Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 434, which the \nclerk will report by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 434, an act \n     to authorize a new trade and investment policy for sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to proceed \nto H.R. 434. As Senator Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee's \nTrade Subcommittee, indicated last night, I will offer a manager's \namendment--to be titled the Trade and Development Act of 1999--as a \nsubstitute for the House-passed language.\n  That act will include the Senate Finance Committee-reported bills on \nAfrica, an expansion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, an extension of \nthe Generalized System of Preferences, and the reauthorization of our \nTrade Adjustment Assistance programs. I want to explain the intent \nbehind these measures and my reasons for supporting their passage.\n  Let me begin with Africa. No continent suffers more from poverty, \nhunger, and disease. Those problems have been compounded by \ncolonialism, cold war politics, corruption, social division, and \nenvironmental disaster. Our daily news records the desperate images of \nstarving mothers and their children, small boys employed as the dogs of \nwar, and the slaughter of wildlife as poachers attempt to eke out a \nliving on the bare plains of Africa.\n\n[[Page S13038]]\n\n  The result has been the lowest living standards and the lowest life \nexpectancy of any in the world. Those conditions have too often \nreinforced a dangerous cycle of war, political instability, and \neconomic decay.\n  What the daily news has too often overlooked are the efforts of so \nmany of our African neighbors to restore political freedom, guarantee \nhuman rights, and foster economic hope.\n  In the past decade, we have seen an end to apartheid in South Africa \nand the peaceful transition to black majority rule. We have seen Nelson \nMandela go from political prisoner to president.\n  We have witnessed the more recent restoration of economic links \nbetween South Africa and the former ``front-line states,'' between \nUganda and Tanzania, and between the sub-Saharan region and the rest of \nthe world. We have benefited from the example of courage and dedication \nthat many sub-Saharan African states have provided as they have \nconfronted the daunting challenges they face.\n  We have also seen nothing short of a revolution in economic thinking. \nAfrica has too frequently been the beneficiary of bad economic advice \nfrom well-meaning international institutions, technical advisers, and \neven creditors.\n  That advice often encouraged crushing debt, confiscatory taxation, \ngrowth-killing devaluations, inefficient state-owned enterprises, and \neconomic mismanagement. For too long, our African neighbors have been \nencouraged to adopt models of economic development that have, in fact, \nwasted their most valuable resource--their people.\n  That era has now come to an end. The new Africa is tackling its own \nproblems and the new Africa can be the master of its own economic \ndestiny.\n  It is in that context that the African title of the Trade and \nDevelopment Act is relevant. It offers tariff preferences to sub-\nSaharan Africa that will encourage economic foundation on which the \neligible countries can build their own future. Equally important, it \nreflects a belief in the power of markets, incentives to investment, \nand human potential.\n  That approach enjoys broad bipartisan support in both Houses of \nCongress and by the President, who mentioned the bill as one of his top \nforeign policy and trade priorities in this year's State of the Union \nAddress. As the chart behind me attests, the legislation also enjoys \nbroad support in the business community, among U.S. and foreign opinion \nleaders, as well as, most importantly, from the potential African \nbeneficiaries themselves.\n  Numerous U.S. businesses and business groups have expressed their \nsupport for moving this legislation. That group includes companies as \ndiverse as Oracle, Cargill, General Motors, Enron, and The Limited.\n  The list of supporters includes the NAACP, the Southern Christian \nLeadership Conference, and the National Council of Churches. It \nincludes opinion leaders such as Nelson Mandela, Coretta Scott King, \nthe Reverend Leon Sullivan who led much of the fight in this country to \nforce change in South Africa under apartheid, and Robert Johnson, the \nfounder of Black Entertainment Television who appeared before the \nFinance Committee in support of the legislation. And, most importantly, \nthe legislation is endorsed by all 47 of the potential beneficiaries in \nsub-Saharan Africa.\n  The bill deserves our support as well.\n  The Trade and Development Act of 1999 would do much the same of the \nCaribbean and Central America that it would do for sub-Saharan Africa. \nIt expands the existing benefits available under the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative to include the duty-free and quota-free treatment of the \nvalue added in the Caribbean to apparel made from U.S. yarn and U.S. \nfabric.\n  It is no understatement to say that the countries of the Caribbean \nand Central America have faced problems similar to those faced in \nAfrica, and often-times on a similar scale. It was only a decade or so \nago that Nicaragua was an avowedly Marxist state harboring guerrillas \nthat sought to undermine the governments and economies of Central \nAmerica. It was only a decade or so ago that El Salvador was confronted \nwith bloody civil strife and a mass migration of its people northward \nto escape the conditions of poverty and hopelessness that recurring \ncivil war had brought.\n  More recently, the region has been hit by natural disasters, rather \nthan the man-made variety. This past year, Hurricane Mitch devastated \nthe islands of the Caribbean and the countries of Central America. \nAmong the hardest hit were Honduras and Guatemala, where farms and \nfactories were literally washed away overnight. Both countries \nconfronted the need to rebuild their economic infrastructure from the \nground up.\n  Since 1983, the countries of the region have been eligible for \nenhanced tariff preferences under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. The \nCBI was expressly designed to encourage private investment and an \neconomic partnership between the firms in the United States and firms \nin the Caribbean. The CBI accomplished that objective.\n  In 1993, however, with the conclusion of the NAFTA, the margin of \npreference enjoyed by the CBI beneficiaries was undercut by the \npreferential treatment accorded Mexican goods under that agreement. \nThat was particularly significant in the area of textiles and apparel, \nwhere the NAFTA rules of origin gradually encouraged a shift in United \nStates investment and trade from the region to the Mexico.\n  In order to make good on the initial promise of the CBI, the \nCaribbean title of the manager's amendment would encourage the \nmanufacture in the Caribbean of apparel articles made from U.S. fabric \nwoven with U.S. yarns. In effect, the bill would simply restore the \nmargin of preference it previously enjoyed in the region in such \nmanufacturing.\n  At this point, it is worth outlining the reasons why the Finance \nCommittee settled on the particular package of benefits extended to \ntextiles and apparel under both the Africa and CBI titles of the \nmanager's amendment.\n  For many years, we have employed a program that encouraged production \nsharing between the United States and many countries in the developing \nworld. That program--generally known as the ``807'' program--allowed \nfor the export of U.S.-manufactured components off-shore for assembly.\n  Under the 807 program, when the assembly was complete and the goods \nwere returned to the United States, the importer paid duty only on the \namount of value added offshore in the assembly process.\n  Do such programs work? The answer, based on the latest reports of the \nInternational Trade Commission, is an unequivocal yes. They work for \nboth the beneficiary countries and for American firms.\n  Production sharing programs, according to the ITC, are used by \nAmerican companies ``to minimize their overall costs and improve \ncompetitiveness.'' Indeed, in most instances, American firms experience \n``enhanced overall competitiveness'' that ``allows companies to \nmaintain higher U.S. production and employment levels that might \notherwise be possible.'' In short, the programs reflected in both the \nAfrica and CBI titles of the manager's amendment are designed to create \na ``win-win'' outcome for the regions and for American firms.\n  The American textile industry's latest analyses vindicate the \napproach we adopted in the Finance Committee.\n  I think it is fair to say that when we started the process of \nconsidering these programs for Africa and the Caribbean in the 105th \nCongress, the textile industry was lukewarm at best. What they have \nfound in the intervening three years is that the bill proposed by the \nFinance Committee would help create a competitive platform from which \nAmerican firms could compete effectively on a global basis even in the \nface of fierce competition from exporters such as China and India.\n  According to the respected industry consultant, Nathan Associates, \nthe Finance Committee bill would ``increase U.S. textile shipments by \n$8.8 billion and increase U.S. textile and textile-related employment \nby 121,400 by the end of five years.''\n  That result led the president of the American Textile Manufacturers \nInstitute, Doug Ellis of Southern Mills, to conclude that the Senate \nFinance Committee bill would have a ``very strong and direct positive \nimpact . . . on U.S. textile production and jobs.'' He indicated that \nthe legislation will ``significantly enhance'' trade between the United \nStates and the beneficiary countries. For that reason, ATMI,\n\n[[Page S13039]]\n\nurged the Congress to support the Finance Committee's bill.\n  What is more, U.S. wholesalers, retailers, and consumers benefit as \nwell. The direct effect on the duty preferences extended under the \nmanager's amendment will be to lower the cost of apparel products sold \nin the United States as cost savings are passed on to the consumer.\n  The indirect effect is that, by ensuring the continuing \ncompetitiveness of the U.S. industry, the bill would also encourage \ncontinuing competition well into the future. That competition \nultimately means a broader range of higher quality goods available to \nthe consumer at lower prices.\n  I want to pause here to reemphasize my basic point. Under the \nmanager's amendment, everyone in the U.S. textile and apparel market--\nfrom the farmer growing cotton to the yarnspinner to the fabric-maker \nto the apparel manufacturer to the retailer to the consumer--wins under \nthe Finance Committee bill. The same holds true for the beneficiary \ncountries.\n  Now, I would be remiss if I failed to mention two other particularly \nimportant provisions of the manager's amendment. The first is the \nrenewal of the Generalized System of Preferences. The GSP program \nlapsed in June of this year. Much depends on its renewal.\n  The program was designed to create an incentive to investment in the \ndeveloping world. Since its inception in 1975, the GSP program has done \njust that. Now, however, in the absence of the renewal of the program, \nthat needed incentive to productive capital investment will be cut off. \nMany American firms that depend on the GSP program will be hurt along \nwith the beneficiary countries.\n  The second additional item is the reauthorization of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance programs. The TAA programs are designed to help \nU.S. workers and firms adjust to new levels of import competition.\n  I have always maintained that those that benefit from trade should \ncare for those who are hurt by the economic adjustment trade can \nengender. For that reason, I rushed to the floor to object when there \nwas an initiative to do away with these programs in the past. In my \nview, the TAA programs represent a down payment on the commitment we \nmust make to workers as the United States if we want them to join us in \nsupport of the benefits trade brings.\n  In closing, let me urge my colleagues to listen carefully to the \ndebate they will hear in the coming hours on the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 434. I firmly believe that my colleagues will hear no meaningful \nobjection to the Senate Finance Committee's approach to providing \nadditional trade incentives to sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, or \nthe developing world generally through the renewal of GSP. Nor can \nthere be any principled objection to the renewal of the TAA programs.\n  This is a significant step in favor of engagement with our neighbors \nin Africa and the Caribbean to help them surmount their own economic \nproblems. I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to proceed to the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray pertaining to the introduction of S. 1772 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on the objections I have registered to \nthe motion to proceed to the CBI/sub-Sahara bill, I was delighted to \nhear the chairman of our Finance Committee relate the reason for it. \nThe reason, perhaps, is well-founded: good foreign policy.\n  I have sponsored and recommended some kind of Marshall Plan for the \ncountry of Mexico for the simple reason that Mexico is our neighbor; it \nis our friend. We have a responsibility to assist it, and we are \nresponsible for the problems NAFTA has caused, which are quite obvious \nwith respect to immigration and drugs. If we can put in a plan where \nMexican workers can have workers' rights and some money in the economy \nwould not be stripped and sent back to the bankers in New York or to \nthe investment wizards from all the other countries, including the \nUnited States--you can cross from California into Tijuana, Mexico; one \nwould think you were in Seoul, Korea. If we could do that, we could \nhave some prosperous parity with our friends in Mexico.\n  Unfortunately, we went the so-called NAFTA way. We have had \napproximately 5 years to measure the success or failure of NAFTA. \nEverywhere I go I hear: Oh, isn't it wonderful how well it has worked.\n  The truth is, they told us in the original instance this was going to \ncreate jobs in America, just as the distinguished Senator from Delaware \nis telling me this bill is going to create jobs in the United States.\n  It is a win-win situation, he says, from the farmer to the apparel \nmanufacturer. And he goes down the list: What a wonderful win-win \nsituation it is.\n  I do not advise that he come to South Carolina and tell them that, \nwhere they have lost 31,700 textile jobs since NAFTA. They are \nstreaming out. Why? Because you and I, Mr. President, set the American \nstandard of living. That is a bipartisan effort whereby we all agree on \na minimum wage, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, safe working \nplace, safe machinery, plant closing notice, parental leave, clean air, \nclean water--on down the list. We can continue to list Republicans and \nDemocrats joining in setting our highest standard of living.\n  Obviously, it is competing with one of the lower standards of living. \nYou can go down to Mexico for 58 cents an hour. There are none of those \nprotections. You are guaranteed a profit. And everybody is streaming \ndown there.\n  But we are losing jobs not just in South Carolina but all over the \nNation. The overall job loss is in the textile and apparel sector over \nthe last twenty five years is some 1.2 million, and 420,000 of them are \ntextile jobs since NAFTA. They said we were going to get 200,000 new \njobs. We have lost 420,000. They said, oh, it was going to solve the \nimmigration problem. I know better--by handling the immigration \nappropriations--there is the Border Patrol, and how we are breaking out \nabandoned Navy yards and using schools, and having thousands of \nadditional agents, and everything else of that kind, and illegal \nimmigrants keep coming. The immigration problem is worse today than it \nwas 4 or 5 years ago.\n  Drugs? Heavens above. There is a drug culture. You have to break it. \nYou don't break it with NAFTA. It is worse today than it was 4 to 5 \nyears ago. Even the Mexican worker is taking home less pay than he was \ntaking home 5 years ago.\n  So there is no education in the second kick of a mule. When they come \naround and say, let's spread this NAFTA approach elixir and spread that \ndown to the rest of the countries over to the sub-Sahara, or any \nelsewhere else in the world, we say, now, wait up.\n  Of course, if you listen to my distinguished colleague, he talks \nabout the 48 sub-Sahara African countries. Certainly they are for it. \nThey are for foreign aid. The retailers and wholesalers, and so forth, \nthey get lower costs. Yes; there isn't any question about that. You can \nproduce it for 58 cents an hour--no clean air, no clean water, child \nlabor, and everything else of that kind in these countries abroad. That \nis a given, known fact. We have college students, who know better, \ndemonstrating against that. Everybody knows it. We want to make it an \nofficial policy?\n  They say: From the farmer to the apparel manufacturer, and on, it is \na win-win situation. Well, of course, unfortunately, it is a losing \nsituation. As I have indicated, we have been through this singsong.\n  It started some 40 years ago or more with Japan. I will never forget, \nat the particular time I was a young Governor in South Carolina, they \nsaid: Now, Governor, what do you expect these emerging countries to \nmake? The airplanes and the computers? Let us make the airplanes and \ncomputers, and let them make the textiles, the clothing, and the shoes.\n  The trouble is, 40 years later, with our noncompetitive blind kind of \nforeign trade policy, they are making the shoes, they are making the \ntextiles, they are making the airplanes, they are making the computers, \nthey are\n\n[[Page S13040]]\n\nmaking everything. When we get into full debate on Monday, we will \npoint out and list down exactly what has been going on and how we have \nbeen hollowing out the industrial strength of America.\n  Last evening, we had a delightful exchange with the ranking member of \nour Finance Committee, the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan. \nHe was relating back to when he was on the Kennedy team negotiating the \ntrade policy, which was an outstanding policy at the time. It was \noutstanding in that it was realistic.\n\n  President Kennedy knew the situation. I went and showed how we \nbrought the witnesses, and everything else, and found that textiles was \nsecond only to steel as the most important to our national security. \nAnd with that authority under the law, President Kennedy enunciated his \nseven-point textile program, from which came the Kennedy Round, the \nMulti fiber Arrangement, One Price Cotton; and it gave a chance--yes, \nto sort of an archaic industry--to really refurbish, retool, modernize, \nand compete.\n  Until the recent years, like NAFTA, they had been putting in $2 \nbillion a year, at least $2 billion a year, in the State of Delaware, \nthe State of South Carolina, and the several other States to modernize \nand compete.\n  I went to a plant there in Clinton, for example--I went to numerous \nones last year--but this was an old plant, over 100 years old, that \nlooked to me as if it was going to fall down. But I was pleasantly \nsurprised when I walked in. They had the most modern machinery and the \nhighest productivity you could possibly imagine.\n  There isn't any question that the industry has been brought into the \nworld of reality of so-called global competition. The only trouble is \nthat our competitors are fancy-free and footloose with their \nprotections, with their nontariff trade barriers, and other measures to \nprotect their economic strength, and we are blindly pell-mell down the \nroad with this so-called free trade, free trade, when, of course, it is \nobviously not free.\n  That goes back now to the standard of living we talked about. And \nmore than the standard of living--if this passes because it will change \nwhat we said with the Multi fiber Arrangement just 5 years ago after \nGATT/WTO: That we were going to have a phaseout of any kind of quotas.\n  I know the distinguished Chair knows about subsidies. We have done \nall the research, just about, for the aircraft industry. We give them \nExport-Import Bank financing. We do not do that for textiles. We do not \ndo that for textiles.\n  But I see all of these people come out for the farmer. Yes, I had to \ntalk to a farmer friend yesterday. I support the farmers. I support \nthat aircraft industry. The farmers, they get subsidized water, \nsubsidized telephones, subsidized electricity. They get export \nsubsidies. If it rains, they get protection; if it dries up, they get \nprotection.\n  And Oracle. The Senator from Delaware says: Oracle is with us. That \nis that crowd with whom we started the Internet. You would think, by \ngosh, they invented it. The politicians, the Pentagon, we did all of \nthat back in 1967, 1968, 1969. We put in, at the University of Illinois \nand Stanford, the training programs for which ultimately benefited Mr. \nYang of Yahoo and other Internet start-ups. And so fine, our friend \nGates, he has 22,000 employees, and there are approximately 22,000 \nmillionaires. There was nothing wrong with that. But don't talk about \nthe engine of this prosperity and economy as this crowd. No, sir.\n\n  We go back to Henry Ford when he said, in order to sell his car: I \nwant to make sure the person producing it is making enough to buy it. \nHe started generating, more than anyone, just with Ford automobiles, \nthe middle class in America. General Motors, compared to those 22,000, \nhas 250,000. We had that machine tool industry, and we had all the rest \nof these good manufacturing establishments, but we have gone to \nsoftware, which doesn't help us in our exports nearly as much as the \nheavy manufacturers. And it is not the engine. It is the hard \nindustries that are the engine of our economy.\n  When you give me Oracle and Exxon and the rest of them on this \nparticular bill, and foreign policy, obviously they are trying to \nexplore oil in the sub-Sahara. They are trying to sell their goods \nanywhere else in the world and, of course, in Central America. But \nright to the point, this is the sort of last chance we have for a \nformative industry, second-most in importance to our national security. \nIt is the last chance in the sense that after 5 years of the 10-year \nphaseout, the textile manufacturers all invested in that 10-year \npolicy. So if we cut it off in October of 1999, cut it off at least 5 \nyears short, they begin to lose the investment. They don't get the \nreturn. They don't increase their productivity.\n  I never heard such an outrageous statement, that this is going to \nincrease their productivity. They immediately freeze in their tracks \nand say, no, we can't get our money back out of trying to, even again, \nbuy a better spindle and get even a higher production. They begin to \nlose their money as well as the workers lose their jobs. It is a lose-\nlose situation because, bottom line, look what happens.\n  Like I say, all these other countries invest down there in the \nvarious Central American countries. Honduras, seven Taiwan firms, \nincluding the leading Chung hsing Textile have invested $24 million. \nAgain, the Republic of China will provide $15 million in low-interest \nloans for Honduras to build an export processing zone, an EPZ. Then the \nTaiwan manufacturers in the upper and lower streams of the textile \nindustry are planning to form integrated textile production in San \nPedro Sula down in Honduras and Central America. The South Koreans, Kim \nand Arzu, have agreed on the need to diversify South Korean investment \nin Guatemala and their particular textile investments down there.\n  Looking at the Caribbean as a potential staging ground and production \nbase, the Malaysian textile industry uses Caribbean plants as the \ngateway to the United States. Then again some 18 Taiwanese companies \nare down there. South Korea, 180 small South Korean companies, mostly \ntextile and garment makers, have invested $130 million in five Central \nAmerican nations. You can go right on down the list.\n  I am going to get in the Record on Monday the 100,000-acre tract the \nPeople's Republic of China, Beijing, developed--that industrial tract--\ndown in Mexico. So it isn't somehow that we are opening it up for \nAmerican fabric. Yes, temporarily that ATMI crowd, they thought they \ncould just hold on to American fabric, but Burlington has found \ndifferently. They have moved down and other fabric manufacturers are \nmoving. Why? Because it is cheaper in Mexico.\n  When it comes right down to it, it might be a good aim but it is a \nbad recoil. We learned that with the artillery in World War II. No \nmatter how well the gun was aimed, if the recoil is going to kill the \nguncrew, don't fire. That is why we object to proceeding to this \nparticular bill--because the recoil here is going to kill this \nimportant industry.\n\n  I will be glad to get into it in depth when we have all the Members \nback here the first part of the week. Of course, the President, yes, he \nis building a library now, and he is looking to see what he did down in \nCentral America and what he did in Africa and traveling around building \na library. But he is absolutely draining, so to speak, the industrial \nstrength in the United States of America. It is a sad thing to see that \nmore people are not exercised about it. This has been going on for \nyears on end. President Kennedy was worried, and that is why he put in \nhis seven-point program when only 10 percent of the textile apparel \nconsumed in the United States were represented in imports.\n  Now I am looking at at least two-thirds--nearly 70 percent of the \nclothing I am looking at in this Chamber is manufactured outside the \nUnited States; and, of course, the shoes, 86 percent of the shoes on \nthe floor. But it has gone on to cameras and hand tools and everything \nelse.\n  Just earlier this year we found out about steel. The World Bank runs \naround and says, wait a minute, in order to become a nation state, you \nhave to have the steel for the tools of agriculture and the weapons of \nwar. So the World Bank gives these 2-percent loans, all over the entire \nworld, down through Africa, into the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and \nIran, now to the People's Republic of China. So they get an\n\n[[Page S13041]]\n\noverproductivity of steel, and they come dumping it here. And we are \ntelling them, let us get more competitive. You have to look at these \nbroad policies. You have to look at this broad foreign policy that the \nSenator from Delaware now enunciates and how wonderful it is that we \nare going to make friends in the sub-Sahara and down in Central \nAmerica.\n  I think the Koreans, the Malaysians, the Taiwanese, the Japanese, and \neveryone else will be making the friends. They are quicker, faster; \ntheir countries subsidize, finance. They have followed the MITI form, \nnot the American capitalistic form, but the controlled capitalism of \nthe Ministry of Industry and Trade in the country of Japan.\n  That said, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first, let me make the observation that \ntextile jobs are being lost to China and India, not to Mexico. NAFTA \nhas helped increase U.S. textile shipments. But I think it is \nparticularly important to understand that it is not I who is saying \nthat the legislation before us will help the textile industry; rather, \nit is the textile industry itself. It is the President of the American \nTextile Manufacturing Institute that is telling us that the Finance \nCommittee will raise textile shipments by $8.8 billion over the next 5 \nyears. That is what is significant, Mr. President--that it is the \ntextile industry itself that is asserting that the legislation before \nus will help the textile industry to the tune of $8.8 billion and, most \nimportant of all, it will increase employment by 121,000 jobs.\n  That is the reason I made the comment that it is win-win because we \nare not only helping the countries such as the sub-Saharan Africa CBI, \nbut we are helping the workers here at home. We are not talking about \nwhat happened in the past; we are talking about what will happen in the \nfuture. And what we are seeking to do is to enact legislation that will \nboth create jobs and help the industry. I should also point out, most \nimportantly, it will be of benefit to the retailers, the wholesalers, \nas well as the people who acquire the goods. So I reiterate what I said \nearlier, that this is good legislation. It accomplishes what I think we \nall want--a stronger economy in the textile area.\n  Now, on the immigration issue, my distinguished colleague says NAFTA \nhasn't helped. What that statement overlooked is the strong flow of \nillegal immigration. But, again, as I said earlier, it is not from \nMexico; rather, it is from Central America and the Caribbean, which is \nprecisely the reason that the Finance Committee bill will help. In \nother words, by strengthening their economy, there will be jobs there, \nand as a result of that, there won't be the need for the illicit \nimmigration that has occurred in the past.\n  As to who would benefit, my distinguished colleague cannot possibly \nclaim that Korean and Taiwanese firms will benefit. As I explained \nbefore, the only fabric that will benefit is American fabric. It is \nU.S. textiles that will benefit and U.S. export of textiles. So my \ncolleague argues that we are losing in manufacturing. In fact, it is \nincreasing, and that is the purpose of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important that the record reflect what \nhas happened to productivity in the textile industry.\n  In a CRS report for Congress dated August 24, 1999, the point is made \non page CRS-3 that:\n\n       Labor productivity growth in the textiles industry has \n     actually outstripped [I think that is important] that of the \n     economy as a whole, increasing at 2.8% per year from 1970 to \n     1996, compared with 1.2% per year for the aggregate economy.\n\n  In other words, the economy as a whole, its productivity, has been \ngrowing at the rate of 1.2 percent per year, whereas the textile \nindustry, in contrast, has been growing as rapidly as 2.8 percent.\n  Textile productivity growth was fast even compared to the rest of the \nmanufacturing sector.\n  The figures are given that it grew at 2.8 percent versus 2.3 for the \nrest of the manufacturing sector and has maintained the high growth of \nlabor productivity even in the 1990s. Again, it is 4 percent versus 3.5 \npercent.\n\n       Much of the increase in the textile industry productivity \n     was due to capital deepening that occurred beginning in the \n     1970s. Over this decade, capital expenditures by textile \n     producers outstripped their profit with almost $3 billion \n     invested annually in new plant and equipment.\n\n  The same publication points out that exports have grown 12.1 percent \nin the textile sector from 1989 to 1996 but has shrunk very slightly, \n1.2 percent, since 1997 due primarily to lingering effects of foreign \ncurrency devaluations that have been induced by the Asian crisis.\n  I urge anyone who has an opening statement or comment on the \nlegislation to come down to the floor as soon as possible while there \nis an opportunity to speak on this matter.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want the record to be clear that this \nGovernment has been of help to the apparel and textile industry, as \nwell as others, including agriculture and aerospace. The claim was made \nthat the A sector has not benefited, but that is not correct. Let me \ngive one example.\n  The question of the R tax credit--a most important credit in that \nit encourages research by various industries and I think helps keeps us \non the cutting edge of technology--I point out this is a matter, as a \nmatter of fact, being discussed and debated in the Finance Committee \nand the Ways and Means Committee on the other side as part of \nextenders.\n  The point I want to make is the R tax credit is of great benefit to \nthe textile and apparel industry. As a matter of fact, the CRS report \nfor Congress of August 24, 1999, states that the R tax credit may be \neven more important to the A sector. This is probably because more \ntechnology-intensive industries consider R spending a fixed cost of \ntheir sector activity that must be undertaken to maintain \ncompetitiveness regardless of public policy. While in the A sector, \nthe amount of R engaged in is variable depending on the expense. It \nconcludes, for these reasons, this credit is probably of more benefit \nto this industry than many others.\n  I conclude by saying that as Congress has recently displayed a \npreference in favor of tax credits over direct funding for R, the \nfuture of the R tax credit may be determined, to a large degree, by \nthe rate of continued technical progress in the A sector.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I start out by saying this debate over S. 1387 and S. \n1389 is probably a debate we should not be having now. I think the \nSenate has far more important issues to deal with--having to do with \nthe minimum wage and the standards for working people, having to do \nwith giving consumers more protection through HMO or managed care \nreform, having to do with campaign finance reform and the ways in which \nmoney has subverted our representative democracy. And, believe me, if, \nin fact, cloture is invoked and we go forward with this bill, I will \nargue the farm crisis. I will have an amendment to this bill that will \ncall for a moratorium on these acquisitions and mergers taking place \nthat are driving our producers off the land.\n  These are the issues people care about in our country. My question \nis, When are we really going to be debating these issues on the floor? \nI think that is what we should be doing.\n  Having said that, however, I think the debate over CBI and African \ntrade bills could be useful and enlightening because I think we have a \nchoice between two very different models.\n  Senator Feingold has introduced a very impressive and innovative \nbill. It is based on legislation introduced in the House by Jesse \nJackson, Jr., which really blazes a trail for U.S. trade policy. It is \ntruly groundbreaking. And for\n\n[[Page S13042]]\n\nthose people who want our trade policy to work for working families, \nthis is the direction in which we should go.\n  I do not think we are going to have a debate between people who are \nsaying we ought to build a wall on our borders and we should not be \ninvolved in trade. For me, that is not the issue. The issue is not \nwhether we expand trade; the issue is on whose terms we expand trade. \nWhat are the rules and who benefits from the rules?\n  The choice could not be clearer. The Feingold-Jackson legislation, \ncalled the HOPE for Africa Act, says that an expansion of trade should \nbenefit working families and poor families in America and in \nAfrica. Trade agreements should be about making the global economy work \nfor working people in all countries. The HOPE for Africa bill says if \nwe are really serious about raising labor and environmental standards \nacross the globe, then we have to have enforceable protections built \ninto our trade agreements. The HOPE for Africa bill says that we can't \nbe serious about wanting to help African countries develop economically \nif we don't do anything about the crushing debt burden. The HOPE for \nAfrica bill says the lives of Africans suffering from AIDs are far more \nimportant than the monopoly profits of foreign pharmaceutical \ncompanies. The HOPE for Africa bill has its priorities straight. It \nexpands trade the right way by putting people first.\n\n  Our other option is the same old more of the same, more NAFTAs, NAFTA \nfor the Caribbean, NAFTA for all of South America, NAFTA for Africa, \nmore IMF-style economic policies that have impoverished one country \nafter another all over the world, more investment protections for \nmultinationals to export jobs overseas so they can avoid complying with \nAmerican-style labor and environmental standards.\n  I think we should have learned our lesson from NAFTA. We have gained \njobs; we have lost jobs, but that is almost beside the point. The kind \nof labor, environmental side agreements we put into effect were an \nafterthought. They were not part of the trade agreement. They weren't \nenforceable. Basically, if we are going to do these trade agreements, \nwe ought to be talking about uplifting the living standards of working \npeople, of low-income people, in our country and other countries.\n  What we have right now, without clearly enforceable standards dealing \nwith the basic right to organize and bargain collectively, to earn a \ndecent living in other countries, much less in our own country, is a \ntrade agreement that says to working people: Look, these multinationals \ncan go to other countries. They don't have to comply with fair labor \nstandards, including the right of people to be able to organize and \nbargain collectively. They can pay low wages, miserably low wages, with \nexploitive working conditions, and then export those products back to \nour country, undercutting working people who are trying to produce and \nbasically eliminating our jobs. It is lose-lose. That is why the \nFeingold-Jackson bill is such a clear alternative.\n  If we pass these bills without any kind of meaningful and enforceable \nprotection for the interests of working families, we will have made a \nbig mistake. That is part of what is going to be happening in Seattle. \nYou will see at this WTO meeting all sorts of NGOs, nongovernment \norganizations, all sorts of environmental organizations. Being a \nSenator from Minnesota, a lot of farm organizations and farmers are \ngoing to be there. A lot of labor people are going to be there; a lot \nof working people are going to be there. They are going to basically \nsay that is exactly what is at issue here--when we look at S. 1387 and \n1389, the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the U.S. Caribbean \nBasin Trade Enhancement Act. We are for trade; we are for being in an \ninternational economy, but we are not for the kind of trade agreements \nthat drive our wages down and basically eliminate our jobs and don't \nprovide protection for people in other countries.\n  If we are going to have trade agreements, we are for them, but not \nunless you have clearly enforceable standards dealing with \nenvironmental protection and dealing with the right of people to \norganize and bargain collectively. If you don't do that, then we know \nall too well what these kinds of agreements mean for working families \nin Minnesota and our country, much less for the people of the Caribbean \nand African countries.\n\n  When people come out to this WTO meeting, they are going to say what \nWTO should be all about is the rules of trade, not trade without rules. \nWe want to talk about the rules of trade. We don't want to support an \nagreement which is trade without rules. We want enforceable protection \nwhen it comes to the basic right of people to organize in these other \ncountries and we want some enforceable environmental standards as well.\n  As we move forward in this debate, we do have a piece of legislation \nthat does look to other nations, that is all about trade, that is all \nabout our role in the international economy. The difference is that the \nFeingold-Jackson legislation is a trade bill that will lead to \nuplifting the standards of working families.\n  I want to signify to my friend and colleague from Delaware, whose \nwork I respect, that we will have debate about whether or not this bill \nshould be on the floor. If it is on the floor, one piece of good news \nfor me, though I am in disagreement with the legislation, is it will \ngive me the opportunity to bring an amendment to the floor that deals \nwith the farm crisis, that says we should have a moratorium on these \nacquisitions and mergers by these big packers and big grain companies \nthat are basically driving producers out. I hope there will be another \namendment to take the cap off the loan rate to deal with the price \ncrisis.\n  I am determined that if we go forward with this legislation, I will \nbe out of the box with those amendments as soon as possible next week. \nI have been waiting for 4 weeks now to come to the Senate floor with \nlegislation that will alleviate the pain --or some of it--of family \nfarmers in our States. I thank both of my colleagues for their \npatience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Grams, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the trade \npackage before us today which would expand trade opportunities with \nsub-Saharan Africa, offer enhanced tariff treatment to Caribbean Basin \nInitiative (CBI) nations, extend the Generalized System of Preferences \n(GSP) program for 5 years and extend the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprogram.\n  The CBI language will expand benefits to CBI nations, yet continue to \nprotect import-sensitive industries in the United States. It will for \nthe first time link benefits to improvements in areas such as \nintellectual property rights, investment, market access, government \nprocurement and other issues which will not only help CBI nations \ndevelop but create an improved market for U.S. companies in the future. \nU.S. exports have tripled to the region since the Caribbean Basin \nEconomic Recovery Act was passed in 1984. They have soared the first 6 \nmonths of this year, and this legislation will further that progress.\n  The CBI benefits will serve as the next step in helping this region \nbecome part of the Free Trade Area of the Americas.\n  The Generalized System of Preferences program aiding the least \ndeveloped countries expired in July of this year. Most of us have many \nsmall importers in our States who have depended on this lower tariff \ntreatment to compete with larger retailers. I know there are many in \nMinnesota who are now paying enormous tariffs--at the risk of staying \nin business--and need the program extended for 5 years. Extending the \nprogram year by year, often retroactively, and usually with no \ncertainty is no way to treat these small businesses or these countries. \nThe GSP program has been improved over the years, and graduations of \ncountries and products have ensured it helps only those who need \nassistance will get the help.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act is the most controversial, but \ncrucial, part of this package. I have continually supported this effort \nand am disappointed it has taken so long to consider the measure on the \nfloor. What really is very modest assistance to one of the poorest \nregions of the world, sub-Saharan Africa, has been\n\n[[Page S13043]]\n\nbattered from all sides--and it is the needy people of those countries \nwho will suffer the most if we do not pass this legislation.\n  Much of the opposition is from the textile and apparel industry, and \nI am sensitive to the concern that has come from textile companies in \nmy own State of Minnesota. I believe the Senate bill has addressed this \nindustry's concerns in a very responsible manner. The bill requires the \nuse of U.S. textiles and includes tough transshipment language--far \ntougher than that of current law. The Customs Service has reassured us \nthat Africa is not a transshipment problem. Africa supplies 1 percent \nof our textile imports and has little ability to flood our market with \nadditional imports. I believe most new apparel investments in Africa \nwill just replace many in Asia rather than expanding overall textile/\napparel imports.\n  Some in the Congress believe this legislation should focus more on \ndebt relief. However, we are involved in multilateral efforts to \nprovide this relief and have made commitments unilaterally as well. I \nsupport these separate efforts. This is not the vehicle to expand our \ndebt relief efforts. The focus of this legislation is to foster \neconomic growth through incentives, to create a high-level dialogue \nbetween U.S. and African leaders on economic issues, to start the \nprocess toward a U.S.-sub-Saharan free trade area--to help Africa \ndevelop and prosper through improved business relationships with our \ncompanies. We want these relationships to help Africa grow, to expand \njob opportunities, to become more market oriented as they reform \neconomically and to become less dependent on foreign aid from other \nnations.\n  Some will say this bill is not worthy of support because it does not \nprovide enough benefit for the United States. Fortunately we don't \nalways pass legislation solely on what it can do for us immediately. We \nneed to look ahead, which we don't do enough of here, but this \nlegislation is a good example of how we should act. The more than 700 \nmillion people of sub-Saharan Africa represent an enormous market of \nthe future for us. Right now my State of Minnesota is the 15th largest \nexporter to the region. We must continue to improve our export \nopportunities, but we can't do that if we don't allow sub-Saharan \nAfrica the ability to export to us. If we are not there now helping \nthem help themselves, developing the relationships needed to build \nfriendship and trust, sub-Saharan Africans will not want to buy our \nproducts in the future. And we know how many other countries are there \nto step in if we are not there. Again, we can't expect to develop an \nexport market there if we are not with them during the hard times when \nsub-Saharan Africans need us to give them a small edge to compete for \nexports into the United States. If Africa can't become strong and \nprosperous, it will not be able to buy our products in the future.\n\n  A strong and secure Africa will not only benefit trade, but will help \nus achieve our goals in areas such as drug trafficking, terrorism, \nhuman rights, and many others.\n  I also want to mention a statement I just read whereby AIDS activists \noppose this legislation because they believe sub-Saharan African \ncountries will spend more on business investment than on social \nservices spending such as health care. I strongly disagree with this \nthinking. The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act will help countries \ngrow and prosper. It will enable these governments, and their people to \nspend more on their health care needs, including the need to fight the \ndevastation of AIDS.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a good one. It complements what we are \ndoing in so many other ways to help sub-Saharan Africa. The entire \npackage is one we should enthusiastically support. I urge my colleagues \nto vote for this trade package without damaging amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as \nin morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, along with Senators Lott, Thurmond, \nHelms, Kyl, Inhofe, Allard, and Tim Hutchinson, I have introduced a \nconcurrent resolution, with the House, regarding the transition of \ncontrol of the Panama Canal from the United States to the Republic of \nPanama. I thank my colleague, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Helms, for agreeing to discharge the resolution \nquickly to give Congress a chance to consider it in a timely manner.\n  I hope we can bring this resolution before the Senate, debate it, and \nvote up or down on the merits. Indeed, the Senate must be heard on this \nissue, which is important to our national security.\n  In accordance with the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, the withdrawal of \nthe United States Armed Forces from Panama is almost complete, and with \nit will be the relinquishment of our control of the canal, which will \ntake place December 31 of this year.\n  The canal is of vital interest, however, to the United States, and it \nis an invaluable world asset. Unfortunately, Panama's ability to \nmaintain and provide adequate security for the canal is lacking. \nExacerbating this tenuous situation is the growing influence of the \nPeople's Republic of China in the region.\n  Almost as soon as we started our pullout, a company called Hutchison-\nWhampoa, closely associated with the People's Republic of China, began \nto establish its presence and to fill the void left by the United \nStates in Panama. Hutchison-Whampoa, Limited, holds leases for two port \nfacilities at either end of the canal. Documented evidence shows that \nHutchison-Whampoa, Limited, is closely tied to the Chinese Government.\n  The fears voiced by the American people when the United States \nnegotiated this treaty in 1977 have been validated. The American people \nwere right to be skeptical of Panama's ability to adequately maintain \nthe operability of the canal and guarantee its independence and \nsecurity. These fears were supposedly addressed in the Panama Canal \nTreaty's companion, the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and \nOperation of the Panama Canal, which promises that the canal will \nremain open during times of peace and war. It also guarantees \n``expeditious transit'' to the United States through the canal in times \nof conflict, generally interpreted to mean that, in an emergency, U.S. \nwarships would be sent to the head of the line. Still not satisfied \nwith these provisions, the Senate, under Senator DeConcini's \nreservation, insisted on the right of the United States to intervene \nmilitarily, if necessary, if it appeared the canal was about to be \nclosed or threatened. Apparently, Panamanian President Torrijos did not \nagree and offered his own counter-counterreservation, nullifying \nDeConcini. Inexplicably, this counterreser- vation, which Panama \nratified, was never transmitted to the Senate for consideration.\n\n  Consequently, in 1996, the Panama Government awarded control of two \nkey port facilities through a questionable bid process to Hutchison-\nWhampoa. Under the so-called Law No. 5, passed by the Panamanian \nNational Assembly, it appears Hutchison-Whampoa has the authority to \nblock or delay passage of ships through the canal to meet its business \nneeds. This Chinese company could simply declare that passage of U.S. \nwarships could be harmful to their business and we would have a serious \nproblem in moving ships through the Panama Canal.\n  I have heard from many of my constituents on this issue. Some believe \nChina will attempt to base bombers and missiles there. The Department \nof Defense has asserted this scenario is unlikely. However, recent \nantagonistic statements by China, such as thinly veiled threats \nconcerning Taiwan and declarations possessing the neutron bomb, are \nreasons for people to be concerned.\n  There are two legitimate security concerns related to regional \nspying, narcotrafficking, illegal immigration, and the creation of \nbureaucratic obstacles which over the long term could impede the flow \nof traffic through the canal. Such actions could have a significant \nimpact on American trade.\n  The Panama Canal sees the transit of nearly one-third of the world's \nshipping\n\n[[Page S13044]]\n\neach year, including 15 percent of all imports and exports of the \nUnited States, 40 percent of U.S. grain exports, and in the vicinity of \n700,000 barrels of oil every day. Though prohibited by treaty, \nHutchison-Whampoa, perhaps at Chinese's behest or with their influence, \ncould impede commercial military traffic.\n  We hope this will not occur. There is no immediate indications that \nit will occur. But stopping the flow of these exports is a possible \nconsequence of the leases that have been executed, and they could have \nsignificant devastating impacts on free trade, particularly for the \nUnited States.\n  The resolution I introduced was intended to address the issue of the \nPanama Canal security to raise the concerns of the Congress to the \nPresident, before some action is taken that could in the long term \ndamage or threaten our security.\n  Panama has recently elected a new government. By reputation, \nPresident Moscoso is a woman of the highest personal character and \npossesses an astute political intellect. I am confident of her ability \nto lead Panama into the 21st century and to positively contribute to \nthe security and economic growth of the Western Hemisphere. I believe \nthere is probably no better time than while this new administration is \nin its infancy to engage Panama in discussions to address the concerns \nI have described.\n  As this resolution calls for, the United States should request that \nthe Moscoso government investigate the charges of corruption or \nimproprieties related to the granting of the Panama Canal contract to \noperate the ports by the previous administration.\n  Prior to the awarding of these leases, several consortiums--some of \nwhich included U.S. bids--had submitted bids to operate the ports that \nwere better than offers made by Hutchison-Whampoa. Without warning, \nPanama twice closed and reopened the bidding process, changing the \nrules and accepting higher bids after the bidding was supposed to have \nbeen closed. At one point, it is said that Panama asked a U.S. company \nto rescind its bid, citing a potential monopoly of firms in Panama. The \nsudden rules changes and unusual requests, at the very least, raised \nsuspicions. Our Ambassador to Panama vigorously protested this bidding \nprocedure and fought hard against it. The matter is even more troubling \nbecause the contracts have, by the passage of laws in Panama, extended \nthem to the length of 25 to 50 years. It is called Law No. 5 in Panama.\n\n  Therefore, this resolution also requests that if President Moscoso, \nalong with her government, finds illegal or improper dealing in this \nbidding process, they take steps to ensure a new process be undertaken; \nthat it be transparent and fair to all parties.\n  The final provision of this resolution addresses the security issues. \nThe canal, its mechanism of locks and dams, is fragile at best. By \ntheir own admission, Panama doesn't have the necessary resources to \nprotect it. It disbanded its military after the U.S. invasion in 1989 \nto oust the Noriega regime. Now, as the United States has withdrawn its \nmilitary forces--there are only a few hundred troops remaining today--\ndrug trafficking through Panama has begun to increase. Panama's \nnational police force is ill equipped by all admissions and is not \nprepared to counter this threat.\n  The Colombian civil war is spilling over Panama's eastern border and \nthe threat of terrorism is growing daily. Russia and other organized \ncrime groups are developing bases in the isthmus. Further, China's \nnewfound foothold in the Americas has affected the flood of illegal \nimmigrants who are coming in, using Panama as the staging area for \ntheir journey to the United States.\n  As a U.S. attorney, around 1990 I prosecuted a major international \nalien smuggling case involving a planeload of Chinese citizens who were \nbrought to Panama and then secreted into the United States. They were \nable to be stopped, arrested, and people were prosecuted for it. Even \nat that time, China was using Panama as a conduit to bring illegal \naliens into the United States. There is evidence that there is a \nChinese role in this smuggling.\n  Our resolution calls for the negotiation of security arrangements to \nprotect the canal and Panama on a mutual basis, respecting the \nsovereignty of each nation to protect Panama and the canal from any \noutside forces that might undermine it and undermine the free trade on \nwhich we have come to depend that goes through the canal.\n  The United States must not abrogate its leadership responsibilities \nwhen we relinquish control of the canal. We must emphasize to Panama \nour legitimate interest that sound, security standards be maintained, \nand we must work with Panama to fight corruption, illegal drug \nactivity, gun running, and illegal immigration rings. The United States \nmust also send a clear message to China, or any other entity with \ndesigns on the canal, that we will guarantee the security and \nneutrality of the canal through all necessary force.\n  China's influence in Latin America has been expanded. We certainly \ndon't want to see a resurgence of Communist activity in the Western \nHemisphere at this time in history.\n  I see the majority leader is here. I thank him for his leadership and \ninterest in so many areas, particularly in this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New York, I will \nbe brief. I have a cloture motion to file.\n  But I do also want to comment just briefly on the remarks of the \nSenator from Alabama. I thank him for his remarks. He is raising very \nimportant concerns--ones that I have discussed with the Chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, and I have written to the Secretary of \nDefense expressing my concerns. As a result of the correspondence with \nthe Secretary of Defense, and our worry about the Chinese involvement \nin the Panama Canal through a particular company having control of port \nfacilities on both ends of the Panama Canal, our concern is about what \nis their relationship with the Chinese Government as well as other \nconcerns as we move toward turning over the Panama Canal on December \n31.\n  Narcoterrorism is of concern in the area, as well as corruption in \nthe government. We do, at this very moment, have a hearing underway in \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. We have had Members of Congress \ntestify about their concerns. We have a panel now that includes General \nWilhelm, who has jurisdiction for our military over that region; \nAmbassador Gutierrez from the State Department, answering questions; as \nwell as the Honorable Aleman Zubieta who is Deputy Administrator, I \nbelieve, of the Commission. That testimony is underway right now. \nSecretary Weinberger is there. I know they are looking forward to \nSenator Sessions returning to ask questions.\n  There may be no problem here, although there is clearly a problem \nwith narcoterrorism and corruption in the government. But I think we \nhave an absolute responsibility to ask questions and get into the law \nabout how this is going to work.\n  There is a provision in Law No. 5, as it is described in Panama, that \nraises some questions about how U.S. military vessels would have access \nto the Panama Canal after December 31. To the extent they say they \nwould have right of passage provided it didn't interfere with the \noperations of the Panama Canal, we need to make sure we know what is \nhappening there. We are going to carry out our responsibilities in that \neffort. I thank Senator Sessions for his work in that also.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13044-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13044-S13045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee and ranking \nmember for being here and being willing to proceed on this important \nlegislation. I do think we have an opportunity with this CBI and \nAfrican free trade legislation to be able to have better relations and \ntrade with Central America, with the Caribbean, and with Africa. I \nbelieve it will be in the interests of all countries concerned. It is \nthe right attitude.\n  There are a lot of terms being thrown around in recent weeks about \nisolationism. This is clearly a case where, by trading with countries \nin Central America, the Caribbean and Africa, we can open up not only \ntrade but relationships and opportunities for peoples in all the \ncountries involved, including the United States. So I am glad we have \nproceeded to this legislation.\n\n[[Page S13045]]\n\n  The Senate has been debating the motion to proceed because there had \nbeen objection to going to the bill itself. That is as a result of the \nobjection to its immediate consideration by Senator Hollings. I wanted \nto see if maybe we could go ahead, get started, have some debate and \namendments and then not have to debate the motion to proceed and then \ndebate the bill itself, but it looks as if we are not able to at this \ntime proceed in that way. Since there has been objection and this is an \nimportant trade bill, one with major implications, one I discussed with \nthe President three times this week alone, about his interest and \nconcern and support of this legislation, I think it is important we \nfile cloture and try to find a way to stop a threatened filibuster and \nmove to the substance of the bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, rare is it to have an opportunity to talk \nabout health care policy when the chairman of the Health Care \nSubcommittee is on the floor with Mr. Moynihan, a long time expert, and \nDr. Frist is in the chair. So you have three of the most influential \npeople in the health care policy field before you.\n  I will not abuse this opportunity. But I wanted to take just a few \nminutes to talk about this prescription drug issue and its importance, \nin terms of coverage under Medicare. There is now one bipartisan bill \nbefore the Senate on this issue, and that is the legislation that \nSenator Olympia Snowe and I have proposed.\n  What I have said--this is the fifth time I have come to the floor in \nrecent weeks--is I am actually going to, as this poster says, ``Urge \nSenior Citizens To Send In Copies Of Their Prescription Drug Bills,'' \nso we can show just how critical this issue is and come together on a \nbipartisan basis before the end of this session and get prescription \ndrug coverage added to Medicare.\n  What Senator Snowe and I have proposed, on a bipartisan basis, uses \nmarketplace forces to hold down the cost of these prescriptions. We \nhave an ``ability to pay'' feature in the program. That is something I \nhave heard Senator Moynihan and Dr. Frist talk about. My sense is, it \nis critically important that we get this coverage, not just because \nsenior citizens suffer so, but because this is the next breakthrough in \npreventive health care. The drugs we are seeing today help to lower \nblood pressure; they help to lower the cholesterol level.\n  I have heard Senator Moynihan and Chairman Roth talk, for example, \nabout how costs are exploding in Medicare, particularly under Part A, \nthe hospital portion of Medicare. It seems to me if we can come \ntogether on a bipartisan basis and address this prescription drug \nissue, a lot of these new drugs, these preventive drugs, will help us \nsave money and hold down some of the costs in Part A of Medicare, the \nhospital and institutional portion of the program.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal pointed out yesterday, again, how staggering \nsome of these costs are and how we might prevent them with thoughtful \npolicy work in the health care area. For example, yesterday in the Wall \nStreet Journal they noted that one-third of all stroke survivors are \npermanently disabled. But doctors can now prescribe anticoagulants to \nprotect the high-risk patients from stroke. The Journal goes on to say:\n\n       The lifetime cost of a severe stroke is $100,000, while \n     treatment with anticoagulants costs $1,095. This is a chance \n     to get good coverage for vulnerable people in our country and \n     save taxpayers' money at the same time.\n\n  I am just very hopeful; Senator Roth's staff and Senator Moynihan's \nstaff have spent a lot of time with us already. Senator Snowe and I \nwant to do this in a bipartisan way. We want to act in this session of \nCongress, not put it off until after yet another round of \nelectioneering and more slugging back and forth between Democrats and \nRepublicans. I am hopeful seniors, by sending in copies of their \nprescription drug bills, as Senator Snowe and I advocate, will help us \ncome together in a bipartisan way.\n  In wrapping up, as I have indicated to the Senate before, I am going \nto bring to the floor each time I come three cases of what I am hearing \nfrom seniors at home in Oregon, to dramatize how important it is we act \non this matter.\n  I just heard yesterday from a 75-year-old widow from Salem, OR. She \nwrote me that her income is $8,218 a year; her prescription drug bill \nis $2,289.\n  She spent that on three drugs--Fosamax, Relafen, and Paxil. Three \ndrugs, $2,289 from her $8,118 income. That is an elderly woman in \nSalem.\n  A woman in Portland wrote me:\n\n       My mother is 97 years old and will soon be required to file \n     for Medicaid because the ever-increasing cost of her care and \n     medications have depleted her savings. Currently, her \n     expenses exceed income by over $1,000 per month. In some \n     months, her medication costs over $300. Last year, her \n     prescription drug bill was $2,746.\n\n  As we saw in a recent study, more than 20 percent of the Nation's \nelderly are spending over $1,000 a year out of pocket on their \nprescription medicines. This story was not at all something we found to \nbe rare or out of the ordinary.\n  Finally, the third case I want to mention this morning comes from a \nwoman in Seaside, OR. She has an income of just over $1,000 a month. \nShe wrote me yesterday:\n\n       I am supposed to take 20 milligrams of Lipitor, but I do \n     not have enough money to buy it.\n\n  These are the kinds of cases I know we are going to hear when seniors \nsend in copies of their prescription drug bills. The question is, Can \nwe come together in a bipartisan way to address this issue?\n  Senator Snowe and I used the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan as\n\n[[Page S13046]]\n\nour model. There are other good ideas out there. Our bill is called \nSPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. We are \nnot saying this is the last word on how to address this issue, but I \nwould like to see the Senate look at an approach that utilizes \nmarketplace forces, along the lines of what we do in the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefits Plan and one that will not produce a lot of \ncost shifting on to other groups of vulnerable people.\n  For example, there is one proposal going around, certainly well-\nmeaning, which has Medicare buying up all the drugs for the Nation's \nsenior citizens. I am very fearful what will happen under that approach \nis we may control prices for the elderly, but you could have a divorced \nwoman, a 27-year-old, say, African American women in my State or the \nPresiding Officer's State. She could see her drug bill go through the \nroof because prices would be controlled in just one segment of the \npharmaceutical area, the Medicare area, and the costs would be shifted \non to somebody else's back.\n  I know the Senate has a lot of important business. By the way, I am \nwith Senator Moynihan and Chairman Roth on this great bill as well. I \nknow they want to go on to that important matter. I intend to keep \ncoming to the floor. Senator Snowe had to be in Maine today and could \nnot be here. We have already done this together. We urge seniors to \nsend in copies of their prescription drug bills.\n  We hope they will back the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill. Frankly, I \nwould rather hear from them so as to bring this Senate together in a \nbipartisan way and deal with this issue. Let's not let it become fodder \nfor the 2000 election. Let's make this issue a legacy of this Congress \nwhere we really came together to do something important, something that \nis the wave of the future in American health care, which is to give \ngood preventive approaches, wellness-oriented approaches as part of our \nAmerican health system.\n  I thank Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan and my friend, Senator \nAkaka, for indulging me this morning. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Oregon leaves, I \nexpress my own personal gratitude to him and to Senator Snowe for \nbringing this issue in the congenial, collegial way they do. It must be \naddressed. I feel presumptuous to speak on such matters in the presence \nof the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Tennessee, but since the \nadvent of sulfa and penicillin, the great medical revolution has been \nthe development of the array of prescription drugs that prevent disease \nas against cured, in the case of penicillin. We will one day go this \nway, and we will have Senator Wyden and Senator Snowe to thank and the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, I rise to call attention to a recent \nannouncement by Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights. The Justice Department announced the conviction of three \nindividuals charged with luring women from China into slavery and \nforced prostitution in the Northern Mariana Islands. The three pled \nguilty in Federal district court in Saipan.\n  The defendants pled guilty to extortion, transportation for illegal \nsexual activity, and conspiracy to violate the right of women to be \nfree from involuntary servitude. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe Justice Department announcement be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, regrettably, this is not the first incident \nof such behavior in the Northern Mariana Islands. As Bill Lann Lee said \nin announcing the pleas:\n\n       We have seen too many cases of modern-day slavery.\n\n  Nor is it the first incident of sexual slavery in the Northern \nMariana Islands. Indeed, slavery and prostitution are endemic to the \nislands' economy.\n  According to the Department of the Interior's latest report on \nworking conditions in the Commonwealth ``many workers are virtually \nprisoners, confined to their barracks during nonworking hours.'' There \nare documented reports of Chinese female workers becoming pregnant and \nwho are pressured to have abortions.\n  The grave situation in the Northern Marianas is captured by the \nheadlines in the Department of the Interior's report. Here are a few of \nthem: ``Local Control Over Immigration Has Led to an Unhealthy, \nPervasive Reliance Upon Indentured Alien Workers,'' ``The CNMI Garment \nIndustry Has Abused Current Trade Privileges to the Detriment of U.S. \nWorkers,'' ``U.S. Companies and U.S. Taxpayers.''\n  Another one: ``Worker Exploitation in the Form of Recruitment \nFraud,'' ``Payless Paydays & Coerced Abortions, Ineffective Border \nControl,'' and ``Smuggling of Aliens and Increased Criminal Activity.'' \nThis is not a pleasant picture, and it only gets worse. In another \nreport earlier this year, an undercover investigative team sponsored by \nthe Global Survival Network detailed the sex trade and slavery in these \nonce idyllic Pacific islands.\n  According to their report, ``Trapped: Human Trafficking for Forced \nLabor in The Commonwealth of The Northern Mariana Islands'':\n\n       Many of the Chinese women working in clubs with local \n     clientele, for example, said they had come to the CNMI \n     ostensibly to work as waitresses, unaware that they would \n     have to work in a nightclub and/or be forced into sexual \n     slavery. These women had been trafficked into the CNMI \n     specifically for sex work without their knowledge or consent.\n\n  Given this environment, is it any wonder three people have pled \nguilty to forcing women into slavery and prostitution?\n  No. The wonder is that more people have not been so found. Hopefully \nthis will change. As the Department of Justice notes, this prosecution \nwas the result of a new effort to increase resources and oversight in \nthe Commonwealth.\n  Fortunately, some American clothing retailers are beginning to react \nto sweatshop conditions in the Northern Marianas. Just the other day, \nfive major retailers--Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Phillips-Van Heusen, \nBryland L.P., and The Dress Barn--agreed to settle a class-action \nlawsuit about this deplorable working environment. The settlement with \nthese businesses follows a similar settlement agreed to last June with \nNordstrom, J. Crew, Cutter & Buck, and Gymboree. Hopefully this marks a \ntrend toward ending indentured servitude in the Commonwealth.\n  More needs to be done. The central cause of the slavery and \nprostitution on this American territory is the lack of any controls on \nimmigration.\n  For my colleagues who may not be familiar with this U.S. territory, \nthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is located 4,000 miles \nwest of Hawaii. In 1975, the people of the CNMI voted for political \nunion with the United States. Today the CNMI is a U.S. territory.\n  A 1976 covenant enacted by Congress gave U.S. citizenship to \nresidents of the CNMI. However, the covenant exempted the Commonwealth \nfrom the Immigration and Nationality Act. As we now know, that omission \nwas a grave error.\n  I want my colleagues of the Senate to know that the chairman of the \nSenate Energy Committee, Mr. Murkowski, and I have introduced \nlegislation to correct fundamental immigration problems in the \nCommonwealth, such as the ones that led to the convictions obtained by \nthe Justice Department. It was only yesterday, that the Energy \nCommittee approved our CNMI reform bill. I hope that the full Senate \nwill act on our legislation soon.\n  Our bill stands for the simple proposition that America is one \ncountry and we must abide by a single, uniform immigration law. \nCongress must terminate an immigration system that is fundamentally \nwrong and incorporate the CNMI under Federal immigration law.\n\n[[Page S13047]]\n\n  Common sense dictates that our country must have a single, national \nimmigration system. If Puerto Rico, or Hawaii, or Oregon, or Washington \ncould write their own immigration laws--and grant work visas to \nforeigners--the U.S. immigration system would be in chaos. That is \nexactly what is happening in the CNMI.\n  Over the past 20 years, the number of citizens in the Commonwealth \ndoubled. During the same period, however, the population of alien \nworkers exploded by 2,000 percent. Today, the CNMI has twice as many \nindentured laborers as citizens in its work force.\n  A decade ago, in response to a growing concern about the large number \nof guest workers employed in the CNMI, the Reagan administration \ndemanded change. Since then, the Bush and Clinton administrations have \nrepeatedly criticized CNMI immigration and demanded reform.\n  The Commonwealth is simply unable to control its borders. One CNMI \nofficial testified that they have ``no effective control'' over \nimmigration.\n  The INS reports that the CNMI has no reliable records of aliens \nentering the Commonwealth, how long they remain, and when, if ever, \nthey depart.\n  A bipartisan commission labeled the Commonwealth's immigration system \n``antithetical to American values.''\n  It is not just the number of workers that prompt concern; alien \nworkers in the CNMI serve as indentured laborers. In a civilized \nsociety, indentured servitude, we believe, is immoral. The United \nStates outlawed indenture over a century ago, but it continues today in \nthe CNMI. The Commonwealth is becoming an international embarrassment \nfor the United States. We have received complaints from the \nPhilippines, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh about immigration abuses \nand mistreatment of workers. Countries around the world watch--and \nwait--for Congress to act.\n  The CNMI system of indentured immigrant labor violates basic \ndemocratic principles. It is time for Congress to enact CNMI \nimmigration reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n Three Plead Guilty to Forcing Women Into Slavery and Prostitution in \n                        Northern Mariana Islands\n\n       Washington, D.C.--Three individuals who were indicted last \n     November on charges that they lured women from China, held \n     them in slavery and forced them into prostitution pled guilty \n     today in federal district court in Saipan, Northern Mariana \n     Islands, the Justice Department announced.\n       Soon Oh Kwon, president of Kwon Enterprises, Inc., which \n     does business in Saipan, pled guilty to one count of \n     conspiracy to violate rights, specifically the right to be \n     free from involuntary servitude. Kwon's wife, Ying Yu Meng \n     pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate federal \n     laws that prohibit involuntary servitude, extortion, and \n     transportation for illegal sexual activity. Kwon's son, Mo \n     Young Kwon, who is an officer of Kwon Enterprises, also \n     entered a guilty plea to one count of transportation for \n     illegal sexual activity.\n       ``Sadly, we have seen too many cases of modern day \n     slavery,'' said Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney \n     General for Civil Rights. ``Today's guilty pleas, should put \n     those who exploit workers on notice that the Justice \n     Department will be relentless in bringing them to justice.''\n       The charges arose out of allegations that the three lured \n     women from China to the CNMI and then held them in slavery \n     and forced them to work as prostitutes in K's Hideaway \n     Karaoke, a bar owned by Kwon Enterprises. ``This kind of \n     abuse of guest workers is intolerable'' said Frederick A. \n     Black, U.S. Attorney for the District of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands. ``No matter where someone is from, once they come to \n     the United States, they should be free from slavery.'' As \n     part of his guilty plea filed with the court, Soon Oh Kwon \n     admitted that, in 1996 and 1997, Kwon Enterprises, in \n     collaboration with Kwon's mother-in-law, recruited and \n     brought women from China to Saipan to work at the karaoke \n     club, where they were forced to have sex with customers. The \n     women were not allowed to stop working for Kwon Enterprises \n     until they had paid debts owed to Kwon and his family for \n     bringing them to Saipan. In order to discourage the women \n     from leaving without permission, the women were subjected to \n     mental and physical coercion, which included threats to their \n     lives, and their families' reputations in China. Soon Oh Kwon \n     also admitted to brandishing a pistol at some of the women. \n     Kwon and his wife also admitted that they threatened the \n     women in order to prevent them from making complaints to the \n     CNMI Department of Labor and Immigration.\n       Kwon's wife admitted that she had general oversight \n     responsibility for the women who were employed by Kwon \n     Enterprises and made sure that they did not leave without \n     permission by intimidating and instilling fear in them. \n     Kwon's son admitted that he made arrangements with customers \n     of the karaoke club to have sex with the women, collected the \n     money, and directed the women to leave with the customers in \n     order to engage in illegal sexual activity.\n       Sentencing is set before Judge Alex R. Munson on January \n     11, 2000.

During that visit, I heard more about a community \neffort that demonstrates the value of local ideas and local innovation. \nThe program is titled, Wake Up. Get Real. and is the product of \nEdmonds-Woodway High School students who are taking leadership roles in \neliminating substance abuse and violence in their schools.\n  Some of those students are here this week in Washington, DC, and were \nable to join me on one of my regular radio shows where they shared \ntheir creative work with members of the media from across Washington \nState. While they are in town, I would like to take this opportunity to \npresent them with one of my ``Innovation in Education'' Awards.\n  Wake Up. Get Real.'s strength lies in the grassroots, community-\noriented nature of its effort, led by students, to reduce the violence \nand substance use that can tarnish a school's learning environment. The \nprogram is young, as it was only created this past spring, at the \nbehest of students concerned about the perception of unsafe schools and \nan increasingly negative public perception of teens.\n  Rather than accept such a situation, the students embarked on a \ncrusade that upholds respect, dignity, and integrity while teaching \ntheir peers that there are a vast number of students who choose not to \nparticipate in substance abuse or in violent activity. Additionally, \nthe students are teaching educators about what is causing problems in \ntheir school and helping them to eliminate alcohol and drug use and \nviolence in their classrooms.\n  All told, Wake Up. Get Real. generates increased community awareness; \nprovides intervention and prevention from dangerous behavior at all \ngrade levels (K-12); promotes increased educator focus on health as a \nfactor in student learning; provides education materials for adults and \nstudents; and offers efficient access to referral resources.\n  For a program with such young roots, one would expect that it would \nstill be in its infant stages. Rather, Wake Up. Get Real. already touts \nwidespread community support from the school district, local health \ncare providers, area law enforcement, and even the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration. Community support has been so strong that public \nservice announcements are currently being run on various cable channels \nto heighten local awareness of this important campaign.\n  When I began my Innovation in Education award program, my goal was to \nhighlight the importance of local control in education. I couldn't ask \nfor a better example than the students who lead Wake Up. Get Real. They \nhave rallied the support of the community behind them and I commend \nthem for their work in changing their schools for the better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13047-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13047-S13048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JACOB WETTERLING FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today in to recognize 10th \nanniversary of the disappearance of one of Minnesota's finest young \nmen, Jacob Wetterling.\n  Jacob's abduction at gun point 10 years ago today from St. Joseph, \nMinnesota, has profoundly affected the lives of his family, but also \nthe lives of the people of Minnesota and the entire United States. \nJacob's family has endured a significant loss and has found\n\n[[Page S13048]]\n\nthe strength to help other families survive tragedy.\n  Patty and Jerry Wetterling have spent the last decade raising \nawareness and influencing public policy through the formation of the \nJacob Wetterling Foundation. The foundation works on a national level \nto eradicate the abduction and exploitation of children by educating, \nraising awareness, and responding to the needs of victim's families.\n  The Jacob Wetterling Foundation has worked with over 1,500 families \nin the search for their missing children, they have presented workshops \nand seminars to thousands of people, and have shared their message of \npersonal safety and abduction prevention to countless parents and \nchildren. Thanks to the Wetterling Foundation sex offenders are \nrequired to register in all 50 States and law enforcement agencies can \nnotify neighborhoods when a likely-to-re-offend sex offender moves \nthere.\n  The Jacob Wetterling Foundation and the family of Jacob are perhaps \nmost widely known for their message of hope, Jacob's Hope. Today we \ntake a moment to think about Jacob Wetterling and the thousands of \nmissing and exploited children and we pray for their safe return. \nMinnesota has an unsung hero in Patty Wetterling and the Jacob \nWetterling Foundation, today we recognize, in great appreciation, the \nwork they have done to save the lives of our children.\n  The Wetterling's have helped others in need while never giving up on \nJacob's Hope. Today we salute this courageous family.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, first, I want to associate my remarks to \nthe Senator's comments dealing with the 10th anniversary of the \ndisappearance of Jacob Wetterling.\n  Our support continues to go out to the family and also, as Senator \nWellstone mentioned, to the Jacob Wetterling Foundation. Patty and \nJerry Wetterling have worked tirelessly to aiding in the search for \nmissing children. As the Senator said, Jacob's Hope is all of our hope.\n  Again, I commend the Wetterlings for their efforts. Also, our \nsympathy and support continues to go out to the family in the \ndisappearance of Jacob Wetterling 10 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13048-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING NAPOLEON ``NAPPY'' LaCHANCE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

At the age of 95, Mr. Napoleon \n``Nappy'' LaChance of Westbrook, ME, will be our State's oldest \nparticipant in the National Senior Olympics.\n  Mr. LaChance, who earned a gold medal in the fast walk competition in \nthe last Maine Senior Olympics, will travel to Orlando, FL, tomorrow, \nOctober 23, to represent the State of Maine in that event.\n  Equally impressive, Mr. LaChance does not excel in just one sport. \nNot only did he win a gold medal for fast walking in the Maine Senior \nOlympics, but he also has won gold medals for golfing and bowling.\n  Mr. LaChance has achieved success in his career as well as in \nathletic competitions. In 1917, Mr. LaChance began working at Valee \nPharmacy as a floor sweeper and errand boy. Through hard work and \ndedication, he became a registered pharmacist and managed the pharmacy \nuntil his retirement. For his dedication to his community's well-being, \nMr. LaChance has been rewarded with the respect, affection, and \nadmiration of his customers, neighbors, family, and friends.\n  Mr. LaChance's accomplishments are an inspiration to anyone who \naspires to be the best they can be.

Mr. President, just a few weeks ago, many of my Senate \ncolleagues met a young, dynamic parliamentarian from Belarus, Mr. \nAnatoly Lebedko, right here on the Senate floor. He impressed us with \nhis dedication and commitment as he advocates for democracy and the \nrule of law in his home country currently being rule by a repressive \nregime.\n  You can imagine how shocked and concerned I was to receive a call \nfrom the State Department this week informing me Mr. Lebedko had been \npicked up by the authorities as part of the latest crackdown in \nBelarus. I am sure my colleagues who met Mr. Lebedko share my concern \nfor his well-being and for the safety of all of those struggling for \ndemocracy and freedom of speech.\n  Eight years after the break-up of the Soviet Union, Belarus finds \nitself increasingly isolated from the rest of Europe as a direct \nconsequence of the authoritarian policies pursued by its present \ngovernment which have stifled that country's fledging democracy and \nmarket economy.\n  The Helsinki Commission, which I co-chair, held a hearing a few \nmonths ago to assess democracy and human rights in Belarus. In July, a \nnumber of Commission members and I had the opportunity to hear Mr. \nLebedko address the annual Parliamentary Assembly meeting of the \nOrganization of Security and Corporation in Europe (OSCE) in St. \nPetersburg, where he outlined developments in Belarus and the prospects \nfor genuine political and economic reforms.\n  Clearly, the cycle of political and economic stagnation in Belarus \nwill only come to an end through genuine dialogue based on human \nrights, democracy and the rule of law. The Helsinki Commission has \ncalled on Belarus to adopt meaningful political and economic reforms in \nkeeping with that country's obligations as a participating State of the \nOSCE.\n  On September 3, the government and opposition in Belarus began \nconsultations at the office of the OSCE Advisory and Monitoring Group \nin Minsk. These talks, long urged by the international community and \nthe Helsinki Commission could represent an important step in beginning \nthe process of reversing the bleak human rights and democratization \npicture in Belarus.\n  Until recently I had been encouraged by what appeared to be the start \nof a dialog between the Belarusian Government and opposition. However, \nthere have been a number of disturbing developments, including \ncontinued harassment of opposition members, a renewed crackdown on the \nindependent media in recent weeks, and now the detainment of Mr. \nLebedko.\n  We recently wrote to Secretary of State Albright voicing concern \nabout the situation in Belarus and called on the State Department to \nintensify its work in this area. This most recent development \nunderscores our concerns.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of our letter to the Secretary of \nState, a letter we sent to the President of Belarus, along with recent \nnews clips be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Commission on Security\n\n\n                                    and Cooperation in Europe,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Madeleine Korbel Albright,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: We are writing to voice our growing \n     concern over violations of the principles of democracy, human \n     rights, and the rule of law in Belarus under the \n     authoritarian leadership of Aleksandr Lukashenka, who remains \n     in power despite the expiration of his legal presidential \n     mandate last July. The fledgling opposition in Belarus \n     deserves both our moral and material support as they seek to \n     overcome the legacy of Communism and authoritarianism and \n     build a democratic society firmly rooted in the rule of law.\n       Many of us recently had an opportunity to meet with Anatoly \n     Lebedko of the United Civic Party of Belarus, a young \n     political leader who, despite personal risk, continues to \n     openly criticize the Lukashenka regime. His personal safety \n     is of particular concern as he returns to Belarus following \n     an intense crackdown against the opposition.\n       In recent weeks, Lukashenka has reportedly authorized a \n     series of measures designed to further suppress Belarus' \n     already beleaguered opposition. Border controls have \n     apparently been tightened and officials in Minsk and other \n     large cities have been instructed to ban public protests and \n     demonstrations. The few remaining independent opposition \n     newspapers, including Naviny and Kuryer, have likewise come \n     under increased pressure from the authorities.\n\n[[Page S13049]]\n\n       Lukashenka's campaign of harassment and intimidation of the \n     political opposition has intensified. Former Premier Mikhail \n     Chigir, arrested in March on politically-motivated charges, \n     remains imprisoned. A number of other former government \n     officials and political opposition figures continue to be \n     subjected to lengthy pre-trial detention on similar changes. \n     In a particularly disturbing development, several prominent \n     opposition leaders, including Viktor Gonchar, Tamara \n     Vinnikova, and Yuri Zakharenka, have simply disappeared.\n       Madam Secretary, we urge you to intensify pressure on the \n     Lukashenka regime for the immediate release of all political \n     detainees in Belarus and a full accounting of those who have \n     disappeared. We further urge you to ensure that adequate \n     resources are made available on an urgent basis to support \n     those programs aimed at strengthening independent media, \n     human rights, civil society, independent trade unions and the \n     democratic opposition in Belarus.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christopher H.

Until recently, we were becoming more helpful that \n     meaningful dialogue between the Belarusian Government and \n     opposition would take place. Within the last month, however, \n     violations of the principles of human rights, democracy and \n     rule of law have come to our attention that, frankly, lead us \n     to question your government's seriousness in finding a \n     solution to the problems of democracy in Belarus. We were \n     disturbed to learn of the arrest earlier today of democratic \n     opposition leader Anatoly Lebedko, for allegedly \n     participating in ``an unsanctioned march.''\n       Our concerns include the following:\n       The continued imprisonment of former Prime Minister Mikhail \n     Chygir, who was supposed to be released from investigative \n     detention where he has been held for six months.\n       The disappearances of former Central Election Commission \n     Chairman Viktor Gonchar, his colleague Yuri Krasovsky, former \n     Interior Minister Yuri Zakharenka, and former National Bank \n     Chair Tamara Vinnikova.\n       Increased attempts to stifle freedom of expression, \n     including the annualling of registration certificates of nine \n     periodicals, and especially the harassment of Naviny through \n     the use of high libel fees clearly designed to silence this \n     independent newspaper.\n       The denial of registration of non-governmental \n     organizations, including the Belarusian Independent \n     Industrial Trade Union Associaiton.\n       The police raid, without a search warrant, on the human \n     rights organization Viasna-96, and confiscation of computers \n     which stored data on human rights violations.\n       Criminal charges against opposition activist Mykola \n     Statkevich and lawyer Oleg Volchek and continued \n     interrogation of lawyer Vera Stremkovskaya.\n       The initial attack by riot police against peaceful \n     protestors in last Sunday's Freedom March.\n       Your efforts to address these concerns would reduce the \n     climate of suspicion and fear that currently exists and \n     enhance confidence in the negotiation process which we \n     believe is so vital to Belarus' development as a democratic \n     country in which human rights and the rule of law are \n     respected.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christopher H.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed \nthe conference report on the Interior and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000. The conference report \nrepresents a good faith effort to merge the spending priorities of the \nHouse, the Senate, and the administration, and to resolve the concerns \nvoiced by the administration about various legislative provisions in \nthe bill. I think the conference report is a solid, bipartisan bill \nthat deserves the overwhelming support of the Senate and the signature \nof the President.\n  The bill totals roughly $14.5 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, which is a significant increase from the levels contained in \nthe House and Senate passed bills. Some of this increase is \nattributable to the House and Senate insisting upon funding for \nspecific programs, and much of the increase is due to the efforts of \nthe conferees to meet the spending priorities of the administration. \nWhile the bill before you represents an increase of about $500 million \nover the fiscal year 1999 level, it is still $500 million below the \nadministration's request level.\n  In developing the fiscal year 2000 Interior bill, the top priority \nfor both the House and Senate committees was to maintain the core \noperating programs of the land management agencies, the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, the Indian Health Service, and the cultural agencies \nfunded in this bill. Because Interior bill agencies are highly \npersonnel-intensive, simply keeping pace with the cost of Federal pay \nraises requires an increase of more than $300 million over the fiscal \nyear 1999 level. This leaves little room from programmatic increases \nand new initiatives.\n  The conference report before you, however, does contain significant \nincreases for targeted, high-priority programs. The bill provides \nroughly $28 million to increase the base operating budgets of more than \n100 units of the National Park System, while also providing funds for a \nfocused effort to enhance our limited understanding of the tremendous \nnatural resources present within the Park System. The bill also \nincludes an increase of $25 million for the operation and maintenance \nof the National Fish and Wildlife Refuge System, and increases for \ncritical grazing management, road maintenance, wildlife and fisheries \nmanagement, and recreation programs within the Forest Service and the \nBureau of Land Management.\n  For Indian programs, the bill provides the full administration \nrequest for the Office of the Special Trustee--the Secretary of the \nInterior's No. 1 priority within this bill. I fervently hope that these \nfunds will enable the Secretary to clean up the Indian trust fund \nmanagement mess that has been allowed to accumulate over many years. \nThe conference agreement also provides an increase of $130 million for \nthe Indian Health Service, and increases within the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs for law enforcement, school operations, school repairs, and \nschool construction.\n  With regard to the cultural agencies in this bill, I am pleased that \nthe conferees agreed to the Senate position with regard to the National \nEndowment for the Humanities, thereby providing a $5 million increase. \nI was disappointed that the House would not agree to a similar increase \nproposed by the Senate for the National Endowment for the Arts, but \nanticipate we will try again next year. I also note that the bill \nincludes $19 million for the Smithsonian to complete the federal \ncommitment to construction of the National Museum of the American \nIndian on The Mall, and $20 million to\n\n[[Page S13050]]\n\ncontinue renovations at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing \nArts.\n  In addition to the programs I have mentioned, the conferees made a \nconcerted effort to address some of the specific funding priorities \nvoiced by the administration that were not included in either the House \nor Senate bill. The conference agreement includes $30 million for the \nSave America's Treasures Program for historic preservation, a grant \nprogram of particular importance to the First Lady funded for the first \ntime last year. The conference agreement also provides funding for \nFederal land acquisition at levels higher than in either the House or \nSenate bill, including $40 million for the purchase of the Baca Ranch \nin New Mexico.\n  With regard to issues of policy, the conference agreement embodies a \ngreat number of compromises with both the House and the administration. \nThe legislative provisions, or ``riders'' about which the \nadministration has complained most vociferously have all been modified \nor scaled back significantly to address administration concerns.\n  The one year moratorium on oil valuation regulations contained in the \nSenate bill has been modified to provide a maximum of a 180-day delay \nwhile the Comptroller General reviews several aspects of the proposed \nregulations.\n  The provision in the Senate bill regarding millsites--which would \nhave permanently refuted the Solicitor's opinion on this issue--has \nbeen limited to a 2-year provision that prohibits application of the \nnew Solicitor's opinion to existing plans of operations, plans of \noperations filed prior to May 21, 1999, and patent applications that \nhave been grandfathered under the terms of the Interior bill since \nfiscal year 1995. This provides some degree of fair treatment to those \nwho have invested millions of dollars in the permitting process, only \nto find that the ground rules have been radically changed by the \nactions of a single bureaucrat.\n  With regard to grazing, the conference agreement includes a 1-year \nprovision that is substantially similar to the provision signed into \nlaw as part of last year's bill. This provides for renewal of expired \ngrazing permits pending completion of environmental review, but \nmaintains completely the Secretary's right to renew, alter, or reject a \nrenewal application upon completion of such review. The Senate bill \nincluded a permanent provision that was opposed by the administration.\n  The conference report embodies many more compromises such as those I \nhave just described. I want to thank Chairman Regula, his staff and the \nHouse conferees for their willingness to work through these many \ncomplex and difficult issues. I have thoroughly enjoyed my relationship \nwith Chairman Regula since becoming chairman myself, and admire his \ncommitment to supporting, overseeing and, when needed, critiquing the \nimportant programs and agencies funded in this bill.\n  Finally Mr. President, I note that there are three corrections that \nneed to be made to the conference report. The number for the Historic \nPreservation Fund in the National Part Service should be $75,212,000, \nthe number for Forest Service land acquisition should be $79,575,000, \nand in section 310, ``1999'' should read ``2000.'' Mr. Regula and I \nwill take the necessary steps to ensure that thee corrections are made.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support the conference report. It is a \ngood bill that deserves our vote, and deserves the signature of the \nPresident.\n\n\n                         mms royalty valuation\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to engage my colleagues, \nSenators Nickles, Domenici, Murkowski, and Breaux in a discussion of \nthe important issue of Federal oil royalty valuation.\n  Yesterday the House and Senate both passed the fiscal year 2000 \nInterior appropriations conference report. Contained within that bill \nis a provision addressing proposed new rules of the Minerals Management \nService on establishing the value of oil from Federal leases to \ndetermine the royalty owed on that oil.\n  On September 23 of this year 60 Senators voted to break a Senate \nfilibuster and vote on the Hutchison-Domenici amendment to prevent the \nMMS from going forward with its misguided and unworkable new valuation \nsystem. Our amendment passed, and it passed because a bipartisan \nmajority of the U.S. Senate recognized that blocking the rule was the \nright thing to do. It was the right thing to do because it protected \nthe American consumer, who is increasingly at the whim of foreign oil \nmarkets as America's oil production dwindles. And it was the right \nthing to do for the American taxpayer, who entrusts the Congress, not \nunelected bureaucrats, with the decision of whether or not to raise \ntaxes in this country.\n  But despite our victory on the floor, it became apparent during the \nconference negotiations between the Senate and the House, that this \nprovision in the Interior appropriations bill may be used by the \nPresident as an excuse to veto the entire bill. Because there are so \nmany important programs funded in this bill, from national parks to \nenergy conservation programs, I, Senator Domenici, and the other \nsponsors of this amendment, offered a compromise, which is reflected in \nthe bill, and I wonder if my distinguished colleague from New Mexico, \nwho has been my partner on this issue for two years, could explain that \ncompromise?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be happy to explain the provision, and I thank \nthe Senator for her leadership and diligence in joining with me to \nfight this clear example of regulatory abuse by a Federal agency. As \nthe Senator knows, Federal law requires that the value of oil from \nFederal land be determined when it is drawn from the ground, or ``at \nthe lease.'' After decades of following the law and using this method \nof determining oil value, in 1997 the MMS tried to implement a new \nsystem without congressional approval and one not supported by \nstatutory law. The proposal would peg the royalty price of the oil \n``downstream,'' that is, after value has been added to it through \ntransportation, processing, and marketing. It was the equivalent of the \nFederal Government saying that, rather than determine the value of \nFederal land timber when it is chopped-down, the Federal Government \nwould tax the value of the timber once it was turned into furniture. We \nfought that plan, and will continue to fight it, as long as the MMS \ncontinues to ignore the mandate of the law and of the Congress.\n  But, as the Senator from Texas indicated, we offered a compromise on \nthis issue. Frankly, part of the problem in this debate, and one of the \nreasons it has been so polarized, is that there has never been a \ncomprehensive, independent assessment of just how the MMS can establish \nthe value of Federal royalty oil in a simpler, more workable way, while \nfollowing the controlling Federal statutes. Everyone agrees that the \nprocess as it exists today is too complex, and too subjective. In fact, \nI and other Members of Congress have held extensive meetings and \nhearings on the issue to determine just how we can make the rule easier \nand more predictable to administer, while ensuring a fair return to the \ntaxpayer for Federal royalty oil. This provision included in the \nconference report requires a General Accounting Office study. We have \ndirected the GAO to carefully examine the key issues raised by the \nproposed new rule and report back to Congress before any new royalty \nvaluation rule can go into effect. But to ensure that this is not \ndragged out too long, we have directed that the GAO's report on the \nissue be submitted to Congress within 6 months. Finally, the provision \nrequires that any new proposal by the MMS must comply fully with all \napplicable Federal laws, including those requiring the establishment of \noil value at the lease, that is, at the wellhead.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator for that explanation, and for his \nleadership and hard work on this issue. I think he will agree that \nwhile this provision is certainly less than we would have liked and is \nless than the moratorium passed by the Senate, and, I might add, passed \nby the Congress and signed into law by the President on no less than \nthree previous occasions, it is a step in the right direction.\n  I would also like to get the comments of my colleague from Louisiana, \nSenator Breaux, who has been a stalwart supporter of reasonable and \nworkable royalty valuation rules on his assessment of this issue.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator, and I thank all of my colleagues who \nhave worked with me on this important matter. I certainly agree with \nthe comments of the Senators from Texas\n\n[[Page S13051]]\n\nand New Mexico that the proposed MMS royalty valuation rule simply will \nnot work. Regulations should reflect a fair, reliable, and accurate \nroyalty valuation system.\n  The issue here is really very simple: How do you set the fair market \nvalue of crude oil extracted from Federal lands on which to base the \nroyalty calculation? Oil companies do not determine how much they have \nto pay--we do. Congress set the royalty percentage in the Mineral \nLeasing Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and other Federal \nlaws and these laws provide that the royalty percentage to the Federal \nGovernment is \\1/6\\ or \\1/8\\ of the total value of the oil.\n  This is a very complicated, ongoing rulemaking procedure to assess \nlegitimate deductions and transportation costs in order to determine \nthe fair market value of oil. But how do you determine the price of oil \nthat is produced in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico? You can very \neasily determine the price of oil at the wellhead, if you sold the oil \nat the wellhead, some 200 miles offshore. However, the oil is \ntransported hundreds of miles onshore where it is refined and then \nultimately sold. The question then becomes: Who pays for the \ntransportation of the oil from the middle of the gulf? It is the \nFederal Government's oil. Do the companies pay for the transportation \nor does the Federal Government? There is a huge disagreement on this \nvery difficult and complicated issue.\n  We say to the Interior Department, in the Interior appropriations \nconference report, that the rule is fundamentally flawed. It does not \nallow for the legitimate deductions in the costs of transportation that \nshould be allowed. Therefore, do not go forward with this rule. \nInstead, we are giving Congress and the Interior Department time to \ncome to an agreement on what is appropriate and I am pleased that we \nhave been able to at least delay the rule until a suitable solution can \nbe determined.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Texas, as well as the \nSenators from New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Louisiana who have all been \nsteadfast in their desire and commitment to ensuring a royalty \nvaluation process that is fair to both the American taxpayer and to \ndomestic producers. As was spelled out in the report accompanying this \nconference agreement, the GAO, at a minimum, must thoroughly examine \nand answer several central issues and answer several key questions. \nAmong those questions the GAO must fully answer are:\n  1. Does the OCSLA and the MLLA require that a producer pay royalty on \nthe value added by post-production downstream activities?\n  2. Does the Interior Department proposed rule allow royalty payors to \nobtain timely valuation methodology determinations on which they can \nrely similar to the practice of Internal Revenue Service letter \nrulings?\n  3. Does the proposed rule provide that the ``gross proceeds'' method \nutilized in valuation of arms-length transactions can not be later set \naside for an alternative methodology (resulting in penalties and \ninterest) simply because another entity was able to obtain a higher \nvalue for the sale of production in the open marketplace?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator. I would also like to ask the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader, Senator Nickles, what, in his \nview, must be examined by the GAO in its study?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Senator. There are, indeed, other key \nquestions that must be thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the GAO \nstudy. Specifically:\n  1. For non-arms length transactions; the GAO should study the use by \nthe MMS of comparable sales as a measure of value of production at the \nlease, provided the lessee satisfies prescribed information and sales \nvolume requirements. This study should not be limited to the Rocky \nMountain region only, but studied for use in all areas.\n  2. The GAO must study the adoption of alternative ratemaking \nprinciples for DOI use in establishing the commercial rate for \ntransportation when oil is sold downstream of the lease. GAO must also \nexamine what adjustments are reasonable for location and quality of \nproduction and post-production activities when oil is sold downstream \nof the lease.\n  This seems to be the best way to arrive at a fair, accurate, and \nconcise calculation of the fair market value of production at the \nlease.\n  I am confident that in this way producers and the Federal Government \nwould be ensured a fair and workable royalty payment system.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will yield, I must say I agree with my \ncolleagues, Senators Hutchison, Murkowski, and Nickles, who represent, \nalong with myself, the key committees of jurisdiction over this issue. \nThe GAO study that we have mandated must, at a minimum, provide a \nthorough examination of these issues, as detailed here and in the \nconference report.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \nguidance and continuing interest in this regard. Finally, I believe my \ncolleagues would agree that it would be useful if the MMS would \nrepropose its oil valuation rule. It has been nearly 2 years since the \nagency put forward its last complete proposed rule. The DOI has \nreceived voluminous comments since that time, including detailed \nrecommendations by industry at three public workshops on the rule \nearlier this year. It also re-opened the comment period for a month \nearlier this year. In trying to resolve this matter, it would be \nhelpful if all the parties could understand the agency's current \nthinking on the contentious issues my colleagues have described. \nReproposing the rule would be the best way to achieve that result and I \nstrongly encourage the agency to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13051-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-5506.

A bill to continue reporting requirements of section 2519 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, beyond December 21, 1999, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     CONTINUED REPORTING OF INTERCEPTED WIRE, ORAL, AND ELECTRONIC \n                           COMMUNICATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill to \ncontinue and enhance the current reporting requirements for the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts and the Attorney General on the \neavesdropping and surveillance activities of our federal and state law \nenforcement agencies.\n  For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has \ncomplied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(3), to \nreport to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state \napplications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of \nwire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3, \n1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because \n``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required \npursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.''\n  The AO has done an excellent job at preparing the wiretap reports. We \nneed to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If \nanother agency took over this important task at this juncture and the \nnumbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate \nquestions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents \nof that report. In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing \nstatistics from prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job \nof Congressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting \nduty to another agency might create delays in issuance of the report \nsince no other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, \nstate and local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting \nmethodology developed by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the \nreporting standards and agency have changed would inevitably create \nmore confusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the \ncountry are forced to learn a new system and develop a liaison with a \nnew agency.\n  The system in place now has worked well and should be continued. We \nknow how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to criticism over \ntheir use of these surreptitious surveillance tools and we should avoid \naggravating these sensitivities by changing the reporting agency.\n  The bill would update the reporting requirements currently in place \nwith one additional reporting requirement. Specifically, the bill would \nrequire the wiretap report to include information on the number of \norders in which encryption was encountered and whether such encryption \nprevented law enforcement from obtaining the plaintext of \ncommunications intercepted pursuant to such order.\n  Encryption technology is critical to protect sensitive computer and \nonline information. Yet, the same technology poses challenges to law \nenforcement when it is exploited by criminals to hide evidence or the \nfruits of criminal activities. A report by the U.S. Working Group on \nOrganized Crime titled, ``Encryption and Evolving Technologies: Tools \nof Organized Crime and Terrorism,'' released in 1997, collected \nanecdotal case studies on the use of encryption in furtherance of \ncriminal activities in order to estimate the future impact of \nencryption on law enforcement. The report noted the need for ``an \nongoing study of the effect of encryption and other information \ntechnologies on investigations, prosecutions, and intelligence \noperations. As part of this study, a database of case information from \nfederal and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies should be \nestablished and maintained.'' Adding a requirement that reports be \nfurnished on the number of occasions when encryption is encountered by \nlaw enforcement is a far more reliable basis than anecdotal evidence on \nwhich to assess law enforcement needs and make sensible policy in this \narea.\n  The final section of this bill would codify the information that the \nAttorney General already provides on pen register and trap and trace \ndevice orders, and require further information on where such orders are \nissued and the types of facilities--telephone, computer, pager or other \ndevice--to which the order relates. Under the Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act (``ECPA'') of 1986, P.L. 99-508, codified at 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 3126, the Attorney General of the United States is required to \nreport annually to the Congress on the number of pen register orders \nand orders for trap and trace devices applied for by law enforcement \nagencies of the Department of Justice. As the original sponsor of ECPA, \nI believed that adequate oversight of the surveillance activities of \nfederal law enforcement could only be accomplished with reporting \nrequirements such as the one included in this law.\n  The reports furnished by the Attorney General on an annual basis \ncompile information from five components of the Department of Justice: \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United \nStates Marshals Service and the Office of the Inspector General. The \nreport contains information on the number of original and extension \norders made to the courts for authorization to use both pen register \nand trap and trace devices, information concerning the number of \ninvestigations involved, the offenses on which the applications were \npredicted and the number of people whose telephone facilities were \naffected.\n  These specific categories of information are useful, and the bill we \nintroduce today would direct the Attorney General to continue providing \nthese specific categories of information. In addition, the bill would \ndirect the Attorney General to include information on the identity, \nincluding the district, of the agency making the application and the \nperson authorizing the order. In this way, the Congress and the public \nwill be informed of those jurisdictions using this surveillance \ntechnique--information which is currently not included in the Attorney \nGeneral's annual reports.\n  The requirement for preparation of the wiretap reports will soon \nlapse. I therefore urge prompt action on this legislation to continue \nthe requirement for submission of the wiretap reports and to update the \nreporting requirements for both the wiretap reports submitted by the AO \nand the pen register and trap and trace reports submitted by the \nAttorney General.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Continued Reporting of \n     Intercepted Wire, Oral, and Electronic Communications Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 2519(3) of title 18, United States Code, \n     requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the \n     United States Courts to transmit to Congress a full and \n     complete annual report concerning the number of applications \n     for orders authorizing or approving the interception of wire, \n     oral, or electronic communications. This report is required \n     to include information specified in section 2519(3).\n       (2) The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 \n     provides for the termination of certain laws requiring \n     submittal to Congress of annual, semiannual, and regular \n     periodic reports as of December 21, 1999, 4 years from the \n     effective date of that Act.\n       (3) Due to the Federal Reports Elimination Act and Sunset \n     Act of 1995, the Administrative Office of United States \n     Courts is not required to submit the annual report described \n     in section 2519(3) of title 18, United States Code, as of \n     December 21, 1999.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONTINUED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Continued Reporting Requirements.--Section 2519 of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(4) The reports required to be filed by subsection (3) \n     are exempted from the termination provisions of section \n     3003(a) of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of \n     1995 (Public Law 104-66).''.\n       (b) Exemption.--Section 3003(d) of the Federal Reports \n     Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-66) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (31), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (32), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(33) section 2519(3) of title 18, United States Code.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to increase student involvement, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n             youth and adult school partnership act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are rapidly coming to the end of the \nsession. This Congress has a lot of unfinished business left in far too \nmany areas: Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drug, guns, juvenile \njustice, and education. Today I want to take a few minutes to talk \nabout one of America's top priorities, education. Today I am going to \nbe introducing, a little bit later, and describing several bills that \nwill improve education in America. We are about to start our biggest \ndebate on education in 5 years as we begin the work on the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act.\n  If the past few weeks are any indication, I am very concerned that in \nthis critical education debate our children are going to be the losers, \nand that would really be a shame. Education has long been a bipartisan \nissue, but somehow in this Congress partisanship has too often pushed \nprogress aside.\n  Two weeks ago, I tried to help our schools continue a very successful \ninitiative to hire more teachers so there would be fewer kids in each \nof our classrooms. Just 1 year ago, this initiative was announced as a \nbipartisan issue and leaders on both sides of the aisle claimed credit \nfor this national effort to reduce class sizes in grades 1 through 3. \nBut now, a year later, this amendment has been defeated on a party line \nvote.\n  Parents and teachers want real solutions. They want real investments. \nThey want a real commitment to our schools. I believe we can do what is \nright for education in this Congress. When we listen to parents and \neducators and students, a vision for improving our schools based on \ntheir real needs is clear. I believe we must first establish the \nfollowing principles: We need to ensure that all children have an equal \nopportunity to learn. We need to elevate the teaching profession \nthrough better pay and greater respect. We need to hold educators \naccountable for students' progress. And we need to invest more money in \npublic education.\n  This plan is built on a partnership among Federal, State and local \nofficials, working together to help all our students. It starts with \nmaking the school work for our students. That means making sure the \nschool buildings are safe and secure and modern. That is why I am an \noriginal cosponsor of the School Modernization Act, so kids do not have \nto learn in crumbling schools or overcrowded classrooms.\n  It means making sure the teachers have the training and professional \ndevelopment they need to give our kids the best. That is why I am an \noriginal cosponsor of the Public Schools Education Excellence Act. A \nsection of that act that I wrote called Teacher Technology Training \nwill make sure all educators know the best ways to use technology to \nteach our children.\n  It means making sure education does not stop when the school bell \nrings. We need to give our kids safe and educational things to do when \nthe schoolday is over and parents are still at work. And it means \nmaking sure there are, at most, 18 students in each classroom instead \nof 30. We know in smaller classes kids get the time and attention they \nneed. That is why I wrote and I am going to continue to fight for the \nClass Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Act, to give schools the money \nthey need to reduce our class sizes, particularly in the younger \ngrades.\n  Everyone wants smaller classes. When you ask experts in education, \nthey tell you that, based on their research, smaller classes make a big \ndifference. When you ask teachers what makes the biggest difference, \nthe answer is smaller classes. And when you ask parents, Do you want \nyour child in a class of 30 or 18? the answer is clear; they want \nsmaller classes. Smaller classes help kids learn the basics and improve \nclassroom discipline. Parents, teachers, and experts all want smaller \nclasses.\n  Last year, this Congress promised schools we would fund smaller class \nsizes for 7 years. This year, schools across the country are taking \nadvantage of that program. But here we are, just 1 year later, and that \ncommitment is fading. Last week, I released a letter signed by 38 \nSenators, Senators who are going to stand up for class size reduction. \nThe President said if this Congress does not fund class size reduction, \nhe will veto the bill. Last week, 38 Senators said they would stand \nwith him and back up that veto.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, if you shortchange class size, the \nPresident will veto your bill. If you try to override that veto, we \nwill stand together to make sure our kids get the smaller classes they \ndeserve, the ones we promised them 1 year ago, a promise made by both \nparties to all of our kids.\n  I have other ideas on how we can help our students. As we begin \ndiscussing our Nation's Federal education law, I will introduce \nlegislation to assure that all segments of our school community--\nteachers, students, and families--play their role in improving \neducation.\n  To help teachers, my legislation will give us the tools to recruit \nthe world's finest educators; to retain educators by improving \nprofessional development and creating career ladders so that our best \nteachers will not leave the classroom but will have the opportunity to \ncontinue to grow professionally; to make sure all teachers can use the \ntools of technology to boost student achievement.\n  It will reward and recognize great educators. It will offer a \nmeaningful financial bonus for States to improve teacher pay. And it \nwill require educators to meet the same high standards we expect of our \nstudents.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to help students by creating more \nmeaningful roles for students in their schools and communities, finding \nthe best examples of students and adults working together and rewarding \nthose efforts and sharing those ideas with all schools, and showing the \nlink between student involvement and student achievement.\n  Because we know parents and families are a child's first and best \nteachers, I am also introducing legislation that will invite families \ninto our schools, train teachers, and administrators in the best ways \nto involve parents, and invest in family involvement at newer and \nhigher levels.\n  It will use technology to make it easier for parents to stay informed \nand involved in their child's education. Borrowing from an example in \nmy home State of Washington, it will build on the success of parent \ncooperative preschools which use local community colleges as a vehicle \nto improve parent involvement and school readiness for young kids.\n  I have talked with parents in my State, and it has become clear they \nwant to be involved in their child's education. Too often, though, \ntheir jobs prevent them from being involved. That is why I introduced \nmy Time for Schools Act. Which lets parents take up to 24 hours of \nunpaid leave off work each year to attend academic events at school and \nbe involved in their child's education. That is the type of real-\n\n[[Page S13054]]\n\nworld solution that will help our parents.\n  Those are all parts of the comprehensive vision for improving \neducation. I believe this plan will help prepare America for the next \ncentury. It is based on what we know works and has real money to back \nit up.\n  All too often, the debates on education begin with talk about how bad \nour public schools are. Everyone will hear that our schools are in \nshambles. I believe our schools are not failing, but if we let this \nCongress cut education funding, we will be failing our public schools.\n  Most of our public schools are doing a good job. Some are not, but \nthey are all facing more and more challenges with fewer resources than \never before. We have to recognize those challenges and prepare our \nschools and our children for the future.\n  Today, I hear a lot of talk about bureaucracy. I hear our schools are \ntrapped by red tape. I was a school board member, and I know what it is \nlike to fill out forms and, yes, we should reduce paperwork. That is \nwhy the class size reduction application is only one page, is available \nonline, and takes just a few minutes to fill out. Less paperwork is \ngood. But somehow some people have convinced themselves that if there \nare fewer forms, our kids will magically get the resources they need. \nFewer forms will not buy a textbook or build a classroom. It takes \nresources and support, and it takes real dollars. Reducing bureaucracy \nsounds good, but it means nothing if it is only as good as the paper on \nwhich it is written.\n\n  I hear a lot of talk about flexibility. That sounds great. I support \nflexibility because I know that principals and local school boards \nunderstand their own needs best. But we cannot forget right now that \nthe Federal Government sets money aside for specific programs, like for \nhomeless children or gifted children, money to help our schools become \nsafe and drug free. That money is targeted for special needs which we \nas a country believe are important, and those Federal funds do a lot of \ngood because they are seven times more targeted than other education \nfunds. That money ensures that every American child gets a good \neducation.\n  But the plans I hear about tell schools, ``Do whatever you want with \nthe money.'' At the same time, those plans start cutting the amount of \nmoney available to schools, and then our kids are the losers. When that \ndollar is no longer attached to a specific need, like making our \nschools safe after Columbine, or meeting the needs of a child who is \nbehind or a child who is gifted, it is a lot easier to cut that money.\n  Now schools think they have a choice, but they really have fewer \noptions because there is less money available than there was the day \nbefore. When schools have choice with less money, national priorities \nand protections lose out.\n  Suddenly that choice does not sound so good. Suddenly that choice is \nnot liberating; it is limiting, and that is wrong because some of our \nkids are going to be left behind when a bill promising some version of \nflexibility makes schools choose between children. Let's not forget \nthat we have already passed a better version of school flexibility \ncalled Ed-Flex earlier this year. Let's see how that serves our \nchildren before we try more risky approaches.\n  We cannot forget why the Federal Government got involved in \neducation. Thirty years ago, when education was left to States and \nlocalities alone, some kids got left behind. So the Federal Government \nset a basic safety net for all children. These are the targeted funds \nthat some plans would put into a block grant and then cut.\n  The Federal Government does two other vital things: It helps us meet \nnational priorities, such as teaching technology or reducing class \nsize, and it also helps students meet their potential and achieve at \ntheir highest levels. When this Congress ignores the reasons why we \nhave a Federal partner in education, we are left with false choices \nthat fail our children.\n  Our country deserves a real choice. We must offer real plans, real \nmoney to improve our schools, not false choices and not funding cuts. I \nurge my colleagues to listen to the American people. We should treat \neducation like a priority and do right by all of our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13054-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1235\n\n  At the request of Mr. Robb, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1235, a bill to amend part G of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control \nand Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow railroad police officers to \nattend the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Academy for law \nenforcement training.\n\n\n                                S. 1510\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Montana \n(Mr. Burns) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1510, a bill to revise the \nlaws of the United States appertaining to United States cruise vessels, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1626\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n(Mr. Grams) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1626, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to improve the process by which the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services makes coverage determinations \nfor items and services furnished under the medicare program, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 59\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the name of the Senator from Missouri \n(Mr. Ashcroft) was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution \n59, a concurrent resolution urging the President to negotiate a new \nbase rights agreement with the Government of Panama in order for United \nStates Armed Forces to be stationed in Panama after December 31, 1999.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 118\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reid, the names of the Senator from Kentucky \n(Mr. Bunning), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts), and the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) were added as cosponsors of Senate \nResolution 118, a resolution designating December 12, 1999, as \n``National Children's Memorial Day.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13054-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13054-S13062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 ROTH (AND MOYNIHAN) AMENDMENT NO. 2325\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Moynihan) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill (H.R. 434) to authorize a \nnew trade and investment policy for sub-Sahara Africa; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n     the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and \n     sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan \n     Africa;\n       (2) the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region \n     richly endowed with both natural and human resources;\n       (3) sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous \n     economic potential and of enduring political significance to \n     the United States;\n       (4) the region has experienced a rise in both economic \n     development and political freedom as countries in sub-Saharan \n     Africa have taken steps toward liberalizing their economies \n     and encouraged broader participation in the political \n     process;\n       (5) the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have made progress \n     toward regional economic integration that can have positive \n     benefits for the region;\n       (6) despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-\n     Saharan Africa averages less than $500 annually;\n       (7) United States foreign direct investment in the region \n     has fallen in recent years and the sub-Saharan African region \n     receives only minor inflows of direct investment from around \n     the world;\n       (8) trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa, \n     apart from the import of oil, remains an insignificant part \n     of total United States trade;\n       (9) trade and investment, as the American experience has \n     shown, can represent powerful tools both for economic \n     development and for building a stable political environment \n     in which political freedom can flourish;\n       (10) increased trade and investment flows have the greatest \n     impact in an economic environment in which trading partners \n     eliminate barriers to trade and capital flows and encourage \n     the development of a vibrant private sector that offers \n     individual African citizens the freedom to expand their \n     economic opportunities and provide for their families;\n       (11) offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced \n     trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade \n     and direct investment in support of the positive economic and \n     political developments under way throughout the region; and\n       (12) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and \n     investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of \n     trade and investment for the region as well as enhance \n     commercial and political ties between the United States and \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress supports--\n       (1) encouraging increased trade and investment between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (2) reducing tariff and nontariff barriers and other \n     obstacles to sub-Saharan African and United States trade;\n       (3) expanding United States assistance to sub-Saharan \n     Africa's regional integration efforts;\n       (4) negotiating reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade \n     agreements, including the possibility of establishing free \n     trade areas that serve the interests of both the United \n     States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (5) focusing on countries committed to accountable \n     government, economic reform, and the eradication of poverty;\n       (6) strengthening and expanding the private sector in sub-\n     Saharan Africa;\n       (7) supporting the development of civil societies and \n     political freedom in sub-Saharan Africa; and\n       (8) establishing a United States-Sub-Saharan African \n     Economic Cooperation Forum.\n\n     SEC. 104.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``United States-Caribbean \n     Basin Trade Enhancement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (referred to \n     in this title as ``CBERA'') represents a permanent commitment \n     by the United States to encourage the development of strong \n     democratic governments and revitalized economies in \n     neighboring countries in the Caribbean Basin.\n       (2) Thirty-four democratically elected leaders agreed at \n     the 1994 Summit of the Americas to conclude negotiation of a \n     Free Trade Area of the Americas (referred to in this title as \n     ``FTAA'') by the year 2005.\n       (3) The economic security of the countries in the Caribbean \n     Basin will be enhanced by the completion of the FTAA.\n       (4) Offering temporary benefits to Caribbean Basin \n     countries will enhance trade between the United States and \n     the Caribbean Basin, encourage development of trade and \n     investment policies that will facilitate participation of \n     Caribbean Basin countries in the FTAA, preserve the United \n     States commitment to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries, \n     help further economic development in the Caribbean Basin \n     region, and accelerate the trend toward more open economies \n     in the region.\n       (5) Promotion of the growth of free enterprise and economic \n     opportunity in the Caribbean Basin will enhance the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (6) Increased trade and economic activity between the \n     United States and Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries will \n     create expanding export opportunities for United States \n     businesses and workers.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) offer Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries willing to \n     prepare to become a party to the FTAA or a comparable trade \n     agreement, tariff treatment essentially equivalent to that \n     accorded to products of NAFTA countries for certain products \n     not currently eligible for duty-free treatment under the \n     CBERA; and\n       (2) seek the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary \n     countries in the FTAA or a trade agreement comparable to the \n     FTAA at the earliest possible date, with the goal of \n     achieving full participation in such agreement not later than \n     2005.\n\n     SEC. 203.

SELYA\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, for the past 5\\1/2\\ years, Judge \nBruce Selya has served as Board Chairman of the Lifespan hospital \nsystem, a network of five hospitals in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. \nAfter an impressive tenure, he is stepping down from that post this \nweek.\n  As a United States Appeals Court Judge for the First Circuit, Judge \nSelya already has heavy responsibilities. Nevertheless, he approached \nthis unpaid position with great energy and determination. He has been \nactively engaged in the health care debates in my state.\n  Indeed, he was one of the chief architects of the Lifespan system, \nhelping to bring about the initial merger between Rhode Island Hospital \nand Miriam Hospital in 1994. As Chairman, he oversaw the addition of \nBradley Hospital, Newport Hospital, and Boston's New England Medical \nCenter to the system. Together, those five hospitals offer more than \n1,600 beds. In 1998, they discharged more than 60,000 patients and \ntreated nearly 200,000 emergency room visitors.\n  Presumably, any one or more of these facilities might have been \nacquired by an out-of-state hospital network, reducing them to \n``satellite'' status and moving the decision-making authority out of \nRhode Island. Thanks to Judge Selya's leadership and foresight, \nhospital decisions affecting quality of care for Rhode Islanders are \nstill made within my state's borders.\n  These past five years have been tumultuous times for the hospital \nindustry, marked by changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and \ndifficulties in the private health insurance market. Judge Selya \nrecognized these challenges as they came along, and he has been \nresponsive to them.\n  And so, Mr. President, I want to salute Judge Selya for his long-\nstanding commitment to quality health care for the people of Rhode \nIsland. Bruce is a good friend and a long-time supporter, going back to \nbefore my first campaign for Governor in 1962. I look forward to \ncontinuing our close association in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13062-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13062-S13063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           A SALUTE TO MEDAL OF FREEDOM RECIPIENT EVY DUBROW\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my \nfriend, Evelyn Dubrow, who recently received the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom. Unfortunately, a previous commitment prevented me from joining \nEvy's many friends and admirers at the ceremony, but I want to commend \nher on receiving the nation's highest civilian honor bestowed by the \nUnited States Government.\n  President Kennedy established the Presidential Medal of Freedom award \nin 1963 to honor persons who have made\n\n[[Page S13063]]\n\nespecially meritorious contributions to the security or national \ninterests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other \nsignificant private or public endeavors. There is not a more deserving \nrecipient of this award than Evy Dubrow. As founder of the Coalition of \nLabor Union Women and Americans for Democratic Action, she tackled \ndifficult issues from fair trade to civil rights. As legislative \ndirector of UNITE and its predecessor, the International Ladies' \nGarment Workers Union, Evy spent her career fighting not only for labor \nrights, but for individual rights and humanity. She is by far one of \nthe best I have had the pleasure to know and to work with.\n  Mr. President, I ask that President Clinton's remarks upon the \npresentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Evelyn Dubrow be \nprinted in the Record:\n\n       Evy Dubrow came to Washington more than 40 years ago, ready \n     to do battle for America's garment workers--and do battle she \n     did. When it came to the well-being of workers and their \n     families, this tiny woman was larger than life. The halls of \n     Congress still echo with the sound of her voice, advocating a \n     higher minimum wage, safer work places, better education for \n     the children of working families. And in opposition, to \n     President Ford and me, she also was against NAFTA.\n       No matter how divisive the issue, however, Evy always \n     seemed to find a way to bring people together, to find a \n     solution. As she put it, there are good people on both sides \n     of each issue. And she had a knack for finding those people.\n       By the time she retired two years ago, at the age of 80, \n     she had won a special chair in the House Chamber, a special \n     spot at the poker table in the Filibuster Room and a special \n     place in the hearts of even the most hard-bitten politicians \n     in Washington; even more important, for decades and decades, \n     she won victory after victory for social justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13063-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13063-S13064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A LESSON LEARNED THE HARD WAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \nreveal yet another tragedy in my state. Early this week, in the \ndormitories of Kalamazoo College, a 20 year old student allegedly shot \nand killed his former girlfriend, before turning the gun on himself and \ncommitting suicide. Now, two students are dead, and the relatively \nsmall campus in Kalamazoo is in deep shock over the loss of their \nfellow classmates.\n  The apparent murder-suicide was announced in a campus-wide email, \nsent to all students to inform them that classes and school events \nwould be canceled, trained counselors would be on hand, and a mass \ngrieving assembly would take place on the campus quadrangle. To many, \nsuch an announcement must have seemed like a terrible nightmare. But \nstudents soon realized that this tragedy was not a dream and this week \nthey have been trying to make sense of such senseless violence.\n  This week, students are being taught the most valuable lesson they'll \never learn in college. Unfortunately, it's a lesson learned the hard \nway. What they will take away from this tragedy is the knowledge that \nguns can destroy innocent lives and devastate families; guns can result \nin pain, suffering, and loss of quality of life; and gun violence will \ncontinue to be a reoccurring nightmare for our young people unless \nCongress controls the easy access of guns among minors.\n  I ask that an article about this tragedy be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Kalamazoo Gazette, Oct. 19, 1999]\n\n   K-College Students Search for Answers--Murder-Suicide Leaves Many \n             Wondering What They Could Have Done to Stop It\n\n                     (By Lynn Turner and Mark Fisk)\n\n       The students came in groups of two or 10, quietly walking \n     toward ``The Quad'' of Kalamazoo College just before noon on \n     Monday.\n       By the time college President James Jones stepped to the \n     portable podium on the east end of the grassy clearing, more \n     than 300 students had gathered--eerily silent--to hear words \n     that, maybe, would answer the question ``Why?''\n       Why had junior Neenef Odah, 20, a computer science major, \n     shot sophomore Margaret Wardle, 19, to death and then turned \n     the shotgun on himself in an apparent murder-suicide?\n       Could others have recognized some sign and stopped the \n     carnage?\n       ``There is, to date, not a single indication that any of us \n     could have foreseen what was festering in Neenef's mind and \n     what drove him in the end to commit such a deed,'' Jones said \n     as an occasional sob was heard from those at the gathering. \n     ``I ask you, therefore, on this serene quad, on this autumnal \n     day, not to second-guess yourself.\n       ``We shall not succeed today to make any sense of this \n     endless night and their senseless deaths. All we mortals can \n     do is hold tight to each other.''\n       After Jones ended his 15-minute speech and walked away, the \n     students continued to stand and sit in a ragged semicircle \n     until some began shifting, forming knots of hugging students \n     who cleared away each other's tears.\n\n\n                        jealousy possible motive\n\n       Witnesses told police they heard a heated argument coming \n     from within Odah's dorm room in DeWaters Hall around midnight \n     Monday.\n       ``They heard a female yelling, then some loud bangs,'' said \n     Capt. Jerome Bryant of the Kalamazoo Department of Public \n     Safety.\n       If Odah planned the shooting, he kept his intentions \n     private. Several students told the Kalamazoo Gazette there \n     were no warning signs that Wardle's life was in danger.\n       Police combing the school for clues also came up empty-\n     handed.\n       Even talks with Wardle's mother and stepfather, and Odah's \n     father on Monday shed no light on any problems between the \n     two, Jones said.\n       Jealousy is considered the prime motive in the incident. \n     The two had dated on and off for the past year.\n       ``There was a homecoming dance over the weekend in which \n     both people were in attendance,'' Bryant said. ``She was \n     dancing with another K-College student and possibly this is \n     what invoked his rage.''\n       The weapon used was a bolt-action shotgun, Bryant said. \n     Wardle was shot at least twice.\n       ``He had purchased it legally from a Kalamazoo-area gun \n     dealer earlier this month,'' Bryant said.\n\n\n                             Sorting it out\n\n       About 25 minutes after the meeting, about 100 students \n     remained in the quad. The mood remained heavy despite the \n     sunshine.\n       The Rev. Ken Schmidt, pastor of St. Thomas More Student \n     Parish, and pastoral team member Andy Lothschultz wandered \n     among the students, offering hugs and shoulders on which to \n     cry.\n       ``I don't have anything to tell them that can make sense of \n     something that doesn't make much sense,'' Schmidt said. ``All \n     I can do is listen and help them to process it for \n     themselves.''\n       Jessie Sheidt, finance director for K-College's Student \n     Commission, was one of those trying to make sense of things. \n     Although she didn't know either student directly, Sheidt \n     said a friend of hers was a friend of Wardle's.\n       ``There's a total trust between students on this campus,'' \n     she said of the 1,300-member student body.\n       Bad things don't happen here, she said. At least they're \n     not supposed to.\n       Simone Lutz, president of the Student Commission, said that \n     belief was the topic at hand during early morning meetings \n     she had with students.\n       ``We all think it doesn't happen here, but in all reality \n     it does,'' she said.\n       But it hasn't shattered the bonds between students.\n       ``The cocoon is still very much intact,'' Lutz said. ``When \n     something happens, we all come together. It develops a much \n     closer bond to see people out here who care so much about the \n     people who we've lost. . . . It's amazing, and I think it's \n     an incredibly heartwarming thing.''\n\n\n                       Zero tolerance for weapons\n\n       During a media briefing following Jones' speech at the \n     quad, his patience slipped--showing the toll of the previous \n     12 hours--when he was asked what, if any, new information he \n     had.\n       ``We don't know any more than we knew this morning,'' he \n     said curtly. ``We have two dead students and a grieving \n     campus.''\n       Outside counselors are augmenting the college's staff at \n     residence halls and Stetson Chapel, he said.\n       When asked about the weapon used in the apparent murder-\n     suicide, Jones said that neither he nor Odah's roommate had a \n     clue as to when it came into the dorm room or how long it had \n     been there.\n       The roommate, who has not been identified except as a \n     Hornet football player, was working in the college's ceramics \n     studio at the time of the incident. He, along with two suite-\n     mates, have been moved to new quarters, Jones said.\n       K-College has long had a zero tolerance policy for having \n     weapons on campus, including weapons used as theatrical and \n     sports-related equipment, said Marilyn LaPlante, a vice \n     president there. This fall it became the basis for \n     suspension.\n       Jones called for tighter gun control measures during his \n     talk to students.\n       ``I wish every congressman in Washington who has taken a \n     position against gun control could walk on this campus this \n     tragic day,'' he said. ``I would imagine that a moment or two \n     here would drive them to change the laws of the land tomorrow \n     morning.''\n       Wardle showed much promise.\n       Although few could make sense of Monday's tragic events, \n     everyone agreed that Wardle was a young woman full of \n     potential.\n       A science teacher called the National Honor Society member \n     one of two of the most intelligent students he'd encountered.\n       Plainwell High School Principal Linda Iciek called her ``a \n     lovely young woman of character . . . an outstanding student \n     who will be missed by students and staff alike.''\n\n[[Page S13064]]\n\n       Little is known of Odah. Jones said Odah was not an athlete \n     on any school team. He didn't have information regarding any \n     of Odah's extracurricular activities.\n       Sarah Ayres, Wardle's best friend, said Wardle was good at \n     ``anything she did.\n       ``She was really smart, she was top-notch, but she was so \n     modest she would never flaunt it,'' Ayres said. ``She was the \n     kind of person that had great things coming.''\n       Ayres and her boyfriend had gone on a double date with \n     Wardle and Odah, but saw nothing to lead her to believe their \n     relationship would end in violence.\n       ``He seemed like a normal person and she never said \n     something'' to indicate anything was wrong, Ayres said. ``I \n     think he was thinking it was more serious than she did. She \n     broke it off with him this year and started going out with \n     other people this summer. . . . I know he wanted her back the \n     whole time.''\n       Ayres' father had the task of informing his daughter of the \n     deaths by telephone Monday.

Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to \nthose of millions of New Yorkers to thank two treasured teams for a \nmost memorable baseball season in the Empire State. We seldom enjoy \nsuch sweet success from both our major league teams, and in this regard \nour season has been unique. Our revered Bronx Bombers competed in \ntypical Yankee fashion and have earned yet another World Series berth: \ntheir third in four years, 36th of the century. Meanwhile, our equally \ncherished Mets brought us an emotionally-lifting season and for a \nremarkable month faithfully lived up to their moniker ``The Amazin's.'' \nEach team achieved its success with character and class, and I would \nlike to speak on these attributes.\n  This year's Mets provided us with a look into the gloried past as \nthey continually conjured up wins worthy of the fabled '69 Miracle \nMets. The last month of the season was a window into the Mets heart and \nsoul, the view enthralling. Each time their prospects dimmed the \ngentlemen from Queens rose to the challenge. From a one-game playoff to \nenter the Division Series, to the final 26 roller-coaster innings of \ngames five and six of the National League Championship Series, the \nAmazin's captivated New York with their relentless play.\n  These victories were earned by a collection of individuals \nepitomizing all that makes New York great. Al Leiter's pivotal shutout \nof the Reds advanced New York to the Division Series. Todd Pratt, \nsubstituting for the mighty Mike Piazza, won the Division Series with a \nstorybook home run. Rookie Melvin Mora led the Mets in hitting in the \nNLCS. Perhaps the ultimate New York moment was Robin Ventura's ``Grand \nSingle'' in the bottom of the 15th inning of Game 5 to win. Together, \nthese players captivated us for a month of remarkable baseball. No game \nwas out of reach and we watched in awed appreciation. Unfortunately, \neven these Miracle Mets reached the end of the road, a mere two wins \nshy of the World Series. But there is great pride in New York today for \nthese Mets have soared.\n  We are blessed with another baseball team in New York. The Yankees \nare the greatest franchise in the history of sports and this season \nthey have continued to meet their own lofty standards. Their quiet \nconfidence and unassailable professionalism have powered them to a \nrematch with their 1996 World Series opponents, the Atlanta Braves. \nThis matchup will determine who is the best team of the '90's and there \nis little doubt that the Yankees will bring their best to this pursuit.\n  The character of the Yankee team is unassailable. Joe Torre has \nfashioned a team in his own typically modest image. When an early \nseason bout with cancer stole Torre from the team the Yanks rallied \naround their manager and maintained the unity that he created. This \ntoughness of character was displayed throughout the season and into the \nplayoffs. Paul O'Neill's gritty play with a broken rib best exemplifies \nthe type of play the Yankees have given for Torre. With the dominance \nof ``El Duque'' Orlando Hernandez and Mariano Rivera the Yankees \nintimidated the Rangers and defeated the Red Sox. And of course the \nperpetually unflappable Ramiro Mendoza was pivotal in carrying us in \ntimes of trouble. With this team effort the Yankees have given Torre \ntheir best. It is with great anticipation that we look forward to the \nYankees picking up the banner for the honor of New York.\n  Near the end of the regular season, as the Mets prospects looked \nbleak, one Atlanta player uncharitably suggested that New York fans \nshed their loyalty for the Mets and give their allegiance to the \nYankees. The Mets very nearly proved this player wrong.\n  With great charity a united New York responds; Chipper, we'll see you \nin the Bronx.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13064-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF TREATMENT OF CERTAIN \n                   INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING FIRMS.\n\n       Section 206(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (8 U.S.C. \n     1101 note) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Clarification of Treatment of Certain International \n     Accounting and Management Consulting Firms.--In applying \n     sections 101(a)(15)(L) and 203(b)(1)(C) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act, and for no other purpose, in the case of \n     a partnership that is organized in the United States to \n     provide accounting or management consulting services and that \n     markets its accounting or management consulting services \n     under an internationally recognized name under an agreement \n     with a worldwide coordinating organization that is \n     collectively owned and controlled by the member accounting \n     and management consulting firms or by the elected members \n     (partners, shareholders, members, employees) thereof, an \n     entity that is organized outside the United States to provide \n     accounting or management consulting services shall be \n     considered to be an affiliate of the United States accounting \n     or management consulting partnership if it markets its \n     accounting or management consulting services under the same \n     internationally recognized name directly or indirectly under \n     an agreement with the same worldwide coordinating \n     organization of which the United States partnership is also a \n     member. Those partnerships organized within the United States \n     and entities organized outside the United States which are \n     considered affiliates under this subsection shall continue to \n     be considered affiliates to the extent such firms enter into \n     a plan of association with a successor worldwide coordinating \n     organization, which need not be collectively owned and \n     controlled.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering is a minor, \ntechnical clarification to the L visa program. The L visa is a \ntemporary, nonimmigrant visa allowing a U.S. company which is part of \nan international business to make intra-company transfers from overseas \nof foreign executives, managers, and employees with specialized \nknowledge to America. In 1990, Congress clarified that international \naccounting firms and their related management consulting practices \nwould be able to use the L visas. This specific provision in the \nImmigration Act of 1990 was thought necessary by Congress because, for \nlegal and historical reasons, international accounting firms and their \nmanagement consulting businesses are not organized the same way most \ninternational corporations are organized. The laws of various foreign \ncountries relating to the accounting profession have caused the \ninternational accounting and associated management consulting \nbusinesses to be generally organized as partnerships held together by \ncontracts with a worldwide coordinating organization. The INS \nregulations reflect congressional intent to be sure that international \naccounting firms and their associated management consulting businesses \nso organized would not be at a disadvantage under the L visa program. 8 \nCFR Section 214.2(l)(1)(ii)(L)(3).\n  My amendment will make sure that any international management \nconsulting firm that separates from an international accounting firm, \nyet continues to maintain the qualifying worldwide organizational \nstructure, may continue to use the L visa even if it is no longer \nconnected to an accounting firm. Thus, no new category of beneficiaries \nmay use the L visa. On the other hand, no business currently able to \nuse the L visa will lose the right to do so under this amendment, \nincluding management consulting firms which have a relationship with an \ninternational accounting firm or which are organized in a more typical \ninternational corporate structure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be \nagreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, as amended, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 441), as amended, was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13065-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1771\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Eaton, of the District of Columbia, to be a \n     Judge of the United States Court of International Trade.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I must say how delighted I am that the \nSenate has just confirmed Richard K. Eaton to be a Judge of the United \nStates Court of International Trade. I have known Dick for nearly a \nquarter-century: he volunteered to work on my first campaign for the \nUnited States Senate in 1976. I was so impressed with his abilities, I \nasked him to run my Oneonta office. Later, he ran my New York City \noffice. Then he moved to Washington to serve as my legislative director \nand--on two separate occasions--as my chief of staff.\n  Dick Eaton lives in Georgetown with his wife Susan Henshaw Jones and \ntheir two delightful daughters, Alice\n\n[[Page S13066]]\n\nand Liza. He is a partner in the New York law firm of Stroock & Stroock \n& Lavan, LLP. He was also a partner in Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & \nFerdon. His practice has been varied, but includes work on some of the \nlargest offerings of municipal securities in American history and \nappearances on behalf of clients in civil lawsuits in both State and \nFederal Courts.\n  I suppose I have always thought of Dick as a judge. Before he joined \nmy staff he was--at the tender age of 26--the Village Justice of \nCooperstown, New York. I know I have always benefitted from his wise \ncounsel with regard to matters large and small, professional and \npersonal. I can tell you that he has the requisite qualities to make a \nfine judge: a respect for all points of view, extraordinarily good \nsense, an evenness of temperament, patience, intellectual agility, and \nabsolute integrity.\n  Mr. President, Richard Eaton's greatest contribution to the \nadministration of Justice may be that, since 1977, he has been the \nanchor of my committee that screens candidates for recommendation for \nFederal District Court and United States Attorney nominations. Dick now \nserves as chairman of the committee which--in our view at least--serves \nas a model for other States. Ours was the first such committee to \nproceed on a non-partisan basis. New York University Law School \nProfessor Stephen Gillers put it this way:\n\n       In most places, lawyers who count, who want to be judges, \n     become politically active. In New York, lawyers who want to \n     be Federal trial judges complete a twelve-page questionnaire \n     containing thirty-seven questions. An eleven-member panel \n     screens applicants and recommends nominees. .  .  . Who have \n     been Moynihan's nominees? .  .  . They are a first-rate \n     group, as might be expected from the process that produced \n     them.\n\n  No one deserves more credit for the committee's work than Dick. I \nknow that a great number of Federal judges in New York can attest to \nthe value of his counsel, so indispensable during the nomination and \nconfirmation process, which often can be quite torturous. I daresay it \nis only fitting that Dick should himself join the Federal bench.\n  International trade litigation is a subject requiring intelligence \nand energy. The issues facing the Court of International Trade are \nhugely complex. As Congress prescribed in the Customs Court Act of \n1980, the Court of International Trade has broadened its powers and is \nnow far more capable of providing uniformity in the judicial decision-\nmaking process for import transactions as required under Article I, \nsection 8, of the Constitution. It will require the dedication and \nsurpassing intellect of someone meeting Dick Eaton's high standard to \nsee this job through. The President has shown great wisdom in proposing \nDick for this Court.\n  It would be remiss of me not to thank the Majority and Minority \nLeaders for shepherding this nomination, and the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Judiciary Committee, Senators Hatch and Leahy, for their \ngenerous support. We have confirmed a man of great talent and \nunwavering integrity who will distinguish himself on the bench as he \nhas in every other endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/22/senate-section/article/S13066-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
