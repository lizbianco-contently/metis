Mr. President, this afternoon at 3 o'clock we will begin \ndebate on a farm disaster relief plan that will be offered by Senator \nHarkin, myself, Senators Conrad, Daschle, and others. I think this will \nbe, for those of us from farm country, one of the most important pieces \nof legislation addressed by this Congress this year. I know that unless \none lives on a family farm, it is probably pretty hard to describe the \nfarm crisis, but I thought I would read a couple letters from my \nconstituents in North Dakota.\n  Before I do, I am reminded of the story the former chairman of the \nHouse Agriculture Committee used to tell. Kika de la Garza was his \nname. He used to talk about agriculture and food by telling a story \nabout nuclear submarines. He said he met with all these folks from the \nDefense Department and they told him about the wonders of these nuclear \nsubmarines the United States had. They told him about all of their \nprovisions and all their fuel and their capabilities and their speed \nand their distance. And he said, well, how long can a nuclear submarine \nstay under the sea? And the admiral says: Until the food runs out. It \nwas Kika de la Garza's way of pointing out that food, after all, is the \nessence of most of our existence, and we are a world, a rather fragile, \nlarge globe--as seen by the astronauts who leave our Earth and go into \nspace--of diverse interests, diverse people.\n  However, one thing that seems constant in this world is that we read \nthat so many people go to bed hungry--especially children, but so many \npeople across the world go to bed hungry. Somewhere around half a \nbillion people go to bed with a serious ache in their belly because \nthey do not have anything to eat. Malnutrition and lack of good \nnutrition among billions of others exists around the world.\n  Then we go to the farm belt in the United States where a family is \nstruggling to make a living on the family farm and find that its farmer \nloaded some grain on the truck and took it to the elevator and the \ngrain trade said to the farmer: Your food does not have any value. Our \ngrain trade assesses the value of your food as relatively meaningless. \nThe farmer wonders about that because we live in such a hungry world. \nHow could it be that what we produce in such abundance has no value?\n\n[[Page S9960]]\n\n  That is what our farmers wonder. Let me talk just about these farmers \nin the context of their words. This is a letter from a woman in the \ncentral part of our State whose family farms; she farms. Here is the \nkind of plaintive cry that exists from a proud and hard-working people \nin our country, family farmers who take enormous risks, risk everything \nthey have to try to make a living with seeds they plant in the ground. \nThey do not know whether they will grow; they do not know whether the \nnatural disasters will occur--insects and hail and rain too much, too \nlittle. They don't know what will happen with this money they have \ninvested in the soil. If they finally get their crop and they escape \nall of those problems, they get the crop off the ground and take it to \nthe elevator, they don't know whether there will be a price that allows \nthem to get a return for that crop.\n  Those are the kinds of people who live on our family farms. They are \nthe people who create the backbone of our society in our country. They \nare the people who together build a small community where they trade \nand do business. They build our churches in those communities. They \ncreate charities. They do the things together in a community that we \nforget about sometimes in our country. What is it that makes this \ncountry work at its roots? It is entrepreneurship, it is family \nfarming, it is a sense of community, and it is a sense of sharing.\n  Here is a family farm. This woman says in her letter to me:\n\n       We aren't asking for a free ride, just the possibility of \n     surviving. We are private people and we bear our pain alone, \n     and we don't discuss the true situation out here on the \n     family farm with anybody. Our neighbors are all in the same \n     shape. The spirit of North Dakota will be gone with these \n     people and their farms. We cannot survive without a \n     reasonable income. How much longer will it be before people \n     understand that we are trying to feed our family, and pay for \n     basic necessities? But with today's income we are not saving \n     money for retirement. We are not going on trips. We are not \n     enjoying any of the fruits from our labor. We are slowly but \n     surely going broke.\n\n  A man who lives in southeastern North Dakota on the family farm says:\n\n       It sometimes brings a tear to my eye that maybe in a year, \n     maybe two years, I will not be around in family farming to \n     matter anymore. This won't be easy to explain to my three \n     young daughters. This is where I wanted to bring them up, in \n     a rural setting of life that I was used to and that I \n     understand. If it happens, I hope they read in their history \n     books that it wasn't because their dad was a dumb man. It \n     was because it was caused by policy and giant \n     concentration of companies who want dominance.\n\n  Or, from a woman named Susan, whose letter I have read previously on \nthis floor. She lost her husband, and she had to sell their family \nfarm. Prices had collapsed.\n\n       I had an auction last week to sell the machinery so that I \n     could help pay off some of the debts that incurred after 26 \n     years of farming. I have a 17-year-old son who would not help \n     me prepare for auction and did not even get out of bed the \n     day of the auction sale because he is so heartbroken that he \n     cannot continue to farm this land.\n\n  This is a 17-year-old boy who is not a bad boy. It is just that he \ncouldn't get out of bed to watch the auction sale of his farm because \nhe couldn't bear to see the loss of his dream and his families' dream. \nHe wanted to be a farmer as well.\n  She said:\n\n       My husband was an excellent manager, fully educated. He \n     chose to farm rather than live in a big city. He had a job \n     once with Motorola. He wanted to raise his children in a \n     place with clean air, no crime, and good schools. He worked \n     very hard physically and emotionally to make this farm work. \n     And its failure was no fault of his. Something is seriously \n     wrong with our country when we will sacrifice the family farm \n     for a political system and an entire way of life for hundreds \n     of years.\n\n  Her point is that farmers at this point are not at fault for what is \nhappening. The world is hungry. Most people need food. We raise it in \ngreat abundance, and family farmers are told that what they produce \ndoesn't matter.\n  I would like to use a couple of charts that show the dilemma that \nfamily farmers are facing not only in my State but around the country.\n  I show this chart because some people might wonder, well, what is all \nthis farm crisis about? I ask anyone who looks at this chart--this \nchart shows prices received by farmers for wheat. Most of the farmers \nin my part of the world are wheat farmers. Put minimum wage in this \nchart, if this had happened with the minimum wage; put corporate \nprofits on this chart, if this had happened to corporate profits--what \ndo you think the outcry would be? Put congressional salaries on this \nchart. If this had happened to congressional salaries, what would the \noutcry be?\n  This represents the income farmers are receiving from their products \nwhen the price of every other thing is increasing. The income received \nby farmers is collapsing.\n  For purposes of comparison, let me compare the price of corn and \nwheat with what farmers received for those commodities during the \nmiddle of the Great Depression. With the price adjusted over time, ask \nyourself: What do farmers get now relative to what they got during the \nGreat Depression?\n  Take a look at it in 1998. These are the worst farm prices price \nadjusted for 50 years. Families cannot make a living in this country in \nthese circumstances.\n  I am tempted to go into a long discussion of so-called Freedom to \nFarm. I didn't vote for it. It was a terrible piece of farm \nlegislation. Some loved it. Some voted for it. Some still support it. \nCertainly it has a wonderful name.\n  It reminds me of the people early on who sold insurance. They called \nit ``death insurance.'' Many years ago they sold ``death insurance.'' \nDo you know something? Death insurance didn't have a very good name for \nit. It didn't sell very well. Nobody wanted to buy death insurance. So \nwhat did they do? They changed the name to ``life insurance.'' It is a \nbetter sounding name, and it sold much better.\n\n  So we had a farm bill called Freedom to Farm. What a nice sounding \nname with bankrupt policies that said family farming doesn't matter \nmuch in whatever the market system says with respect to agriculture.\n  There has never been a free market in agriculture, and never will be.\n  Do you think the European countries whose citizens have gone hungry \nwill decide it doesn't matter whether they have family farmers? They \nwill never make that decision. They will always have a farm program \nthat insists on price supports for families on the farms in Europe.\n  The point is that this country has decided by itself that family \nfarming as a concept doesn't matter to its future; that whatever the \nmarket decides is what our future shall be. If the market decides that \ncorporate farms shall farm from California to Maine, so be it.\n  The problem with that is that all across this country we will have \nyardlights turned off and families leaving the farm. The economic \narteries that they provide to the small towns will be closed and dried \nup, and those small towns will be boarded up. The people will be \nleaving small towns. We will see the collapse, the total collapse, of a \nrural lifestyle.\n  The author Critchfield, who was a wonderful, world-wide, world-renown \nauthor, who actually grew up in Fargo, ND, said that family values have \nalways been nurtured on the family farms in this country, and the \nrefreshing small towns rolled to the cities from many family farms. It \nwas always a seedbed of family values of nurturing and helping and \nworking together. We will lose all of that because some people say it \ndoesn't matter.\n  We are having a debate this afternoon at 3 o'clock. It is critically \nimportant. This matters more than most people in this country will ever \nknow. I hope that with my colleagues we can easily pass a disaster bill \nin the first step, and in the second that we can then pass a revision \nof the underlying farm bill, and say to farmers: You have a future. We \nwant to provide you hope and help because we think you matter to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I echo the words of my colleague.\n  I was raised on and continue to be a part of the seventh generation \nArkansas family farm.\n  I think it is so important that we recognize this is an issue--those \nfrom other States, as well as farm States, agricultural-based States--\nand that we can impress upon our colleagues in Washington, D.C. the \ncrisis that our small rural communities and our farming communities are \ngoing through.\n  I will certainly be joining the Senator later on this afternoon in \nthat debate. We need to impress upon people\n\n[[Page S9961]]\n\nthat this is an issue for this country. It is not just agriculture; it \nis a heritage of this country and a heritage of our rural communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S9961-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9961-S9962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SAFE SCHOOLS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on what I think is the \nmost critical as well as the most worthy of issues that we should be \ndealing with in the Senate and the Congress; that is, the emotional \nwell-being of our children. They are truly the fabric of the success of \nour Nation into the next century.\n  All too often we have been through incidents such as Jonesboro, AK, \nas well as Littleton, CO. We like to talk about them and discuss these \nissues and the crises that are going on in our children's minds and in \ntheir souls. But all too often we talk about it, and we seem to forget \nit. We don't do what we really need to be doing on behalf of our \nchildren in this country.\n  Mr. President, the Safe Schools Act of 1999 will provide resources to \npublic schools so they can remain safe and strong cornerstones of our \ncommunities.\n  As we move into the 21st century, we must adapt our approach to \neducation to meet the changing needs of students, teachers and parents \nin these communities.\n  Although I am one of the youngest Members of the Senate, I grew up in \nHelena, Arkansas during what seemed to be a much simpler time--even \nthough we were in the height of de-segregation in the South.\n  Our parents pulled together to make everyone's education experience a \nsuccess. Students came to school prepared to learn. Teachers had \ncontrol of their classroom. The threat of school violence was virtually \nnon-existent.\n  Now, more than twenty years later, things are different.\n  Our children are subjected to unprecedented social stresses including \ndivorce, drug and alcohol abuse, child abuse, poverty and an explosion \nof technology that has good and bad uses.\n  These stresses exhibit themselves in the behavior of teenagers, as \nwell as in our young children. Increasingly, elementary school children \nexhibit symptoms of substance abuse, academic underachievement, \ndisruptive behavior, and even suicide.\n  Too many students bring guns and weapons to school.\n  This is a very complex problem and there is no one single answer. It \nwill take more than metal detectors and surveillance cameras to prevent \nthe tragedies occurring in our schools today. But we must do something. \nWe cannot wait any longer. We have to address this issue now.\n  I believe the Safe Schools Act reflects the needs and wishes of \nstudents, parents, teachers and school administrators. It is the first \nstep toward addressing the emotional well-being of our young people.\n  During my Senate campaign last year, I spent a lot of time listening \nto parents and teachers. From my experience, a lot of the most \neffective solutions being at the local level.\n  This bill incorporates the lessons I have learned from the people of \nmy state who are working on the front lines to educate and care for our \nchildren.\n  First, this bill would provide funds to elementary and secondary \nschools to hire additional mental health professionals.\n  Students today bring more to school than backpacks and lunchboxes. \nMany of them bring severe emotional troubles.\n  It is critical that schools be able to help these students and help \nteachers deal with them. We can possibly prevent a horrific act of \nviolence, and if a disruptive student receives help, his or her teacher \nwill have more control of the classroom in order to instruct all of the \nchildren there to learn.\n  Unfortunately, there are not nearly enough mental health \nprofessionals working in our nation's schools today.\n  The American School Health Association recommends that the student-\nto-counselor ratio be 250:1. In secondary schools, the current ratio is \n513:1. In elementary schools, where the student-to-teacher ratio \nexceeds 1000:1.\n  This is just not acceptable for a country as advanced as ours to not \nbe providing the needs of our children.\n  The second major component of my Safe Schools Act provides funding \nfor after-school and mentoring programs.\n  Many of our children go home to empty houses or spend hours every day \nin poorly supervised settings. Studies show that youth crime peaks \nbetween 3:00 and 7:00 p.m.\n  Local public schools need additional resources so they can establish \nor expand after school and summer programs for children.\n  This is a wonderful chance for the community to get involved. Many \nnon-profit organizations can bring their resources to children in the \nschools and to the community.\n  A variety of organizations can come together to build strong after \nschool and summer programs which enhance the academic work of students \nand provide them with other meaningful activities.\n  Many communities in Arkansas are doing just that.\n  The city of Fort Smith has begun the SPICE Program, which has been \nworking for nine years with adult tutors who help kids after-school \nwith homework, and teach them arts and crafts which keep them out of \ntrouble.\n  In Little Rock, the Camp Aldersgate Youth Initiative encourages \nteenagers to participate in supervised community service activities, \nsuch as tutoring, recreation and conflict management;\n  The Safe Jonesboro Mentoring Program in Jonesboro, Arkansas, brings \nadults from the local business community to Jonesboro High School once \na week to mentor high school student.\n  And these programs are not just being put into place in our larger \ntowns, they're also cropping up in rural communities.\n  In Monticello and six counties throughout Southeast Arkansas, the \nSoutheast Arkansas Foster Grandparents Program has helped improve \nliteracy and reading test scores for hundreds of children. In this \nprogram, senior citizens serve as literacy and reading tours to K-3 \nelementary school students twenty hours a week.\n  The Boys, Girls and Adults Community Development Center in Marvell, a \nSave the Children grantee, has been providing educational, cultural and \nrecreational activities, as well as mentoring for children after \nschool. 60% of the children participating in this program have improved \ntheir grade point average. It works.\n  Studies show that one-on-one attention raises the academic scores of \nchildren and improves their self-esteem. With just a little extra help, \na child who is struggling with reading or math can catch up with the \nhelp of volunteers or mentors and excel.\n  We can utilize organizations like AmeriCorps and our older volunteers \nin the Senior Corps program. Encourage high school students to mentor \nelementary school students who need a little extra attention, to see an \nolder peer being a part of their life makes a difference.\n  The bottom line is we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Good examples \nalready exist in our communities, initiatives like the ones I've \nmentioned today. By providing added resources to the states, we can \nemphasize the successful programs and make them available to more \nstudents.\n  I'm also asking states to inform parents about the quality of public \nschools by issuing a Safe Schools Report Card. My own state of Arkansas \nwill begin releasing a more comprehensive report card next year.\n  All states should collect this information and make it readily \navailable to parents and the community. This information will help \nparents and schools officials better address the most important issues \nat the local level.\n  Above all, we must continue to share information and ideas, to talk \nto one another. Our country cannot possibly meet the challenges of the \n21st century if each community operates in a vacuum and there is no \nmechanism to pass on what is working and what isn't.\n  During the August recess I will hold five ``Back to School'' meetings \nwith students, parents, teachers, school administrators and concerned \ncitizens.\n  These meetings will be a good chance to discuss the various \ncomponents of my Safe Schools Act as well as other important education \nissues like school construction, class size, school discipline and \nparent involvement.\n  I welcome the chance to listen to those who care deeply about our \npublic\n\n[[Page S9962]]\n\nschools and I hope my colleagues will spend some of their time during \nthe recess to do the same.\n  I also hope my colleagues will take the opportunity to review the \ncomponents of this bill. I feel strongly it should be a critical part \nof any federal response to school safety issues. I look forward to its \npassage.\n  This is our opportunity to begin the process that will show our \nchildren we do care about their emotional well being and the future \nsuccess of our nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the last week before we go on \nrecess. We will be gone approximately a month. We will have an \nopportunity to be home, to talk to our constituents about the issues \nthat are here, to talk about what we have done during this calendar \nyear, and talk about what we have not done for this year as well. We \nwill be back, then, the first part of September. We will have, \nprobably, 2 months to continue and to complete our work for this year.\n  There are 13 appropriations bills that must be passed to keep the \nGovernment running. They must be passed by September 30, the end of the \nfiscal year. This is a very difficult task. We are, hopefully, running \non time. We passed eight bills out of the Senate. However, none has yet \nbeen sent to the President. So we will have a couple of months to wind \nup the year's work. I cannot tell you how important it is that we do \ncomplete that work. Of course, the Presiding Officer is the key Senator \nin that regard. He has done a great job.\n  We do not want the President to be able to put us in a position again \nof closing down the Government and blaming the Congress. I hope what we \ndo is get these bills to him. I think we will do that. I cannot help \nbut mention as we think about this a little bit, I hope in Congress we \ntake a look at a biennial budget, as we have in many States--for \ninstance, my home State of Wyoming. The Congress or the legislature \nwould form a budget for a 2-year period of time, which has advantages, \nparticularly for the agencies, and we would have the other year for \noversight, which is equally as important a task for the Congress--to \noversee the expenditure of those dollars. So I hope we are able to do \nthat.\n  This has been a tough year. We have had lots of difficulties, \nstarting, of course, with the impeachment process, which was difficult. \nI don't know that it slowed us up particularly. On the contrary, we did \na lot of committee work during the time the impeachment was going on. \nNevertheless, it was tough. Then came the Colorado Columbine situation, \nof course, the tragedy out there at the school and, with that, the \ngreat controversy over gun control, which we are likely to see again \nnow after the tragedy in Georgia. Then Kosovo was also an issue, of \ncourse, although Congress really was not as involved. It was pretty \nmuch the President on his own, committing troops there. Obviously, we \nwere going to support them.\n  So it has been a difficult year. Despite that, it seems to me we have \naccomplished a great deal. I am a little disappointed that most of the \naccomplishments have been made without the support of the minority. Our \nfriends on the other side have, in fact, opposed nearly everything that \nhas been done--I think, unfortunately, often more to create an issue \nthan to create a solution. That often is the choice we have; you can \ncook up something you can take home to talk about in political \nrhetoric, as opposed to trying to find some solutions.\n  But we have accomplished a great deal. Much of the controversy will \ncontinue, I suppose. There are legitimate differences of view when we \nare on the floor on almost every issue. Generally, the issue is the \nlarger issue of whether or not you want more and more Federal \nGovernment, more and more Federal regulation, more and more taxes--\nwhich is basically Senators on that side of the aisle as opposed to \nthis side of the aisle, where we are looking for limited government, \nwhere we are looking for less regulation, where we are looking for an \nopportunity for people to spend more of their own money.\n\n  So basically, when you get down to it in almost all these issues, if \nyou really pare it away, that is the debate. Legitimate? Yes, indeed, \nit is legitimate. I happen to be on the side of being more \nconservative, of thinking we ought to be moving more and more of these \ndecisions back to the States and to the counties rather than deciding \neverything, one-size-fits-all, at the Federal level. But these are the \ndifferences, and they are the basis for most of the things we find in \nconflict. We have had less cooperation from the administration than I \nhad hoped we would have, from that side of the aisle. I think the \nPresident is seeking to change his image so the politics become more \nimportant than the movement of the congressional budget.\n  Let's review some of the highlights. The most recent one, of course, \nis the passage of tax relief, something I think is very legitimate, \nperfectly logical. We went through great debates about it, of course. \nOne of the keys, naturally, is that you have to talk about reduction of \ntaxes after having done something to save Social Security, having done \nsomething to strengthen Medicare. That is part of the program. That is \nnot the choice.\n  We see these polls that are run from time to time. They say: Would \nyou rather have Social Security protected or would you rather have tax \nrelief? That is not the issue. That is one of the things we worked at. \nAll of us are setting aside this surplus that comes from Social \nSecurity for the preservation of Social Security. These funds which \nwill be used to reduce taxes and give some tax relief are beyond that.\n  I think one of the best illustrations is the Member who had three \ndollars--three dollar bills. This is basically the surplus we are \nlooking at in the next 10 years, $3 trillion, each of these. Two of \nthem are being set aside for Social Security. Tax relief constitutes \nabout 75 percent of the third one, with the additional amount of the \nthird one being set aside for spending and for Medicare. The press has \nnot been very helpful, of course, trying to get that understanding. But \nin any event, I think that is a real movement forward.\n  The thing one also has to keep in mind is, if there is money lying \naround here, it is going to be spent. It is going to be spent enlarging \nFederal Government. So if you go back to that original thesis, you go \nback to the original notion that you would like to move activities back \ncloser to people, you do it that way rather than bringing more and more \nmoney here that inevitably will be spent increasing the size of \nGovernment.\n  I think we have some hope there. Both Houses have passed some tax \nrelief. We will see if we can find a way to put that together, \nhopefully this week. Then it will be up to the President to say whether \nhe wants to spend more and more money, wants to spend $1 trillion on 81 \nnew programs, or let the American people have an opportunity to spend \nsome of their own.\n  Education? Our position again has been that the decisions that are \nbasic to elementary and secondary education ought to be made closest to \nthe people. They ought to be made by the States and by the school \nboards. Sure, we have an obligation to provide some financial help, but \nthe Ed-Flex program that was passed by this Senate allows those \ndecisions to be made more at home.\n  I can tell you, the delivery of education is quite different in \nWyoming or different in Alaska, the State of the Presiding Officer, \nfrom what it is in New York--and properly so. But to make that work, \nthen, the local people have to have that opportunity. We have done that \nwith Ed-Flex, and we had some other educational programs.\n\n[[Page S9963]]\n\n  I feel fairly strongly about some of the Federal involvement. My wife \nis a teacher. She teaches special ed and spends almost half of her time \non paperwork because of the kinds of Federal programs that are \ninvolved. So we are making some movement to change that.\n  The military fulfills what is obviously one of the principal, if not \nthe principal, obligations of the Federal Government, to provide for \nthe safety and protection and defense of this country. Over the last \nnumber of years, the administration has increasingly reduced the amount \nof resources there. At the same time, we had more demands on the \nmilitary than we had before. They are not able to conduct their mission \non the amount of resources that have been available. I was very \ndisappointed it took a congressional committee to press and push and \ndemand from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to really get down to whether \nthey are able to carry out their mission with the resources they have. \nThe answer was no. So we have moved to make some additions to that, in \nthe first step for a very long time.\n  The other thing is, if you are going to have a voluntary force, you \nhave to make it fairly attractive to be in the military, and after \nhaving trained people to do technical things like flying airplanes or \nservicing airplanes, they have to stay in the service and do that. So \nwe need more of that kind of support.\n  Social Security? For a very long time no one would talk about Social \nSecurity. It is the third rail of politics--touch it and you are dead. \nNow, finally, everyone does understand that you have to do something \ndifferent if, indeed, your purpose is to maintain the benefits that are \nnow going to beneficiaries and to provide an opportunity for young \npeople, who are beginning to work and put their money into the fund, to \nhave some anticipation of having benefits for themselves.\n  We have to make some changes. The sooner those changes are made the \nless severe they will have to be.\n  The President has been talking about saving Social Security for \nseveral years. He has no plan. He has done nothing except talk about \nit. We now have a plan. There is a bipartisan plan on this floor. There \nhas been a lockbox amendment to preserve Social Security funds. It has \nbeen opposed on the other side of the aisle five times, but we are \ngoing to move forward on Social Security.\n  VA funding: The administration has for several years requested a flat \nbudget for VA health care but at the same time has expanded the \neligibility for people to utilize those facilities. We find, for \ninstance, in my State we have two facilities, but they are \nunderfinanced and are not providing the kinds of services to which \nveterans are entitled. More money needs to be provided, and we are \ngoing to do that. The Republican budget this year had an additional \n$1.7 billion for veterans' health. It is something that is very \nimportant.\n  Patients' Bill of Rights: We passed a Patients' Bill of Rights that \ndid not involve the Federal Government, did not involve lawyers and the \ncourts making the decisions but indeed guaranteed emergency services \nwithout having to go through some kind of clearance. It guaranteed, if \nyou felt as if you were not getting the services, an appeal to a \nphysician, not to a lawyer or to a court, and that was passed.\n  Medicare: We moved to doing something with Medicare. A bipartisan \ncommission was set up and they have a reasonable plan for Medicare, but \nthe President asked his folks whom he appointed to serve on that \ncommission to vote against it, so it did not come out as a commission \nreport and as a commission recommendation. We are going to take that, \nbasically, and move forward and do something on Medicare.\n  We are moving toward the end. We have some very difficult issues to \ndeal with, particularly in appropriations. We have to deal with them. \nWe will deal with them. I am hopeful we will also have some kind of a \nrelief valve so that if we get through and cannot come to an agreement \nwith the President that it goes on as it has and will not let that \npolitical technique be used again. I hope we find a little less \nresistance from our friends on the other side in terms of finding \nsolutions to these problems.\n  I also hope--and this is a philosophy, I admit--that as we go forward \nwe continue to understand the greatness of this country. And it is a \ngreat country. If you have had a chance to travel about a bit, you find \nit is the greatest. Each time I have a chance to go somewhere, I come \nback thanking God this is the place in which I live. But it is a great \ncountry not because of the Federal Government. There is a legitimate \nrole for the Federal Government, of course, described, by the way, in \nthe Constitution, but the real strength of this country lies in its \ncommunities and in its individuals who have the freedom to make \ndecisions for themselves. They have the freedom to get together and do \nthings that are required to be done in their communities to make them \nhealthy.\n  Admittedly, I come from a State that is unique. Maybe we are the \nlowest populated State now. We are one of the largest States. The \ndelivery of services is quite different, whether it be airlines, \nwhether it be electricity, whether it be education. We cannot have this \none-size-fits-all situation.\n  Again, I am pleased with what we have done. I say to the Presiding \nOfficer that he has had one of the most difficult tasks of leadership \nin the Appropriations Committee and has done a good job.\n  I hope we will continue to provide an opportunity for us to come \ntogether to resolve our problems so that we can continue to have the \nopportunity to serve, to let communities make some of their decisions, \nand we will continue to be the greatest country in the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S9963-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9963-S9965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRADE AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN AN ERA OF GLOBALIZATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to talk today about the \nrelationship between trade and the environment.\n  When I joined the Finance Committee in 1979, debate about the Tokyo \nRound was just concluding. I don't remember a single mention of water \npollution, air pollution, or the protection of sea turtles and other \nendangered species--important issues, but they were not part of the \ntrade debate.\n  NAFTA changed this. We negotiated the environmental side agreement, \nand created the North America Commission on Environmental Cooperation. \nThere were flaws and limitations, but it was a turning point.\n  Now, like it or not, environmental issues are an integral part of the \ntrade debate. Environmental group opposition was one of the major \nreasons for the defeat of Fast Track legislation last year. Ambassador \nBarshefsky has said that the next round of trade negotiations should \nexpressly address environmental protection. Two months ago, the WTO \nheld a series of high level roundtable discussions on trade and the \nenvironment, in part to help define the issues for consideration in \nSeattle.\n  Why has this happened?\n  It is partly a function of technology. Environmental groups have \nplugged into the Internet--aggressively. Browse the web sites of almost \nany environmental group, and you will see what I mean. Any citizen can \nfollow a high-level environmental trade dispute on the Internet. The \nheretofore insulated, inaccessible, and arcane international trade \nworld meets the chaotic, grassroots, democratic, and Internet-savvy \nenvironmental world.\n  Let me tell my friends in the trade world something about my friends \nin the environmental world. I have worked with them for years. \nSometimes on the same side, sometimes in disagreement. They are smart, \ndedicated, energetic, and aggressive. And they are very good at using \nthe latest communications technology. So, if you are uncomfortable with \nthe new role of the environmental community in the trade debate, my \nonly advice is: Get used to it and figure out how to work together. The \nsame advice goes to my environmental friends: The trade folks are here \nto stay. Figure out how to work with them.\n  There's a second important reason why environmental protection is now \nan important part of the trade debate.\n  We are in the midst of an economic boom in the United States and the \nrevolution of globalization. Globalization is bringing every classroom \nin every\n\n[[Page S9964]]\n\nsmall western town, and on every Native American reservation, smack \ninto the middle of the information-based global marketplace. It allows \nsmall businesses all over the world to tap into the global marketplace. \nIt's forcing virtually every company to become more competitive.\n  But there's another side to the story. Call it the dark side of \nglobalization. And it has a long history.\n  America's age of industrialization created great wealth and progress. \nBut it left behind a terrible environmental legacy. Rivers so infected \nwith toxic chemicals that they caught fire. Abandoned mine tailings \nthat dot the landscape of the mountainous west. The loss of wetlands \nand other habitat necessary to sustain the animal and plant species \nupon which our survival depends.\n\n  In America, we have turned the tide. Our air and water are cleaner \nnow. But we have seen what unchecked economic development did to us.\n  Extend that kind of growth worldwide. And pick up the pace, to \nreflect the hyper-speed of global competition. As globalization \naccelerates, along with the expanded trade that accompanies and fuels \nit, we are likely to see a rapid increase in environmental problems.\n  Tom Friedman puts it this way, in The Lexus and the Olive Tree:\n\n       [globalization has] unleashed forest-crushing forces of \n     development . . . which, if left unchecked, [has] the \n     potential to destroy the environment and uproot cultures, at \n     a pace never before seen in human history.\n\n  Let me give you two examples.\n  For years, Montanan and other U.S. softwood lumber producers have \nbeen fighting against subsidized Canadian imports. One continuing issue \nis Canada's relatively weak environmental standards for timber \nharvesting. Canada has no law, at the federal or provincial level, like \nour Endangered Species Act.\n  This gives Canadian producers an economic advantage over U.S. \nproducers. It also can have a serious environmental effect. In Montana, \nwe're struggling to protect the Bull Trout, which is listed as an \nendangered species. One of the biggest populations resides in Lake \nKookanusa, just south of the Canadian border. In the spring, the fish \nswim up Wigwam Creek, across the border in British Columbia, to spawn.\n  Recently, British Columbia announced a program of aggressive timber \nharvesting in the Wigwam Basin. Maybe things will work out, and the \nharvesting will occur in a way that does not threaten the Bull Trout. \nBut, if not, our efforts to protect an endangered species in this \ncountry will be undermined because of another developed country's \nenvironmental laws that are deliberately weak to support an industry \ninterest.\n  Or consider the objectives of the Endangered Species Act which \nincludes preserving biodiversity, the web of life that sustains us. \nWe're losing species at an alarming speed--perhaps a thousand times the \nnatural rate.\n  No matter how strictly we protect species here in the United States, \nif the South American rain forest continues to disappear at the current \nrate, all of our efforts will have been futile.\n  The message is simple. Globalization and expanded trade benefit us. \nBut we must ensure that globalization and expanded trade are conducted \nin a way that enhances, and does not undermine, environmental \nprotection.\n  One thing that worries my greatly is the polarization that has \noccurred among participants in the trade and environment debate. The \nmiddle ground seems to have fallen into a sink hole. Yet the middle is \nwhere we need people to find solutions to these very difficult \nproblems.\n  Let's turn to the next round of multilateral trade negotiations that \nwill be the subject of the WTO Ministerial in Seattle in late November. \nWe must accommodate globalization and expanded trade while, at the same \ntime, preserve and enhance environmental protection.\n  America must lead. We are the world's largest economy. We are the \nworld's largest trader. And we are the world's leader in developing \nstrong environmental laws. As in many different areas, if we don't \nexert leadership, no one else will. This is not arrogance. This is not \nunilateralism. This is leadership, and I offer no excuses and no \napologies for it.\n  I believe that we must follow three broad precepts in developing the \nproper linkage between trade and the environment. Call these my ``Three \nNo's''.\n  Trade liberalization must not harm the environment: Trade rules must \nnot be used to stop legitimate and reasonable environmental protection; \nEnvironmental regulations must not be used as an instrument for trade \nprotection that closes markets and distorts trade flows.\n  We need to balance trade and environmental goals and prevent trade \nand environmental abuses. So, let me turn to my agenda for trade and \nthe environment in the next round of trade negotiations.\n  First, the WTO dispute resolution process must be made more open, \ntransparent and publicly accessible. This is important in the context \nof environmental law and regulation, which relies heavily on citizen \nsuits and the public's right to know. And it is important in the \ncontext of the WTO's credibility. Secrecy does not enhance respect and \nconfidence in institutions.\n  The GATT was created in an era when nation-states were the only \nsignificant actors on the world scene. The WTO followed the same \nstructure. But it does not reflect today's reality where non-\ngovernmental entities have become important international and national \nplayers. The rules and procedures must accommodate these new actors.\n  The dispute settlement process takes too much time and must be \nshortened significantly. Loopholes that allow delay in complying with \ndecisions must be closed.\n  Second, the Administration must conduct an environmental assessment \nfor the trade agreement that will emerge from the new round. I will \nintroduce legislation soon requiring such a review.\n  Third, we should eliminate all tariffs on environmental goods and \nservices. One important way to improve environmental conditions in \nother countries, especially in developing countries, is to reduce the \ncost of environmental technology--everything from the elements of a \nsewage treatment plant to catalytic converters to groundwater \nbioremediation technology. U.S. companies are leaders in this field, so \nreduced tariffs will have the added advantage of increasing U.S. \nexports.\n  My fourth item involves environmentally harmful subsidies. In some \ncases, like fishing and agriculture, excessive subsidies lead to \npractices that are both economically and environmentally harmful. By \nlimiting such subsidies, we can achieve a ``win-win,'' that makes good \neconomic and good environmental sense. I would like to see the total \nelimination of fishing subsidies. Export subsidies for agriculture \nshould be eliminated worldwide. We should also start looking seriously \ninto the reduction of domestic agricultural subsidies throughout the \nworld.\n  The fifth item relates to other subsidies--the so-called ``pollution \nsubsidy'' where intentionally keeping environmental standards weak can \nbe an unfair and unacceptable practice that distorts trade, cuts costs \nof production for the polluter, and makes taxpayers pay the difference \nthrough higher health and environmental cleanup costs.\n  A sub-set of this problem is that of PPMs--production processes and \nmethods. How a product is produced affects the environment. Examples \ninclude the way shrimp harvesting affects sea turtles, and the way \ntimber harvesting affects species, water pollution, and the demand for \nrecycled materials.\n\n  These are complex issues. Some argue that the WTO has already \naccepted the principle that a production process can determine how a \nproduct should be treated. They point out that countries already \ndetermine if an imported product was made with improperly obtained \nintellectual property or with improper government subsidies. If so, \nthose countries can prevent the import of that good because of the \nprocess of production. They argue that if this is the rule under the \nWTO for intellectual property and for subsidies abuses, it should be \nthe rule for environmental processes as well.\n  The WTO needs to take on this set of tough issues that sits clearly \nat the intersection of trade and the environment. We need serious and \nresponsible discussion now.\n\n[[Page S9965]]\n\n  Sixth, the environmental community believes that we need to find a \nway to integrate multilateral trade agreements and multilateral \nenvironmental agreements, MEAs, and they are right. Actions taken under \nan MEA should not be subject to a GATT challenge. There are two ways to \ngo about this. One is to ``grandfather'' specific environmental \nagreements, as we did in NAFTA. We could start out by providing a so-\ncalled ``safe haven'' for the Montreal Protocol and CITES, the \nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna \nand Flora. The other is to describe the characteristics of an MEA that \nwill automatically be protected.\n  Let me add a few other agenda items that are unrelated to my Seattle \nlist but need to be on our ``to do'' list in the United States.\n  First, we should take a hard look at the NAFTA environmental side \nagreement, and see how it is working. I will ask the key Congressional \nCommittees, including the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, to conduct appropriate oversight.\n  Second, we need to improve our domestic trade policy institutions. \nAnd that includes enhancing the role of Congress in trade negotiations. \nLast week, in a speech at the Washington International Trade \nAssociation, I proposed the establishment of a Congressional Trade \nOffice. This office would provide the Congress with additional \nindependent, non-partisan, neutral trade expertise.\n  Its functions would include: monitoring compliance with major \nbilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements; analysis of \nAdministration trade policy, trade actions, and proposed trade \nlegislation; participation in dispute settlement deliberations at the \nWTO and NAFTA, and evaluation of the results of dispute settlement \ncases involving the United States.\n  The National Wildlife Federation and the Sierra Club have proposed \nsuch an office, although the functions in my concept are quite \ndifferent.\n  I will be offering legislation on this later this year.\n  One of the most difficult issues that has arisen in recent years has \nbeen the relationship between trade policy and environmental \nprotection. The lack of consensus on this relationship has been one of \nthe major reasons that we have not been able to proceed with fast track \nlegislation in the Congress.\n  Paralysis helps no one. I hope that the thoughts I have set out today \nfor Seattle and for our own domestic agenda will help to begin a \nconstructive and responsible dialogue between the trade and the \nenvironmental communities. We need trade. We need environmental \nprotection. We need a sustainable earth, and that means a clean world \nand a growing world--more and better jobs everywhere, increased income, \ncleaner air and water, the protection of our natural heritage for \nfuture generations. These goals are only incompatible when people are \nunwilling to talk about them together.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S9965-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is now considering S. \n335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, legislation I \nauthored along with my colleagues, Senator Levin, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Edwards, Senator Durbin, and Senator Specter.\n  S. 335 is the product of an extensive investigation and 2 days of \npublic hearings held by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \nwhich I chair. This legislation would establish for the first time \ntough new Federal standards for sweepstakes and other promotional \nmailings.\n  For example, these mailings would be required to clearly inform \nconsumers that a purchase is not necessary to win the contest and that \na purchase will not increase their chances of winning. In addition to \nthese important consumer protections, the bill confers additional \ninvestigative and enforcement authority on the U.S. Postal Service and \nauthorizes civil fines of up to $2 million for companies that violate \nthe consumer protection standards.\n  This comprehensive measure has the support of the AARP, the National \nConsumers League, and the U.S. Postal Service.\n  I particularly recognize the leadership roles played by several \nmembers of the committee. Senator Levin, in particular, has long been a \nleader in the effort to curtail deceptive mailings. Senator Cochran \nheld some of the first hearings on this issue. Senator Edwards, Senator \nSpecter, and Senator Durbin all contributed greatly to our \ninvestigation.\n  Let me also express my appreciation for the assistance provided by \nthe chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Thompson, \nand by the committee's ranking minority member, Senator Lieberman.\n  In addition, I salute Senator Campbell, who was one of the first to \ncall attention to the growing problems of deceptive sweepstakes \nmailings. Some of the provisions in our legislation are similar to \nthose in a bill introduced by Senator Campbell.\n  I first became aware of the growing problem of deceptive sweepstakes \nlast year after receiving several complaints from my constituents in \nMaine. In order to learn more about this growing problem, the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations began an investigation into the nature \nof deceptive mailings and the extent of sweepstakes and other \npromotional mailings. The subcommittee soon realized that the \npromotional mailing industry generates an enormous volume of mail that \nreaches the mailboxes of millions of Americans. In fact, the four major \nsweepstakes companies alone flood Americans with more than 1 billion \nsolicitations every year.\n  The subcommittee held 2 days of public hearings. At the first \nsubcommittee hearing in March, we examined the practices of the four \nmajor sweepstakes companies: American Family Publishers, Publishers \nClearinghouse; Time, Inc.; and Reader's Digest.\n  I want to make clear that they all run legitimate sweepstakes, \nlegitimate in the sense that they do award the prizes, they do deliver \nthe merchandise orders, and they do not seek to conceal their \nidentities. However, there is a critical distinction between running a \nlegal contest and treating consumers fairly, without resorting to \nmisleading or deceptive practices.\n  Our hearings in March examined the key issue of whether consumers are \nbeing clearly informed that no purchase is necessary to enter \nsweepstakes and that buying something does not increase their chance of \nwinning. That is the biggest misconception. Far too many consumers \nbelieve that if they make a purchase in response to the sweepstakes \nsolicitation, they somehow improve their chances of winning. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. The subcommittee heard testimony \nindicating that the existing disclaimers used by the large sweepstakes \ncompanies are of very little value. They are too often deceptively \nworded or they are contradicted by the glowing promises in the \npromotional copy. In addition, they are hard to locate on the mailing, \nand they are often written in very tiny print that is difficult to \nread.\n\n  Our hearings in March prompted over 1,000 letters from across the \ncountry to the subcommittee. Many of those letters included mailings \nfrom smaller sweepstakes companies with which the subcommittee had not \nbeen familiar. This public response prompted an expansion of the \nsubcommittee's investigation into the deceptive practices of these \nsmaller sweepstakes companies.\n  Those smaller companies were the focus of the subcommittee's second \nhearing in July. Many of these smaller companies tend to be fly-by-\nnight operations that use multiple trade names to hide their identities \nand to confuse consumers. In fact, we found one company that sent out \nsolicitations under 40 different trade names. That was obviously very \nconfusing to consumers because they believed they were getting a chance \nto enter 40 different contests when, in fact, it was just one \nsweepstakes company using 40 different names.\n  In some cases, these smaller companies are run by promoters for a \nyear or two and then shut down. The operator then starts up a new \ncompany under yet another name, often one that is specifically chosen \nto lend credibility to the contest or to deceive consumers. These \ncompanies profit not only from their extremely deceptive mailings but \nalso by reselling the names of their customers to other operators who \nthen inundate the unlucky consumer with still more mailings. \nUnfortunately, our investigation suggests that this practice, this \nbusiness, is quite lucrative.\n  The smaller companies investigated by the subcommittee sent \napproximately 100 million mailings in 1998 and received over 4 million \npurchases, which we conservatively estimate cost consumers in the \nneighborhood of $40 million.\n\n[[Page S9969]]\n\n  In return, most individuals received a discount coupon book that was \nfrequently followed by additional numerous other mailings urging \nconsumers to purchase the exact same coupon book once again.\n  Anonymity, as our hearings demonstrated, is crucial to the success of \nmany of these small operators. They depend on working in the shadows \nand underneath the radar of State and Federal regulators. They are, in \nmany ways, the ``stealth'' sweepstakes companies--difficult to detect, \nto track, and to stop. Our investigation discovered that most of these \ncompanies attempt to conceal their identities through multiple \ncorporate names and various mailbox drops in several different States. \nTheir mailings are often designed to deceive even the most cautious and \nwary consumer.\n  Our investigation and hearings demonstrated that sweepstakes \ncompanies, both large and small, use deceptive and aggressive marketing \ntechniques far too often to entice consumers into making purchases that \nthey do not need or want, in the mistaken belief that a purchase will \nimprove their chances of winning that grand prize. Indeed, we heard \ntestimony that deceptive sweepstakes mailings can induce trusting \nconsumers to purchase thousands of dollars of questionable merchandise. \nOne example that was related to us by a witness was a magazine \nsubscription extending to the year 2018 that had been purchased by her \n82-year-old father-in-law in response to repeated solicitations.\n  The subcommittee found that many of our senior citizens are \nparticularly vulnerable to such deceptive mailings. They come from \nperhaps a more trusting generation. Many seniors tend to believe what \nthey read, particularly if it is endorsed by a trusted spokesman, such \nas Ed McMahon or Dick Clark, or if it comes from a well-known company, \nsuch as Reader's Digest or Time, or if it involves a mailing that \nappears to be official.\n  At the subcommittee's hearings, family members told of loved ones who \nwere so convinced that they had won a sweepstakes that they refused to \nleave their home for fear of missing the Prize Patrol. One of my \nconstituents in Maine actually postponed needed surgery because she was \nabsolutely convinced that that was going to be the day her winnings \nwere delivered to her.\n  The subcommittee investigated many cases of seniors who, enticed by \nthe bold promises in deceptive sweepstakes, actually spent their Social \nSecurity checks, squandered their life's savings, and even borrowed \nmoney in order to continue to make purchases through these sweepstakes \nmailings. I will never forget one of our witnesses who actually broke \ndown in tears before the subcommittee as he recounted how he had been \nenticed to spend $15,000 on merchandise he did not want because he \nthought it would bring him closer to winning millions of dollars.\n  Time and again, family members have described sweepstakes companies \nliterally bombarding elderly relatives with repeated mailings. Our \nwitnesses explained that their elderly family members spent thousands \nof dollars in the vain hope that if they just bought one more trinket, \nor one more videotape, or one more magazine subscription, it would \ngreatly improve their chances of winning. Of course, it never did.\n  The losses suffered by consumers could not, however, be measured in \ndollars alone. As one elderly gentleman put it:\n\n       My wife has finally come to realize that she has been duped \n     by the sweepstakes solicitations for all these years. \n     Although the financial drain is now halted, the loss of \n     her dignity is incalculable.\n\n  Unfortunately, these are not isolated examples. According to a recent \nsurvey commissioned by the AARP, nearly 40 percent of seniors surveyed \nbelieved there was a connection between purchasing and winning, that \neither making a purchase would help you to win or it would ensure that \nyou would win a prize.\n  You have only to look at some of these sweepstakes mailings to \nunderstand why consumers draw these conclusions. For example, one \nmailing by Publishers Clearinghouse, which is famous for its Prize \nPatrol, tells consumers to ``open your door to $31 million on January \n31.'' You can see the personalized mailing, although we blocked out the \nname of the person involved. This mailing clearly suggests to the \nconsumer that his or her--her in this case--purchases are paying off. \nIt specifically states:\n\n       You see, your recent order and entry has proven to us that \n     you're indeed one of our loyal friends and a savvy \n     sweepstakes player. And now I'm pleased to tell you that \n     you've passed our selection criteria to receive this special \n     invitation. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, this is clearly and blatantly designed to deceive the \nconsumers into drawing a connection between making a purchase and \nwinning the prize.\n  Let me show you another example. The next example is a mailing from \nAmerican Family Publishers. It states:\n\n       It's down to a 2 person race for $11 million--you and one \n     other person in Georgia were issued the winning number. \n     Whoever returns it first wins it all.\n\n  Most people don't see the very fine print that declares:\n\n       . . . if you have the winning number.\n\n  Unless the contestant reads and understands this fine print, the \nmailing leaves the unmistakable impression that this recipient, this \nlucky person, and one other person, have the winning number for the $11 \nmillion prize.\n  This mailing actually caused a number of contestants to fly to \nFlorida in the hope that their entry would be received first. After \nall, it says, ``Whoever returns it first wins it all.'' It also \nprompted lawsuits by several States' attorneys general, and American \nFamily Publishers eventually agreed to a multistate settlement.\n  I wish the misleading mailings from the largest sweepstakes companies \nrepresented the worst of the lot. Unfortunately, they do not. Let's \ntake a look at a couple of examples of deceptive practices of some of \nthe smaller sweepstakes companies. As you will recall, these were the \ncompanies that were brought to the subcommittee's attention by outraged \nconsumers from across this country who wrote to us after our first \nround of hearings.\n  This solicitation, or promotion, from Mellon, Astor & Fairweather is \na deceptive attempt to make the consumer think that a prestigious \nfirm--presumably an accounting firm--is ready to give him or her money. \nDespite describing Mellon, Astor & Fairweather as the ``trustee of \nrecord,'' the sponsor of this mailing admitted under oath to the \nsubcommittee that Mellon, Astor & Fairweather is not a trustee for any \ngroup or individual. In fact, there is no ``Mellon,'' ``Astor,'' or \n``Fairweather'' associated with this company. The name was completely \nmade up to give an air of legitimacy and credibility to this mailing--\nin short, to deceive people. Moreover, the sweepstakes promoter \nadmitted that this is actually the address of a Mail Boxes, Etc., and \nthat the company's offices are located not in Lake Forest, IL, but in \nLas Vegas, NV.\n\n  Another problem the subcommittee found was the use of words or \nsymbols that give the impression that the mailing is connected with the \nFederal Government. Here is another example of this kind of mailing. It \nsays at the top--it is hard to read: The Official United Sweepstakes of \nAmerica.\n  Yes, this mailing implies a Government connection to the sweepstakes. \nIt includes a photo of the U.S. Treasury building, and by using the \naddress of 611 Pennsylvania Avenue, Southeast, Washington, DC, it \nsounds like a very prestigious Pennsylvania Avenue address of a Federal \nagency. In fact, once again, this is an address of a Mail Boxes, Etc. \nAnd, of course, the Federal Government does not sponsor sweepstakes, \ncontrary to the implication of this mailing.\n  Yet another deceptive mailing shows how fraudulent operators link \ntheir company to the Government. This is a blowup of a postcard sent to \nme by a constituent from Machiasport, ME. As you can see, it is marked \n``Urgent Delivery, A Special Notification of Cash Currently Being Held \nBy the U.S. Government is Ready for Shipment to You.'' It mimics the \ntypical postcard the Postal Service uses. It is designed to look like \nthat.\n  The mailing asks the consumer to send $9.97 to learn how to receive \nthis cash. Of course, this was not in any way a legitimate postcard \nfrom the Federal Government. It was merely a ploy used by an \nunscrupulous promoter to trick an unsuspecting consumer into sending \nmoney. Fortunately, my consumer did not fall for this scam. But\n\n[[Page S9970]]\n\nmany others did, leading the Postal Service to bring action against the \npromoter of this scam.\n  Sadly, these are just a few of the many examples of deceptive \nmailings that the subcommittee uncovered during its investigation. The \nsimple fact is that far too many consumers regularly fall victim to \nincreasingly deceptive and sophisticated marketing techniques used in \nthese mailings.\n  I want to emphasize that sweepstakes can, of course, be a legitimate \nmarketing technique. While I have concerns about the deceptive nature \nof far too many sweepstakes mailings, I don't want to give the \nimpression that all sweepstakes are deceptive, or that they should be \noutlawed. Our legislation is setting clear standards for them to follow \nto avoid the kind of deception that we found to be rampant in the \nindustry.\n  Let me outline the major provisions of the legislation before the \nSenate today.\n  First, S. 335 requires sweepstakes mailings to clearly \nand conspicuously display several important disclaimers and consumer \nnotices, including a clear statement that no purchase is necessary to \nwin the contest, and, most of all, a statement that a purchase will not \nimprove your chances of winning.\n\n  I think that is the most important disclaimer of all.\n  These statements have to appear in three places--on the solicitation, \nin the rules, and on the order form.\n  In addition, the mailings must state the odds of winning, the value \nand the nature of the prize, and the name and the address of the \nsponsor of the sweepstakes. Sweepstakes mailings would also be required \nto include all the rules and entry procedures for the contest. The bill \nwould prohibit mailings from describing the recipient as a ``winner'' \nunless the recipient has really won a prize.\n  You can see from some of the mailings that we have discussed here \ntoday why that protection is so important.\n  Second, this legislation includes the provision drafted by Senator \nEdwards to require companies sending sweepstakes or skill contests to \nestablish a system that will allow consumers to request that they be \nremoved from sweepstakes mailing lists. Companies sending sweepstakes \nmailings must include either a toll-free number or the address at which \nthe consumer may request that their name be removed altogether from \nfuture sweepstakes mailings. Companies would be required to remove such \nindividuals from sweepstakes lists within 35 days.\n  Our hearings showed that far too many consumers had great difficulty \nin turning off the spigot of sweepstakes mailings to themselves, or, as \nwas often the case, to an elderly family member. Senator Edwards' \nprovision will assist consumers who want relief from the flood of \nsolicitations.\n  Third, our legislation strengthens the current law regarding \n``Government look-alike'' mailings by prohibiting mailings that imply a \nconnection to, approval, or endorsement by the Federal Government \nthrough the misleading use of a seal, insignia, reference to the \nPostmaster General, citation to a Federal law, or any other term or \nsymbol unless the mailings carry true disclaimers.\n  The bill imposes new Federal standards for facsimile checks that are \nsent in any mailing. These tests must include a statement on the check \nitself stating that it is non-negotiable and has no cash value.\n  Finally, S. 335 will strengthen the ability of the Postal Service to \ncombat deceptive mailings. Under existing law, the Postal Inspection \nService does not possess subpoena authority, is unable to obtain a \njudicial order to stop the deceptive mailing at multiple mailboxes in \ndifferent States, and may only seek financial penalties after a company \nhas violated a previously imposed order for sending deceptive mailings.\n  Our legislation grants the Postal Service subpoena authority, \nnationwide stop mail authority, and the ability to impose strong civil \npenalties for the first violation. At our hearings in July, the Postal \nService testified that civil penalties would be a significant deterrent \nagainst deceptive mailings. We can't just have minor penalties that are \ntreated as a cost of doing business. The penalties under our \nlegislation can reach as high as $1 million, and, if a company violates \nan order, that penalty is doubled and can range as high as $2 million.\n  The current penalties--capped at $10,000 per day--are simply \ninadequate to deter deceptive mailings, especially since they can only \nbe imposed after the mailer has evaded or failed to comply with a prior \norder.\n\n  Our bill recognizes the important role played by the States in \ninvestigating and prosecuting deceptive mailings. We do not preempt any \nprovision of State or local law. In many instances, it is the States \nthat have taken the strong action against deceptive sweepstakes \nmailings largely because of the gap in Federal law. During our \ninvestigation, we worked very closely with the National Association of \nAttorneys General.\n  I would like to close my initial statement by urging my colleagues to \nsupport S. 2335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, so \nthat the Senate, by passing this legislation later today, can take an \nimportant first legislative step in curtailing deceptive sweepstakes \nand protect the American consumer.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \ntremendous leadership on this issue and so many other consumer \nprotection issues. She is leading the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations with tremendous distinction, with great strength, and \nthe consumers of this Nation are all better off because of that \nleadership. This bill is a further example of that leadership. I am \nproud to be her principal cosponsor of the bill that we have worked on \nfor so long.\n  Sweepstakes for many Americans has become a cruel joke. Americans are \noverwhelmed with sweepstakes solicitations in the mail that deceptively \nappear to promise large winnings but deliver only empty appeals for \npurchases of unneeded products and more entries into additional \nsweepstakes.\n  The majority of Americans may have a healthy skepticism about these \nsolicitations and don't believe the misleading representations. But \nmany are not so disbelieving, and they can get caught up and do get \ncaught up in a spiral of financial and emotional trauma.\n  The subcommittee heard story after story before of seniors \nparticularly, some of the most vulnerable people in America, who \nreceive these mailings and believe that they have been awarded a prize.\n  Several of my constituents from Michigan lost tens of thousands of \ndollars to sweepstakes solicitations.\n  One woman in Grand Rapids spent over $12,000 in one year with \nReader's Digest alone.\n  A woman in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan spent $30,000 in less than \na month on sweepstakes-related promotions.\n  Sweepstakes solicitations are big business. Companies using \nsweepstakes to promote their products, be it magazines or coupon books, \nor jewelry, send over a billion pieces of mail a year to American \nconsumers.\n\n  We learned that one person could get from one company alone as much \nas 144 different pieces of sweepstakes mail in a year. That was from a \nso-called ``legitimate company.''\n  Purchases through these types of mailings are in the billions of \ndollars. Sweepstakes are used as the ``come-on'' to get the recipient \nto purchase a product or make a contribution. They are used, companies \nsay, to get the recipients to open the envelopes, and, once opened, \nused to get the person to respond with a purchase or contribution. \nPromoters argue that sweepstakes entrants buy these products because \nthey want them or need them.\n  Our investigation demonstrated that many people who enter these \nsweepstakes purchase items only because they think doing so will \nimprove their chances of winning the sweepstakes prize. A large number \nbuy and buy and buy, spending tens of thousands of dollars, with that \nexpectation that the purchase of items will help improve their chances \nof winning.\n  Companies are not allowed by law to use the U.S. mails to conduct a \nlottery. A lottery is where payment must be given in order to have a \nchance to win. It is illegal for a sweepstakes promotor to require a \npurchase in order for a person to have a chance to win or to improve a \nperson's chances of winning.\n\n[[Page S9971]]\n\n Buying something when entering a sweepstakes cannot, by law, do \nanything to improve a person's chances of winning. Many people don't \nknow that or believe a purchase will improve their chance and many \nsweepstake companies try to leave the impression that buying something \nwill give that recipient an advantage.\n  Sweepstake companies encourage this in many ways. For example, some \nuse different envelopes for those who buy a product and those who \ndon't. Here is an example from Reader's Digest. They send two \nenvelopes. If a person orders something, the envelope says: Yes, Reward \nEntitlement [underlined], Granted and Guaranteed. If a person does not \norder something, the envelope says: No Reward Entitlement, Denied and \nUnwarranted.\n  They go to different post office boxes, clearly leaving a very \ndifferent impression. It is a very strong different impression and a \nvery deceptive different impression.\n  Other sweepstake companies use their own envelope and address card \nfor those entering the sweepstake without purchasing a product. In \nanother sweepstakes, they are given an envelope if they want to buy \nsomething; if they don't want to buy something but still enter, they \nhave to fill out their own envelope or their own card, which is much \nmore difficult than if they are simply buying a product.\n\n  Some companies try to confuse the message, leaving the recipient to \nbelieve he has to pay a fee to collect a prize that he has already won. \nThis certificate from the ``Motor Vehicle Awards'' states: [You] are \nguaranteed to receive a brand-new automobile or a cash award.\n  The first envelope has the name of the person receiving it, so it is \nvery personalized: [Mr. or Miss Someone] are guaranteed to receive a \nbrand-new automobile or cash award.\n  They ask the recipient to confirm that his name is spelled correctly \non the certificate and to indicate how he wants the car delivered. In \nthe very last paragraph it says: In addition, an optional commodities \npackage with a fully redeemable value of over $2,500 is being held \npending your submission of the standard acquisition fee.\n  The impression is that the recipient has won a car, that all he has \nto do is return the certificate for the car, and pay an acquisition \nfee. Of course, the impression they attempt to create--and often do, \naccording to our testimony--is that acquisition fee relates to the car.\n  If he does that, the impression is he will receive a car and the \ncommodities package. That is a pretty good bargain, at $14.98 for a car \nand commodities package. In reality, this is a sales promotion for the \ncommodities package connected to a sweepstake. The acquisition fee of \n$14.98 is buying the commodities package. The commodities package is \nnothing more than a booklet of coupons that require buying items in \norder to redeem the coupons.\n  One must spend thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars for \nitems that you don't need in order to receive the savings that are \npromised. Yet we learned at our hearings this is a very common \nsweepstakes scheme. Honest businesses don't engage in these practices, \nor they shouldn't. Over and over we heard from victims of the deceptive \nsweepstakes packages that they thought they had to buy something to \nreceive the big prize or to improve their chances of winning. The \nsweepstake companies are very artful at creating this impression. This \nis about stringing people along. Often the people being strung along \nare the most vulnerable.\n  This is a promotion from Reader's Digest to a constituent of mine \nwhose house is filled to the brim with tapes, books, CDs, and magazines \nshe bought believing it would help her get the prize. This is a \nCertificate of Recognition for her loyalty to Reader's Digest: Dear \nvalued customer: You've been selected to receive one of our highest \nhonors--the Reader's Digest Recognition Reward. It's your obvious love \nof Reader's Digest and sweepstakes that made you an ideal candidate. In \nfact, it was your recent subscription request that finalized our \ndecision.\n  In other words, keep buying and we will keep sending opportunities to \nwin a sweepstake. It is buying the Reader's Digest that they are saying \ngets the special treatment. What is the Reader's Digest Recognition \nAward? It is a little stick 'em label that is pulled off this letter \nthat has my constituent's name on it so she can paste it on any article \nof furniture around her house. It really is a come-on, an opportunity \nto enter yet another sweepstake. That is the award, a little stick 'em \nthat Mrs. Roosenberg got for spending over $12,000 in 1 year for \nproducts she didn't even open, filling up her house.\n\n  Through the artful placement of words and graphics, the sweepstakes \ncompanies make the reader believe they have won. They use such large \nscreaming headlines: [Mr. X] is Officially Declared $833,337 Winner.\n  A big headline you can't miss. However, one misses the fine print \nthat says, no, you haven't--only if you held the right number. What \njumps out is the headline that you have won.\n  Our sweepstakes promoters try to make their envelopes look special, \nnot like the bulk mail which they are, or try to make them look like a \nGovernment document, or even in the case of a recent Publishers \nClearinghouse envelope, as if they were photographs that the recipient \npaid to have developed. This envelope looks exactly like envelopes \nreceived from the photo store. In fact, this is one of these sweepstake \noffers from Publishers Clearinghouse.\n  We cannot control each and every trick that a company uses to get the \nrecipient of a sweepstakes promotion to buy something. However, there \nare some things we can and we should insist upon. We can insist that \nthe companies state clearly and conspicuously that buying something \nwill not improve a person's chances of winning. We can insist that \nthese companies state clearly and conspicuously that you don't need to \nbuy anything to win. We can make these companies state clearly and \nconspicuously what are the odds of winning. In many cases, the odds are \nnearly 1 in 100 million or 1 in 150 million. We can also require the \nsweepstake promoters not tell a person they have won if they haven't \nand not use devices to suggest that the mail is from a Government \nagency. That will hopefully alert the folks receiving the sweepstakes \npromotion and will help them think twice before buying items they \nreally do not want and do not need.\n  In the last Congress, several of our colleagues joined in sponsoring \na bill to increase enforcement of deceptive mailings by the Postal \nService. This, year Senator Collins held hearings on sweepstakes and \nother forms of deceptive mail. We have introduced two bills to try to \neliminate deceptive sweepstakes practices. Senator Collins' bill is S. \n335; my bill is S. 336. We learned during the hearings that the \nfinancial costs to consumers for deceptive and fraudulent sweepstakes \nis a serious problem and one that particularly plagues our senior \ncitizens. We learned that the Postal Service has inadequate law \nenforcement tools to effectively shut down deceptive direct marketers \nwho use deceptive sweepstakes promotions to sell their products. We \nalso learned that the Postal Service can't impost a fine against such a \npromoter until the Postal Service has issued a stop order, and the stop \norder has been violated. Wily promoters craft their mailing so that it \ntechnically complies with a particular stop order but is this \ndeceptive? Thus, time and time again these promoters continue to prey \non Americans, and the postal Service has been all but powerless to stop \nthem.\n\n  The bill before us is a combination of our two bills. It establishes \na special provision in law for deceptive sweepstakes mailings, requires \ncertain disclosures to be clearly and conspicuously displayed in key \nparts of the sweepstakes promotion; prohibits other misleading and \ndeceptive statements in the promotion; gives the Postal Service \nadditional enforcement tools, and requires sweepstakes promoters to \nprovide a mechanism for a recipient of mail to remove his or her name \noff a mailing list if requested.\n  Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. These are 34\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nSenator's side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 10 additional minutes.\n  Three key provisions in S. 336 have been incorporated into the \nsubstitute. First, to prevent unscrupulous mailers from duping people \ninto believing that a purchase will increase their chances\n\n[[Page S9972]]\n\nof winning, the bill requires that a statement that a purchase will not \nincrease an individual's chances of winning be clearly and \nconspicuously displayed in a prominent place and manner in the mailing, \nin the rules, and on the order or entry form.\n  I believe of all of the new requirements and standards, this is \nperhaps the most important. The statement that a purchase will not \nincrease an individual's chances of winning must not only be clearly \nand conspicuously displayed but also displayed in a prominent place and \nmanner in the mailing, in the rules, and on the order or entry form. \nSuch a statement will, hopefully, help readers dissociate the ordering \nprocess from the sweepstakes entry.\n  Second, it provides the Postal Service with the authority to issue a \ncivil penalty for a first-time violation of the statute. This means the \nPostal Service does not have to first issue a stop order and then wait \nfor that order to be violated before assessing civil penalties. This \nhas the effect of applying the penalty to the deceptive offense, not \nfor noncompliance with the order. It makes enforcement a one-step \ninstead of a two-step process. Third, it gives the Postal Service the \nsubpoena authority it often needs to help identify sweepstakes scams.\n  Despite the specificity of the disclosures required under the bill, I \nremain quite concerned that the disclosures be noticeable and \nunderstandable to the reader. That is why the bill requires all \ndisclosures to be clearly and conspicuously displayed. With a managers' \namendment, we define ``clearly and conspicuously displayed'' in the \nbill so that there can be no misunderstanding by the Postal Service and \nthe direct mail industry as to what we mean. Furthermore, two critical \ndisclsoures--``no purchase necessary'' and ``a purchase will not \nincrease an individual's chances of winning''--are required to be not \nonly ``clearly and conspicuously displayed'' but ``prominently'' \ndisplayed as well. This means that these two diclsoures must be highly \nvisible to and easily noticeable by the reader. These important \nmessages will not be allowed to be hidden or disguised through \nillegible print size, glitzy displays which detract from the \ndisclosure, or barely noticeable ink color.\n  The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999 takes a \ntough approach to dealing with sweepstakes solicitations and other \ngames of chance offerings that are sent through the mail. If you use \nsweepstakes or a game of chance to promote the sale of a legitimate \nproduct, provide adequate disclosure, and abide with Postal Service \nregulations, then the Postal Service will deliver that solicitation \nwithout any interruption. If deceptive practices are used in a \nsweepstakes or game of chance solicitation, the Postal Service will be \nable to stop the solicitation and impose a significant penalty.\n  I again thank Senator Collins again for her hard work and commitment \nto consumers in this legislation. I also thank Senator Cochran for his \nearly support and Senator Edwards for his excellent work on the \nprovision requiring a delisting of persons not wanting to receive \nsweepstakes mailings. Finally, I want to thank the staff of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations for the terrific job they did \nputting together the hearings and developing this legislation. In \nparticular I want to thank Linda Gustitus and Leslie Bell of the \nminority staff, Lee Blaylock and Kirk Walder of the majority staff, and \nMaureen Mahon of Senator Edwards' staff.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time as Senator Collins has indicated, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the Senator's information, the Senator \nfrom Michigan has 29 minutes remaining. The Senator from Maine has 35 \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague from Michigan \nfor his very generous comments. Also, once again I commend his \noutstanding leadership on this issue. It has been terrific working with \nhim in a variety of areas related to consumer protection. We are where \nwe are today because of his efforts.\n  I also echo the thanks to our staff who have done a tremendous job.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  I do ask unanimous consent the privilege of the floor be granted to \nthe following members of my staff during the pendency of this \nlegislation: R. Emmett Mattes, Kathy D. Cutler, and Deirdre Foley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is now my great pleasure to yield to \nthe Senator from Mississippi, who is the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Governmental Affairs with jurisdiction over the Postal Service. \nSenator Cochran held the very first hearings on deceptive mailings last \nyear. He has been a tremendous supporter of the effort to curtail \ndeceptive mailings. I really appreciate his leadership on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor and to \nsupport the passage of the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement \nAct, S. 335. This legislation would establish new safeguards to protect \nconsumers against deceptive and dishonest sweepstakes and other \npromotional mailings. The bill grants additional investigative and \nenforcement authority to the U.S. Postal Service to stop deceptive \nmailings, and it establishes standards for all sweepstakes mailings by \nrequiring certain disclosures on each mailing.\n\n  In the last Congress, our subcommittee examined the use of mass mail \nto deceive and defraud consumers. At the subcommittee's hearing, we \nheard how sweepstakes and other promotions were causing individuals to \nmake unwanted or excessive purchases in the hope that the purchases \nwould increase their chances of winning money or other prizes. Since \nconducting that hearing, the subcommittee has been flooded with stories \nfrom consumers all over the country who have lost thousands of dollars \nin some cases--sometimes their life savings--to deceptive mailing \npractices. But it is not just sweepstakes offers that deceive \nconsumers. Some mailers imply an association with the Government, often \nenticing consumers to pay unnecessary fees.\n  This bill will address several types of deceptive mailings, including \nsweepstakes and Government look-alike mailings.\n  First, it will require sweepstakes mailings to display a statement \nthat no purchase is necessary to enter the contest and that a purchase \nwill not improve the chances of winning. Other disclosures will also be \nrequired, including the sponsor of the sweepstakes and the principal \nplace of business or an address at which the sponsor can be reached, \nand the estimated odds of winning each prize and the estimated value of \neach prize. In addition, all terms and conditions of the sweepstakes \npromotion, including the rules and entry procedures for the \nsweepstakes, will be required on each mailing.\n  Second, the bill will expand the authority of the U.S. Postal Service \nby granting the Postal Inspection Service subpoena authority, \nnationwide stop-mail authority, and the ability to impose civil \npenalties of up to $1 million for the first offense and $2 million for \na violation of an existing order.\n  Finally, the bill will strengthen existing law regarding Government \nlook-alike mailings by requiring disclaimers on any mailings that might \nbe interpreted as implying a connection to the Federal Government.\n  This legislation was reported out of the Subcommittee on \nInternational Security, Proliferation and Federal Services on April 12 \nand reported unanimously by the Committee on Governmental Affairs on \nMay 20. It has the support of the U.S. Postal Service, a number of \nconsumer groups, and the American Association of Retired Persons.\n  I commend the work of the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. \nCollins, in crafting this legislation to curb deceptive mailings. As \nchair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senator Collins \nhas thoroughly examined the issue, and I applaud her important efforts \nin developing this bill and her continuing efforts to protect \nconsumers. The distinguished ranking minority member of the committee, \nSenator Levin, has also supported this initiative, and we appreciate \nhis assistance.\n  This bill takes an important step toward the prevention of deception \nin sweepstakes and other promotional mailings. I urge Senators to \nsupport it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S9973]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis very kind comments and for his strong support of this initiative. \nHe has been a partner throughout this investigation into deceptive \nmailings, and I am very grateful for his support.\n\n\n             different promotions for the same sweepstakes\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, during the July 1999 hearing on deceptive \nmail held by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, several \npromoters testified that they use different business names and \ndifferent stationery to send to the same people different-looking \nmailings to promote the same sweepstakes. So, for example, on day one, \na person can get a solicitation to enter a $10,000 sweepstakes, and the \nsolicitation says on the top that ``Company Blue'' is making the offer. \nIn the rules it says ``your chances of winning are 1 in 3 million.'' \nLet's say you enter that sweepstakes. One week later you get another \nsolicitation for a $10,000 sweepstakes.\n  And we learned that the standard operating procedure for this type of \nsweepstakes is to send 5 or 6 mailings for the same sweepstakes after \nthe person responds to the first mailing.\n  So on this second mailing, it says ``Company Red'' at the top and the \nmaterials look totally different from the ``Company Blue'' promotions. \nThe rules of this second solicitation also say you have a 1 in 3 \nmillion chance of winning $10,000, which a reasonable person would \nthink is a completely different sweepstakes. That's also what the \npromoter wants you to think. So you think you have a chance of winning \n$20,000 in total. But, you don't. The most you can win is $10,000.\n  I believe these mailings are misrepresenting the facts, and under \nexisting law these misrepresentations are deceptive. For example, in \nthe ``Company Blue'' and ``Company Red'' scenario I just described, the \npromoter wants you to think that you're receiving two separate \nsolicitations, each involving two separate sweepstakes. In fact, the \nsolicitations for ``Company Blue'' and ``Company Red'' are for the same \nsweepstakes and thus you can win only once. Section 3005 of title 39 \ncurrently allows the Postal Service to deny delivery of mail used as \npart of a scheme to obtain money through the mail by means of false \nrepresentations. Clearly many sweepstakes promoters use different \nbusiness names and different stationery to make you think their \nmultiple solicitations are unique and have no relationship to each \nother.\n  Does the Senator from Maine agree that these multiple mailing schemes \nmislead people into thinking they are entering separate contests from \ndifferent companies?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yes, I agree with the Senator from Michigan. The \npractice of using different-looking promotional mailings without any \ninformation explaining that they are for the same sweepstakes serves no \npurpose except to lead recipients into believing that they are \ndifferent sweepstakes. Once the recipient believes that they are \ndifferent sweepstakes, the recipient who believes that a purchase \neither is required or will confer an advantage upon them will then \nbelieve that a separate purchase must be made for each unique-looking \nsweepstakes. Because these different-looking mailings do not clearly \nstate that they are promoting the same sweepstakes, I agree with the \nSenator from Michigan that they can be deceptive.\n\n\n                     use of the word ``prominent''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our bill requires a sweepstakes or skill \ncontest promotion, in order to be mailable matter, to contain a number \nof specific disclosures. Each of the disclosures required by the bill \nmust be ``clearly and conspicuously displayed.'' We have defined that \nterm in the bill to mean ``readily noticeable, readable, and \nunderstandable.'' This is a definition consistent with the definition \nused by the Federal Trade Commission.\n  Two of the required disclosures--that no purchase is necessary to win \nand that purchasing does not improve your chances of winning--are so \nimportant to giving a consumer the information he or she needs to \ndecide whether or not to enter a sweepstakes and if so, whether or not \nto purchase an advertised product--that they should appear prominently \nin three places in each mailing. Our addition of the term \n``prominently'' to these two disclosures is intended to emphasize the \nheightened significance of these disclaimers. This means that these two \ndisclosures must be highly visible and highly noticeable to the reader. \nIn Edgeworth v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 673 F. Supp. 922, 923 (N.D. Ill. \n1987), rev. on other grounds, 683 F. Supp. 1193 (1988), the District \nCourt defined ``prominent and accessible place'' to mean that the \nmessage conveyed can readily be observed by the people for whom it is \nintended. In Allstate Insurance Co. v. Clemmons, 742 F. Supp. 1073, \n1075 (D.NV 1990), the District Court defined ``prominently displayed'' \nto mean ``the message must have greater prominence than the balance of \nthe policy language. . . . In other words, a clause attains prominence \nby being different from its surrounding terms.'' ``Prominently'' \nrequires, for purposes of our bill, making the two disclosures to which \n``prominently'' applies different from other messages in appearance, \nmanner of presentation, and location. These two disclosures must stand \nout from the rest of the printed material on the three locations where \nthey are required to appear.\n  One can argue that there is going to be some subjectivity in deciding \nwhether a statement is prominently placed in a promotion or not. Our \nintention here is to provide the Postal Service with enough guidance to \nensure that when it comes to these two disclosures, there should be no \nclose calls. These two disclosures should be obviously clearly and \nconspicuously displayed in a prominent manner and location.\n  Does the Senator from Maine agree with my description?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yes, I do. Of the several disclosures we require to be \nincluded in a mailing containing a sweepstakes or skill contest \npromotion, these two disclosures--that no purchase is necessary and \nthat purchasing does not improve your chances of winning--are \nparticularly important for the reader to see in a prominent way. The \nstatements themselves should be clear and conspicuous, as required by \nthe bill, and they should be prominent in three places in each mailing, \nso it would be very difficult for a recipient not to notice them.\n  A number of sweepstakes and skill contest promoters currently include \nin their mailings the statement that no purchase is necessary. But this \nis often included only as a part of a lengthy set of rules or buried in \nother statements and notices that allow it to be easily overlooked. \nThat is why our managers' amendment includes the requirement that these \ntwo statements be prominent, and clearly and conspicuously displayed. I \nthank the Senator from Michigan for his assistance on this issue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1497\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a managers' amendment)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send to the desk the managers' \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself and Mr. \n     Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 1497.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I offer this managers' amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Levin to clarify certain provisions of S. \n335.\n  As I described in my opening statement, this legislation imposes a \nnumber of new standards on promotional mailings. The managers' \namendment further defines the ``clear and conspicuous'' standard for \nthe disclaimers and notices required in this bill. All disclaimers and \nnotices must be ``clearly and conspicuously displayed,'' which means \n``in a manner that is readily noticeable, readable and understandable \nto the group to whom the applicable matter is disseminated.''\n  During its investigation into deceptive sweepstakes mailings, the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations found numerous examples of \nmailings that misled consumers into believing that they must purchase a \nproduct to win a prize, or that a purchase will improve their chances \nof winning. The investigation showed that many mailings did not clearly \ninform consumers that no purchase was necessary to enter the \nsweepstakes and that buying a product did not increase their chances of \nwinning. The disclaimers and notices in many existing sweepstakes \nmailings are of little value because they are too often buried in tiny \nprint or contradicted by the promotional copy. Consumers should not \nneed a law degree or a magnifying glass to read the rules or to \ndecipher how to enter a sweepstakes without placing an order. In order \nto give some value to the disclaimers and consumer notices mandated by \nthis bill, S. 335 requires each of these disclosures to be ``clearly \nand conspicuously displayed.''\n  The managers' amendment defines ``clearly and conspicuously \ndisplayed'' in a manner that is consistent with previous agency and \ncourt rulings. As the committee report for this legislation explains, \nthe Federal Trade Commission has issued opinions on the meaning of \n``clear and conspicuous'' and this standard is a staple of commercial \nlaw. The definition of clear and conspicuous, as used in S. 335, is \nmeant to be consistent with the interpretation of the standard as \ndeveloped in previous regulatory opinions, statements, and case law.\n  Thus, as the definition states, the required disclosures must be \nreadily noticeable, readable, and understandable to the group to whom \nthe matter is mailed. As the committee report notes, in some instances, \nthe language may need to be highlighted, in bold letters, or placed in \na visible location. We recognize that the format and layout of \npromotional mailings differ dramatically and, accordingly, the \npresentation of each required disclosure will necessarily vary. Thus, \nwe believe it is unwise to dictate the size, font, color, or placement \nof each disclaimer imposed on promotional mailings. The definition in \nthis managers' amendment, however, gives the regulators broad guidance \nto interpret on a case-by-case basis what is required for a disclaimer \nor notice to qualify as ``clearly and conspicuously displayed.''\n  The committee report accompanying S. 335 provides a detailed \ndescription of the clear and conspicuous standard as\n\n[[Page S9975]]\n\nenunciated by the Federal Trade Commission and in court decisions. The \nstandard was designed to prevent deception, and we expect those \nenforcing this Act to make use of this standard to protect consumers \nreceiving promotional mailings from deceptive practices. We agree with \nthe Federal Trade Commission that deception occurs if there is a \nrepresentation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the \nreasonable consumer or his or her detriment.\n  Furthermore, the managers' amendment adds the word ``prominently'' to \nthe two most significant disclosures required by S. 335: first, that no \npurchase is necessary to enter the sweepstakes; and second, that a \npurchase will not increase an individual's chances of winning with that \nentry. S. 335 already places significance on these two disclaimers by \nrequiring that they appear in three different places in most \nsweepstakes mailings: (1) the mailing, (2) the rules, and (3) the entry \nor order form. Because the subcommittee's investigation found strong \nevidence that some consumers believed a purchase would increase their \nchances of winning, we view these two disclosures as particularly \nimportant. As such, and because of the brevity of these disclosures, we \nbelieve that it is particularly important that they be easily \nidentifiable by the reader.\n  The Federal Trade Commission has used a variety of terms to describe \nclear and conspicuous, including sufficiently clear and prominent. \nBecause many of the other disclosures required by S.  335 may be \nlengthy and may only appear in one place in a mailing, we believe that \nwhat is ``clear and conspicuous'' for one disclaimer may differ from \nwhat is necessitated by another. A disclosure of a few words, such as \n``no purchase necessary,'' would by its very nature dictate a different \nyardstick than would the entire contest rules, which might consist of \nseveral hundred words. We expect all disclosures to be clear and \nconspicuous but these two disclosures should be ``prominent'' in the \nthree required places in each mailing.\n  The managers' amendment also makes several technical changes. it \nremoves duplicative language from several different disclosures \nrequired by S. 335. These deletions, however, are not intended in any \nway to weaken the overall requirement that disclosures must be \n``clearly and conspicuously displayed.'' The managers' amendment also \ndeletes a somewhat duplicative requirement relating to advantages that \na sweepstakes might imply are given to those entries that accompany a \npurchase. Given the disclaimer which states that a purchase will not \nimprove the contestant's chance of winning, we determined that this \nprovision was superfluous.\n  Finally, the managers' amendment replaces section 8 of the bill \nreported by the Governmental Affairs Committee with new language \nrequiring all companies sending sweepstakes or skill contest mailings \nto establish a system for removing the names of individuals who do not \nwish to receive such mailings. Section 8, as reported out of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, established a uniform notification \nsystem for most sweepstakes and contest mailings.\n  Under the new provisions companies would be required--on a company-\nby-company basis--to include on their mailings a notice of the address \nor toll-free telephone number that individuals could contact to request \nthat their names be removed from future mailings. Such names must be \nremoved within 35 days after appropriate notice. If a mailing is \nrecklessly sent to consumers who have requested not to receive further \nsolicitations, the mailer shall be subject to a penalty of $10,000. \nThis section shall take effect one year after enactment of this \nlegislation. We commend our colleague and friend Senator Edwards for \nhis strong leadership in crafting this proposal.\n  In closing, I thank my colleagues, particularly Senator Levin, for \ntheir assistance in crafting this managers' amendment, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1497) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we are expecting additional speakers. In \nthe meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nDeceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act. Unrequested mailings are \nseen by many as a nuisance. But when junk mail makes insupportable and \noutrageous claims of instant wealth, phantom prices, and bogus benefits \nannoyance becomes fraud--the small print notwithstanding.\n  Among its provisions, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement \nAct, S. 335, would place new requirements on sweepstakes offerings and \nallow fines to be levied on deceptive mailings. S. 335 would also \nrequire sweepstakes information to be presented clearly, and grants the \nPostal Service new authority to halt misleading mailings. I feel \nstrongly that these reforms will benefit an untold number of American \nfamilies and elderly persons from some unscrupulous elements of our \nsociety.\n  It pleases me to remark briefly on the genesis of this proposal. In \nmy experience, the role of oversight and investigation has enabled the \nCongress to craft its most informed, well reasoned, and thorough \nlegislative proposals. As past chairman of the Senate's Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigation and current chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, I have long used and will continue to use these \ntools to assess and reform.\n  I commend my successor as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigation, Senator Susan Collins, for taking a thorough approach to \ncrafting this proposal. Following a process of investigation and \nhearings, Senator Collins has applied the right tools to a common \nproblem. The people of Maine, Delaware, and the rest of our Nation will \nbenefit from her hard work.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for S. 335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act.\n  As a cosponsor of this legislation, let me first thank Senator \nCollins for her hard work in crafting this legislation, and for the \ninformative and insightful oversight hearings she has held on the \nsweepstakes industry this year. Those hearings have exposed some \ntroubling practices, and clearly demonstrate the need for this \nimportant legislation.\n  Earlier this year a constituent of mine from Huntington, Vermont, e-\nmailed my office and relayed his own personal story as an example of \nthe need for this legislation. He had been asked by his mother to help \nreview her mail as she was certain she had won something from a variety \nof sweepstakes mailings. He was shocked to learn in reviewing the \nmaterial that while technically correct the material she was sent was \nvery misleading. Any information that would lead the person to believe \nthey had won was highlighted or in bold print, while the statements \ncontaining words like ``if you have the winning number'' are subdued, \nand in small print. The intent of these mailings was clearly to create \na false sense of ``winning'' in the recipient.\n  As his e-mail further points out, it used to be only the big names \nwhich sent out these sweepstakes mailings, but it ow seems to be every \nfund-raising group, catalog, or magazine has some version of these \nsweepstakes mailings. However, even if you are just receiving material \nfrom one company if can be an overwhelming amount of sweepstakes \nmailings.\n  For example, another constituent of mine from Barre, Vermont, brought \ninto my office over fifteen pounds of sweepstakes mailings from one \ncompany that related to only one contest. You heard me right, fifteen \npounds of material for only one contest from one company. Multiply that \nby the number\n\n[[Page S9976]]\n\nof contests and companies people receive mailings from and you are \nlooking at an overwhelming amount of mail.\n  One of the most outrageous practices in these mailings is the request \nfor a donation or a purchase of a product without making it clear that \nthe donation or purchase has no effect on your chances of winning any \nof the prizes. This has caused some people to expend their precious \nresources thinking they are giving themselves a better chance at \nwinning the grand prize, when in reality it has done nothing to change \nthe odds.\n  Senator Collin's legislation, S. 335, will go a long way to solve the \nproblems of these deceptive sweepstakes mailings. It requires a clear \ndisclosure of the game's rules and an indication that the odds of \nwinning are not improved by purchasing any products that are being \nadvertised. It also will restrict the mailing from depicting an \nindividual as a winner unless that person actually has won a prize. In \naddition, the bill will implement stricter penalties for sending mail \nthat does not comply with the federal standards.\n  Every day people are being inundated with these mailings and many of \nthem promote a belief that you have already won, or that a donation or \npurchase will increase your chances of winning. For many, especially \nfor the most vulnerable in our society, it has been very difficult to \nseparate the truth from the fantasy in these mailings, and as past \nhistory has shown sweepstakes mailings are a particular problem for the \nelderly in our society.\n  Mr. President, we have a chance to protect all Americans, \nparticularly the elderly, and I urge all my colleagues to support this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nmajority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes 12 seconds.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nremaining on the majority side be equally divided between Senator \nThompson and Senator Burns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time under \nthe quorum call, which I will ask for, be charged against our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I lend my strong support for Senate \napproval of S. 335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act. \nThis bill will establish new consumer protections to shield consumers \nfrom falling victim to deceptive and fraudulent practices found in some \nsweepstakes and mail promotions.\n  Thanks to the hard work of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, under the leadership of Senator Susan Collins, we have \nbecome privy to the operations of some of these sweepstakes companies. \nAs the hearings pointed out, sweepstakes companies are now sending out \nmore than one billion mailings per year. In the course of these \nmailings, some recipients have been led to believe that their chances \nof winning large amounts of money could be increased through the \npurchase of the promoter's products or merchandise. Whether through the \nuse of unclear and ambiguous language, symbols, or documents, these \nmailings have been a source of confusion and have lead to some readers \nspending significant sums of money ordering products in the mistaken \nbelief that this would increase their chances of winning.\n  S. 335, for the first time, would establish specific guidelines and \nparameters for mailings containing sweepstakes, games of skill and \nfacsimile checks. The legislation requires clear and conspicuous \ndisclaimers that ``no purchase is necessary'' on the sweepstakes claim \nor entry form. The legislation also improves restrictions on government \nlook-alike mailings. Further, the bill directs sweepstakes companies to \nadopt procedures to prevent the mailing of these materials to anyone \nwho submits a request stating their intent not to receive these \nmailings.\n  This bill has the strong support of the Postal Service. In providing \nthe Postal Service with the ability to protect consumers through civil \nenforcement, the bill further grants the Postal Service administrative \nsubpoena authority. It will also give U.S. district courts the ability \nto impose nationwide temporary training orders.\n  As a strong proponent of federalism, I think it is important that \nthis bill does not preempt the authority of the state attorneys general \nand various consumer protection agencies which also combat deceptive \nmailings. The Postal Service and these agencies have a history of \ncooperation in the investigation and prosecution of these cases. The \nPostal Service reports that this collective effort has produced \nsignificant results in policing a variety of frauds while enabling \nstate prosecution efforts to investigate questionable promotion \npractices beyond their state borders. S. 335 will not only improve the \nPostal Service's ability to investigate and stop deceptive mailings, \nbut it will also help state attorneys general work more effectively \nagainst fraud.\n  This bill represents the bipartisan efforts of a number of Senators. \nS. 335 was unanimously reported out of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs with the support of both myself and the ranking minority \nmember, Senator Lieberman. I would like to take this opportunity to \nacknowledge the hard work put forth by the bill's sponsor, Senator \nCollins, and other cosponsors of the legislation including Senators \nCochran, Levin, and Edwards. In addition I want to acknowledge the role \nof Senator Campbell in first introducing legislation last year on this \nissue. His efforts served as the genesis for the successful \ninvestigative and legislative efforts we have seen this year.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, S. 335 presents a balanced and fair \napproach in protecting consumers from misleading and fraudulent \nsweepstakes and related mailings, while not unduly burdening those \nmailers who legitimately use the mail as an advertising medium. I urge \nall Senators to support Senate approval of S. 335.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMichigan.\n  I am delighted to stand in support of defending S. 335, the Deceptive \nMail Prevention and Enforcement Act. I commend my colleague from \nMichigan, along with Senators Collins, Cochran, and Edwards, for the \nway they have worked together with my former colleagues, the State \nattorneys general, the AARP, and the sweepstakes industry itself to put \ntogether this important consumer protection legislation. I think their \ncombined efforts stand as a model not only of cooperation but of \nthoughtful legislating from which we can all learn. I am very proud to \njoin them as a cosponsor of this bill.\n  No marketing effort should be based on misleading advertising. That \nprinciple is at the core of the legislation before the Senate. It \nreminds everyone that occasionally the Federal Government has to step \nin to make sure that the free market we celebrate and benefit so much \nfrom truly remains free. That freedom is so often based on the \ntruthfulness of representations made by those who are marketing.\n  The purpose of this bill is to eliminate deceptive practices in the \nsweepstakes industry. We have all seen\n\n[[Page S9977]]\n\nthem. Who wouldn't be tantalized by a letter proclaiming you may \nalready be a winner? It is hard not to open that one up. Everybody \nwants to be a winner. Most of us have probably fantasized about how we \nwould spend a sudden windfall that dropped into our bank accounts.\n  Unfortunately, sweepstakes mailings often involve sophisticated \nmarketing techniques that persuade recipients to spend money in the \nhope of finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but it is a \nlong way off in almost all cases. Often the mailings are targeted at \nthe elderly or the financially vulnerable who don't realize that \nsweepstake companies are not in business primarily to rain riches down \nupon them. Sweepstakes companies are in business to sell products that \nmake a profit, plain and simple. That is legitimate so long as they do \nit fairly and truthfully.\n  It is a big business. The fact is that sweepstakes and telemarketing \nfirms take in more than $400 million a year from promotional campaigns \nin my State of Connecticut alone. Nationally, estimates are that the \nsweepstakes in telemarketing firms have gross revenues between $40 and \n$60 billion a year. This legislation makes sure that before consumers \ntake a chance on the sweepstakes, they know it is just that, a chance--\nnot a winning ticket, not a prize, but a chance. They will know the \nodds are not improved no matter how many subscriptions they buy.\n  This legislation requires a clear statement that no purchase is \nnecessary to win, as well as terms and conditions of the promotion in \nlanguage that is easy to find, to read, and to understand. It prohibits \nabuses we have seen such as symbols or statements that imply Federal \nGovernment endorsement, and it provides meaningful disclosures to let \nconsumers know the actual odds of winning.\n  Further, the bill sets up a mechanism for consumers and those who \ncare for them to stop unwanted sweepstake solicitations and a \nrecordkeeping requirement to assure that such requests are properly \nimplemented.\n\n  Finally, the bill gives the Postal Service the additional enforcement \nauthority it needs to stop unlawful sweepstake schemes, particularly \nthose that flirt with fraud and skip from State to State.\n  I strongly support this legislation as a tool to help consumers \nnegotiate their way through the high pressure sales tactics sometimes \nemployed by marketers using sweepstakes to sell their products. I am \nvery grateful to colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee for \nthe leadership they have shown.\n  I am delighted to join this bipartisan effort to protect our \ncitizens--again, particularly the aged--from these deceptive marketing \ntactics. I urge the Senate to vote for this strong consumer protection \nmeasure. I hope the House will then join in adopting this bill and \nsending it to the President.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to speak for a brief period \nof time in morning business. I see the Senator from Mississippi is \ncoming into the Chamber. I know we are ready to start with the Ag \nappropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S9977-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9977-S9978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to very briefly speak to an \nissue that actually might be one we will debate as we go through this \nAg appropriations bill since part of what we deal with within the \nDepartment of Agriculture is food assistance programs such as the \nWomen, Infants, and Children Program and the Food Stamp Program.\n  We have heard a great deal from the White House and from some Members \nof Congress about the success of the welfare bill. On Sunday, the White \nHouse released data on the number of women who were on welfare and are \nnow working. There will be a gathering in Chicago tomorrow, I believe, \nwhere the President will be talking about welfare to work and talking \nabout the success of this.\n  As a Senator, I want to raise a couple of questions that I think are \nimportant and to focus on some unpleasant facts that we should be \nwilling to face up to.\n  First of all, I point out for my colleagues the fact that the welfare \nrolls are down 40 percent begs the question of whether or not we have \nreduced poverty. The fact of the matter is, the welfare rolls are down \n40 percent, but poverty is barely down. The goal was not to reduce the \nwelfare rolls; the goal everybody talked about was to move families \nfrom poverty to economic independence. That is really what the goal was \nall about. The issue has never been welfare; the issue has been \npoverty.\n  The question is, How do you reduce the poverty? I do not quite \nunderstand how the White House or any Democrat or any Republican can \nproclaim this a success when we have done so little to reduce poverty \nin our country, especially poverty of children. There are about 14 \nmillion people who are poor in the country.\n\n  My second point is, when the President and the White House talk about \nthe number of mothers who are now working, that begs the question as to \nwhat kind of jobs and what kind of wages. What we should be talking \nabout are family-wage or living-wage jobs. The evidence we have right \nnow is that most of the mothers who are working are working in jobs \nwith wages somewhere between about $5.50 and $7 an hour, which is \nbarely above minimum wage but does not enable these families to escape \npoverty.\n  My third point is, Families USA just came out with a study that \npoints out there are about 675,000 low-income citizens who have now \nbeen cut off medical assistance because of the welfare bill. There are \nabout 675,000 low-income citizens who no longer are receiving any \nmedical assistance.\n  My final point is, there was a Wall Street Journal piece today about \nthe dramatic, precipitous decline of participation in the Food Stamp \nProgram. I argue especially the decline of participation among children \nwhich cannot be explained alone by the state of the economy, especially \nwith the dramatic increase in the use of food shelf service.\n  What is going on? Do we have a situation now where the AFDC structure \nis no longer there, and when people come in, no one tells them about \nthe fact they and their families are eligible for food stamps--that is \nhappening--or they are not told they are eligible for medical \nassistance--that is happening--all of which leads me to two final \nthings today as we move into this debate about the Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  First, I lost by one vote on a welfare tracking amendment, and then \nthe Senate adopted it on the Treasury-Postal bill. It is now in \nconference committee. The amendment called upon the States, when they \napply for the $1 billion bonus money, to present to Health and Human \nServices the data on what kind of jobs women have, whether or not they \nand their children are participating in food stamps and do the families \nhave medical assistance, so we can find out if families are better off \nor worse off. That is now in conference. If that gets taken out of \nconference committee--amendments are adopted in the Senate and taken \nout in conference committee--I am going to bring that amendment back up \non this bill, and we are going to have a vote because sometimes we do \nnot know what we do not want to know, and sometimes we only know what \nwe want to know.\n  That is the way it is with the White House about this welfare bill. \nWe ought to be engaged in an honest policy evaluation to find out what \nis happening in the country. We are talking about poor women and poor \nchildren, and we ought to know whether they are better off or whether \nthey are worse off. There is some disturbing evidence that many of \nthese families might, in fact, be worse off. It is a little early and \npremature for the White House to be declaring this a success or for any \nSenator or Representative, Democrat or Republican, to be declaring it a \nsuccess.\n  My final point is, since we are dealing with an Ag appropriations \nbill--and I think I will have an amendment to this effect--we need to \ncall on USDA, or someone, to do a study and to report\n\n[[Page S9978]]\n\nback to the Senate and to the Congress in a relatively brief period of \ntime, as soon as possible, what is happening with the Food Stamp \nProgram in this country. We need to know.\n  There was a dramatic piece in the Washington Post about 2 weeks ago. \nI could hardly bear to read it. It was the front page of the B section. \nIt was a picture of an 8-year-old child, a little boy. The whole piece \nwas devoted to hungry children in the District of Columbia.\n  The gist of the article was that in August--now--the summer schools \nare going to shut down and the breakfasts will not be there, the School \nLunch Program will not be there, and there is no food at home.\n  In this particular family, this grandmother with four children does \nnot have enough money to feed her children. What I want to know is, \nwhatever happened to the Food Stamp Program? That has been our safety \nnet program. What is going on when we have a dramatic rise in the use \nof food shelves and food pantries in this country? The Catholic Church \nnetwork study pointed this out just last month.\n  What is going on when 675,000 low-income people are removed from \nmedical assistance as a result of the welfare bill? What is going on \nwhen the vast majority of these women are working at jobs that still do \nnot get them and their families out of poverty? What is going on when \nwe are unwilling to do an honest policy evaluation of this legislation, \nbecause very soon in many States there will be a drop-dead date \ncertain, and all families, all women, and all children will be cut off \nfrom any welfare assistance at all. Before that happens, we need to \nknow what is happening with this legislation.\n  I have come to the floor of the Senate today to basically challenge \nmy colleagues to make sure this stays in the conference committee and \nto announce I will be out here on the floor with an amendment if it \ngets eliminated from the conference committee, and to announce we ought \nto also have a study of the Food Stamp Program to find out why it is \nnot reaching children and families who need the help, and also to \ndirectly challenge the White House and the President. It is not enough \nto say we have cut the rolls by 40 percent. The question is, Have we \nreduced the poverty by 40 percent? We have not.\n\n  It is not enough to say these mothers are now working. The question \nis, Are they working jobs that will enable them and their children to \nno longer be poor in our country? That is the goal which I do not \nbelieve has been met.\n  We are talking about the lives of poor women and poor children. They \ndeserve to be on our radar screen. They deserve an honest, rigorous \npolicy evaluation so that we, as decisionmakers, know whether or not, \nby our actions, we are helping these women and children or whether or \nnot we are hurting these women and children. We ought to have the \ncourage to step up to the plate.\n  I think we are about ready to start on the Ag appropriations bill. I \nwill yield the floor. I look forward to this debate. I came down here \non the floor to debate this bill. This is the crisis that is staring my \nState of Minnesota in the face. I am going to leave it up to Senator \nHarkin or Senator Daschle to start out debate on our side, but I am \nvery anxious to be in this debate and very anxious to speak for farmers \nand for agriculture.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S9978-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9978-S9982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n           RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1233, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1233) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I believe we have a unanimous consent \nrequest now and some motions that we will need to make. It might take a \nfew minutes to get through this.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Daschle be recognized to \noffer his amendment relative to disaster assistance and, following the \nreporting by the clerk, the amendment be laid aside and Senator Cochran \nbe recognized to offer his disaster assistance amendment. I further ask \nunanimous consent that debate run concurrently on both amendments, with \nthe votes occurring in a stacked sequence at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, the \nfirst in relation to the Cochran amendment to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Daschle amendment, as amended, if amended, with 2 \nminutes of debate prior to each vote. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat no amendments be in order to either amendment prior to the votes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following those votes, Senator Jeffords \nbe recognized to offer his amendment relative to dairy and immediately \nfollowing the reporting by the clerk, Senator Lott be recognized to \nsend a cloture motion to the desk and that cloture vote occur at 9:30 \na.m. on Wednesday, with the mandatory quorum being waived \nnotwithstanding rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KOHL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Since objection has been heard, I have no alternative other \nthan to offer a series of amendments. This is important because we do \nneed to move forward with the Agriculture appropriations bill. We \nbrought it up earlier, this past month. It became embroiled in an \nunrelated issue, and we had to set it aside.\n  The farmers in America and the consumers of America and the children \nof America are depending on this very important legislation going \nthrough the process. We are talking about $60.7 billion, probably more \nthan that by the time it is completed, for agriculture in America. We \nneed to get it completed.\n  I know there are some issues that cause a lot of concern: How do you \ndeal with a disaster in America, when do you deal with it, and how \nwould any assistance be apportioned among the farmers that have been \nimpacted by disasters in a number of ways. And also, of course, we have \nthis very important dairy issue. I have advised Senator Cochran, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Kohl, and Senator Daschle to make sure \neverybody understands what I am doing here. I am doing it because I do \nthink it is so important that we move forward on this bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1499\n\n     (Purpose: To provide emergency and income loss assistance to \n                        agricultural producers)\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The vote on the cloture motion will occur Wednesday under \nRule XXII, unless agreement can be reached to set a time certain for \nthat vote.\n  I encourage Senators on all sides of this issue to communicate with \neach other and see if there is some accommodation that could be worked \nout so that both sides can find it acceptable. In the meantime, it is \nmy hope that we can continue to debate the important disaster relief \namendments.\n  I thank my colleagues. I am delighted to yield the floor to the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, or to Senator Daschle if he has \nany comment at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will be very brief. I thank the \nmajority leader for moving this process along to accommodate a \nprocedure that takes into account a number of very important matters \nthat we hope to resolve this week. I think this procedure will do it. I \nalso note for my colleagues that I designate the Senator from Iowa, the \nranking member of the committee, to be my designee in offering the \namendment.\n  The yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, as I understand the parliamentary \nsituation at this time, pending before the Senate is a second-degree \namendment to an amendment offered on behalf of the Democratic leader to \nprovide disaster assistance and economic assistance to our Nation's \nfarmers.\n  The amendment, which is the amendment in the second degree offered by \nthe majority leader on my behalf, provides a wide range of benefits to \nindividual farmers and ranchers who, under the terms of this \nlegislation, are eligible for disaster assistance because of economic \nlosses and disasters that have occurred by reason of vagaries in the \nweather and other conditions that will cause these farmers to undergo \nunusual hardship.\n  We think this amendment is better and a more sensitive approach to \nthe real needs of those involved in production agriculture than the \nproposal coming from the Democratic leader. Here is why. Most of the \nfunds that are appropriated in this amendment for economic and disaster \nassistance go directly to the agriculture producer who has been \nvictimized by floods or drought or economic catastrophes affecting his \nability to earn a profit this year.\n  On the other hand, much of the assistance that is appropriated or \nfunded in the Democrats' package goes to continue or expand Federal \nprograms, to enlarge programs. In other words, the money is going to \nthe Government to expand and administer programs that either have to \nwork, in some cases, or really do nothing to improve the farmer's \nability to derive income from his labor. So that is a major distinction \nthat I hope Senators will consider as they try to decide which of these \nproposals to support.\n\n  As Senators know, most of the funds that go to protect income, or \nsupport the production of agriculture commodities in our country, are \nin the form of assistance called AMTA payments. These payments are \ntransition payments that were begun under the last farm bill to prepare \nfarmers for the time when predictable subsidies under the old farm bill \nprogram are reduced and then finally eliminated. Over this 5-year \nperiod under this new farm law, the transition payments are made to \nhelp support farmers as they become accustomed to agriculture without \nthe benefit of the old subsidy payments. Farmers are now free to make \nplanting decisions, for example, for themselves, as indicated by the \ncondition of the market and the likelihood of crops being productive \nand efficiently produced, rather than what the Government tells them \nthey should produce under the restraints of Federal law.\n  Many farmers are beginning to make these decisions and shift from one \nprogram crop to another, without running the risk of losing Federal \nGovernment support. In order to show that the economic conditions and \nthe market conditions have been so severe as to cause farmers not to be \nable to operate profitably under the new transition payment system, \nthat payment is doubled under the Cochran amendment. And so instead of \nreceiving $5,000 as a transition payment, a person who is entitled to \nthat benefit under existing law this year will get twice that amount as \nan economic assistance payment from the Federal Government. A total of \n$5.54 billion will be paid to agriculture producers for market \ntransition payments under the Cochran amendment. This is a 100 percent \nincrease in a producer's 1999 payment under the existing farm bill.\n  Other benefits that are available to agriculture producers under this \namendment would include $500 million in direct payments to soybean and \noilseed producers; $350 million in assistance to livestock and dairy \nproducers, to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. The \namendment would also suspend the budget deficit reduction assessment on \nsugar producers for the remainder of the farm bill, as long as no \nFederal budget deficit exists.\n  There will be a direct payment provided in this amendment to \nproducers of quota and non-quota peanuts, equal to 5 percent of the \ncurrent loan rate. The Cotton Step Two Export Program is reinstated in \nthis amendment. There is an increase in the current loan deficiency \npayment limit from $75,000 to\n\n[[Page S9980]]\n\n$150,000. There is, additionally, a provision in this bill that \nexpresses the sense of the Congress, encouraging the President to be \nmore aggressive in strengthening trade negotiating authority for \nAmerican agriculture and expressing the Congress' objectives for future \nagriculture trade negotiations. The amendment also requests that the \nPresident evaluate and make recommendations on the effectiveness of our \nexisting export and food aid programs.\n  If you add up all of the direct benefits that are payable, they have \nbeen scored by the Congressional Budget Office as amounting to a total \nof $6.67 billion for fiscal year 2000. The added cost over the next 3 \nyears, from 2000 to 2004, would add another $309 million to the cost of \nthe bill, for a total of $6.979 billion in total cost from fiscal year \n2000 to 2004, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Madam President, Senators will remember that when we first brought \nthis bill from the committee to the floor of the Senate, there was a \ngreat deal of concern about whether or not there should be a disaster \nprogram included in a title of the bill. We had asked the \nadministration to submit a budget request for any funds that were \nexpected to be needed. We have had no response whatsoever from the \nadministration to that request. We attached that as an amendment in the \nCommittee on Appropriations. We discussed it on the floor of the Senate \nwhen this bill was before the Senate earlier, and I am very distressed \nthat we have yet to hear any request made by the administration for \nthis assistance. So in spite of the absence of cooperation in trying to \nidentify and work together on a program that would be sensitive to the \nproblems in production agriculture, we are moving to suggest to the \nSenate that this is a program that ought to be adopted.\n  I have additional comments to make. I will be glad to respond to \nquestions that may arise from Senators on the content of this \nlegislation to try to answer any questions that others may have. But I \nknow we will soon have a vote that is scheduled to occur on another \nbill that was debated in the Senate earlier today. In an effort to \naccommodate friends who have asked for time to talk on their amendment, \nI will yield the floor at this time so other Senators may speak.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator will yield. I \nwould like to ask the Senator a question.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I would be happy to respond to the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I didn't get a copy of the amendment. What is the bottom \nline? What is the total package?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Congressional Budget Office has scored the items I \ndiscussed at $6.67 billion for fiscal year 2000, and the total cost \nduring fiscal years 2000 to 2004 is scored at $6.979 billion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today all across America most people are \ndoing pretty well. Unemployment is at its lowest rate in years. The \nstock market keeps going up. Our gross national product is going up at \na great rate. As we now know, we have a surplus for the first time in \nalmost 30 years in the Federal budget. We just had a lengthy debate \nlast week on what we are going to do with that surplus. Our friends on \nthe other side want to take most of it and give it, through a tax \nbreak, to people mostly in the upper-income brackets.\n  If you just looked at that, you would think we shouldn't be worried \ntoo much about what is happening in America; things look pretty good.\n  Out of the glare of Wall Street, far from the floor of the New York \nStock Exchange, sort of silently and quietly, American farmers and \nranchers are losing their businesses. They are at the end of their \nrope. Our small towns and communities that dot our countryside are \nfacing a bleak winter, with the prospect that things will get even \nworse after the harvest is in and the snow falls.\n  The situation facing American agriculture today--according to \nbankers, farm economists, and agricultural economists from many of our \nuniversities--is the worst it has been since the Great Depression. We \nhave to respond to that. We have to respond in a way that is \nmeaningful. That is what our first-degree amendment does.\n  I listened to my friend from Mississippi describe this amendment. I \nguess my response basically would be, ``Nice try.'' Would it help \nfarmers? Would the Republican amendment help farmers? Why, sure. Any \nlittle bit would help. Does it get to the underlying problem? Does it \nreally help get our farmers through this winter and into next year? The \nanswer is no. It is hopelessly too short.\n  While I appreciate the effort by my friends on the Republican side to \ncome up with a last-minute amendment to perhaps put out a smokescreen \non what is really happening in agriculture and what we need to do to \nrespond to the crisis, it is a nice effort, but it really doesn't do \nit. Our hard-working, dedicated, progressive farmers and ranchers \nacross this country don't just need a little bit of a handout that the \nRepublican amendment will give them. What they need is a package of \nhelp that will not only get them through this summer and this fall but \nthrough next winter so they can get back on their feet again next year.\n  You will hear a lot of talk about how one of the problems is our lack \nof exports. I just want to point out that even though the United States \nhas a trade deficit, one sector that earns us money and that has a \npositive trade balance is agriculture. But there are those who would \nhave you believe it is because of the lack of exports that our farmers \nare in such bad shape. Here is the chart that puts the lie to that.\n\n  For wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans--the major commodities we \nexport--the exports are fully up this year over what they were in the \nprevious couple of years. We are exporting more. If we are exporting \nmore, what is the problem? The problem is, there is no price and \nfarmers aren't getting anything for their commodities.\n  Here is what has happened to soybeans just in my State of Iowa since \nthe fall of 1997: Basically about a 45-percent decrease in the value of \nthat crop. The same is true with corn. There have been precipitous \ndrops just in the last year and a half. It is not a lack of total \nexports. It is a lack of the money and the price that farmers are \ngetting.\n  While we need to get an emergency package of money out to farmers, we \nneed to do it now. We also have to be about changing the farm policy. \nWe cannot go on another year under the Freedom to Farm bill and be back \nhere again next year looking at another package of several billion \ndollars. The Freedom to Farm bill has failed miserably. It has failed \nour Nation. It has failed our farmers. It has failed our rural \ncommunities.\n  I have an article that was in the Kansas paper back in 1995 when we \npassed the Freedom to Farm bill by my friend from Kansas, Senator \nRoberts. He said:\n\n       Finally, Freedom to Farm enhances the farmer's total \n     economic situation. In fact, the bill results in the highest \n     net farm income over the next seven years of any proposal \n     before Congress.\n\n  I hate to say it to my friend from Kansas, but net farm income in key \nfarming areas is down dramatically. For the principal field crops, net \nfarm income is going to be down about 29 percent this year from the \naverage of the last 5 years. That is why we are facing one of the \ngreatest depressions in agriculture since the 1930s. That is why \nhalfhearted measures are not going to work. That is why the bill we \nhave come up with really does address the magnitude of the problem. It \nis deep, and it is a very large problem and one that has to be \naddressed efficiently.\n  The amendment that Senator Daschle and I, along with Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Kerrey, Senator Johnson, Senator Conrad, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Wellstone, Senator Lincoln, and Senator \nSarbanes have just sent to the desk provides for a total of $10.79 \nbillion to farmers and ranchers for this next year.\n  There is a great gulf of difference between what the Republicans have \nset up and what we are proposing. First, the Republicans are proposing \nthat we send all of this money out in a direct payment to farmers; an \nAMTA payment, it is called, a market transition payment. Our payments \ngo out in supplemental loan deficiency payments,\n\n[[Page S9981]]\n\nwhich means they are based upon a farmer's production--what that farmer \nactually produced this year, not what they did 10 or 20 years ago. In \nthat way, it is more fair and it is more direct to the actual farmers \nthis year. We include $2.6 billion for disaster assistance.\n  We include a number of other measures such as $212 million for \nemergency conservation. We have had a lot of floods and a lot of \ndamages in a lot of States. We need to repair the damage to farm and \nranch land and enhance our conservation. For emergency trade provision, \nwe have $978 million for purchases of commodities for humanitarian \nassistance. We have people starving all over the world. We have a \nPublic Law 480 food assistance program and related programs. Our bill \nprovides about $1 billion to take the surplus food we have and send it \naround the world to starving people. The Republican proposal does not \ninclude that.\n  We include money for emergency economic development for our rural \ntowns, small towns, and communities that are hit hard. Our total \npackage of $10.79 billion addresses the magnitude of the problem. It is \nthat big.\n  I say to the people who think $10.79 billion is a lot of money, we \npassed a tax break bill last week for $792 billion, most of which goes \nto upper-income people in this country. Very little will ever go to our \nfarmers and our ranchers around America.\n  This point in time is going to decide what happens to rural America \nthis winter. That is why it is so important to act now. That is why it \nis so important that we get the money out that is needed--not some \nhalfhearted measure in a way that doesn't address the real and \ndevastating economic problems that farmers have all over America.\n  I will have more to say about my amendment later.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My colleague asked me whether the Congressional Budget \nOffice had scored the amendment that I offered. I ask my colleague the \nsame question: What does the Congressional Budget Office say the \namendment that the Democratic leader has offered will cost the American \ntaxpayer over the next few years?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I answer to my friend from Mississippi that all of the \nitems in our amendment are direct appropriations for next year. The \nonly items that are not are the Cotton Step Two Export Program, and \nthat is scored by CBO at $439 million for 3 years, and the adjustment \nto the payment limitations.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Does that mean that the exact dollar amount set aside \nfor each of the programs such as the Wetlands Restoration Program, the \nEQIP program--which is an emergency conservation program--emergency \nwatershed program, all total $212 million in the bill?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is the amount of money provided for those items.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Emergency trade provisions, humanitarian assistance, \ncooperator program, for a total of $988 million; is that what the \nSenator is saying the CBO has verified the cost to be?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is the amount of money we specifically provide in \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield, and I want to thank the Senator \nfrom North Dakota with whom I serve on the agriculture appropriations \nsubcommittee.\n  I appreciate the very strong help in putting this package together. \nIt has been a very difficult year for farmers in North Dakota as well \nas Iowa and I can say without fear of contradiction the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has been one of the instrumental people in actually \nputting this package together.\n  I appreciate the support.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to address the question to the Senator from Iowa. \nThe discussion we had about income support for family farmers in the \nnature of a disaster program being income support in the form of a \ntransition payment or AMTA, the whole notion of a transition payment is \nto transition farmers out of a farm program into the free market.\n  This chart shows what has happened to the price of wheat since 1996. \nThis chart is similar to the corn chart and the price of corn which the \nSenator from Iowa shared. This is what has happened to the so-called \n``free market'' for wheat. The price of wheat has collapsed. The notion \nof a transition was philosophically by those in this Chamber who said \nlet's transition people out of a farm program.\n  Isn't that the base of an AMTA payment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I read the debate and all the talk on the Freedom to \nFarm bill when it passed, the idea was that we would transition out of \nfarm programs with AMTA payments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is the right subject and the right time; we are \ndebating the right issues. The Senator said it well. We have an economy \nthat is growing and prospering, more people are working, fewer people \nare unemployed, fewer people on welfare, inflation is down. So many \ngood things are going on in this country, but in rural America family \nfarmers are in desperate trouble through no fault of their own.\n  If any group of Americans found their income had collapsed, or if the \nsalary for Members of Congress had fallen where income for family \nfarmers had fallen, we would have dealt with this immediately and a \nlong time ago. The same is true with corporate earnings.\n  However, we are here through no fault of the family farmers but \nbecause they are trying to do business in a marketplace where prices \nhave just collapsed. If we don't take action soon, we won't have many \nfamily farmers left across the bread basket of the country.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is absolutely correct. The Freedom to Farm \nbill was premised that we would put farmers on the free market. As the \nSenator from Kansas said, they would have high net income for the next \nseveral years. However, Freedom to Farm ripped the safety net out from \nagriculture.\n  As I pointed out, our exports are up. We are exporting more of our \nkey commodities, but there is no price. The safety net has been taken \nout from underneath agriculture. Farmers all across America recognize \nthat Freedom to Farm has been a total and absolute disaster when it \ncomes to protecting farm income, and it has to be changed. That is why \nthe first thing we need to do is get the emergency package, but then we \nhave to address the end-of-the-line problem of Freedom to Farm.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I have a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I actually have three quick questions. First of all, \ndealing with the urgency of now, is it not true that the Senator from \nIowa and other Democrat Senators have tried to pass an emergency \nassistance package and we have been working on this for some time? \nWould the Senator from Iowa give a little bit of a historical \nbackground? I think farmers are wondering how much more has to happen \nto them before there is some assistance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Minnesota. I also thank him for \nhis help in putting this package together.\n  The Senator is right. We started this spring, in the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill, trying to add some money. We got beat \non a nearly straight party-line vote. All but one Republican voted no; \nDemocrats voted yes.\n  We then came back, as the Senator from Minnesota knows, and tried it \nagain in the subcommittee on this bill. We again lost on a straight \nparty-line vote.\n  Now we are on the floor. I will say we are making some progress. At \nleast now our friends on the other side recognize there is a problem. \nAt least they are willing to address it somewhat. The amendment that \nthe Senator from Mississippi sent to the desk is better than nothing, \nbut it is not going to do enough to help get our farmers through this \nwinter. It is only a little more than half of what is needed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I might ask my colleague from Iowa a second \nquestion to be clear about what is at stake--we will all have a chance \nto speak later. My colleague from Iowa says that what the Senator from \nMississippi introduces is an emergency assistance package for farmers \nto try to get some income out there to families, and my colleague says \nit does about half the job.\n\n[[Page S9982]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. A little bit over half. Give them the benefit of the \ndoubt-- about half, though.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Where are the gaps? In other words, I think people \nassume, if we pass something that we say is going to enable them to \ncontinue to stay on the farm until we deal with the structural \nproblems, it is going to help them. Again, could the Senator emphasize \nthe difference?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be delighted to respond to the Senator, but I \nunderstand our time is up.\n  Madam President, if I might inquire what the parliamentary situation \nis right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate resumes consideration of S. 335 in \n15 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand there is a vote at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further parliamentary inquiry. After that vote is over, \nwill we return then to the Agriculture appropriations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the end \nof that vote, when we return to this bill, the Senator from Iowa be \nrecognized to complete his statement. It will not take very long to \ncomplete my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none. It is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S9982-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9982-S9988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DECEPTIVE MAIL PREVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to vote on S. 335, after recognizing Senator Edwards for 10 \nminutes, Senator Levin for 5 minutes, and Senator Collins for 5 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 335, the \nDeceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, legislation authored by \nmy colleague from Maine, Senator Susan Collins. I applaud her \nleadership on this issue as chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations. I believe that this legislation strikes an important \nbalance between consumer protection and over-regulation of the \nsweepstakes industry.\n  This issue has long been a priority for me. In the late 1980s, while \nin the House of Representatives, I began working on initiatives to curb \ndeceptive mailings, and during the 101st Congress, I co-authored H.R. \n2331, the Deceptive Mailings Prevention Act of 1989, which was signed \ninto law by President Bush on November 6, 1990. H.R. 2331 prohibited \nsolicitations by private entities for the purchase of products or \nservices or the contribution of funds or membership fees, which imply \nfalse federal government connection or endorsement.\n  At the time, our main focus was on mailings that led one to believe \nthat they were endorsed by the government--for example, offers that \npromise consumers information on federal benefits for which they may be \neligible for a fee, when in fact such information is available at no \ncost directly from federal agencies.\n  The legislation barred the use of any seal, insignia, trade or brand \nname, or other symbol designed to construe government connection or \nendorsement. Today, I am pleased to support S. 335, which builds on the \nfoundation laid by the 1990 law, in recognition of the problems that \nhave emerged as sweepstakes offers have proliferated, with all of the \naccompanying abuses we have witnessed.\n  How many times have each of us received an offer in the mail \npromising enormous sweepstakes payoffs or other prizes? These promises \nare a clever way to market magazine subscriptions and other products. \nThe old adage--``if it's too good to be true, it probably is''--comes \nto mind. Regrettably, for many, such offers seem too good to pass up \nparticularly when the are accompanied by dire warnings such as ``urgent \nadvisory,'' ``don't risk losing your multimillion dollar prize,'' or \n``don't risk forfeiture now!'' Many consumers are misled by this type \nof advertising, which is deliberately designed to mislead.\n  Many offers are designed to entice the consumer into believing that \nhe or she has already won a valuable prize, for example, or is on the \nverge of winning, when in fact, the odds against winning may be \nastronomical.\n  The sad truth is that companies use deceptive advertising because it \nworks--it sells more product. And the tragic problem facing us today is \nthis: all too often, the consumer who is being victimized is a senior \non a fixed income or is disabled.\n  We have all heard the horror stories about unwitting victims on fixed \nincomes who have purchased hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of \nmagazine subscriptions--sometimes multiple subscriptions to the same \nmagazine, thinking they would improve their chances of winning a prize. \nWe have heard the tragic accounts of individuals flying to another city \nor state to claim a prize, genuinely believing that they had been \nselected as the winner, only to find that they have become a victim. \nSome have squandered life savings on misleading offers. When these \ntypes of incidents become commonplace, I think, we have a good \nindication that there is a problem. And we have a responsibility to \ncorrect the problem.\n\n  What I find most troubling about this issue is that many unscrupulous \ncompanies intentionally target the most vulnerable consumers, knowing \nfull well how devastating the results can be. S. 355 is designed to \ntarget these those companies that have demonstrated that they will not \npolice themselves.\n  Among other things, S. 335 requires sweepstakes mailings to display \nrules clearly and state explicitly that no purchase is necessary to \nincrease one's chance of winning. It requires the sponsor of an offer \nto clearly state the odds of winning and the value of the prize, and \nprohibits companies from making false statements, such as an individual \nis a winner, unless they have actually won a prize. It also strengthens \nsafeguards to protect those who have requested not to receive \nsweepstakes mailings and other such offers, and enhances the Postal \nService's authority to investigate, penalize, and stop deceptive \nmailings.\n  S. 335 does not prohibit legitimate offers. Rather, it puts fair, \ncommon sense restrictions in place in order to protect consumers, \nparticularly those most at risk, such as seniors, or the disabled.\n  This week, the Senate Commerce Committee, of which I am a member, is \nscheduled to hold a hearing on fraud against seniors. It is a serious \nproblem, and one that is not going to go away on its own. We must \naddress the problem, and the deceptive mailings which S. 335 seeks to \ncurb are certainly a component of this problem.\n  I am pleased that S. 335 has generated so much debate on this issue, \nbecause I believe that in addition to government action, the key to \nthis challenge is increased awareness and personal responsibility--on \nthe part of companies and individual consumers and families.\n  Companies should police themselves. Likewise, there are steps that \nconsumers can take to protect themselves. For example, always read the \nrules for any offer very carefully, especially if it sounds too good to \nbe true. And if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you \nreceive a letter in the mail informing you that you have won a prize, \nand it solicits a shipping or handling fee, be wary. This type of offer \nshould raise a red flag, and could be a fraud. Finally, make sure you \nknow the company is a reputable one, and don't give out your bank \naccount or credit card number.\n  I hope this legislation will be a constructive step forward in this \nimportant effort, and I hope that it sends a strong message that \ngovernment takes its responsibility as a watchdog and regulator of \nanti-consumer practices very seriously.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, today the Senate is taking another \nimportant step toward enacting sweepstakes reform legislation.\n  Today we continue the good fight that was launched nearly fourteen \nmonths ago when the Senate first began consideration of sweepstakes \nreform legislation. I was pleased to lead the fight for sweepstakes \nreform on June 5th, 1998, in the 105th Congress, when I introduced S. \n2414, the Honesty\n\n[[Page S9983]]\n\nin Sweepstakes Act of 1998. This was the first legislation of its kind.\n  A few months later, on September 1st, 1998, a high-impact Senate \nhearing focusing on the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1998 attracted \nnational attention and widespread public support. That hearing, \nfollowed by a series of hearings chaired by Senator Collins this year, \nwas the turning point in the battle for sweepstakes reform and helped \ngenerate the powerful momentum that has carried sweepstakes reform \nforward.\n  I was prompted to fight for Honesty in Sweepstakes when I heard far \ntoo many horrible stories about how consumers, especially our seniors, \nwere being taken advantage of, and all too often seriously financially \nharmed by sweepstakes promotions that prey upon people's hopes and \ndreams by making convincing yet false promises of riches. They use \nmassive mailing lists to deliberately target our most vulnerable \nconsumers with false promises of riches and then bombard them again and \nagain.\n  Since I first introduced the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act I have been \ncontacted by many people from Colorado and all over the country with \nstories of their unfortunate experiences with sweepstakes promotions. \nThey told stories of how their loved ones, often their elderly parents, \nhad squandered many thousands of dollars after having been lured in by \ncleverly presented promotions promising instant riches. Many people \nfrom all over the country have also sent me large envelopes stuffed \nfull of examples of the misleading sweepstakes promotions they and \ntheir loved ones have received.\n  I am pleased to be an early cosponsor of the bill we consider today, \nS. 335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, which was \nintroduced by my colleague Senator Collins. This bill includes a number \nof provisions similar to those I included in the Honesty in Sweepstakes \nAct. There are two additional provisions included in S. 335 that I \nbelieve will be especially beneficial in the fight against misleading \nsweepstakes. The first calls for establishing centralized and easy to \naccess toll free phone numbers where consumers' questions can be \nanswered. The second provision makes it much easier for people to have \ntheir names removed from mailing lists.\n  Our nation's seniors and other vulnerable consumers are clearly being \ntaken advantage of, and in some cases seriously financially harmed, by \nintentionally misleading sweepstakes promotions. Something needs to be \ndone. I support passage of this legislation to bring this harmful \npractice to a halt.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 335, the \nDeceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act. I am proud to be one of \nthe cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  I commend Senators Collins and Levin for their efforts in addressing \nthe serious problems with deceptive mailings involving sweepstakes, \nskill contests, facsimile checks, and mailings made to look like \ngovernment documents. The investigation and hearings of the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations have shed \nlight on sweepstakes and other mailings that promise extravagant prizes \nin order to entice individuals to make unnecessary purchases.\n  Far too many of these mailings are full of deceptive and misleading \nstatements, which lead unsuspecting recipients to believe that they \nmust purchase various items in order to be a winner or in order to \nimprove their chances of winning. In too many cases, the prizes and \nawards are never granted. In many instances, the customer receives a \ntrinket or coupon book of little value. Those consumers who respond to \nthese mailings are then bombarded with additional mailings seeking more \nmoney for the same or similar items.\n  The effect on many consumers can be devastating. One of my \nconstituents wrote about his 88-year-old father, who had spent \nthousands of dollars in hopes of receiving a large cash prize.\n  This legislation would set new standards for mailings that use \nsweepstakes, skill contests, and facsimile checks as promotions to sell \nmerchandise. More disclosures would be required, disclosures which are \nclear and conspicuous, displayed in a manner that is readily \nnoticeable, readable and understandable. Sweepstakes mailings must \ninclude prominent notice that no purchase is necessary to win, and that \na purchase will not increase the chances of winning. In addition, the \nmailing must state the estimated odds of winning.\n  While S. 335 will probably not put a stop to all of the egregious \npractices that the unscrupulous companies employ, I am hopeful that \nthis bill will result in fewer deceptive mailings and that fewer \nconsumers will lose their hard-earned savings and retirement funds.\n  One important provision of this bill would require each company that \nsends these mailings to have a toll-free number that consumers may call \nto have their names removed from that company's mailing list. This is a \nfirst step in making it possible for individuals to have their names \nremoved from mailing lists. However, this particular system places an \nundue burden on the consumer to call each company that sends him a \nmailing. The unscrupulous companies could circumvent the intent of this \nprovision by forming a new company that would then use the old mailing \nlists.\n  To minimize this risk, I encourage the industry groups to establish a \nsystem whereby consumers would have one toll-free number to call which \nwould serve as the mechanism to remove their names from all mailing \nlists for all sweepstakes, skill contests, facsimile checks and \ngovernment look-alike mailings. This system has worked in other areas, \nand I believe that it would work here, as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of the sweepstakes legislation, which is S. 335, the \nDeceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act.\n  Let me say first, I thank my colleague, Senator Levin--I do not see \nhim on the floor right now--also, my colleague, Senator Collins. They \nworked so hard and so long on this remarkably important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Let me start by telling a story. It is a story I have told before, \nbut I think it goes to the very heart of what this legislation is \nabout.\n  There is an elderly man in North Carolina who lives in Raleigh, NC, I \nbelieve--right outside of Raleigh--named Bobby Bagwell. Bobby Bagwell \nis an elderly man who was watched over by his family, his daughter-in-\nlaw. Although he lived alone, he had a difficult time living alone.\n  His daughter-in-law went over to his house one day. When going \nthrough his various belongings, she discovered boxes and boxes of \nsweepstakes mailings. She came to discover in addition to that, in \nresponse to these sweepstakes mailings, Mr. Bagwell had purchased \nthousands and thousands of dollars of devices--goods that were \nbasically useless. They were of no value to him at all. When she \nquestioned her father-in-law about why he had bought these goods, the \nresponse was that he believed it would increase his chances of winning \nthe sweepstakes. He had spent, I think, something on the order of \n$20,000, which was basically his life's savings, on purchasing this \nuseless, worthless material.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Bagwell was an elderly man. For that \nreason, he was vulnerable. But there is an even worse part to this \nstory. Mr. Bagwell, as it turns out, suffers from dementia. So he could \nnot remember from day to day what he had bought, how much money he had \nspent, or why he had spent it. His daughter-in-law, doing everything in \nher power to do something about this very sad situation, contacted the \nsweepstakes companies, asking them to take him off the mailing lists. \nShe got no response. She then sent a doctor's order to the sweepstakes \ncompanies saying, ``My father-in-law suffers from dementia. I ask you, \ntake him off your lists for sweepstakes mailings because he is buying \nall these goods, he doesn't remember that he is spending his life's \nsavings, and we need to take him off the lists so he does not continue \nto engage in this kind of behavior.'' For the second time, she got no \nresponse.\n  Finally, when they contacted me and I became aware of the situation \nand I contacted the sweepstakes companies,\n\n[[Page S9984]]\n\nthey responded appropriately and took him off the lists.\n  The sad part of this story is that in this country, in this day and \ntime, it was necessary for a Senator to contact the sweepstakes \ncompanies in order to get this accomplished. That goes to the very \nheart of what this sweepstakes legislation is about. It is the reason \nSenator Collins has done such a remarkable job in conducting hearings \nand bringing this matter to the attention of the American people so \nsomething can be done about it. It is something for which I believe we \nhave broad bipartisan support, support on both sides of the aisle. \nEveryone knows and recognizes something needs to be done about this \nproblem.\n  I do want to discuss one specific feature. The bill has many \nwonderful provisions, including provisions that require the sweepstakes \ncompanies, for example, to tell people that buying these goods does not \nincrease their chances of winning. That would save a man such as Bobby \nBagwell from being taken advantage of.\n  One specific provision I worked on awfully hard, with Senator Collins \nand Senator Levin, basically provides that sweepstakes companies be \nrequired to provide a vehicle for people to be taken off these mailing \nlists so someone such as Bobby Bagwell, who has dementia, an elderly \nperson who is being taken advantage of, who is vulnerable, can be \nprotected and can be taken off the lists. In addition to that, it helps \nevery North Carolinian--in my case--and every American who simply does \nnot want to continue to receive these sweepstakes mailings.\n\n  We all recognized during the course of the hearings there are some \nreputable, legitimate companies that engage in these sweepstakes \ntechniques as a marketing tool. But people need to have a way to get \noff these lists if they want to get off the lists. One of the \nprovisions in this legislation specifically provides for that.\n  The bottom line is this. This legislation goes a long way toward \neliminating any sort of deceptive, misleading sweepstakes mailings. It \nallows people who do not want to receive these mailings to no longer \nreceive them. Ultimately, what it does is it empowers American families \nwho want to make sure the elderly members of their families--their \nparents, their in-laws--are taken care of. It empowers them to make \nsure they are not taken advantage of with these sweepstakes mailings, \nand in fact, if they so choose, that they no longer continue to receive \nthese mailings.\n  This is a wonderful piece of legislation. As I mentioned earlier, it \nhas bipartisan support. I am very proud to have worked with Senator \nCollins and Senator Levin, who have done a tremendous job for the \nAmerican people in connection with this legislation.\n  Lastly, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons be printed in the Record. They \nspecifically provide their strong support for this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. John Edwards,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Edwards: AARP thanks you for including a \n     provision to the Managers Amendment to S. 335, the Deceptive \n     Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, to institute a \n     notification system. As drafted, the notification system \n     would provide consumers with numbers to call to have their \n     names removed from the mailing lists of companies that \n     promote products and services through sweepstakes. The \n     ability to have one's name removed from mailing lists is an \n     important consumer protection, and facilitating such removal \n     through the use of a toll free number is even better for \n     consumers.\n       AARP has supported the use of toll free helplines to \n     respond to questions or concerns in the telemarketing area, \n     and the requirement that companies provide such a service to \n     slow the proliferation of deceptive mailings is a logical \n     extension. Further, we applaud the amendment's strong civil \n     penalty provisions imposed on companies that violate a \n     consumer's request.\n       AARP appreciates your efforts on behalf of consumers to \n     eradicate the practice of fraudulent sweepstakes mailings \n     through this provision to the Manager's Amendment to S. 335. \n     We strongly support the ``notification system'' provisions \n     that you authored, and hope that this section of the bill \n     will be retained as it works its way through conference. We \n     look forward to working with you and other Members on a bi-\n     partisan basis to ensure that this issue is resolved in the \n     106th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Horace B. Deets,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I again commend Senator Collins for her \nreally strong leadership of our subcommittee in so many consumer \nprotection measures. This is just the latest of many on which Senator \nCollins has been the leader. That leadership is critically important to \nthe American people. I commend her on it.\n  I also want to single out Senator Edwards. He made a major \ncontribution to this bill by making it possible for people who no \nlonger want to receive these sweepstakes to call a phone number to stop \nthe deluge of mail which is received in so many homes. As in so many \nother areas, he is already making a great contribution to this Senate. \nI especially thank him for his contribution to this bipartisan bill. \nThat part of this bill is a very important part. It is a very creative \npart of the bill. Again, it makes it possible, in a very practical way, \nfor people who get sick and tired of the swamping of their mailboxes \nwith these sweepstakes offers, to end that.\n  This bill attempts to end these sweepstakes swindles which are \nswamping our Nation. The sweepstakes scams are part of a $1 billion \nindustry, an industry which is too often based on deception, an \nindustry which too often tells people they have won a prize, dangles in \nfront of them that promised prize, and then, of course, encloses the \npromotional materials that create the impression that buying a product \nwill help to get that prize.\n  Most people are skeptical when they get this mail. They realize there \ncould be 100,000 people who are told they have just won a huge amount \nof money, but there is a significant percentage of our people who are \nmisled. The companies that do this prey on some of the most vulnerable \namong us and they take special advantage of our seniors. This is shown, \nin particular, when somebody responds to one of these promotions and \nthen they are frequently inundated with followup targeted promotions. \nIn fact, according to one of our witnesses, one person could get as \nmany as 144 mailings from one company in 1 year and that, by the way, \nis one of the larger companies that does that, one of the so-called \nlegitimate companies.\n  Our bill is aimed at ending the abuses and the deceptions and the \nscams. It will require the companies that are using these sweepstakes \nto display clearly and conspicuously and in a prominent place and in a \nprominent manner a statement that no purchase is necessary to enter the \ncontest and, even more important, in my judgment at least, a statement \nsaying that a purchase will not improve their chances of winning.\n  There are other requirements in this bill, and they are important \nrequirements, but I think those are two of the most important \nrequirements that we do now impose on an industry to see if we can \nclean up some of these abuses.\n  We also give the Postal Service some long-needed tools to put the \nscam artists out of business. The Postal Service will have subpoena \nauthority. The Postal Service will no longer have to take two steps \nbefore clamping down on the deception; they will be able to do it in \none step. If the representation is deceptive and violates our bill, the \nPostal Service will be able to end it directly and not have to first go \nthrough an order which, in turn, will have to be violated as is the \ncurrent law.\n  If someone violates the law, they should not need two steps. One step \nought to be enough to stop the violation and punish the perpetrator. \nThis bill is intended to close the loopholes in our law, to end the \ndeceptions that permit too many of these sweepstakes to take in too \nmany people, usually too many vulnerable people, raising hundreds of \nmillions of dollars from people who usually cannot afford the dollars \nthey are scammed into sending to the deceptive mailers of some of these \nsweepstakes.\n  Madam President, again, I commend the Senator from Maine, Ms. \nCollins, for her very strong leadership, and the other members of our \ncommittee who have participated, including Senator Cochran who has been \na leader in this\n\n[[Page S9985]]\n\nand, again, Senator Edwards for his major contribution to this bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Domenici and Senator Feingold be added as \ncosponsors to the pending legislation S. 335.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, let me start by expressing my deep \nappreciation to the members of the subcommittee and the full committee \nwho worked so closely with me on this legislation. In particular, I \nrecognize the enormous contributions of the Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin; the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Edwards; and the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, Mr. Cochran. Without their help, we would not have \nbeen able to craft such an effective bill. I am very grateful for their \nassistance and support.\n  We have heard very eloquent statements from a number of Senators \ntoday about the need for this legislation. In closing this debate, let \nme quote from a 74-year-old woman who wrote to me about how deceptive \nsweepstakes put her deeply into debt. In her letter, she said:\n\n       My only source of income is a monthly Social Security check \n     totaling $893. I estimate that I have spent somewhere between \n     $10,000 and $20,000 in the last 19 years. What money I did \n     not have, I borrowed from my daughter who is now responsible \n     for my total financial support. I am deeply in financial \n     debt. Their mailings were worded in such a way that I was \n     certain I was going to win anywhere from $1 million to $10 \n     million. I truly wish I could recoup the moneys that I \n     squandered in the hope that a real payoff would come my way.\n\n  Unfortunately, it is too late for this woman, but today the Senate \ncan act to avoid financial hardship, wasted savings, and a great deal \nof heartache for countless other vulnerable citizens by passing this \nlegislation.\n  It is my hope that we will have a very strong vote today and that it \nwill prompt the House to act and we will see this important legislation \nsigned into law before we adjourn this year.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I ask for the yeas and nays. I \nthink they have already been ordered, but if they have not, I request \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, be added as a cosponsor of the \nbill S. 335.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the substitute amendment, as amended, is agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand the parliamentary situation \nis that we are now back on the Agriculture appropriations bill. The \npending amendment is the Cochran amendment to the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator from Iowa asked unanimous consent before we \npermitted discussion of the Collins bill that he be recognized \nfollowing the vote.\n  I am rising to clarify the situation, and also to inquire how long \nthe distinguished Senator is planning to speak at this point. I am \nhopeful that there will be time for the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Lugar, who is chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, to \nspeak for about 30 minutes. He has to chair a committee hearing in the \nmorning beginning at 9 o'clock and won't be available tomorrow morning. \nI am hopeful the Senator will either let Senator Lugar proceed now or \nafter a reasonable time for the Senator to then be recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  That is the purpose of my inquiry of the Senator from Iowa. I did not \nobject when the Senator sought unanimous consent to be recognized \nbecause I thought I had talked about 15 minutes and the Senator had \ntalked about the same period of time, or maybe a little longer. That is \nthe purpose of my inquiry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Traci \nParmenter, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges for the \nduration of the debate on the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Mississippi that I \ndon't intend to talk too much longer. I did want to engage in a \ncolloquy with a couple of Senators who wanted to do so. I don't imagine \nit will take that long--a little bit of time, not that long.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator for his clarification.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We will not take that long. As the Senator knows, I have \ntremendous respect for my chairman of the Agriculture Committee. But I \nwanted to wrap up our presentation with a short colloquy with my fellow \nSenators prior to yielding the floor. If I might, Mr. President, let me \ntry to conclude the remarks that I had earlier.\n  Did the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. No. My question of the Senator was how much longer he \nthought he would take. This is for the purpose of advising my friend \nfrom Indiana how long he would sit on the floor and listen to your \ncolloquy, or whatever it is the Senator intends to do, or for how long \nthe Senator intends to do it. It is just a question. I am not \nsuggesting the Senator does not have the right to talk all night, if he \nwishes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am not going to talk all night.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator from Iowa has the floor. I am just curious \nabout how much time he might take, or could we interrupt the remarks \nand let the Senator from Indiana proceed?\n  Mr. HARKIN. About 15 minutes--perhaps not that long.\n  Let me conclude my earlier remarks. Quite frankly, I find myself in a \nvery uncomfortable position. This is extremely uncomfortable for me. I \nthink the pending amendments are the ultimate statement on the failure \nof the current farm policy. Why do I say it is uncomfortable for me? \nBecause I don't like it when farmers have to rely on government \npayments because they are not getting enough from the marketplace.\n  I am uncomfortable with an amendment that provides above $10 billion \nin support for our farmers. I find myself extremely uncomfortable. That \nis why I view what we are doing here as part of a two-step process. \nFirst, we must get the emergency money; but second, we have to change \nthe underlying failures of the Freedom to Farm bill or we will be right \nback where we are again next year, asking for billions more in \nemergency payments to deal with the crisis in the farm economy.\n  Our farm policy now is based on cash payments. Now we are back here \ntalking about even more cash payments. We are forced into this \nsituation because the underlying farm policy is wrong. And that is how \nthe Republicans' proposal is shaped. It is a stopgap gesture based on \nAMTA payments.\n\n[[Page S9989]]\n\n So naturally, the larger farmers with the larger base acreages are \ngoing to get the most money. This policy goes against what government \nprograms ought to be. Government programs ought to be for those who are \nin need. This amendment stands that principle on its head. The \nRepublican proposal will give most of the money to the biggest farmers \nunder the so-called AMTA payments. Our proposal offers a more equitable \ndistribution by providing the assistance to producers who are actually \non the farm right now and in relation to what they are growing now--not \nwhat they grew 20 or more years ago. That is a big difference between \nthe two approaches.\n  The Republicans' said they wanted to get rid of the old farm programs \nwhen they passed Freedom to Farm, but their AMTA type payments are \nbased on that very same outdated base acreage and payment yield system \nthat is decades old. And quite frankly, with the AMTA system, payments \ncan go to someone who is not even trying to grow a crop and has not \nincurred those expenses. And the benefits of AMTA payments are too \neasily claimed by absentee landlords. They could be long gone and \nliving in--Palm Beach, Miami, or retired in southern Texas or someplace \nelse. Our proposal is designed to provide the money to real farmers who \nare actually farming and trying to grow crops.\n  I might also add one other thing: We are facing some terrible \ndisaster conditions around the country. I know out in the upper Midwest \nwe have had floods and excessive moisture that have prevented planting, \nin the Dakotas for example, and we have had terrible floods and \nrainstorms in parts of Iowa. We are facing a tremendous drought on the \neastern seaboard among the Atlantic coastal States where we also have \nfarmers who are in dire straits.\n  In our package, we have over $2 billion for disaster-related \nassistance. The Republican package has zero dollars to help farmers \nsurvive disasters, not for those on the Eastern seaboard suffering that \nterrible drought or others undergoing disasters. That is another big \ndifference because these are truly farmers in need. They need help. Our \nbill has that help for them; the Republican bill doesn't.\n  Those are the two major differences I see. I will have more to say \ntomorrow about the Freedom to Farm bill. Freedom to Farm had a lot of \ncheerleaders when it passed a few years ago, saying how great it would \nbe. Those cheers ring hollow now. The proof of the pudding is in the \neating. Quite frankly, farmers are going broke. And they know it is a \nfailure. It has not protected farm.\n  We must change the underlying farm policy. We need to get loan rates \nup. We had a bipartisan group of State representatives and Senators \nfrom Iowa here last week, Republicans and Democrats. They had a \nproposal for us: Raise the loan rates, allow the Secretary of \nAgriculture to extend commodity loans and provide storage payments to \nfarmers, all of which I support. I said: You are talking to the wrong \nperson; you ought to talk to the backers of Freedom to Farm. Don't try \nto convince me, I am for it.\n\n  We ought to raise the loan rates. We ought to provide for storage \npayments. We ought to extend the loans. I think that is what we will \ncome back and try to do in September, the second part of our two-step \nprocess.\n  The name Freedom to Farm reminds me of a conversation a little bit \nago when it was asked, is there anything good about the bill. I said \nabout the only thing good in the Freedom to Farm bill is the name \n``freedom.''\n  But considering where the farm economy is now, I am reminded of the \nwords in the Janis Joplin song. ``Freedom is just another word for \nnothin' left to lose.'' How accurate that is when it comes to the farm \ncrisis. For our farmers, the word ``freedom'' in the Freedom to Farm \nbill, is just another word for ``nothin' left to lose.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, every time I'm home, farmers are saying \nto me: We appreciate some assistance so we can live to be able to farm \nanother day, but we want to know whether we or our children or \ngrandchildren will have any future? How are you going to deal with the \nprice crisis? What are you going to do to change the direction that \nthis freedom to farm bill has taken us?\n  Farmers focus on the structural issues. They want Members to write a \nnew farm bill. They don't want a bail out every year. They want to be \nable to get a decent price in the marketplace. They want a fair shake. \nThat is all they want.\n  I ask my colleague from Iowa, also my friend from North Dakota, what \nshould we be focusing on here in the U.S. Senate beyond this emergency \nassistance package to make sure that farmers can get a decent price, \nand that family farmers can be able to make a living and their children \ncan farm and our rural communities can flourish?\n  Mr. HARKIN. In responding to my friend from Minnesota, I was meeting \nwith farmers this week in Iowa talking about our emergency package. On \nmore than one occasion the farmers got up and said: We appreciate what \nyou are trying to do. We can sure use the money. But if all you are \ngoing to do is send out another check and we are going to have the \nFreedom to Farm bill again next year, it isn't going to work because we \nwill be even deeper in the hole next year.\n  They are begging Congress to change this policy.\n  I tell my friend from Minnesota what I hear most often from them is \nthey have to have a better price, they have to be able to market their \ngrain more efficiently, and they need some limited kinds of \nconservation land idling program shorter than 10 years.\n  The vast majority of farmers I talked to said we have to get our \nsupply and demand in line. The only way we will get them in line \nanytime soon is if we have some land out of production. With short-term \nland retirement, something to take land out for conservation purposes \nfor 2 years, or 3 years at the most, where they get some economic \nbenefit for that, coupled with higher loan rates and the extension of \nthe loan and storage payments, we can start to get some stability and \nget the farm economy back on track.\n  This past weekend as well as on other Iowa visits, farmers are \ntelling me if we don't change the underlying farm bill it will get \nworse next year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think the points being made here are important to \nunderstand. If all we do is to pass a disaster relief package and do \nnothing to change the underlying farm bill, we will not have addressed \nproblems in a way that gives family farmers hope that there is a \nfuture.\n  Let me ask the Senator about the underlying farm bill. The underlying \nfarm bill, the Freedom to Farm bill, has put us in a position where \npayments were made to farmers early on when farm prices were very high \nand farmers didn't need those payments. Now, when farm prices have \ncollapsed and farmers need a bigger payment, they are still getting the \nsame payment or a lower payment than they were getting when prices were \nhigh.\n  In other words, there is a disconnection with respect to need. \nFreedom to Farm, was it not, was a transition payment. It was to \ntransition them out of the farm program. That was the philosophical \nunderpinning of the farm bill.\n  Is it the judgment of the Senator from Iowa that while we do this--\nand it is urgent that we must do this, pass some disaster relief bill--\nthat we also must accompany that with a change in the underlying farm \nbill, sooner rather than later, because if we do not, those farmers who \nare making decisions about the future will have to decide there is no \nhope ahead?\n  Freedom to Farm means there are lower price supports even when prices \ncollapse. Isn't it true that this must be the first step in a two-step \nprocess?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I could not agree more. I would proffer this. If all we \ndo is pass this emergency package, either this one or the scaled-down \npackage of the Republicans, and we do nothing else, farmers are going \nto see the handwriting on the wall. If we do not change that Freedom to \nFarm bill, they are going to see it and they will say, I'm going to be \nright back where I am again next year. Farmers are going to say, I'm \ngetting out. They will be leaving in droves. It will drive farmers out.\n  In the State of Iowa, from April of 1998 to April of 1999, land \nprices in Central Iowa have gone down 11 percent already. The Governor \nof Iowa was at a\n\n[[Page S9990]]\n\nmeeting I held in Iowa this weekend. He said, when the legislature left \n3 months ago, when they went out of session, they estimated the growth \nin revenues at 1.8 percent. It is now down to 1 percent. That is going \nto affect our schools and everything else in the State of Iowa. So the \nbroader impacts on Iowa's economic health are already being felt. It is \nalready happening.\n  I have had people tell me if all we are going to do is put the money \nout there, it will help them some with their debts, it will help them \nget through the next few months, help them get through the harvest, but \nif we do not change the Freedom to Farm bill, they are out, they are \nnot going to be there next year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. May I ask one further question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Payments, as I understand them, have gone too far in the \ncurrent farm bill, the underlying farm bill; too high in the disaster \nprograms. Perhaps both programs should be adjusted lower. My \nunderstanding of the program that has been offered earlier today, by \nthe majority party, is with the triple-entity rule, the payment limits \nwould effectively, under that rule, be about $460,000--under their \ndisaster package. In my judgment, that is too high. In my judgment, we \nshould craft a farm program and craft disaster programs that target \nhelp for family-size farms. If that is not what it is about, my feeling \nhas always been, if we are not targeting help to family farmers, we \ndon't need a Department of Agriculture. The only reason to have all of \nthis is to help family farmers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is onto something regarding payment \nlimitations. In the Republicans' proposal, the maximum payments that an \nindividual can receive--by setting up partnerships or corporations to \nmaneuver around the limits--would be $460,000. Nearly half a million \ndollars to one individual.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might--\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I think we ought to be here to help people who \nreally need some help and get it out. To me, that is going way beyond \nthe bounds there.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might again just inquire, I had computed it under \nthe three-entity rule, what they could achieve. If I have missed part \nof that and they can achieve $460,000, it simply makes the point; \n$300,000 is too much. Mr. President, $460,000 is way out of bounds. We \nought to be trying to get a reasonable amount of support during this \nprice collapse to family-size farms.\n  I come from ag country, but I will not support giving $300,000 to \nanybody in farm country. We don't need that. That is not what a farm \nprogram ought to be about, in disaster help or in regular help, when \nprices collapse. That is not supporting a family-size farm; that is \nspending taxpayers' money in support of farm operations far in excess \nof family farms. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n  Again, when I inquired of the Senator from Iowa, I was thinking of \nthe repeal of the three-entity rule. If there is another device that \ngoes above the $300,000, that simply compounds the aggravation with \nrespect to who is going to get this money and how much. Let us find a \nway.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa, isn't our job here to craft a decent \ndisaster bill, first, that gets the most help possible to family-size \nfarms and, second, to decide we must follow it quickly by saying the \ncurrent farm bill doesn't work, that is obvious to everyone--obvious \nbecause we have to pass disaster bills every year now--and we should \nchange the underlying farm bill in the same way that provides real help \nto family farmers so when prices collapse they have a chance to \nsurvive?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond to my friend from North Dakota: These big cash \npayments are an inherent part of the Freedom to Farm bill--an inherent \npart of it. A lot of that money goes to the big operators. Yet we have \nour family farmers out there who are just trying to get by.\n  That is why this Freedom to Farm bill--I wish I could say just one \ngood thing--the only good thing about Freedom to Farm was flexibility. \nIt gave the farmer planting flexibility. But as the Senator from North \nDakota might remember, when we were debating the farm bill, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota offered an amendment to provide the planting \nflexibility to farmers and still have a farm program that provided \nhigher loan rates and storage payments and some set-asides within the \nconfines of the farm program. If I am not mistaken, it was the Senator \nfrom North Dakota who offered the amendment to provide the flexibility \nto farmers to plant what they wanted, where they wanted, and yet it was \ndefeated on a party-line vote.\n  So there were those who sold to the farmers the Freedom to Farm bill \non the basis that they would have planting flexibility. But we did so \nin our proposal. We provided planting flexibility in our alternative--I \nbelieve it was the Senator from North Dakota who offered it----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Conrad, the other Senator from North Dakota, \noffered it. That was to provide that planting flexibility. We were all \nfor that. There was no one here who was not for that. I think farmers \nby and large got very confused by that. They were told by our friends \non the other side of the aisle you had to have Freedom to Farm to get \nflexibility. That is not so. What happened with Freedom to Farm is that \nit took away the safety net and we are in the situation we are in right \nnow. I repeat, for emphasis' sake, these big cash payments are an \ninherent part of the Freedom to Farm bill.\n  I will yield for one more question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will say to my colleagues--and I know they are \nwaiting to speak, and I will soon be done after just a final question--\nI apologize you have to wait.\n  I especially say that to Senator Grassley since he was gracious \nenough, when I was in Iowa, to tell me if I needed a place to stay, I \ncould stay at his farm. I much appreciated it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. He would have fed you pretty well, too.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know. I am going to do it next time for sure.\n  Let me ask one more question, and before I do, I ask unanimous \nconsent--if tomorrow morning we are going to be in debate as well--that \nI could have 15 minutes to speak on this.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, what is the request?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I was asking whether or not tomorrow morning we are \nalso going to be in debate on this and that I could have 15 minutes to \nspeak on it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am constrained to object to any request to speak in \nthe morning. We have not had an announcement as to what time we are \ncoming in or how the bill will be handled. The usual rules of seeking \nrecognition I think probably will apply tomorrow.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. OK. Let me ask my colleague: My friend from North \nDakota made the distinction between agriculture and family farmers; his \npassion is for the producers, the family farmers. Beyond this \nassistance bill, we would like to see something that would help people \ncontinue to survive. In Minnesota, on August 21, we are going to have a \nRural Crisis Unity Day with a whole congressional delegation there to \nmeet with the farmers and business people and all, really, of rural \nMinnesota. Does he think it would be helpful for people to say: We need \nyou to do something about the price crisis; we need you to do something \nto make sure we get a fair shake; we need you to make sure it is not \njust for Cargill, it is for family farmers; it is not just for IBP or \nthe packers--it is not for the packers, it is for the producers? Do you \nthink this is the kind of thing we are going to need to see in many of \nour agricultural States over the next several months to come, to put \nthe pressure on the House and Senate to pass a bill for family farmers \nas opposed to these big conglomerates?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Minnesota, I hope each of us in \nour own capacity would understand what is happening out there right \nnow. We are not blind. We are not deaf. We are not without the \ncapability of going out in the countryside and talking to farmers and \nlistening to them. We all do that.\n  If we have eyes to see and ears to hear and a decent knowledge of \nwhat is happening on the farms, I hope we will not have to have all the \nrallies and have farmers come to big meetings to try to impress upon us \nthis need. I daresay, however, the way things are going that will \nhappen.\n  If we do not address the underlying aspects of the Freedom to Farm \nbill,\n\n[[Page S9991]]\n\nyou are going to get more and more farmers out to these meetings, \nespecially after harvest. Of course, farmers are busy during the \nharvest. You will not see too many of them probably in the fall. It is \ngoing to be a long, cold winter if we do not change the underlying \nbill. It will not be just the farmers, you will have the bankers come \nin. I have heard from bankers in, and you are going to have people from \nsmall towns and communities, the school boards and everybody else \nsaying: Look, what is happening? Our towns are drying up.\n  I say to my friend from Minnesota, I hope we will not force farmers \nto go to meetings and plead with us to recognize the dire straits they \nare in. We know it. We know what it is like out there. We have all the \ndata. We have the statistics. We know what the prices are like. Pick up \nthe newspaper and read what the prices are. Look at what futures prices \nare. I had a chart earlier today about the prices. Cash price of \nsoybeans is down about half, about 45 percent in about the last 2 \nyears. You do not really need much more than that to understand what \nthe problem is, I say to my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \noutline of the $10.793 billion that is in the first-degree amendment, \nwhich is pending at the desk, outlining the different line items and \nwhere that money goes so people can look at it tonight.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Democratic position: Emergency relief for agriculture\n                        [In billions of dollars]\nIncome.........................................................    6.045\n                                                                ========\n  Income Loss Payment..........................................    5.600\n  Dairy........................................................    0.400\n  Peanuts......................................................    0.045\n  Tobacco farmers..............................................    0.328\n                                                                --------\n    Total......................................................    6.373\nDisaster.......................................................    2.274\n                                                                ========\n  Crop insurance--30% premium discount.........................    0.400\n  Backfill 1998 disaster programs..............................    0.356\n  Livestock assistance programs................................    0.200\n  Section 32 (domestic food purchases, direct payments related     0.500\n   to natural disasters).......................................\n  Disaster Reserve.............................................    0.500\n  Flooded land program.........................................    0.250\n  Emergency short-term land diversion program..................    0.200\n  Producers erroneously denied eligibility for '98 relief......    0.070\n  FSA loans....................................................    0.100\n  FSA emergency staffing needs.................................    0.040\n  Ag mediation.................................................    0.002\n  USDA rapid response teams....................................    0.001\n                                                                --------\n  Shared Appreciation Agreement regulatory relief..............  .......\n    Total......................................................    2.619\n    Income/disaster total......................................    8.992\nEmergency conservation.........................................    0.212\n                                                                ========\n  Emergency Watershed Program..................................    0.060\n  Emergency Conservation Program...............................    0.030\n  EQIP--Prioritize livestock/nutrient management...............    0.052\n  Wetlands Restoration Program.................................    0.070\n                                                                --------\n    Total......................................................    0.212\nEmergency trade provisions.....................................    1.288\n                                                                ========\n  Humanitarian assistance, oilseeds and other..................    0.978\n  Cooperator program (foreign market development)..............    0.010\n  Step 2 (cotton)..............................................    0.439\n                                                                --------\n    Total......................................................    1.427\nEmergency economic development.................................    0.150\n                                                                ========\n  Cooperative revolving loan fund..............................    0.050\n  Emergency rural economic assistance..........................    0.100\n                                                                --------\n    Total......................................................    0.150\nEmergency policy reform........................................    0.012\n                                                                ========\n  Mandatory price reporting funding............................    0.004\n  Country-of-origin labeling...................................    0.008\n                                                                --------\n    Total......................................................    0.012\n                                                                ========\n    Grand total................................................   10.793\n \n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the indulgence of my friend from Indiana. I know \nmy friend wanted to engage in a little colloquy. I am sorry for holding \nhim up. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, be recognized for such \ntime as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I want to discuss the two amendments which \nhave been offered by my colleagues, the distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Harkin of Iowa, and the distinguished chairman of the \nAgriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations, Senator Cochran. But I want \nto do so in the context in which Senators may be thoughtful about what \ntype of action is appropriate, given not only the problems of \nagriculture but likewise the general problems that we have in this \ncountry that we are trying to address.\n  I note, for example, that the President of the United States, in his \nspeech to the Nation on agriculture on Saturday, indicated that there \nare a number of things at stake here. I quote the President:\n\n       I am committed to working with Congress to provide the \n     resources to help our farmers and ranchers by dealing with \n     today's crisis and by fixing the farm bill for the future. \n     But we must do so in a way that maintains the fiscal \n     discipline that has created our prosperity that now makes it \n     possible for us to save Social Security, strengthen and \n     modernize Medicare with a prescription drug benefit and to \n     pay off our national debt guaranteeing our long-term \n     financial prosperity. These things are good for America's \n     farming and ranching families, too, and they're good for all \n     Americans.\n\n  I quote the President because the administration has been asked a \nnumber of times for an opinion on what type of emergency spending, if \nany, is appropriate at this point, on August 2, for a harvest that, by \nand large, is not yet in and with conditions that must, of necessity, \nbe unknown. The administration has been reticent to address this \nsituation with any figure, in large part because the administration \nand, for that matter, many people in this Senate have been arguing over \nhow the surplus we believe will come after September 30 should be spent \nor the surplus for future years. There have been a number of strong \ncontending ideas which include the rescue of Medicare and Social \nSecurity reform, tax reduction, prescription drugs for those in \nMedicare who do not have that, and the various other things the \nPresident has cited.\n\n  I make this point because usually on this floor we are into that kind \nof debate about our future and about how to use our resources. But from \ntime to time, we have a debate on agriculture, and everything else is \nsuspended. It is as if the money we are talking about today, the $10.8 \nbillion, for example, that Senator Harkin addressed, does not pertain \nto any of the above--tax reduction, Medicare, Social Security, the \nsurplus, and what have you. It is deemed emergency spending, outside \nthe budget, outside the budget caps, outside of our general \nconsideration.\n  If we are to do emergency spending of that amount or any amount, \nthere must be some requirements to show the criteria for what is \nrequired. That is what I want to review with the Senate this evening.\n  I suggest the Department of Agriculture, in its most recent summary \nof where agriculture stands, points out that with low commodity prices \nin 1999, the year we are in, net farm income will be $43.8 billion. \nThey point out that will fall below the revised estimate of $44.1 \nbillion for 1998, last year. That means the estimate for this year is \n$300 million, or less than a 1 percent change, from the net income in \n1998.\n  I make that point because, as I have listened to the debate, Senators \nappear to be describing a loss that is substantially greater than that, \nbut USDA in estimates made just last week, plugging in the low prices \nand plugging in also sometimes low inputs--that is, for feed costs and \nvarious other things agriculture people will need--have come to a \nconclusion the net change is only the difference between $44.1 billion \nand $43.8 billion.\n  Beyond that, the average net income of the last 5 years has been \n$46.7 billion, which means this year's figure, if it comes out this \nway, is $2.9 billion less than the 5-year average. The average for the \n8-year period covering 1990 through 1997 is $45.7 billion, so this \nyear's result is 1.9 less than the 8-year average, or approximately 4 \npercent.\n  I am not making a claim it is higher; I am saying it is going to be \nlower. It is going to be lower by $300 million as\n\n[[Page S9992]]\n\nopposed to last year and at least $2 billion to $3 billion less than \nthe 5-year and 8-year averages.\n  As I have been listening to the debate and Senators have described \nthis as a depression, a circumstance, Senators must take a look at the \nparameters of what is the actual set of facts. Let me point out \nhistorically the high water mark for agricultural income in the last 10 \nyears was $54.9 billion in 1996. That followed the low year in 1995 of \n$37.2 billion. Low of 37, high of 54.9. Average: 45, 46 for the 5-year/\n10-year situations. This year: 43.8, close to 44 billion.\n  That is the range. This is net income, not net loss. Agriculture had \na substantial net income never below $37 billion and never higher than \n$54.9 billion in this 10-year period of time.\n  We are taking a look at a situation that shows loss, but we ought to \nquantify that loss. These are the official USDA projections as of last \nweek.\n  Senators will recall that 1998's net farm income of $44 billion \nincluded $12.2 billion of direct Federal Government payments. About $9 \nbillion was provided by the farm bill and the remaining $3 billion was \nmade available by the October 1998 emergency appropriations bill. But \nthis year, already, before this legislation comes to the floor, Federal \npayments are projected to be $16.6 billion.\n  Let me point out how this can be true. The safety net provided by the \ncurrent farm bill--that safety net--provides for an annual transition \npayment, a so-called AMTA payment, of $5.1 billion. That is provided \nfor by the farm bill, and to be paid to all farmers according to \nformula at the times that are prescribed. But loan deficiency payments \nfor corn, wheat, soybean, and other crops eligible for marketing loans \nare estimated at $6.6 billion. This is a safety net provided by the \ncurrent farm bill.\n  It has been suggested a number of times that the current farm bill, \nin its emphasis upon market economics, has no safety net. But I am \npointing out $5.1 billion in AMTA payments and another $6.6 billion in \nso-called loan deficiency payments, still another $4.8 billion to be \npaid out in conservation and crop loss disaster payments, with $2 \nbillion of that authorized by the 1998 October emergency appropriations \nbill.\n  It is important to note that most of the farm debate has focused on \nlow prices, and charts have been given to the Senate indicating how \nprices have tended downward over the years. But, nevertheless, the more \nimportant figure would be price times yield; that is, the income that \ncomes from an acre.\n  If, in fact, the price is low but the yield is high, the product of \nthe two may still be a reasonable return for that acre in that year. \nThere is an even more important fact that I suspect that many Senators \nhave not thought through clearly. An article that I saw on the front \npage of USA Today talked about a farm meeting the distinguished \noccupant of the Chair attended in Illinois. That particular article \nmentioned low prices and pointed out the depression and the fall of \nthose prices.\n  But if the price of corn--as has been sometimes suggested--has been \nquoted at elevators at $1.75 or $1.70 per bushel, the good news is that \na farmer will receive, at least if he is a farmer in the central part \nof Indiana, $1.95. That is price guaranteed through the loan deficiency \npayment in that part of the state.\n  How does this work? Let's say the farmer brings the corn in and the \nmarket price is $1.70 per bushel at the time of harvest. At the Beach \nGrove elevator in Indianapolis, that farmer will receive what amounts \nto 25 cents a bushel more, bringing that $1.70 up to $1.95. The same is \ntrue for soybeans at Beach Grove, IN. The soybean loan rate will be \n$5.40. In some parts of the country it may be $5.26, I am advised, but \nit is not $4 or $4.50 or $4.60 or $3.75 or various figures that have \nbeen quoted.\n  This is a tough concept to try to get across because even after you \nmake the point again and again, people talk about a $3.75 market price \nfor soybeans. What I am saying is that every bushel of soybeans the \nfarmer brings into the elevator, he is going to get $5.26 to $5.40 \nbecause the government's loan deficiency payment will provide him with \na payment equal to the difference between his market price and the \nlocal county loan rate. That is very different.\n  This is not a question about how low the prices are going to go. If \nthey go lower, the loan deficiency payment is higher. That is why the \nFederal Government will be paying out at least $6.6 billion to make up \nthe difference. It was the same for wheat. In many parts of the \ncountry, the wheat harvest has already come in. But the government \nguarantees at least $2.58 for wheat at many elevators around the \ncountry.\n  I make that point because that is the safety net of the current farm \nbill. It is a pretty strong safety net. It will provide a very \nsubstantial amount of income as the harvests occur, as the grain comes \nin, as the loan rates are established. It will amount to $6.6 billion \nthat has not yet been received but will be received by farmers. \nHopefully, that will take the debate away from a comparison of how low \nthe prices are going to go to the concrete figure of what the loan \ndeficiency payment will be--specifically, as I say, again, in most \nparts of the country, at least $1.89 for every bushel of corn, $2.58 \nfor every bushel of wheat, and $5.26 for every bushel of soybeans. At \nmany elevators it will be a higher figure than that, including the one \nin Indianapolis that I cited. Farmers receive that even if the quoted \nmarket price is much lower.\n  Let me mention some other statistics the USDA has pointed out that \nmay give you some idea about the parameters of our discussion.\n  In the same report last week of USDA giving estimates on net income, \nUSDA also went into the question of farm assets and farm debt and farm \nequity. If you had heard the entirety of the debate today--or maybe for \nsome time--on this issue, the Chair might logically believe that land \nvalues in this country are going down if they pertain to agriculture; \nthat the net worth of farmers collectively in this country is going way \ndown. That, in fact, is not the case.\n  The Agriculture Department points out that farm equity, which was \n$825 billion in 1996, rose to $857 billion in 1997. It is estimated to \ngo up to $865 billion this year. That is an increase of approximately \n$9 billion more, or a 1-percent increase in net worth. The farm real \nestate figures are $802 billion for this year as opposed to $794 \nbillion last year, and $783 billion the year before, and $746 billion \nthe year before that.\n  It does not mean every acre of land in every county all over America \nis going up. As a matter of fact, the Federal Reserve Board statistics \nfor my home State of Indiana indicate an estimate that in the first \nquarter of 1999, real estate values in agriculture may have gone down \nby 2 percent. As a matter of fact, that was true of a number of States. \nBut in a fair number of States, obviously, the estimate is that \nagricultural land is going up. The aggregate, the total, for America is \nthe land values are higher. Furthermore, the net worth is higher \nbecause farm debt will decrease from $172 billion to $171 billion.\n  Once again, listening to the debate you would say, how can that be? \nIf we are in a depression circumstance, how can you be arguing that \nreal estate on farms is going up, that net worth is going up, that debt \nis coming down? Because that is what is occurring. You can give any \nnumber of statistics about prices falling, but the fact is that net \nincome is going to fall by $300 million. And that will still be within \n$2 to $3 billion of a range for the last 5 or 10 years of time.\n  Let me try to bring clarity to the argument in still another way.\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, has mentioned, in a \nfact sheet that he released and he gave some of these figures again \ntoday, that there will be a 29-percent drop in agricultural income, but \nSenator Harkin correctly says this is a drop in principal field crops, \nnot all of agriculture, but principal field crops.\n  I have noted that situation on my own farm. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Grassley, is on the floor. He has a family farm and \ncould cite statistics from his farm if he were inclined to do so.\n  On my farm, Lugar farm in Marion County, IN, our net income in 1998 \nwas 18 percent less than in 1997. That was true principally because our \nmajor income sources were soybeans and corn. My guess is that our net \nincome in 1999 may have a similar reduction, although I hope not so \ngreat as the 18-percent that was suffered the earlier year.\n\n[[Page S9993]]\n\n  Obviously, it makes a very great deal of difference, when you come to \nthe net income situation or the difficulty of a farmer, whether the \nfarmer has debt. Our situation is one in which we do not have debt. We \nare able to finance our operating loans, our operating expenses, \nwithout loans and out of retained capital. So that gives you a big \nheadstart. For those farmers who have extended themselves to buy the \nadjacent farm or have never quite paid off the family mortgage and who \nmust borrow each year to put a crop in the field, the interest costs \nare very substantial. Those are reflected still in the overall \naggregate statistics of net farm income in this country.\n  As you take a look at ag statistics, the fourth that do the best as \nopposed to the fourth that do not do as well, very frequently the same \namount of land is involved, same weather was involved. The question of \ndebt intrudes and makes a big difference in the bottom line figure; \nlikewise, the sophistication of the marketing plan. Even in the midst \nof the crisis we were talking about last week, I was able to make a \nsale of 1,000 bushels of corn to an elevator in Indianapolis at a \nfigure higher than the loan rate, the government's guaranteed minimum \nprice. That prospect was available to each farmer in America, I \nsuspect, that day. We sold that corn for $1.97 for fall delivery. That \nis not a high price, but that is corn that will not be receiving a loan \ndeficiency payment, corn sold in a market which is still out there. In \nweather-driven spurts, farmers have been able to market corn and \nsoybeans even under these dire circumstances.\n  I make that point because those who made sales forward contracts last \nFebruary and March were able to sell their corn and their soybeans at \nprices that were substantially higher. Many farmers do these sales; \nsome farmers do not. We are attempting to deal with a situation of a \ntotal aggregate, those that did very well and those that did not do so \nwell.\n  Finally, it seems to me it comes to a basic decision the Senate must \nmake. That is, should the Senate say that agriculture, farmers in \nAmerica, ought to be made whole, at least to the extent their income is \nraised to, say, the average level of the last 5 years or the average \nlevel of the last 10 years? Is it the goal of the Senate to say no, \nthat is not good enough? What we ought to do is make certain that 1999 \nis one of the best years agriculture has ever had.\n  The proposals before us today will not boost the $44 billion more or \nless of net farm income to $54.9, although they come very close. If the \nDemocratic amendment was adopted and, literally, you added $10.8 \nbillion to the estimate of 43.8, you come up to 54.6, which is just 300 \nmillion short of the all-time record for net farm income. In short, not \na rescue operation but an idea, I suspect, that this is a good time to, \nif not set a new record, at least come very close to that through \nadditional Government payments. That may not be the intent of the \nSenate.\n  My guess is most Senators understand that farm income is down and \nthey would like to make farmers whole, at somewhere around an average \nlevel, which would appear to mean a payment of $2 or $3 billion. \nNeither of the proposals before us is of that nature.\n\n  I have pointed out in colloquies with the press during the past week \nthat there is before the Agriculture Committee now a risk management \nbill that would, in fact, provide about $2 billion a year for each of \nthe next 3 years if passed, and that would pretty well fill the gap, if \nthat was the intent of the Senate to do that.\n  I conclude that Senators finally will take a look at this entire \nsituation and reach some overall judgments. Let me offer at least some \nreasons why some payments might be justified.\n  First of all, farmers or the rest of America could not have \nanticipated the Asian crisis that hit about 2 years ago. The last year, \nin 1998, probably took away 40 percent of the demand of Asian countries \nfor American agricultural products. That probably took away 10 percent \nof our entire market last year, which means that demand fell overnight \nby 10 percent, whereas supplies for the last 3 years have not only been \nample but around the world the weather has been mighty good and the \namount of supply abundant, really throughout that period of time. So a \n40-percent hit in terms of the Asian export demand hit very hard. It \nhit suddenly. Within a 90-day period of time we realized that \ndifficulty.\n  Let me also mention, in addition to the Asian situation and the \noversupply situation, the abnormally good weather in China, in Europe, \nin Brazil, in Argentina, Australia, major sources of food throughout \nthe world, that the American farmers have run up against the problem of \ngenetically modified organisms in European debate, which means that \nEuropeans are rejecting corn and soybeans that come with the roundup \nready genetic changes.\n  As we all know in America agriculture, in order to get rid of the \nweeds in the field, it is a much simpler process. It strengthens, \ncertainly, the soybean and corn plants, if a gene is changed in the \ncorn or soybean plants that rejects the herbicides that kills all the \nweeds but leaves the corn and the soybeans standing. We believe that \nnot only is corn and soybeans from such situations safe, but as a \nmatter of fact, our yields have increased. The health of the plants has \nincreased, and we felt all over the world people might want to benefit \nfrom these breakthroughs. Not so in Europe, and a debate rages as to \nwhether there is something fundamentally wrong with our genetically \nmodified seeds to the point we are finding it very difficult to export \na single bushel of corn or beans to the European market. That debate is \ngoing to go on for awhile, and it has not been helpful.\n  We are on the threshold of a World Trade Organization meeting in \nSeattle that comes up in October. We must have fast track authority. \nThat is, the President must be able to negotiate on behalf of the \nadministration with other countries, knowing this body will vote up or \ndown on the treaty without amendment, because amendments by all of us \nattempting to influence the situation to benefit our particular States \nor crops or so forth could be matched by amendments all over the world \nand the treaty negotiations collapse.\n  We don't have fast track authority. We have tried in this body \nseveral times to obtain that. The House of Representatives had similar \ndifficulties. It will require enormous leadership by the President and \nby many of us, but we cannot make a new treaty that knocks down trade \nbarriers, that increases our exports in the way that all Senators want, \nwithout doing the basic steps. Fast track authority is one of them, as \nwell as a determined will that agriculture will not be left off the \nwagon, that agriculture is an integral part of what our Nation must do \nat the WTO meetings.\n  I make this point because we talk, often glibly, about the need for \nexports. Of course, we have a need for exports. But they will not \nhappen in the quantities that we need to have happen without lowering \ntariff and nontariff barriers, and the Seattle meeting is where that \ndoes or does not get done. If we don't have fast-track authority, it \nwill not occur during this administration. That is a long time.\n  So for all these reasons, farmers have taken a direct hit, largely \nbecause of worldwide demand and in the case of many fields in the State \nof Illinois, or in my State of Indiana, or the State of Iowa, as much \nas a third to a half of all our acreage literally results in yields \nthat must be exported, or we have it coming up around our ears. We know \nthat and yet, as a Nation, we have not moved aggressively to make the \ndifference that has to occur.\n  So for all these reasons, the Senate might come to a conclusion that \nsome compensation is required for farmers in order to keep their cash \nflow going. I made the point earlier that, as a matter of fact, loans \nwill be reduced this year. But cash flow will be reduced, also. And for \nthose farmers who have the need for operating loans, who are genuinely \nin danger because of debt situations, the situation could be dire and \nfamily farms could be lost.\n  In the event that we are to make payments, the so-called AMTA \npayments, put money into the hands of farmers quickly, directly, and \ncertainly--we had a pretty good demonstration of that last year. The \nSenate, in its wisdom, at the very end of the session as the large \nappropriation compromise came together, appropriated as part of a \npackage about $6 billion for American agriculture. It came as a \nsurprise to many, but the\n\n[[Page S9994]]\n\nform of it came as a surprise that was even more difficult. About $3 \nbillion of it came in AMTA payments. Those were made immediately. They \nwere received by farmers in the first week of November, after passage \nlate in October of the appropriation bill.\n  I make that point because if we are serious about money actually \narriving in the hands of farmers, then we must be serious about the \ndistribution method. The AMTA method gets the money to farmers. It does \nincrease cash flow. It is seen as equitable. The ratios were long ago \nworked out on the basis of crop history and the signatures for the farm \nbill. The other half of the $6 billion was for so-called disaster \npayments. They were ill-defined then, as they are ill-defined now in \nthe legislation in front of us.\n  The USDA struggled and, as a matter of fact, finally made payments in \nJune of this year--not in November or October of last year--and it did \nso after exploring not only disasters of 1998 in some States, but '97, \n'96, '95 and '94--multiple years, all mopped up with some type of \ndistribution and equity found among all sorts of contending parties in \nvarious States and counties.\n  Mr. President, money is not going to get to farmers very fast in \ndistribution methods that suggest that type of procedure, however \nhumane the motivation may be. As a matter of fact, payments aren't \ngoing to go to any farmer very soon from this legislation because the \nHouse of Representatives is not prepared to act upon this. So, \ntherefore, whatever we are doing with urgency now is going to be a \nmatter for September, or if the appropriation bills do not pass for \nOctober or November, or whenever a grand compromise occurs.\n  I make that point because farmers listening to this debate might feel \nthere is some possibility as of tomorrow or the next day a vote by the \nSenate could lead to money coming to them. But it will not come to them \nvery soon, whatever our result may be on the floor. Therefore, last \nweek, I suggested that we have 3 days of hearings before the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, in which on the first day the Secretary of \nAgriculture would come before the committee and, hopefully, respond to \nour questions as to what the administration's recommendations are, \ngiven all that the President and the Secretary have said about the \noverall budget condition, about taxes, about Medicare, about Social \nSecurity, and given the administration's view of what is appropriate \nfarm or agricultural legislation.\n\n  And if you follow this with other groups in our society who would \nrespond to Senator's questions about this, the committee will hold a \nmarkup in the first week of September so that the Appropriations \nCommittee that must now struggle with this legislation would have a \nfairly clear roadmap of what the compromises were and what \nconsiderations have been given.\n  Furthermore, the September debate would give us a pretty good idea of \nwhat the yields actually are going to be for a number of our major \ncrops. I suspect that, even as we speak, as people now begin to talk \nabout a different problem in agriculture--namely, drought--a whole slew \nof new considerations are going to come into the picture. The price \nmight go up and the yield might go down. Once again, the product of the \ntwo is the critical element, rather than the new per acre.\n  Mr. President, obviously, we are in this debate because the occupant \nof the chair and, more particularly, the distinguished floor leader has \nindicated that we need to get on with this. I accept that fact. We will \nhave tomorrow morning in the Agriculture Committee at 9 o'clock an \nappearance by the Secretary of Agriculture. We will ask him for his \ntestimony and we will ask him for the administration's point of view, \nwhich I think is relevant to what we are discussing here.\n  I know it is relevant on the basis of last year's experience because \nwe passed an agriculture appropriation bill, and it had considerable \nbenefits for farmers. But it was vetoed by the President. And, as a \nresult, the benefits did not accrue very rapidly, and we got into what \nI would say was a bidding war again. That is not advisable if it can be \navoided in some normal framework. So I am hopeful that we will have a \nhearing, and at least that it will provide some benefit for the debate \nwe are now having before us, and certainly for the debate we shall have \nagain. We will have it again because the Appropriations Committees will \nhave to come back with conference reports, and we will have to judge \nthe adequacy or inadequacy of what we have done at that point.\n  Mr. President, I finally make the point that the previous speakers \nhave stated there is an emergency to be met, an immediate need for \nincome. But, fundamentally, we must debate the entire farm bill when we \ncome back--not simply a question of adequate income for farmers, but \nthe fundamental law of the land.\n  I am prepared for that debate, but I simply say that before Senators \nget engaged in the debate, it is well to gauge at least the benefits \nthat come from the current farm bill. There are, to date, $16.6 billion \nthis year, which is just $100 million short of an all-time record of \nfarm payments. That is a substantial safety net. I make the point that \nthe farm bill recognizes that point and, in fact, provides fairly amply \nwhen that occurs. But it also provides freedom to farm, and that is \nvery important to most farmers in this country--the ability to \ndetermine how to manage their land, how many acres of corn, or beans, \nor cotton, or rice, or whatever the farmer wants to plant, or not to \nplant at all. The AMTA payment comes to a farmer who does not plant at \nall, because this is a transition from the date of supply control to a \nday in which we move into market economics and the farm area more \ncompletely. The thing the world dictates presently is that market \neconomics is the important way to go. Our country testifies to that in \nalmost every other debate.\n  I hope we will continue to testify in behalf of that when it comes to \nAmerican agriculture.\n  I thank the Chair for this indulgence; likewise for other Senators.\n  I am hopeful that before action is taken on either of the two \namendments, there will be testimony by the Secretary and then very \nthorough analysis by each Senator as to what our obligations should be \nto American agriculture both to encourage and enhance it and, likewise, \nthat our obligation is to all the taxpayers of the country and the \nother major objectives that lie before our country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. \nPresident, I thank the Senator from Indiana. He has definitely elevated \nthe level of discussion on the issue before the Senate by his remarks. \nHe has given this debate unusual insight based on his experience and \nhis knowledge of the subject and his personal experience as one who is \nengaged in production agriculture in the State of Indiana.\n  I think the Senate has benefited from his remarks. I, for one, want \nto congratulate him and thank him for remaining on the floor this \nevening and giving the Senate the benefit of his observations on this \nissue.\n  Tomorrow, as he points out, there will be a hearing in the \nAgriculture Committee which could also be very helpful to our further \nunderstanding of the situation. The Economic Research Service and other \nagencies of the Department of Agriculture could make available to us \ninformation that would be very helpful and constructive as we try to \ndecide what is best in this situation for our farmers around the \ncountry.\n  I don't want to overdue this or guild the lily too brightly. But I \npersonally respect the Senator so much--and he knows that --and \nconsider him a great friend. I again express my personal appreciation \nfor his being here tonight and for his leadership in the agriculture \narea specifically.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, who is my friend and whose leadership I appreciate so \nmuch.\n  Let me inquire of the distinguished Senator from Mississippi if he \nknows of further debate. If not, I make an inquiry because I have been \nasked to substitute for the leader in making motions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no other Senator who seeks \nrecognition on this. I think it would be appropriate to go to final \nwrap-up.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S9995-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9995]]\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \nBingaman amendment to recommit S. 1429 to the Senate Finance Committee \nwhich would have enabled us to clarify that debt reduction is a top \npriority for this government in spending any budget surplus.\n  As we say in my home state of Arkansas, the best time to fix the roof \nis when the sun is still shining.\n  Now is the time for us to take steps to reduce our enormous federal \ndebt. I believe we have an unprecedented opportunity before us. We've \nbeen making tough decisions--living within our means, so to speak.\n  We have a surplus that's bigger than we thought it would be and a \nchance to save Social Security for future generations, protect for \nMedicare and help older people afford prescription drugs.\n  So, now we have a shot at reducing our nation's debt, which in turn \nwill lower interest rates and put more money back in the pockets of \nmore Americans.\n  Using a major portion of any surplus accumulated in these times of \nprosperity to improve the financial integrity of the federal \ngovernment. Reducing the national debt is a smart long-term strategy \nfor the U.S. economy and it must be our priority in this bill.\n  Reducing our national debt will provide a tax cut for millions of \nAmericans because it will restrain interest rates, saving them money on \nvariable mortgages, new mortgages, auto loans, credit card payments, \netc. Each percentage point decrease in interest rates would save \nAmerican families hundreds of dollars every year.\n  By reducing the national debt we will protect future generations from \nincreasing tax burdens. Currently, more than 25 percent of individual \nincome taxes go to paying interest on our national debt. Every dollar \nof lower debt saves more than one dollar for future generations, a \nsavings that can be used for tax cuts, or for covering the baby boomers \nretirement without tax increases.\n  Reducing the national debt will also make it easier for the \ngovernment to deal with the future costs of Social Security and \nMedicare and repay the Social Security trust fund when the Social \nSecurity system faces annual shortfalls.\n  In addition, reducing the national debt will reduce our reliance on \nforeign investors. More than $1.2 trillion of the national debt--\nroughly one third of the publicly held debt--is held by foreign \ninvestors. In 1998, the U.S. government paid $91 billion in interest \npayments to foreign investors.\n  It was not the American way to live beyond one's means. Our parents \ntaught us to work hard so that we can pay our bills, clothe our \nchildren and save for the future.\n  Accumulating debt and simply letting it grow and grow is not--and \nshould not be--an option for most families around this country. It \nshould no longer be the practice of this government.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly advised \nCongress that the most important action we could take to maintain a \nstrong and growing economy is to pay down the national debt. I, for \none, believe he is on the right track.\n  Clarifying our intent to prioritize debt reduction is the right thing \nto do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S9995-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States \nCode, to modify employee contributions to the Civil Service Retirement \nSystem and the Federal Employees Retirement System to the percentages \nin effect before the statutory temporary increase in calendar year \n1999, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n         Federal Employee Retirement Contributions Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am again pleased to join with my \ncolleagues, Senators Mikulski, Warner, Robb and Akaka, in introducing \nthe Federal Employee Retirement Contributions Act of 1999. This bill \nmakes a technical correction to legislation introduced last week that \nwould return Federal employee retirement contribution rates to their \n1998 levels, effective January 1st, 2000. It is my belief that the \ntemporarily increased retirement contributions enacted as part of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 represent an unfair penalty against Federal \nworkers at a time when budget surpluses are predicted into the next ten \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1472\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 2007 of the Social Security Act to \nprovide grant funding for additional Empowerment Zones, Enterprise \nCommunities, and Strategic Planning Communities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            EMPOWERMENT ZONES AND ENTERPRISE COMMUNITIES ACT\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today \nimportant legislation that will help low-income rural and urban areas \nnationwide reinvigorate their communities.\n  The Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities Act will fully fund \nthe Round II Enterprise Zones authorized by Congress in 1997. The \nEnterprise Zones/Enterprise Community (EZ/ECs) concept combines tax \ncredits and social service grants to promote long-term economic \nrevitalization. The most important aspect of Enterprise Zones are their \ninclusive approach--by design--so local government, the private sector \nand non-profit and civic groups together create a vision and a plan to \nimplement that vision, with the federal government playing a supportive \nrole rather than the lead role.\n  I'm sure many Senators can point with pride to the successes within \ntheir own states, but I'd like to take a moment to talk about the \nNorfolk-Portsmouth Enterprise Zone (EZ) in my state of Virginia. The \nNorfolk-Portsmouth EZ won its new designation in 1997. One of the many \nservices Norfolk-Portsmouth provides through Norfolk Works, Inc. the \nentity implementing the many activities of the EZ, are GED classes and \njob training and apprenticeship programs. There's even a Multi-media \nTraining Course, which includes an 15-week internship at a media \ncompany. Norfolk Works also recruits and screen applicants for jobs. \nAnd they don't do this alone: Norfolk Works coordinates with many \nagencies, organizations and businesses to help the residents within the \nNorfolk-Portsmouth Zone. Already, the Norfolk Works has produced \nimpressive results--from May 1995 to June 1999, 60 percent of those \ncompleting training are employed with another 16% involved in \nadditional training.\n  The success of the Norfolk-Portsmouth Enterprise Zone is just one \nexample of the promise and results of Enterprise Zones. But unlike \nRound I EZ/ECs, Round II EZ/ECs did not receive the Social Service \nBlock Grant (SSBG) that provides resources for social services such as \njob training and child care which complements the tax incentives and \nbonding authority already approved.\n  Communities competed for these designations with the understanding \nthat Congress would give them the full funding to implement their \nvision. We have a responsibility to fulfill our obligations to these \ncommunities, that worked very hard to win the resources to make their \nvision a reality.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues to fulfill this \npromise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url":

PROGRAMMING ON \n                               TELEVISION\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 49\n\n       Whereas American children and adolescents spend between 22 \n     and 28 hours per week viewing television--more than any other \n     activity except sleeping;\n       Whereas American homes have an average of 2.75 television \n     sets, and 87 percent of homes with children having more than \n     one television set;\n       Whereas a very limited number of prime time programs are \n     suitable for the entire family;\n       Whereas surveys of television content demonstrate that many \n     programs contain substantial sexual and/or violent content;\n       Whereas parents are ultimately responsible for the \n     appropriate supervision of their child's television viewing, \n     and critical viewing and ``co-viewing'' of television \n     programming with the child are especially important;\n       Whereas ``family friendly'' programming means programs \n     which are relevant, interesting, and appropriate for \n     audiences of all ages, including movies, series, \n     documentaries, and informational programs aired during hours \n     when children and adults might be together watching \n     television (between 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.);\n       Whereas ``family friendly'' programming is of a type that \n     the average viewer or parent would not be embarrassed to \n     watch with children in the room and ideally presents an \n     uplifting message;\n       Whereas efforts must be made by television networks, \n     studios, and the production community to produce more quality \n     family friendly programs and to air them during times when \n     parents and children are likely to be viewing together;\n       Whereas members of the Forum on Family Friendly Programming \n     market products and services to entire families and are \n     concerned about the dwindling availability of family friendly \n     television programs during prime time viewing hours; and\n       Whereas Congress encourages activities by the Forum and \n     other entities designed to promote family friendly \n     programming, including--\n       (1) participating in meetings with leadership of major \n     television networks, studios, and production companies to \n     share concerns;\n       (2) expressing the importance of family friendly \n     programming at industry conferences, meetings, and forums;\n       (3) honoring outstanding family friendly television \n     programs with a new tribute, the Family Program Awards, to be \n     held annually in Los Angeles, California;\n       (4) establishing a development fund to finance family \n     friendly scripts; and\n       (5) underwriting scholarships at television studies \n     departments at institutions of higher education to encourage \n     student interest in family friendly programming: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the efforts of the Forum on \n     Family Friendly Programming and other entities supporting \n     family friendly programming;\n       (2) supports efforts to encourage television networks, \n     studios, and the production community to produce more quality \n     family friendly programs;\n       (3) supports the Family Friendly Programming Awards, which \n     will encourage, recognize, and celebrate creative excellence \n     in, and commitment to, family friendly programming; and\n       (4) encourages the media and American advertisers to \n     further a family friendly television environment within which \n     appropriate advertisements can accompany the programming.\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, to submit \na concurrent resolution recognizing the importance of expanding the \namount of family friendly television programming, and the contributions \nthat the Forum for Family Friendly Programming is undertaking to make \nthis goal a reality.\n  One of the more frustrating aspects of being a parent in the United \nStates is the fact that we cannot always protect our children from what \nthey see and hear. Images and descriptions of violence, sex and drug \nand alcohol consumption permeate our culture, but nowhere are these \ndepicted more readily than on television. Recent studies support the \ntheory that children exposed to violent video programming at a young \nage have a higher tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior \nlater in life. Even more distressing is that children witness an \naverage of five violent acts per hour on prime-time television and \n200,000 acts of violence on television by the time they are 18 years \nold. There is no doubt that this exposure threatens the healthy \ndevelopment of our children.\n  For families that have both parents working, it's becoming harder for \nthem to keep track of what their children watch after school or during \nthe summer months. More likely than not, a child will pick up the \ntelevision clicker before he or she will pick up a book. Indeed, each \nweek, the average child will watch 22-28 hours of television, which is \nmore time than he or she spends on any outside activity other than \nsleeping.\n  The trick for parents is to establish good viewing habits for their \nchild--as well as the entire family--that emphasize quality programming \nand are suited to the age of the child. While there is generally a \nvariety of quality children's programming throughout the morning and \nafternoon hours, the concern for many parents is the content of evening \nprogramming. Right now, most parents indicate that the so-called \n``family viewing'' time of evening--traditionally between 8:00 and \n10:00 p.m.--often contains programming that they feel is inappropriate \nfor their children. It is important that broadcasters recognize that \nthe daily ``family viewing'' period needs to focus more on programming \nthat is actually family friendly; shows that parents and children can \nreadily watch together.\n  No one can replace the good judgment of a parent in determining what \na child watches on television. However, parents can use all the help \nthey can get in ensuring that more family oriented shows are aired \nduring the evening hours.\n  To help in this endeavor, a number of our nation's largest companies \nhave joined together to establish the Forum for Family Friendly \nProgramming. Like many American families, the members of the Forum are \nconcerned that fewer and fewer television programs are specifically \ngeared towards the entire family. They are concerned, also, that too \nmany of the programs that our children view contain story-lines, \nlanguage and characters to which they should not be exposed.\n  Most of the companies that belong to the Forum are sponsors of a wide \nrange of television programs, but they believe that more family-\nfriendly television programming, including movies, documentaries, \nseries or informational programs that are interesting or relevant to a \nbroad audience, will actually appeal to more families.\n  Right now, the members of the Forum for Family Friendly Programming \nare working with and in the entertainment community on a variety of \ninitiatives on family friendly programming including: meetings with \nindustry leaders; speeches and discussions at industry meetings and \nconferences; award tributes to family friendly television programs; a \ndevelopment fund for family friendly scripts; university scholarships \nin television studies departments to encourage student interest in \nfamily friendly programming; and a public awareness campaign to promote \nmore family friendly programming.\n  Mr. President, as a father and a grandfather, I am deeply concerned \nabout the healthy development of all of our nation's children. Since \nthe future of our country depends upon our children, we must do all \nthat we can to limit their exposure to negative influences and provide \nthem with as safe and nurturing an environment as possible. Therefore, \nI encourage efforts that will expand the number of quality\n\n[[Page S10000]]\n\nfamily programs that are shown on television, and I congratulate the \nForum for Family Friendly Programming on their leadership towards that \ngoal.\n  I believe that passage of this resolution honoring the Forum's \ncommitment will help raise awareness and inspire others in the business \nworld to align themselves with the goal of bringing quality television \nto our nation's families. I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, who has been a leader in the Senate on addressing \nthe needs of our children, and I urge my colleagues to join us in co-\nsponsoring this resolution, and calling for it's speedy consideration \nby the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S10000-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 170--RECOGNIZING LAWRENCEBURG, TENNESSEE, AS THE \n                  BIRTHPLACE OF SOUTHERN GOSPEL MUSIC\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 170\n\n       Whereas Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, is the home of many of the \n     first major southern gospel music songwriters, including such \n     songwriters as James D.

Stamps, Frank Stamps, the LeFevers, and the Speers;\n       Whereas Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, is the home of the Vaughan \n     Family Visitor, the first influential southern gospel music \n     newspaper which was published from 1914 to 1964;\n       Whereas Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, is the home of the James \n     D. Vaughan Music Company, which has published millions of \n     shape-note southern gospel music songbooks from the date of \n     its founding in 1902 until 1964; and\n       Whereas the Southern Gospel Music Association recognizes \n     Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, as the official birthplace of \n     southern gospel music; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved\n\n     SECTION 1. RECOGNITION OF LAWRENCEBURG, TENNESSEE AS THE \n                   BIRTHPLACE OF SOUTHERN GOSPEL MUSIC.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) recognizes Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, as the birthplace \n     of southern gospel music; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     honoring Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, as such a birthplace.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I rise to submit a resolution \nrecognizing my hometown of Lawrenceburg, TN, as the official birthplace \nof Southern Gospel Music.\n  Lawrenceburg is not a large town by any means, nor is it altogether \nprominent in the political landscape. What this humble town lacks in \nsize, however, it more than makes up for with its importance in the \nhistory of American music. Since the turn of the 20th century, \nLawrenceburg has been the home of Southern Gospel Music, a musical \ntradition embraced and perpetuated by talented and dedicated artists.\n  The roots of Southern Gospel Music reach back to some of the most \ngifted songwriters of our time, such as Adger Pace, James Rowe, G.T. \nSpeer, William Walbert, and the great James D. Vaughan. Vaughan went on \nto found the first Southern Gospel Music quartet in Lawrenceburg in \n1910. He also founded, in Lawrenceburg, the Vaughan School of Music and \nthe James D. Vaughan Music Company. This school helped train the first \ngeneration of Southern Gospel Music artists, such as V.O. Stamps, Frank \nStamps, the Speers, and the LeFevers, while the music company published \nmillions of shape-note Southern Gospel Music songbooks during its \nexistence from 1902 until 1964.\n  Lawrenceburg was also integral in getting the word out to the world \nthat Southern Gospel Music was on its way. Along with the many \ntraveling quartets originating from the training ground of the Vaughan \nSchool of Music, Lawrenceburg was the home of the first influential \nSouthern Gospel Music newspaper, The Vaughan Family Visitor, which \nbegan publication in 1914. Eight short years later the first Southern \nGospel Music radio station WOAN was founded, also in Lawrenceburg.\n  With the endorsement of the Southern Gospel Music Association, which \nhas designated Lawrenceburg the birthplace of Southern Gospel Music, I \nproudly ask my colleagues to support this resolution recognizing \nLawrenceburg, TN, as the official birthplace of Southern Gospel Music.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S10000-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10000-S10001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 171--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nPRESIDENT SHOULD RENEGOTIATE THE EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED \n            STATES OF AMERICA AND THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nregarding our extradition treaty with Mexico. This resolution expresses \nthe sense of the Senate that the United States renegotiate our \nextradition treaty to allow for the possibility of capital punishment. \nThe case of Jose Luis del Toro has made the need for this resolution \nclear.\n  When Sheila Bellush was brutally murdered in November 1997, her \naccused murderer, Jose Luis del Toro, fled to Mexico to escape \nprosecution in the United States. From this time forward, there has \nbeen little consolation for the Bellush family, and a great deal of \nhardship. While Del Toro was apprehended in Mexico just 13 days later, \na nightmare of government delays and roadblocks prevented his \nextradition to the United States.\n  The details of Sheila Bellush's murder are shocking. By all accounts, \nher four 23-month-old quadruplets probably witnessed their mother's \nmurder, and wandered around in her blood trying to wake her up for as \nmany as 4 or 5 hours before the 13-year-old daughter came home from \nschool and found Mrs. Bellush's body.\n  There is overwhelming evidence that Del Toro was involved in the \nmurder. The Sarasota police believe that he was, in fact, the gunman in \na murder-for-hire scheme. Del Toro's cousin works at a golf course \nwhere Bellush's ex-husband plays golf. That cousin and one of the ex-\nhusband's golfing partners have been arrested as co-conspirators. On \nthe day of the murder, Del Toro asked directions to the Bellush house \nand left a clear fingerprint at the scene. He had directions to the \nBellush house in his car, which was seen near the crime, and he stayed \nin a nearby motel, where a .45 caliber bullet was found, like the one \nused in the murder.\n  The Mexican government refused his extradition unless the United \nStates agreed to waive the death penalty. Amazingly, we approved such a \nprovision in the U.S.-Mexico Extradition Treaty of 1978. This agreement \nallows Mexico the right to refuse extradition if the death penalty may \nbe applicable in the case. In the Bellush case, this provision allowed \nDel Toro to evade prosecution for over a year while awaiting his \nextradition.\n  I became involved in this case when Jamie Bellush moved their six \nchildren to Newton, New Jersey, and sought my help with Del Toro's \nextradition. I was in constant contact with the Justice and State \nDepartments and the Mexican Embassy urging them to move\n\n[[Page S10001]]\n\nquickly in returning Del Toro. The Mexican Government has since honored \nour request, and extradited Mr. Del Toro to Florida to stand trial. \nHowever, I believe that the U.S. should still move to renegotiate our \nextradition treaty with Mexico and prevent this unfortunate series of \nevents from happening to other families in the future. I look forward \nto working with this Congress to pass this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S10001-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             DECEPTIVE MAIL PREVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 COLLINS (AND LEVIN) AMENDMENT NO. 1497\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Levin) proposed an amendment to the \nbill (S. 335) to amend chapter 30 of title 39, United States Code, to \nprovide for the nonmailability of certain deceptive matter relating to \ngames of chance, administrative procedures, orders, and civil penalties \nrelating to such matter, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 19, insert between lines 22 and 23 the following:\n       ``(A) `clearly and conspicuously displayed' means presented \n     in a manner that is readily noticeable, readable, and \n     understandable to the group to whom the applicable matter is \n     disseminated;\n       On page 19, line 23, strike ``(A)'' and insert ``(B)''.\n       On page 20, line 1, strike ``(B)'' and insert ``(C)''.\n       On page 20, line 9, strike ``(C)'' and insert ``(D)''.\n       On page 20, line 21, insert ``prominently'' after ``that''.\n       On page 21, line 1, insert ``prominently'' after ``that''.\n       On page 21, lines 4 and 5, strike ``an entry from such \n     materials'' and insert ``such entry''.\n       On page 21, lines 8 and 9, strike ``, in language that is \n     easy to find, read, and understand''.\n       On page 21, line 15, strike ``clearly''.\n       On page 22, line 5, insert ``or'' after the semicolon.\n       On page 22, line 11, strike ``or'' after the semicolon.\n       On page 22, strike lines 12 through 17.\n       On page 22, lines 23 and 24, strike ``, in language that is \n     easy to find, read and understand''.\n       On page 23, line 1, strike ``clearly and conspicuously''.\n       On page 23, line 6, strike ``clearly''.\n       On page 34, line 1, strike all through page 39, line 23, \n     and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 8.

Mr. President, today, I recognize an important and \nhistoric restoration project now nearing completion in Mendocino, \nCalifornia. While the North Coast of California is renowned for its \nnatural beauty and breathtaking views, in Mendocino there is another \ncoastal landmark that has captured the imagination of this rugged \nregion. Built in 1908, the Point Cabrillo Lighthouse is a living \nreminder of California's maritime history. And on August 6th, the \nLighthouse celebrates the 90th anniversary of the first lighting of its \nlight.\n  This one-of-a-kind structure was originally built by the United \nStates Lighthouse Service to protect the legendary ``doghole \nschooners'' that plied the lumber trade between San Francisco and \nCalifornia's northern coast at the turn of the century. The Lighthouse \nwas turned over to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1939, and still houses Coast \nGuard navigational aids and monitoring equipment. However, the \nLighthouse structure and its rare Fresnel lens suffered significant \ndamage after many years of neglect. Then, in 1998, the California \nCoastal Conservancy and North Coast Interpretive Association stepped \nforward to restore and reinstate the original Fresnel lens, and to \nrenovate the Lighthouse for use as an educational and interpretive \ncenter.\n  Thanks to the efforts of the people of Mendocino, the Coastal \nConservancy and the North Coast Interpretive Association, the \nLighthouse restoration project will soon be complete. A weekend of \nfestivities will celebrate the Lighthouse's revival and highlight the \nattractions of the Point Cabrillo Preserve and Light Station. This \ncelebration will acknowledge the efforts of the many volunteers and \ncommunity partners that also helped make this project a success.\n  It is important to take the time to applaud the restoration of this \nnationally significant, historic landmark. I also think it is important \nto recognize the significance of community projects such as the Point \nCabrillo Lighthouse, which serve as invaluable, irreplaceable links to \nour common past and as unique educational tools for the future. I \ncommend the efforts that have gone into this restoration project, and \nsend the Point Cabrillo Lighthouse volunteers and other partners my \nbest wishes for their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S10006-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF NEWTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the town of Newton, New Hampshire on its two hundred and \nfiftieth anniversary. The town's residents will celebrate this historic \noccasion on August 15, 1999 with a number of festivities including a \nparade and an ``Olde Fashioned Fireman's Muster''.\n  Newton's rich and fruitful history dates back to 1639 when families \nfirst settled in the area granted by England known as New Salisbury \n(Amesbury). Newton's actual township was incorporated in 1749, allowing \nthe people to elect their own officials and to hold town meetings.\n  Much of the frontier region was wild country inhabited by the \nNaumkeag Indians. The settlers and the Naumkeaks had generally peaceful \nrelations, relying on one another for trading purposes. The greatest \ndanger facing the settlers came from the war parties of the Mic Macs, \nwho originated from the area now known as Maine and New Brunswick, \nCanada. These hostile groups conducted violent raids as far south as \nConnecticut, killing large numbers of local populations. With a \ncombination of the settlers' admirable fortitude and the recurring \nepidemics of disease, these native populations were nearly wiped out.\n  Newton residents have persevered in other ways throughout the years, \ncourageously serving and defending America. They have participated in \nthe French and Indian Wars, Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Civil War, \nWorld War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam Conflict. \nNewton's citizens are always willing to serve our Nation when called \nupon.\n  I congratulate the town of Newton, and it's dedicated and patriotic \ncitizens. I am proud to serve the residents of Newton in the United \nStates Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S10006-4", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10006-S10007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ICELANDIC HERITAGE\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nIcelandic heritage of our country and of the state of North Dakota.\n  For a century it has been North Dakota's custom to set aside time to \nhonor the contributions of Icelanders to North Dakota. In order to \nhonor the thousands of people of Icelandic descent that reside in my \nstate, the Governor has proclaimed July 30 to August 2 as Icelandic \nHeritage Days.\n  Icelandic Heritage Days culminates with a celebration of the \nhistorical presentation of a new constitution to the Icelandic \nParliament. This occurred on August the second, or ``August the \nDeuce,'' as many Icelanders call it, 1874 by King Kristjan the Ninth. \nThis action formally freed Iceland from hundreds of years of Danish \nrule.\n  In 1878, people of Icelandic descent first settled in northeastern \nNorth Dakota. Since this time, Icelandic-Americans have been \ninstrumental in the development of their communities and my state. One \nsettler, E.H. Bergman, was a member of the Territorial Legislature, \nwhich passed legislation enabling the establishment of the states of \nNorth and South Dakota. Since Bergman's time, many more people of \nIcelandic descent have represented\n\n[[Page S10007]]\n\ntheir constituencies in the ND Legislature and state government.\n  Mr. President, this year's celebration is especially noteworthy \nbecause an honored dignitary, the Honorable Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, the \nPresident of Iceland, will be in attendance. This visit will mark the \nfirst time that an Icelandic head-of-state has visited North Dakota.\n  It is a pleasure to have President Grimsson visit North Dakota, and a \nprivilege to honor Icelandic-Americans for all they have done for North \nDakota and this great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S10007-1", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ANGELO QUARANTA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I extend special birthday \nwishes to a very special Californian, Angelo Quaranta, whose birthday \nis August 8.\n  Angelo is perhaps best known as the owner and driving force behind \nAllegro, an Italian restaurant on San Francisco's Russian Hill. \nRegardless of whether you are the Governor, the Mayor, a community \norganizer or just someone looking for a wonderful plate of pasta, \nAngelo's grace and easy manner always make you feel welcome.\n  Angelo was born in Taranto, Italy in 1934. Before leaving his \nhomeland for San Francisco in 1960, he attended the police academy and \nbecame national Judo champion while serving with the Italian Police \nForce. Upon arriving in San Francisco, he first worked as a window \nwasher and then began a distinguished career in the insurance industry.\n  Cooking may be Angelo's passion, but he can be found in many more \nplaces than the kitchen. He has long been active in local government \nand is a leader in community affairs. He is currently president of the \nCommission of Parking and Traffic, and served on San Francisco's \nRecreation and Park Commission. In the 1970's, he operated an Italian \ntelevision station that broadcast programming from Italy. He founded \nUnione Sportiva Italia, and has been active in numerous efforts to \ncelebrate the invaluable contributions of Italians and Italian-\nAmericans to the life of the city and nation. Angelo has served as a \nmember of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and founded Candlelight \nAgain, an organization comprised of restaurant owners and their patrons \ndedicated to raising funds for community needs. In recognition of his \nwork, and in addition to many other honors, the Mayor's Office has \ntwice proclaimed it ``Angelo Quaranto Day in San Francisco.''\n  Angelo has two adult daughters who live with their husbands and \nchildren in Italy. It is a pleasure to join them and the larger civic \nfamily Angelo continues to nurture in San Francisco in wishing him a \njoyous 65th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S10007-2", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO HONOR BEDFORD PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor the Bedford Presbyterian Church which is celebrating its 250th \nAnniversary on August 15, 1999. The church first organized on August \n15, 1749 and has been serving the people of Bedford ever since.\n  The church was founded under the rules of Massachusetts Colony who \ndeeded the land to the New Hampshire and also mandated that in order to \norganize a town there must be land for a church, a minister, and an \northodox ministry. The church was thus formed in 1749 and the town \ncharter was signed the next year.\n  As a person of strong religious convictions, I applaud the services \nand strong sense of family and community that the church has provided \nto its community. Furthermore, I applaud their monthly celebrations of \nthis historic event.\n  I commend the Bedford Presbyterian Church and wish them luck in the \nnext 250 years. It is an honor to represent the members of Bedford \nPresbyterian Church in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S10007-3", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL BARRY COSTELLO\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rear \nAdmiral (Select) Barry Costello, United States Navy, for the excellent \njob he has done as the Director of Senate Liaison for the Navy. I want \nto recognize Admiral Costello for his many achievements and commend him \nfor the exemplary service he has provided to the Senate, to the Navy, \nand to our great nation.\n  Barry Costello is a sailor's sailor who has distinguished himself \nthrough his seamanship, tactical acumen, and inspiring leadership. He \nhas served on some of our country's finest warships, including command \nof the destroyer U.S.S. Elliot (DD 967). Prior to coming to the Senate, \nhe commanded the prestigious ``Little Beavers'' of Destroyer Squadron \n23, following in the footsteps of Admiral Arleigh ``Thirty-One Knot'' \nBurke, who famously led the ``Little Beavers'' to a decisive victory \nover Japanese forces in the Battle of Cape Saint George in 1943.\n  In March 1997, Admiral Costello took the helm of the Navy's Senate \nLiaison Office. His integrity, enthusiasm, and foresight have earned \nthe admiration of all members of the Senate who have worked with him, \nand it is not an exaggeration to say that through his service to the \nSenate, Barry Costello has helped to ensure that our Navy remains the \nbest trained, best equipped, and best prepared naval force in the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, Rear Admiral (Select) Barry Costello exemplifies what \nis best in the Navy and in America. The Senate, the Navy and the \nAmerican people are indebted to him for his many years of distinguished \nservice. As he departs for his first assignment as a flag officer, I \nknow that my colleagues wish Barry, his wife LuAnne, and their sons \nAidan and Brendan the very best. I have a feeling we will work with \nBarry again in another more important role for our Navy and our \nnation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/08/02/senate-section/article/S10007-4", "month": "08", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT STEPHEN\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Robert Stephen of Manchester, New Hampshire for his \nappointment to Director of Community Development Services at New \nHampshire's Department of Resources and Economic Development.\n  After ten years of service as a New Hampshire State Senator, \nDemocratic Leader from 1984 to 1990, Robert was appointed Deputy \nExecutive Director of the New Hampshire Job Training Council. In this \ncapacity Robert was responsible for providing New Hampshire businesses \nwith the skilled labor needed to grow and be successful and New \nHampshire citizens with the skills they need to become self-sufficient. \nHe has also been a driving force in workforce development by overseeing \nthe state's Rapid Response effort and convening the Statewide Business \nRelations Team.\n  Not only has Robert taken on the task of improving the New Hampshire \nworkforce, but he has been an asset to his community. He has won \nnumerous Multiple Sclerosis Fund-Raising Awards, was a former member of \nthe New Hampshire State Athletic Commission, has received the Easter \nSeal VIP Award and has been a business owner in downtown Manchester. On \ntop of all this service, Robert was also able to become a three-time \nNew Hampshire Golden Gloves Boxing Champion.\n  Robert's new responsibility as Director of Community Development \nServices will give him the opportunity to cultivate a stronger and more \njob ready workforce, meeting the needs and specifications of New \nHampshire companies. His presence at the New Hampshire Job Training \nCouncil will surely be missed.\n  I want to commend Robert Stephen for his hard work on behalf of New \nHampshire citizens and wish him luck in his new endeavor.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NEED FOR \n                   ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING AND TAX INCENTIVES \n                   FOR EMPOWERMENT ZONES AND ENTERPRISE \n                   COMMUNITIES AUTHORIZED AND DESIGNATED PURSUANT \n                   TO 1997 AND 1998 LAWS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) providing Federal tax incentives and other incentives \n     to distressed communities across the Nation to help them \n     rebuild and grow was one of the important goals of the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Omnibus Consolidated and \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999;\n       (2) to help reach that goal, the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n     1997 authorized 20 additional empowerment zones, 15 urban and \n     5 rural, followed by 20 new rural enterprise communities \n     authorized in 1998;\n       (3) the 1997 law authorizing this second round of \n     empowerment zones (EZs) was also significant and important \n     because it broadened empowerment zone eligibility, for the \n     first time, to Indian tribes and rural regions suffering from \n     massive out-migration;\n       (4) many of our urban and rural communities are not sharing \n     in the benefits of the prolonged economic expansion now \n     enjoyed by many other parts of our country;\n       (5) a total of more than 250 economically distressed urban \n     and rural communities competed for the 20 new empowerment \n     zones and 20 new rural enterprise communities, and those \n     areas designated as zones and communities should be provided \n     with the Federal incentives and encouragement they need to \n     attract new businesses, and the jobs they provide, in order \n     to stimulate economic growth and improvement;\n       (6) unfortunately, those areas that are designated EZs or \n     ECs under the 1997 and 1998 laws or rural economic area \n     partnerships (REAPs) by the Department of Agriculture, are \n     not given the full advantage of Social Services Block Grant \n     funds, tax credits, and some other Federal incentives that \n     Congress provided to the first round of empowerment zones and \n     enterprise communities authorized pursuant to 1993 budget \n     legislation;\n       (7) Congress should act swiftly to provide such designated \n     areas an equal share of tax incentives, grant benefits, and \n     other Federal support at aggregate levels of at least that \n     provided by Congress to distressed urban and rural \n     empowerment zones and enterprise communities pursuant to the \n     1993 omnibus budget reconciliation bill; and\n       (8) a fully funded second round of EZs and ECs is estimated \n     to create and retain about 90,000 jobs and stimulate \n     $10,000,000,000 in private and public investments over the \n     next decade.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) if Congress and the President agree to a substantial \n     tax relief measure, it should ensure that such measure \n     includes full funding for the second round of empowerment \n     zones and enterprise communities authorized in 1997 and 1998 \n     as well as those areas currently designated rural economic \n     area partnerships (REAPs) by the Department of Agriculture; \n     and\n       (2) all such designated distressed areas, rural and urban, \n     should equally share at least the same aggregate level of \n     funding, tax incentives, and other Federal support that \n     Congress provided to urban and rural empowerment zones and \n     enterprise communities authorized by the 1993 omnibus budget \n     reconciliation bill.\n\n     SEC. 1129.

Mr. President, I was heavily involved in the \nnegotiations over the manager's amendment to S. 880 as passed by the \nSenate by unanimous consent on June 23, and have carefully studied the \nHouse's amendments to S. 880, which we accept today. I rise to clarify \nthe congressional intent with respect to S. 880, the Chemical Safety \nInformation, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act of 1999, as \nwe pass it and send it to the President.\n  Balance between the right-to-know effect and risks of criminal \nactivity (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(ii)): The amendment directs the \nPresident to promulgate regulations governing the disclosure of the \noff-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) information in a way that minimizes \nthe likelihood of releases of the regulated chemicals, whether these \nreleases are accidental or the result of criminal activity. In\n\n[[Page S10061]]\n\nother words, the amendment calls for a balancing of the risk-reducing \neffect of public disclosure (the ``Right-to-Know Effect'') against the \npotential of increased risk of criminal activity associated with the \nposting of the OCA information on the Internet. Most importantly, \nreducing the threat of criminal activity is not the sole or even \nprimary focus of the rule-making. Rather the objective is to minimize \nthe release of regulated chemicals, which requires a balanced approach, \nand nothing in this Act necessarily precludes the eventual electronic \ndissemination of the information.\n  Off-site consequence analysis information (New section \n112(r)(7)(H)(i)(IV) and (V), and (xii)): The amendment defines ``off-\nsite consequence analysis information'' (OCA information) as a portion \nof a ``risk management plan,'' which is in turn defined as referring \nonly to information ``submitted to the Administrator by an owner or \noperator of a stationary source under subparagraph (B)'' of section \n112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act. Similarly, the amendment makes clear \nthat its restrictions apply only to OCA information in the form \nsubmitted to the Administrator (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(xii)). In \nother words, no information, except OCA information submitted to the \nAdministrator, in the form in which it was submitted, is affected by \nthe amendment. Even identical information that is made available to \nmembers of the public (unless there is a legally-binding restriction) \nor that is submitted to state or local agencies is not affected by the \nconstraints on disclosure established by the Act.\n  Official use (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(i)(III) and (vi)): The \namendment defines ``official use'' broadly--``an action . . . intended \nto carry out a function relevant to preventing, planning for or \nresponding to accidental releases or criminal releases''--to reflect \nthe sense that there are a broad range of official uses to which the \nOCA information may appropriately be put, so long as its public \navailability is constrained in accord with the regulations developed \nunder the amendment. The bill does not authorize the Administrator to \nestablish restrictions on such official use.\n  State and local official access to all OCA information (New section \n112(r)(7)(H)(ii)(II)(ee)): The amendment requires that any covered \nState and local official be provided, upon request, OCA information on \nany facility in the country, not just on facilities in the individual's \nState or community. This reflects, among other things, the fact that a \ncomprehensive evaluation of the facility next door should include \ncomparison with other facilities, including those owned by the same \ncompany or its competitors. Similarly, a comprehensive evaluation of \nthe hazard reduction programs of Community A requires a comparison of \nthe hazards presented by facilities in Community A with those presented \nin Community B.\n  Public access to OCA information regardless of geographic location \n(New section 112(r)(7)(H)(ii)(II)(aa)): The amendment makes clear that \nthe regulations shall allow any member of the public access to the OCA \ninformation for a limited number of facilities regardless of geographic \nlocation. This reflects the fact that the need to compare the \nneighborhood facility with facilities in other locations, or to compare \none's community with others, is just as important and appropriate for \nthe public as it is for officials.\n  Voluntary disclosure of OCA information: New section \n112(r)(7)(H)(v)(III): The amendment directs any facility that chooses \nto provide its OCA information to the public without legally-binding \nrestriction to inform the public, through EPA, of that voluntary \ndisclosure.\n  Qualified researchers (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(vii)): The amendment \ndirects the Administrator, in consultation with the Attorney General, \nto develop a system for providing access to OCA information for \n``qualified researchers.'' The Administrator is given authority to \ndetermine whether researchers are ``qualified,'' but is otherwise given \nno authority to screen researchers nor to deny them access to OCA \ninformation on the basis of political persuasion, likely findings, \npurpose to which findings would be put, or any other such factor.\n  Interaction with State law (New section 112(r)(7)H)(x)(II)): The \namendment makes clear that States with existing or new laws that \ncollect even data that is identical to OCA information are not \nprecluded from making the State- or local-gathered data available.\n  Reports on vulnerability to criminal activity (New section \n112(r)(7)(H)(xi)): The amendment directs the Attorney General to submit \na preliminary report in one year and a final report in three years on \nthe extent to which the Risk Management Program regulations have \nresulted in actions, by stationary sources among others, that are \neffective in detecting, preventing, and minimizing the consequences of \nreleases caused by criminal activity. The Comptroller General is \nspecifically directed to study the ``design and maintenance of safe \nfacilities'' so that Congress may learn the extent to which the best \nprotection against criminal activity is to maintain a facility that is \ninherently safe.\n  Reevaluation of disclosure regulations (Section 3(c)): The Act \ndirects the President to reevaluate the regulations governing \ndisclosure within six years. This reevaluation should be made on the \nsame basis used to promulgate the regulations--i.e. the President \nshould perform two separate assessments: (1) an assessment of the \nincreased risk of criminal activity associated with the internet \nposting of OCA information, and (2) an assessment of the incentives \ncreated by public disclosure of OCA information for reduction in the \nrisk of accidental releases. Written documentation of the two \nassessments and all information and data the President utilizes in \npreparation of the assessments should be a part of the administrative \nrecord associated with any determination the President makes regarding \nthe regulations, or any modification of the regulations.\n  General duty; Finally, the Act leaves the general duty clause of \nsection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act unchanged, in recognition of the \nfact that the Environmental Protection Agency believes that the general \nduty clause applies to releases caused by criminal or terrorist \nactivities.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my legislation, S. \n880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act, which passed Congress today, and \naccording to the Administration should be signed into law shortly. This \nbill was passed in the Senate by unanimous consent on June 23, 1999, \nand passed by the House with amendments, on July 21, 1999.\n  I appreciate the speediness with which the House acted on this \nlegislation and the support of my good friend Chairman Tom Bliley. \nUnfortunately the Senate is forced to act just as quickly on this \nlegislation because of delays created by the administration. In early \n1998, I raised concerns to the administration regarding the security \nrisks posed by disseminating the worst-case scenario data on the \nInternet. The FBI agreed with my concerns. Despite the acknowledgment \nof the risks involved the administration did not cooperate with \nCongress to fix this problem until the eleventh hour.\n  Because of the urgency in passing this legislation I have decided \nthat a conference would not be beneficial. While I agree with most of \nthe changes incorporated in the House-passed version, due to the haste \nof their consideration, I feel the necessity to explain in more detail \nmy view, as the lead sponsor, of one particular provision.\n  Section 3 of the act requires the ``Attorney General, and in \nconsultation with appropriate State, local, and Federal governmental \nagencies, affected industry, and the public, shall review the \nvulnerability of covered stationary sources to criminal and terrorist \nactivity, current industry practices regarding site security, and \nsecurity of transportation of regulated substances.''\n  In carrying out this provision, I ask the Attorney General, in \nconsulting with the Federal governmental agencies, to work with the \nIntelligence Community as well as the FBI. If any technical assistance \nregarding chemicals is needed I direct the Attorney General to work \nwith the Department of Energy facilities, particularly the Hazardous \nMaterial Spill Center at the Nevada Test site and the Sandia laboratory \nin New Mexico. Regarding the transportation issues, the Attorney \nGeneral should consult with the Department of Transportation. In \naddition, I would like to emphasize that\n\n[[Page S10062]]\n\nany confidential information or national security information should be \nclosely safeguarded.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the amendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
