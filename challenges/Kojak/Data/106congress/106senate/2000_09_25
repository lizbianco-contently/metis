Wrap Your arms around those who \nfind this day difficult; surprise them with Your life-giving grace and \nstrength.\n  Grant these Senators a heart for the people whom they serve, \nespecially those Americans whose hopes are diminished today, whose \ndreams constricted, who wonder if there's any voice that really speaks \non their behalf.\n  We thank You for blessings that come through those who serve with \nenergy, intelligence, imagination, and love. Grant these leaders \nhumility in discourse, courage to follow convictions, and wisdom to be \nled by conscience. May they be honoring of one another, and may the \nwork done here bring honor supremely to You, Sovereign Lord, before \nwhom all of us will one day stand and give account.\n  We offer our prayers from the different faith traditions in which we \nlive, and as a Christian I pray in Jesus' name.

It is kind of unique, Mr. President. You know \nOklahoma quite well. Oklahoma wasn't even a State until 1907, and yet \nthe First Presbyterian Church started in 1885. For the first 15 years, \nthe congregation was made up entirely of Cree Indian. It is an unusual \ntype of church. I might also add that in all those years--that would be \nwhat, 115 years--there have only been six pastors of the First \nPresbyterian Church of Tulsa. Dr. Jim Miller is the sixth pastor. So \nonce they come, they do not want to leave.\n  We are honored also to have with us his wife Diana and two of his \nchildren, David and Courtney, who are in attendance with my wife.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on Friday I moved that we proceed to the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act, and my good friend, the majority \nleader, objected to our proceeding to that bill. I was disappointed, \nand I am sorry that we are not going to be able to debate this issue, \nand hope that there will come a time before this Congress ends when we \nwill be able to do so.\n  Those who are watching for action on this important piece of \nlegislation should understand why we are at this point; that is, why we \nare not debating the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, but, rather, \nwhy we are now on H-1B only, and why tomorrow there is going to be a \nmotion to invoke cloture on the underlying bill.\n  I consider myself to be one of the strongest supporters for \nincreasing visas for highly skilled workers. I have spent an enormous \namount of time over the past several years working on this legislation \nin an effort to expedite its consideration. As a matter of fact, this \nlegislation should have been brought forward to the Senate many months \nago. It should have been taken up and debated under the normal process \nof considering legislation. I believe an H-1B bill would have passed \nquickly and the legislation would have already been signed into law. \nBut it also would have provided other Members opportunities, as is \ntheir right, to offer related immigration amendments for what we all \nagree is the only immigration bill that we would consider this year as \na freestanding bill.\n  Hindsight is 20-20. The majority decided not to consider this measure \nunder the traditional rules that have served the Senate for more than \n200 years. I believe, however, as I have indicated, that we will have \ntime to debate the legislation about which I speak.\n  I think it is unfortunate that we at this stage are going to do the \nH-1B bill, apparently, alone. I say that because we were so close to an \nagreement on this underlying legislation. The details were set--the \nminority agreed each side would have 10 amendments, an hour each. That \nwas compressed to five, then four. We agreed to do that. But we were \nturned down, and today we find ourselves in this parliamentary \nsituation.\n  We could pass this legislation, including the amendment about which I \nspeak, in a day--day and a half at the most. Instead, the majority is \ninsisting on closing off all debate and preventing the consideration of \nimmigration amendments.\n  I believe that offering and voting on amendments is a right, not a \nprivilege. H-1B was designed so trained professionals could work for a \nlimited time in the United States. It has become widely popular, \nespecially in an age such as this, when Microsoft, IBM and other high-\ntech companies decided they needed people to fill jobs that were simply \nnot being filled. Hundreds of start-up high-tech companies, in addition \nto the big ones such as Microsoft and IBM, began using this tool, H-1B, \nin an effort to recruit an army of high-tech workers for programming \njobs. Mostly these people came from India, China, and Great Britain. We \nnow have almost half a million people in this country who came as a \nresult of H-1B. Individuals have filled a critical shortage of high-\ntech workers in this country and, in fact, the demand still exists. \nThat is why we need to raise the cap for H-1B immigration.\n  But I also believe strongly that we cannot serve one of our country's \nvery important interests and needs at the expense of others--in \nparticular, when the stakes are people's families and their labor.\n  The needs of the United States are not subject to the zero sum \ntheory. We cannot afford to deal or choose or prioritize between people \nand who we will serve as their legislators. We must try to serve them \nall. That is our cause, and that is what we promised our constituents.\n  This applies specifically to the other pieces of legislation that \nhave been part of this discussion--in particular with the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act, the piece of legislation I moved to proceed on \nlast Friday. This piece of act seeks to provide permanent and legally \ndefined groups of immigrants who are already here, already working, and \nalready contributing to the tax base and social fabric of our country \nwith a way to gain U.S. citizenship.\n  This piece of legislation provides these people with a way to benefit \nfrom the opportunities our country affords good citizenship and hard \nwork. While sectors of this economy have benefited from this extended \nperiod of economic growth, and with unemployment rates approaching zero \nin some parts of our country, employers in all sectors, skilled and \nsemi-skilled, are finding themselves with a tremendous shortage of \nlabor. These views are echoed in many quarters.\n  I would like to refer, for example, to a letter sent to me by the \nEssential Worker Immigration Coalition, which is a group of businesses \nand trade associations from around the country which was formed \nspecifically to address the shortage of workers in this country. This \nletter, dated September 8, is addressed to me.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  Essential Worker\n\n\n                                        Immigration Coalition,\n\n                                                September 8, 2000.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Whip, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The Essential Worker Immigration \n     Coalition (EWIC) is a coalition of businesses, trade \n     associations, and other organizations from across the \n     industry spectrum concerned with the shortage of both semi-\n     skilled and unskilled (``essential worker'') labor.\n       While all sectors of the economy have benefited from the \n     extended period of economic growth, one significant \n     impediment to continued growth is the shortage of essential \n     workers. With unemployment rates in some areas approaching \n     zero and despite continuing vigorous and successful welfare-\n     to-work, school-to-work, and other recruitment efforts, some \n     businesses are now finding themselves with no applicants of \n     any kind for numerous job openings. There simply are not \n     enough workers in the U.S. to meet the demand of our strong \n     economy, and we must recognize that foreign workers are part \n     of the answer.\n       Furthermore, in this tight labor market, it can be \n     devastating when a business loses employees because they are \n     found to be in the U.S. illegally. Many of these workers have \n     been in this country for years; paying taxes and building \n     lives. EWIC supports measures that will allow them to remain \n     productive members of our society.\n       We believe there are several steps Congress can take now to \n     help stabilize the current workforce.\n       Update the registry date. As has been done in the past, the \n     registry date should be moved forward, this time from 1972 to \n     1986. This would allow undocumented immigrants who have lived \n     and worked in the U.S. for many years to remain here \n     permanently.\n       Restore Section 245(i). A provision of immigration law, \n     Section 245(i), allowed eligible people living here to pay a \n     $1,000 fee and adjust their status in this country. Since \n     Section 245(i) was grandfathered in 1998, INS backlogs have \n     skyrocketed, families have been separated, businesses have \n     lost valuable employees, and eligible people must leave the \n     country (often for years) in order to adjust.\n       Pass the Central American and Haitian Adjustment Act. \n     Refugees from certain Central American and Caribbean \n     countries currently are eligible to become permanent \n     residents. However, curent law does not help others in \n     similar circumstances. Congress needs to act to ensure that \n     refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti and Honduras have \n     the same opportunity to become permanent residents.\n       We are also enclosing our reform agenda which includes our \n     number one priority: allowing employers facing worker \n     shortages greater access to the global labor market. EWIC's \n     members employ many immigrants and support immigration \n     reforms that unite families and help stabilize the current \n     U.S. workforce. We look forward to working with you to pass \n     all of these important measures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Essential Worker\n                                            Immigration Coalition.\n\n\n                                members\n\n       American Health Care Association.\n       American Hotel & Motel Association.\n       American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n       American Meat Institute.\n       American Road & Transportation Builders Association.\n       American Nursery & Landscape Association.\n\n[[Page S9125]]\n\n       Associated Builders and Contractors.\n       Associated General Contractors.\n       The Brickman Group, Ltd.\n       Building Service contractors Associated International.\n       Carlson Hotels Worldwide and Radisson.\n       Carlson Restaurants Worldwide and TGI Friday's.\n       Cracker Barrel Old Country Store.\n       Harborside Healthcare Corporation.\n       Ingersoll-Rand.\n       International Association of Amusement Parks and \n     Attractions.\n       International Mass Retail Association.\n       Manufactured Housing Institute.\n       Nath Companies.\n       National Association for Home Care.\n       National Association of Chain Drug Stores.\n       National Association of RV Parks & campgrounds.\n       National Council of Chain Restaurants.\n       National Retail Federation.\n       National Restaurant Association.\n       National Roofing Contractors Association.\n       National Tooling & Machining Association.\n       National School Transportation Association.\n       Outdoor Amusement Business Association.\n       Resort Recreation & Tourism Management.\n       US Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this letter, among other things, states:\n\n       The Essential Worker Immigration Coalition is a coalition \n     of businesses, trade associations, and other organizations \n     from across the industry spectrum concerned with the shortage \n     of both semi-skilled and unskilled . . . labor.\n\n  That is why it is called the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition. \nAmong other things, they want to update the registry, they want to \nrestore section 254(I), and also, as part of their plea, they desire we \npass the Central American and Haitian Parity Act.\n  This coalition has many members. To mention a few: American Health \nCare Association, American Hotel & Motel Association, American \nImmigration Lawyers Association, American Road & Transportation \nBuilders Association, Ingersoll-Rand, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, \nCarlson Restaurants, National Retail Federation, National Restaurant \nAssociation, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among many others.\n  As you can tell, this piece of legislation has widespread support. \nThis is not a feel-good piece of legislation, that is only attempts to \nbring more people into the country. It is legislation that is supported \nby business people in this country who do not have workers to do the \nwork that is essential for them to conduct their business.\n  Take Nevada as an example. We, of course, depend on tourism as our \nNo. 1 industry. But every State in the Union does. Tourism is ranked in \nthe top three; in many instances, one or two, in every state of the \nUnion. Nevada is an example of why we need this, as it mirrors the \ncountry as a whole.\n  We have to build a new school in Clark County, Las Vegas, every month \nto keep up with the growth. We have as many as 10,000 people a month \nmoving into Las Vegas. We have jobs in the service industry that simply \ncannot be filled. We have one hotel that has 5,005 rooms. It takes \npeople to cook the food for the guests, to make the beds, do all the \nmaintenance work in this massive facility, and we are having trouble \nfinding people to do this work. That is another reason why we support \nthis legislation.\n  This bill aims to correct flaws in current immigration policy that \nhave separated families and denied individuals an opportunity to apply \nfor legal immigrant status by addressing three main issues. First, it \nwould address the Central American and Haitian Parity Act of 2000, \notherwise known as NACARA. This important legislation codifies that \nCentral American and Haitian immigrants be granted the same rights that \nare currently granted to Nicaraguans and Cubans coming to the United \nStates. There is no reason in the world that other people who come \nunder basically the same basis as Nicaraguans and Cubans should not be \ngiven the same privileges. Second, 245(I) reauthorizes legislation \nwhich would allow immigrants meeting certain criteria to remain in the \nUnited States with their families and loved ones, rather than being \nforced to leave the country while their status is being adjusted.\n  Every one of us in the Senate have heard these heartbreaking \nexamples, getting calls from our State offices where people are forced \nto go back to their country of origin when they already have a job \nhere, and a quirk in the law is the only reason that they are ordered \nto go home. Section 245(I) would reauthorize legislation which would \nallow these immigrants meeting these criteria to remain in the United \nStates while their status is being adjusted, rather than having them go \nhome, lose their job here, leave their family here. It serves no \npurpose for the country they go to, and certainly not the country from \nwhich they come, the United States.\n  The third main component of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act \nincorporates legislation I introduced earlier this year in S. 2407 that \nwould change the date of registry from 1972 to 1986.\n  I would like to provide a little background as to why I thought it \nwas necessary to introduce the Date of Registry Act of 2000. We all \nremember the massive immigration reform legislation we considered in \n1996 during the last days of the 104th Congress. Pasted into that was \nthe Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, an \nobscure but lethal description which stripped the Federal courts of \njurisdiction to adjudicate legalization claims against the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service.\n  First of all, let me say no one who supports this legislation \nsupports illegal immigration.\n  We believe people who come here should play by the rules. But some \npeople are found in predicaments that need to be readjusted and need to \nbe reexamined.\n  That is why this legislation is so important.\n  That provision I talked about was sneaked into the 1996 act, section \n377. This has caused significant hardship and denied due process and \nfundamental fairness for, not hundreds, not thousands, but hundreds of \nthousands of hard-working immigrants, including about 20,000 in the \nState of Nevada.\n  With its hands tied by section 377 language, the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals issued a series of rulings in which it dismissed the claims \nof class action members and revoked thousands of work permits and stays \nfrom deportation.\n  As I said, in Nevada alone, about 20,000 people have been affected. \nThese are good, hard-working people who have been in the United States \nand paid taxes for more than a decade. Suddenly they lose their jobs \nand ability to support their families.\n  I can remember Bill Richardson came to the State of Nevada. He was \nthen the ambassador to the United Nations. We have a large Hispanic \npopulation in Nevada. Over 25 percent of the kids in our six largest \nschool districts in America have Latino ancestry.\n  Recently I took part in an event with Secretary of Energy Richardson. \nWe were going to this recreation center. It was kind of late at night. \nWe were told before going there that there were a lot of demonstrators \nand we should go in the back way, not go in the front way.\n  Ambassador Richardson and I decided we would go in the front way and \nwalk through these people out there. There were hundreds of people \nthere, none of whom were there to cause any trouble. They were there to \ntell a story, and the stories they told were very sad. These were \npeople who had American children who were born in the United States and \neither a husband or wife had improper paperwork done. There were \nproblems. For example, one of the attendees gave a large sum of money \nto an individual who said he could help them with their citizenship \npapers. Later he found out that they had not been properly filled out. \nThey were being cheated. There were all kinds of reasons why these \npeople did not meet the program that was necessary to allow them to be \nhere legally. But the main problem they had was section 377 because \nthey could not have a due process hearing. It was outlawed in the 1996 \nact.\n  There were terribly sad stories of these people who had lost their \nhomes because of having no work permits. Employers were there saying: \nWhy can't this man or woman work? I need them. I can't find anybody to \nreplace them.\n  This was one occasion I met with these people. I met with them on \nseveral other occasions, and I have seen firsthand the pain this cruel \nprocess has caused. Men and women who once knew the dignity of a \ndecent, legal wage have been forced to seek work underground in an \neffort to make ends meet. Mortgages have been foreclosed\n\n[[Page S9126]]\n\nwhen families who lived in their own homes have been unable to pay \ntheir mortgages. They have lost their cars. Parents who had fulfilled \ndreams of sending their children to college, as they themselves had not \nbeen able to do, have seen those dreams turn into nightmares.\n  What could have happened to create these most unfortunate \nconsequences? As I said, there are lots of reasons. For example, during \nthe 99th Congress, we passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of \n1986, which provided a one-time opportunity for certain aliens already \nin the United States who met specific criteria to legalize that status.\n  The statute established a 1-year period from May of 1987 to May of \n1988, during which the INS was directed to accept and adjudicate \napplications from persons who wished to legalize their status. However, \nin implementing the congressionally mandated legalization program, the \nINS created new criteria and a number of eligibility rules that were \nnowhere to be found in the 1986 legislation.\n  In short, the INS failed to abide by a law passed by a Democratic \nCongress and signed by a Republican President, President Reagan.\n  Thousands of people who were, in fact, eligible for legalization were \ntold they were ineligible or were blocked from filing legalization \napplications. Thousands of applicants sued, but by the time the Supreme \nCourt ruled in 1993 that the INS indeed contravened the 1986 \nlegislation, the 1-year period for applying for legalization had \npassed. They were in a Catch-22.\n  While conceding that it had unlawfully narrowed eligibility for \nlegalization, the INS was clearly dissatisfied with the Supreme Court \ndecision. So the court cases dragged on, and the agency employed a \ndifferent, much more clever approach.\n  Rather than affording the people within these classes due process of \nlaw, the INS succeeded in slipping an obscure amendment into the \nmassive 1996 Illegal Immigrant Reform and Responsibility Act which, in \neffect, as I said, stripped the Federal courts of their jurisdiction to \nhear claims based upon the 1986 legislation. That provision was section \n377 and is now, unfortunately, the law of the land.\n  Changing the date of registry to 1986 would ensure that those \nimmigrants who were wrongfully denied the opportunity to legalize their \nstatus would finally be afforded that which they deserved 13 years ago.\n  It is of interest to note that it was also during 1986 that the \nCongress last changed the date of registry. The date of registry exists \nas a matter of public policy, with the recognition that immigrants who \nhave remained in the country continuously for an extended period of \ntime--and in some cases as many as 30 years--are highly unlikely to \nleave, and that is an understatement.\n  Today we must accept the reality that many of the people living in \nthe United States are undocumented immigrants who have been here for a \nlong time. Consequently, they do pay some taxes, but they could be \npaying more. They pay sales tax, and many times they do not pay income \ntaxes. As a result, the businesses that employ these undocumented \npersons do not pay their fair share of taxes.\n  These are the facts, and coupled with the knowledge that we cannot \nsimply solve this problem by wishing it away, this is the reality we \nmust face when considering our immigration policies today and tomorrow.\n  We last changed the date of registry in 1986 with the passage of the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act which changed the date from January \n1, 1972. In doing that, the 99th Congress employed the same rationale I \nhave outlined above in support of a registry date change.\n  Furthermore, my date of registry legislation included in this bill is \ncritical in another aspect. It establishes an appropriate 15-year \ndifferential between the date of enactment and the updated date of \nregistry.\n  This measure builds upon the 15-year differential standard \nestablished in the 1986 reform legislation by implementing a ``rolling \nregistry'' date which would sunset in 5 years without congressional \nreauthorization. In other words, on January 1, 2002, the date of \nregistry would automatically change to January 1, 1987, thereby \nmaintaining the 15-year differential. The date of registry would \ncontinue to change on a rolling basis through January 1, 2006, when the \ndate of registry would be January 1, 1991. Limiting this automatic \nchange to 5 years would allow the Congress to examine both the positive \nand negative effects of a rolling date of registry and make an informed \ndecision on reauthorization.\n\n  I should note again that the Immigration Reform and Control Act of \n1986, which last changed the date of registry, was passed by a \nDemocratic Congress and a Republican President. I mention these facts \nto highlight my hope that support for this legislation will be \nbipartisan and based upon our desire to ensure fundamental fairness as \na matter of public policy in our country.\n  We hear many of our friends on the other side of the aisle, \nparticularly the Republican candidate for President, talking about how \nthe priorities of the Latino community are his priorities. I can tell \neveryone within the sound of my voice that I have met with many members \nof the Latino community, and whether it is members of the Hispanic \ncaucus in the Congress or community activists in Nevada or other parts \nof the country, I am consistently reminded that the provisions \ncontained in the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act are of their highest \npriority.\n  Vice President Gore recognizes this fact and believes he is truly in \ntouch with the concerns and needs of the Latino community by supporting \nthis legislation. If Governor Bush were really serious about the \npriorities of the Latino community, he would follow Vice President \nGore's lead and demand that Congress take up and pass this act today.\n  This bill would solve the problems of many who have lived in this \ncountry for many years but have been wrongly denied the opportunity to \nlegalize their status. This bill would solve the problem of workers who \nhave been paying taxes, who have feared having their work permits \nstripped, or worse, being deported and separated from their families.\n  Consider for a moment U.S. citizens of Latino ancestry--past \nimmigrants--who have made significant contributions to American society \nand culture in every sphere, as have other immigrants from other parts \nof the world. I am very proud of the fact my father-in-law immigrated \nto this country from Russia. We are a nation of immigrants. My \ngrandmother came from England.\n  Throughout our short history as a nation, immigrants have fueled the \nengine of our economy, and Latino immigrants are no different. Latino \npurchasing power has grown 43 percent since 1995, reaching over $400 \nbillion this year. Because Latinos create jobs, the number of Latino-\nowned firms grew by over 76 percent between 1987 and 1992, and will \nemploy over 1.5 million people by next year.\n  Latinos care about the United States and are willing to fight for it \ntoo. Americans of Latino ancestry have fought for the United States in \nevery war beginning with the American Revolution. Currently, \napproximately 80,000 Latino men and women are on active duty, and over \n1 million Latinos are veterans of foreign wars.\n  Finally, Latinos participate in the American democracy. Of registered \nvoters, Latinos have a higher voter turnout than the population as a \nwhole. Latinos, both established and those new to our hometowns, \ncontribute greatly to the United States. What better time to reconsider \nour Latino immigration policy and make it more practical and more fair \nthan this month as we celebrate Latino Heritage Month.\n  America has always drawn strength from the extraordinary diversity of \nits people, and Latino Heritage Month presents an opportunity to \ncommemorate the history, achievements, and contributions of Americans \nof Latino ancestry, as well as think to the future.\n  Immigrants' love for this country is predicated by the recognition of \nfirsthand knowledge of how special this country is and how privileged \nthey are and we are to live here. I believe Latinos will continue to \nmake important contributions to America's future, but in order for \nLatinos to continue helping America, America must help them with this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nNational Restaurant Association be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9127]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2000.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the National Restaurant \n     Association and the 815,000 restaurants nationwide, we want \n     to thank you for introducing S. 2407, the Date of Registry \n     Act of 2000, and urge the prompt passage of this legislation.\n       The restaurant industry is the nation's largest private \n     sector employer, providing more than 11 million jobs across \n     the nation. Restaurants have long played an integral role in \n     this country's workforce. Not only does the restaurant \n     industry provide a first step into the workforce for \n     thousands of new workers, for many of them it provides a \n     career. In face, 90 percent of all restaurant managers and \n     owners got their start in entry-level positions within the \n     industry. Throughout the next century, restaurants will \n     continue to be the industry of opportunity. However, there \n     will be many challenges for the restaurant industry in the \n     face of a growing global economy and a tightening labor \n     market. Addressing the labor shortage is of critical concern.\n       The restaurant industry is the proud employer of many \n     immigrants and has long supported immigration reforms that \n     unite families and help stabilize the current U.S. workforce. \n     While S. 2407 does not address our key concerns about labor \n     shortages, we believe it will help stabilize the current \n     workforce. Nearly 15 years ago, Congress enacted a \n     legalization program that the INS, through action and \n     regulation, wrongly prohibited many qualified immigrants from \n     using. Furthermore, in 1996 Congress stripped federal courts \n     of their ability to hear those immigrants' cases. S. 2407 \n     would address the problems created by these circumstances. \n     The National Restaurant Association strongly supports passage \n     of S. 2407.\n       We look forward to working with you long-term to address \n     the labor shortage issue and to passing S. 2407 this year. \n     Thank you for your efforts to reform immigration laws.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steven C. Anderson,\n       President and Chief Executive Officer.\n     Lee Culpepper,\n       Senior Vice President, Government Affairs and Public \n     Policy.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the \nColumbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on \nsensible gun legislation.\n  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nUntil we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of \nthose who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and \nwe will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.\n  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight.

Every day at that club, more than 300 kids participated in \nathletics and other after-school activities. Known as the ``professor'' \nat the club, Roy tried to steer youngsters away from gangs, violence \nand drugs. One year ago today, Roy was driving home when a gang member \nhe knew from the neighborhood flagged him down. Roy expressed concern \nfor the boy and encouraged him to stop associating with gangs. \nEvidently, the boy was insulted by Roy's words because the boy pulled a \ngun and shot at Roy until the gun was out of ammunition.\n  Another victim, 15-year-old Richard Love of St. Louis, died after he \nwas shot in the abdomen by two of his friends while they were playing \nwith his .22 caliber pistol.\n  Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by \ngunfire one year ago Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n  September 22, 1999: Telly Butts, 22, Gary, IN; Ray Clay, 40, Detroit, \nMI; Emmitt Crawford, 54, Oklahoma City, OK; Berneal Fuller, 27, Gary, \nIN; Ricardo Griffin, 22, Detroit, MI; Benjamin Hall, 45, New Orleans, \nLA; Desean Knox, 14, Gary, IN; Randy Ladurini, 29, Minneapolis, MN; \nWilliam McClary, 29, Detroit, MI; Yonatan Osorio, 17, Dallas, TX; \nVictor Richardson, 28, Denver, CO; Marice Simpson, 26, New Orleans, LA.\n  September 23, 1999: Domingo Alvarez, 63, Miami, FL; William Belle, \n70, Miami, FL; James Bonds, 43, Baltimore, MD; Peter A.

Mr. President, for the past 2 weeks, my colleagues have \nheard me speak regarding the need to add a prescription medication \nbenefit to Medicare. I indicated that in my judgment the most \nfundamental reform for Medicare is to shift it from a program which, \nsince its inception, has focused on illness and accident--that is, \nproviding services after one becomes sick enough, generally, to go into \nthe hospital or has suffered an accident that requires treatment and \nhospitalization--and move to a system that also emphasizes prevention; \nthat is, to maintain the highest state of good health and not wait \nuntil the state of good health has been destroyed.\n  If we are to adopt that fundamental shift, it will necessitate that \nMedicare provide a prescription drug benefit. Why? Because virtually \nevery regimen that is prescribed to stabilize a condition or reverse a \ncondition involves prescription drugs. So a fundamental component of \nreforming Medicare is to provide prescription drugs.\n  I have also spoken about the skyrocketing drug prices which are now \naffecting virtually all of our older citizens.\n  Today, in my fifth and final statement in this series, I want our \ncolleagues to hear from real people, the people who are affected by the \ndecisions we are about to make. These stories remind us that we have \nlittle time to waste.\n  Unfortunately, some of the voices I am going to present are probably \ngoing to be too far gone in their need for prescription drugs and in \ntheir personal circumstances to benefit by a program which, under the \nmost optimistic timetable, would not commence until October 1, 2002 \nand, under other proposals, would be even 2 years beyond that in terms \nof being available through the Medicare program as a universal benefit.\n  While we are arguing as to whether to put a prescription medication \nbenefit into effect and start the clock running towards the time when \nit will actually be available, people are breaking bones. They are \ngoing blind. While we are debating which party would benefit\n\n[[Page S9128]]\n\nfrom the passage of a prescription drug program this year, people are \nin pain.\n  This is not a hyperbole. This is not rhetoric. This is reality for \nhundreds of thousands of seniors from every State and from every \npolitical persuasion. This is a 911 call. If we fail to pass a \nprescription drug benefit this session, if we fail to start the clock \nrunning towards the time when this benefit will be available to all \nMedicare beneficiaries, we will have ignored their pleas for help.\n  I appreciate being provided with a few moments to share some of these \nvoices of pain. I am also painfully aware that the stories I am going \nto tell are not unique. They are common. They have become near cliches \nhere in Washington. I would wager that every one of us has a \nconstituent who has written us about splitting pills to make \nprescriptions last longer. My guess is that every Member of this \nChamber has heard from someone who has to make that difficult choice \nbetween food or prescription drugs. And we hear from doctors handing \nout free samples of medicine whenever they can get them and begging for \nhelp on behalf of their patients.\n  We get letters describing situations as ``desperate'' and from \nnumerous people who tell us they are at wits' end. The tragedy is that \nwe have been telling these stories for so long they are beginning to \nsound like nothing more than 30-second TV clips. The fault is ours for \nfailing to act. These are not 30-second sound bits. These are real \nstories of our friends, our neighbors, in many cases our parents and \ngrandparents. Someday they could be all of us.\n\n  These are people such as Nancy Francis of Daytona Beach, FL. Ms. \nFrancis used to be able to get the medication she needs through \nMedicaid as a medically indigent older person. Then the Government did \nher a great favor. It raised her monthly Social Security check. Because \nof that raise, she is now too rich by all of $6.78 a month, to qualify \nfor Medicaid. This $6.78 leaves her fully dependent upon Medicare for \nhealth care financing.\n  Medicare is a good system with a gaping hole. It does not cover \nprescription drugs. Medicaid, the program for the medically indigent, \npaid for nine prescriptions Ms. Francis takes in order to stay active \nand well. Medicare pays for none. Ms. Francis can put every penny of \nthat $6.78 a month towards her prescriptions and it won't make a dent. \nSo for some months, Ms. Francis just doesn't buy any prescription \ndrugs. Then she waits and hopes she will be able to stay alive long \nenough for help to arrive.\n  Then there is Mary Skidmore of New Port Richey, FL. Mrs. Skidmore \nworked for 20 years renting fishing boats. Her late husband worked on \nthe railroad. Now she thinks she may have to get another job. Mrs. \nSkidmore is 87 years old. She has two artificial knees. No one, she \nsays, will hire her. She needs a job to pay for a new hearing aid. \nWithout a hearing aid, she cannot hear sermons at her church on Sunday. \nBut with $300 a month in prescription medication bills, a hearing aid \nis a luxury that Mrs. Skidmore cannot afford.\n  She takes medication for her heart, cholesterol, bones, and blood \npressure. Giving up this medicine is not an option. It is, in her \nwords, ``what keeps me going.''\n  Mrs. Skidmore's medication bills have even kept her from marrying her \nboyfriend. He has enough to pay for the utilities in the home they \nshare, but not much else. If she marries him, she will lose her former \nhusband's railroad pension--a pension that she counts on to survive.\n  Marsaille Gilmore of Williston, FL, is a little bit luckier. Between \nSocial Security and a little bit of income from investments, she and \nher husband can usually pay for the $300 to $400 per month she spends \non prescription medication. Sometimes they even have a little left over \nto go out to dinner--but not to the movies. Mrs. Gilmore says the \nmovies are too expensive.\n  Some months, the Gilmores are not so lucky. Recently, their truck \nbroke down. It is now in the shop, and things are stretched pretty \ntight. Sometimes things are so tight that the Gilmores think about \ngoing to Mexico to stock up for half the price on the very same \nmedications they now buy in Williston.\n  Remember Elaine Kett? I told her story last week. Elaine is 77 years \nold. She spends nearly half her income on medication. This chart \nindicates the number of prescription drugs which Mrs. Kett fills every \nmonth. The total is $837.78 a month or $10,053.36 a year. That figure \nis almost exactly half of Mrs. Kett's total annual income. Her \nprescriptions are helping to keep her alive. How ironic then that in \nher plea for help she writes that the cost of medication is ``killing \nher.'' It is the very thing she depends upon for life; it is the source \nof her quality of life.\n  Dorothy Bokish is in a similar trap. She pays $188 in rent each month \nand $162 for her prescription drugs. That leaves her with $238 a month \nfor food, heat, air-conditioning, and gas. It doesn't leave much for \nher to buy gifts for her grandchildren or to take herself to an \noccasional show. I shudder to think what would happen should something \ngo wrong--or, if I may say, more wrong--for Mrs. Bokish.\n  What would she have to give up if her water heater broke or a storm \nknocked out a window in her home? What does she have left to give up? \nWhat some seniors are considering giving up is unconscionable.\n  A central Florida man told his family, which is helping to buy his \nmedication so his wife can afford to continue to take hers, he is \nconsidering giving up his medication so that his wife can live. If he \ndoes so, he will certainly die.\n  Another Florida senior has gone through two grueling heart surgeries \nand has been prescribed medication to stave off a third. But he can't \nafford to fill the prescription. He says he thinks sometimes he would \nrather die than go through surgery again. He says that sometimes the \nstruggle to survive is just too much.\n  I am profoundly embarrassed when I tell these stories. I am \nembarrassed that in these times of unprecedented prosperity as a \nnation, we have not come together to find some way to ease this pain. \nThese seniors and countless others wait and wait and wait. There are \nthose who now say we have to wait until another election to even begin \nthe process of providing meaningful prescription drug coverage. Many of \nthem won't be able to wait until the next month, much less until \nanother extended period of indecision here.\n  The time to act is now. This is quite literally a matter of life and \ndeath. It is also quite literally a challenge to our Nation's basic \nsense of decency and values. It is my hope that before this session of \nthe Congress concludes, we will have responded to the highest values of \nour American tradition.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I would like to talk about two things \ntoday. The first is energy policy--or America without an energy policy.\n  Let me say with as much certainty as I can muster that we have no \nenergy policy because the Interior Department of the United States, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency of the United States, and the Energy \nDepartment all have priorities, and they are ideological priorities \nthat put the production of energy for the American people last. There \nis some other objective, motive, or goal that is superior to the \nproduction of oil and gas and the development of an energy policy that \nuses coal.\n  Do you think Americans know today that we have not built a coal-\nburning powerplant in America in 12 years? Do you think Americans know \nthat the only thing we are doing to increase our electric capacity so \nthey can have light, electricity, and everything else in their homes is \nto build a powerplant\n\n[[Page S9129]]\n\nwith natural gas? We have built five--all with natural gas. And we sit \nback and wonder why natural gas has gone from $2 to $5.63 in 9 months.\n  Let me be the first to predict that the next crisis will be when \nnatural gas goes even higher, because we have made it the only fuel we \ncan use--under what? Under the policies of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, which has their own rules, their own regulations, and their own \nideologies. I have not heard them say once we have adjusted an \nenvironmental concern because we are worried about America's energy \npolicy.\n  I wonder if the occupant of the chair has ever heard the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency say we must be doing something wrong \nbecause there are no new refineries being built in America--none, zero, \nzip. The greatest nation on Earth has not built a new refinery to \nconvert crude oil into the products of everyday use for years. We have, \nin fact, closed 38 refineries to environmental concerns--albeit they \nare small.\n  We own millions of acres of land. That is why I say the Interior \nDepartment is part of our energy policy. But they have different \nconcerns. They never consult on energy issues. So what do they do? They \nlock up millions of acres of land that could produce oil or natural gas \nand say, We are not going to touch them.\n  Why don't you ask Americans? Why don't you ask Americans whether they \nwant to be more beholden to the cartel or whether they would like to \nuse a little bit of their property to go in and drill an oil well? Do \nit with whatever protection you want for the environment.\n  Let's have a serious debate about ANWR, an American piece of real \nestate that is beautiful and something we should protect. It has many \nmillions and millions of barrels of American oil that could be produced \nby American companies for American use. And every time it is brought up \non the floor of the Senate, the environmentalists in America consider \nthat even to take a little, tiny piece of that huge refuge and go see \nhow many millions of barrels of oil are there would be the biggest \nenvironmental disaster ever.\n  But who is worrying about Americans who want to use oil and have it \nrefined so they can drive their automobiles? Who would like to use the \ncoal we have in abundance and make sure we use it as cleanly as \npossible, and build powerplants so we don't run out of electricity and \nso we don't have brownouts in California?--Brownouts which some are \npredicting today because the policies that could have affected the \nproduction of electricity for California have not been judged on the \nbasis of our energy needs, they have been based only upon environmental \npurity.\n  That is why the United States of America is the most difficult piece \nof geography occupied by humans in the world in terms of establishing \nin America a powerplant. It is the most difficult and expensive place \nin the world to build a powerplant with the greatest engineers and \nscientists around. We can't build one because there is no agreement \nbetween the Environmental Protection Agency and the public holders of \nland to work together. The question is never asked: What would be good \nfor American energy policy?\n\n  Let me move on. Let me make sure we understand. We don't have someone \nmaking energy policy, or setting the rules, or saying to the American \nprivate sector: Here are the rules; go work under them. We have none \nbecause Interior, EPA, and Energy all have priorities, and none of \ntheir priorities makes the production of oil and gas and the \ndevelopment of our coal high priorities.\n  The Interior Department is making the drilling for oil and natural \ngas as difficult as possible. EPA, rather than devising good \nenvironmental policy based on sound science, it has become the enemy. \nThis is due to an ideological, pure environmental policy at the expense \nof providing energy we need. This is not understood by most Americans. \nYet we have an Energy Department. Sometimes I feel sorry for the \nSecretary of Energy because there is no authority for them to do much \nabout anything. But we do have a strange oxymoron. We have an Energy \nDepartment that is anti-nuclear power and pro-windmills to produce \nelectricity and sources of electrical power for America.\n  I might repeat, we have an Energy Department that is pro-windmill and \nanti-nuclear. I give Secretary Richardson credit for moving slightly \nunder the prodding of Congress to do a little bit of research in future \nyears on the use of nuclear power, which may end up falling on America \nas being the only thing we can do in 15 or 20 years that is \nenvironmentally clean by the time we get around to explaining it as \nsafer than most any other source of energy. Yet only recently do we \nhave an energy policy that would consider anything that has to do with \nnuclear power now or for the future.\n  Treasury Secretary Summers warned the President that the \nadministration's proposal--now a decision--to drive down energy prices \nby opening the Government's emergency oil reserves--and I quote--\n``would be a major and substantial policy mistake.'' Summers wrote the \nPresident--and Greenspan agreed--that using the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve to ``manipulate prices rather than adhering to its original \npurpose of responding to a supply disruption is a dangerous \nprecedent.''\n  You see, fellow Senators, we have established a Strategic Petroleum \nReserve in the afterglow of some foreign country saying, ``We are \ncutting off your oil supply.'' And, even though it was a small amount, \nthey said, We are cutting it off--and we were dependent on it. Lines \nwere forming at our gasoline stations. Do you recall? In the State of \nNew York, the lines were forming at 5:30 in the morning, to my \nrecollection. People were so mad at each other that, if they thought \nsomebody went ahead of them in line--in one case in eastern America, \nthey even shot the person who went ahead of them in the line.\n  We said we ought to find a place to put crude oil so that if anybody \nstops the flow of crude oil to America, or engages in some kind of war, \nor mischief that denies us our energy, we will have a certain number of \ndays of supply in the ground for use. Mr. President, that is a lot \ndifferent than an America which is now without any energy policy.\n\n  We say the prices have gone too high, even though everything I have \nsaid contributed to it: An Interior Department that won't let you \nproduce oil, an Environmental Protection Agency that has no reason to \nconsider whether their rules and regulations are so stringent, too \nstringent, beyond reasonable, whether in the area of refineries, in the \narea of building a powerplant, in the area of producing more energy \nthrough wells that we drill, their policies have nothing whatever to do \nwith energy needs of our country.\n  With all that piled on America, we have an election coming up and the \noil prices are a little too high. We would like to take a little bit of \nthat oil out of the reserve and put it on the market and use it. \nSecretary Summers added that the move ``would expose us to valid \ncharges of naivete, a very blunt tool to address heating oil prices.'' \nThat is from the Secretary of the Treasury a couple of weeks ago.\n  Of course, over the weekend, a spokesman for this administration and \nfor the Gore campaign got on the national networks and said: The \nSecretary is with us. Of course, he works for the President.\n  They all sat down and said: What is the worse thing that can happen \nto the Gore campaign? Clearly, they all said if these oil prices keep \ngoing up. It is not a question of, can we produce heating oil; our \nrefineries are at the maximum production already. This release of \nadditional barrels from the reserve can do nothing for that. It is just \nthat the price is so high that a lot of poor people in northeastern \nAmerica who still use heating oil, and those in the West are not aware \nhow many, but there are millions; they are not going to be very happy. \nThat is the issue. That is why the petroleum reserve is being used.\n  The truth is, in our country it behooves people like myself and many \nothers to at least make sure the public understands why we are in the \nmess we are, who got us there, what was done to make it so that it \nwouldn't happen the way it has. All the answers come down to the fact \nthat nobody was worried so long as the prices were cheap, so long as \nthose OPEC countries were producing more than was needed in the world, \nkeeping the prices down at $10 or $11 or $12 a barrel.\n\n[[Page S9130]]\n\n  While we lived happily and merrily, month by month, with that \nsituation, firing up our great economic recovery, at the same time we \nwere destroying millions of little stripper wells that were producing \nthree and four barrels per well. They closed down because the price was \ntoo cheap. Even today, we are producing less oil than we were 3 or 4 \nyears ago because we destroyed oil production capacity when we let it \ngo too low, while we were exhilarated with the fact that the cartel was \ncheating on itself and the price of oil was coming down. We didn't \nbother to find out how much that was affecting New Mexico in an adverse \nmanner. When it went up in price, we went to them and said: Now it \nought to come down; it is too high. I don't imagine for the first few \nmonths they greeted us with too much joy or willingness to help us \nafter we sat by and watched it go so low without any concern for what \nhappened to them.\n  Refineries were running at 95 percent last week. To take a supply out \nof SPR, it would still need to be refined into heating oil. Obviously, \nI have explained that isn't the issue. The issue will be the price. We \ndon't have enough refining capacity to take the SPR and add to the \nsupply of heating oil.\n  What else does this using the reserve as it was not intended by \nCongress do? It sends the wrong signal to the private industry in \nAmerica. If I am in the business of storing heating oil, and the \nFederal Government starts stockpiling, I cut my reserve and I assume \nsomebody will come in here asking us to prohibit them from cutting \ntheir own reserves. Clearly, they cannot keep their storage to maximum \ncapacity while the government is building its own capacity to compete--\nsomething we won't figure out until it is too late. Then somebody will \nsay: Why did this happen? They should not have cut back on their \nreserves.\n\n  I indicated natural gas prices were going up, up, and away. This \nfantastic fuel is $5.35 per 1,000 cubic feet; 6 months ago it was \n$2.16. We are talking about oil and derivatives of oil because of the \ncartel. From $2.16 to $5.35 is not because of any cartel; it is because \nof the huge demand for natural gas. When the demand gets so big the \nproduction can't go up so fast, what happens? The price goes up. That \nis a big signal and a sign to us.\n  No one seems to be concerned in this administration that we haven't \nbuilt a powerplant to generate electricity for the growing demand, such \nas in California. We haven't built a new powerplant of any significance \nbecause the only thing we can build it with is natural gas. We cannot \nbuild it with coal, even though they were being built around the world. \nAmerica's environmental laws are out of tune with America's energy \nneeds. They haven't been tuned to be concerned about America's energy \nfuture. It is just ideological--as pure as you can get it in terms of \nenvironmental cleanliness. That is it for America.\n  Inventories are 15 percent below last winter's level and 50 percent \nof America's homes are heated with natural gas. They are beginning to \nsee it in their bills. Clearly, America has almost no competitor for \nthat. We don't have an abundance of electricity to take its place. In \nfact, brownouts are expected in many parts of the country because we \nare underproducing what we need by way of electricity.\n  Natural gas fires 18 percent of the electric power. I am sure there \nare many sitting back saying: Isn't that neat? We haven't had to worry \nabout nuclear. We don't have to clean up coal to the maximum and use \nsome of it to produce electricity in America. We just build natural gas \npowerplants. We used to forbid it. I think the occupant of the Chair \nremembers that during the crisis we said don't use natural gas for \npowerplants. We took that out.\n  Here goes America. Next crisis, will there be enough natural gas or \nwill the price be so high? It will not be just to those who are burning \nit for powerplants. It will be in 50 percent of the homes in America. \nThey will start asking: Where is an energy policy with some balance \nbetween energy sources instead of moving all in one direction because \nall we were concerned about was the environment?\n  Compared to 1983, 60 percent more Federal land is now off limits to \ndrilling. I spoke generally of that. Now I will be specific. As \ncompared with 1983, there is 60 percent more Federal land that is off \nlimits for drilling. On October 22, 1999, Vice President Gore said in \nRye, NH: I will do everything in my power to make sure there is no new \ndrilling.\n  I guess what we ought to be working on is when will we no longer need \nany crude oil, which is refined into gasoline and all those wonderful \nproducts? Because, if you brag to America that you will do everything \nin your power to make sure there is no new drilling, we have to ask the \nquestion: Where are we going to get the oil?\n  I will move to another item that I spoke of generally a while ago, a \ngreat American reserve of crude oil called ANWR, up in Alaska. I \nbelieve any neutral body of scientists--geologists, engineers--could go \nup there and take a look and report to the Congress and the people of \nthis country that ANWR could produce oil for America without harming \nthat great natural wilderness. I am absolutely convinced that is the \ncase. Yet you cannot believe the furor that attends even a mild \nsuggestion that we ought to do something such as that. Perhaps somebody \nwill even quote what I just said, saying that I am for destroying the \nANWR, that I am for destroying that wilderness area, that natural \nbeauty.\n  No, I am not. I am for trying to put together a policy that increases \nour production of crude oil so we can at least send a signal to the \nworld that we do not want to increase our dependence. We want to do \nsomething for ourselves, and wouldn't it be nice if there were a stable \noil market so Americans could get involved in production here at home, \nhiring Americans? It would be owned by Americans if that happened in \nANWR. What a stimulus for American growth in oil-patch-type activities.\n  OCS, offshore drilling--off limits. There is no question we could \ndouble our domestic supply if we could open up some of the offshore \ndrilling areas. Clearly, the more we have to import crude oil, the more \nthe environmental risk in getting it here in tankers where something \ncould happen to them. The amount keeps going up. Yet right in various \nof our bays and ocean fronts, there is natural gas in abundance. And \nthere exist wells where we have proved we know how to do it. But \nsomebody says: Oh, my, no more of that. That's environmentally \ndegrading.\n  What are we going to talk about when Americans say we cannot afford \nthe natural gas because the only thing we are fueling powerplants with \nand using in America is natural gas? We have it out there in the oceans \nand in some bays--yet we would not dare touch it? There are 43 million \nacres of forest land that are off limits for roadbuilding, thereby \nmaking exploration and production impossible.\n  The Kyoto agreement would envision doubling the use of natural gas, \nthus doubling electricity costs. No policies address either \nconsequence. Multiple use, which we used to think was a great thing for \nour public lands, is only words today. Multiple use means if there are \nnatural resources that can help Americans and can help prosperity and \nhelp us grow, that ought to be used along with recreation and other \nthings. That has almost left the vocabularies of those in high places \nwho manage our public lands. There are 15 sets of new EPA regulations \nthat affect the areas we are talking about. Not one new refinery has \nbeen built since 1976. This administration's energy policy has, in my \nopinion, been in deliberate disregard of the consequences on the \nconsumers' checkbook and their standard of living and the way people \nwill be living in the United States.\n  This summer we had soaring gasoline prices and that left motorists in \nAmerica--as prices soared they got more and more sore, but they didn't \nknow who to get sore at. The prices are still pretty high.\n  Other consequences that have been deliberately disregarded are the \nelectricity price spikes California experienced this summer. \nCalifornians usually spend about $7 billion a year in electricity. This \nspike was so dramatic they spent $3.6 billion in the month of July, \nonly half of what they spent annually before that. That is a great \nquestion to be asked--why? California is a big electricity importer. \nThey have ever-growing demands because of Silicon Valley. These \ncompanies use a lot of electricity and a lot of energy. Demand was up \n20 percent in the San\n\n[[Page S9131]]\n\nFrancisco area last year, but there is no new capacity. Environmental \nregulations make building a new powerplant in California impossible. \nThat may be what they want. But I wonder where they are going to get \nthe energy? Where are they going to get the electricity when nobody \nelse has any to spare?\n\n  I predict in a very precise way that home heating bills this coming \nwinter will be exorbitant, even while we are experiencing the gasoline \nspikes in the Midwest. It used to be one type of gasoline was suitable \nfor the entire country. You remember those days. There are now 62 \ndifferent products--one eastern pipeline handles 38 different grades of \ngasoline, 7 grades of kerosene, 16 grades of home heating oil and \ndiesel, 4 different gasoline mixtures are required between Chicago and \nSt. Louis, just a 300-mile distance.\n  As a result of these Federal and local requirements, industry has \nless flexibility to respond to local and regional shortages. There are \n15 sets of environmental regulations--tier II gasoline sulfur, \nCalifornia MTBE phaseout, blue-ribbon panel regulations, and regional \nhaze regulations--on-road diesel, off-road diesel, gasoline air toxics, \nrefinery MACK II, section 126 petitions, and there are 6 more.\n  S. 2962 includes a wide array of new gasoline requirements that are \nboth irrelevant and detrimental to tens of millions of American \nmotorists. Legislation mandates the use of ethanol in motor vehicles \nthat would cut revenues to the highway trust fund by $2 billion a year \nas one side effect. The U.S. Department of Energy has projected this \none bill would increase the consumption of ethanol in the Northeast \nfrom zero to approximately 565 million gallons annually.\n  I have taken a long time. I have given a lot of specifics and some \ngeneralities. But I conclude that it is not difficult to make a case \nthat we do not have an energy policy; that the U.S. Government has not \nbeen concerned enough about the future need for energy of our country, \nbe it in natural gas, in the products of crude oil, how do we use coal, \nhow do we make electricity.\n  Frankly, things were very good. They were good because the cartel was \nselling oil in abundance. While America was enjoying its economic \nsuccess story, a big part of that was because the cartel was having \ndifficulty controlling its own producers. We lived happy and merrily on \ncheap oil as our production went down and we sought no other \nalternatives, and our demand grew as did our use of natural gas. \nAmericans and American consumers are left where, in many cases, they \nare going to be put in a position where they can't afford the energy \nthat will permit them to live the natural lifestyle that is typically \nAmerican--living in a home and having in it electric appliances and \nwhatever else makes for a good life, with an automobile, or maybe two, \nin the driveway. It will not be long that the voices from those \nsituations, those events in America, those kinds of living conditions \nwill be heard loud and clear. There will not be enough of a Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve to solve their problems because we have not cared \nenough to do something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9131-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9131-S9132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SCIENCE AND SECURITY IN THE SERVICE OF THE NATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to make these remarks while \nthe occupant of the chair is the distinguished junior Senator from \nArizona because these remarks have to do with the Baker-Hamilton \nreport. The Secretary of Energy asked these two men--one an ex-Senator, \none an ex-House Member--to compile a report with reference to the \nnational weapons laboratories and the missing hard drive incident. \nThese hard drives were apparently taken out, put back, and found behind \na copy machine, and everybody is wondering what happened. I will talk \nabout this report.\n  I urge--and I do not think I have to--the occupant of the chair to \nread it soon. It is short and to the point.\n  The findings of this Baker-Hamilton report confirm what some of us \nsuspected and have said in one way or another many times about the \nscience and security at our National Laboratories.\n  The report concludes that the vast majority of employees of our \nNational Laboratories are ``dedicated, patriotic, conscientious \ncontributors to our national security and protectors of our national \nsecrets.''\n  The report states, however, that these individuals, the ones who are \nresponsible for the viability of America's nuclear deterrent, have been \nhounded by ongoing investigations and security procedures that render \nthem incapable of achieving their mission.\n  That is a very powerful statement. This commission is very worried \nabout how the morale of the scientists at our National Laboratories, in \nparticular Los Alamos, is affecting their ability to do their momentous \nwork.\n  They go on to say that while new security measures and processes \ncontinue to be imposed, the authors found that X Division--the one that \nwas involved in the last episode--is: ambiguously lodged in a confused \nhierarchy, subject to unclear and diffuse authority, undisciplined by a \nclear understanding of accountability for security matters, frightened \nor intimidated by the heightened sense of personal vulnerability \nresulting from the efforts to address recent security lapses.\n  These are hard-hitting, accurate findings.\n  The scientists at our laboratories need clear lines of authority and \naccountability. The Department of Energy needs to simplify the lines of \ncommand and communication.\n  The report overwhelmingly endorses the creation of the National \nNuclear Security Agency--which we are beginning to understand exists, \nand we are going to begin to understand what it means when we say the \nNNSA--and the need to reinforce ``the authority of the NNSA \nAdministrator.''\n  The NNSA Administrator must have more authority, not less. General \nJohn Gordon, the general who is in charge, is in fact the head man and \nis an excellent person to lead this agency and implement the \norganizational structure needed for the job.\n  They reached some other very important conclusions on the current \nenvironment at our national laboratories: Demoralization at Los Alamos \nis dangerous; that poor morale breeds poor security.\n  There is a severe morale problem at the labs, and they cite four or \nfive general conclusions:\n  ``Among the known consequences of the hard-drive incident, the most \nworrisome is the devastating effect on the morale and productivity at \nthe laboratory. . . .''\n  They also say that ``. . . (the) current negative climate is \nincompatible with the performance of good science.''\n  The report states, ``It is critical to reverse the demoralization at \nLANL before it further undermines the ability of that institution both \nto continue to make its vital contributions to our national security \nand to protect the sensitive national security information.''\n  They recommend ``urgent action (is required) . . . to ensure that \nLANL gets back to work in a reformed security structure . . .''\n  Incidentally, they conclude that while they laud the Secretary of \nEnergy for trying to create more security with the appointment of a \nsecurity czar and the like, as some of us said when it was created, it \nfails to do a job; and remember the Senator from New Mexico saying we \nare creating another box but it is not going to have clear lines of \nauthority, it is not going to have accountability, people are still not \ngoing to be in a streamlined process of accountability. I said it my \nway, they said it another way, but we concluded the same thing.\n  There are many other conclusions in this brief report. I urge all of \nmy colleagues to read this report and reflect on their conclusions.\n  They call for a review of security classifications and procedures, \nsecurity upgrades at LANL, need to deal with cyber security threats, \nand adopt or adapt ``best practices'' for the national labs.\n  Then, under ``Resources'' they underscore:\n\n       Provide adequate resources to support the mission of the \n     national laboratories to preserve our nuclear deterrent, \n     including the information security component of that mission.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S9132]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the reason I wanted to exchange places with \nyou for a moment was to commend you on the statement you just made from \nthe floor regarding our Nation's energy policy. Related to that, of \ncourse, is the work of the Department of Energy on other matters, \nincluding our nuclear facilities, on which you reported with respect to \nthe Baker-Hamilton report. I appreciate that report as well.\n  Back to the energy policy, I have not heard as good a statement of \nthe overall problem in this country as the Presiding Officer just \npresented: The fact that in each of the different components of the \nnational energy potential, we have developed policies or, in some \ncases, failed to develop policies, all of which combine to result in a \nlack of capacity to provide the fuels to create the energy which our \nsociety is going to continue to demand more and more.\n  When we put it all together, as the Presiding Officer did, it becomes \nvery clear that there is no integration of policy; that the Departments \nof Government that, in effect, have a veto over the development of \nthese resources prevail, so that there is no capacity to literally have \nan energy policy that produces the fuel with which we can produce the \nenergy.\n  An administration that had a policy would coordinate the activities \nof each of these Departments of Government--the EPA, the Interior \nDepartment, the Energy Department, and all of the others mentioned. But \nthat has not been done. Instead, each has been allowed, as the \nPresiding Officer pointed out, to develop their own policy for their \nown reasons. The net result is to diminish the capacity of the United \nStates to produce the fuel to produce the energy we need. I think his \nexplanation that we are likely to see an even higher price because of \nthe concentration now into one area--natural gas--is also something \nthat is bound to come true. But I doubt people are thinking that far \nahead at this moment.\n\n  The last thing I would like to say is about the comments in relation \nto ANWR. I would like to expand on that a little bit because I get so \nmany letters and calls from constituents of mine in Arizona who are \nvery concerned about the protection of our environment, as am I. They \nhave heard: If we were to allow exploration of oil in this area, it \nwould destroy the environment. I write back to them and say: Look, I \nhave been there. Now, granted not very many of our constituents can \nafford to go up north of the Arctic Circle a couple hundred miles. You \nhave to work to get there. You have to have some people who know what \nthey are doing to get you there and show you around.\n  But when you have been there, you realize that the exploration that \nwe have been talking about is in no way degrading of the environment. \nWhen you go there, the first thing you see is that in the other place \nwhere we have developed the oil potential--it is an area not much \nlarger than this Senate Chamber--they have been able to put all of the \nwells--I think there are 10 of them; two rows of 5, or that is roughly \nthe correct number--those wells go down about 10,000 feet, and then \nthey go out about 10,000 or 15,000 feet in all directions, so that, \nunlike the typical view that Americans have of oil wells scattered over \nthe environment, they are all concentrated in one little place, in an \nartificially built area out into the water.\n  So it does not degrade the coastal areas at all. It is all focused in \none place. It is totally environmentally contained. There is absolutely \nno pollution. There is no degradation of the environment. There is no \nimpact on animals. There is no environmental damage from this. The \npipeline is already there. It is undercapacity. So it is a perfect way \nto use our Nation's resource for the benefit of the American people.\n  When this wildlife refuge was created, an area was carved out for oil \nexploration. This was not supposed to be part of the wilderness. We \nflew over that area. As far as the eye can see for an hour, there is \nnothing but snow and ice--nothing. There are no trees. There are no \nanimals. There are no mountains. There is nothing but snow and ice.\n  You finally get to the little place where they would allow the \nexploration. There is a little Eskimo village there where you can land. \nYou go to the village, and the people say: When are you going to bring \nthe oil exploration for our village? Because they are the ones who \nwould benefit from it. It is not part of the wildlife refuge. When you \nsay: What is the environmental impact of this? They say there is none.\n  For almost all of the year, what you see is this snow and ice. For a \nlittle bit of the year--a few weeks in the summer--there is a little \nbit of moss and grass there where some caribou will come to graze and \ncalve. The reason the caribou herds have about quadrupled in size in \nthe area where the oil exploration has occurred is because there is \nsome habitation in that area. And, of course, the caribou are a lot \nlike cows; They like people just fine. They are willing to come right \nup to the area of habitation and have their little calves. But the \nwolves do not like people, so the wolves do not prey on them as much, \nand they don't eat as many of the calves. Therefore the herd is able to \ngrow.\n  So the only environmental impact anyone has figured out is we have \nhelped the caribou herds expand. This is an area where we can explore \nfor oil without doing any environmental damage. We need the resources, \nas the Presiding Officer pointed out.\n  I commend the Presiding Officer for his expertise in this area, for \nhis ability to put it all together in a very understandable way, and \nfor urging this administration to get on with the development of a true \nenergy policy.\n  Does the Senator from Idaho want to speak now?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Idaho, \nand I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Arizona in \nthanking you for your leadership in the work you have done on energy. I \nremember, several years ago, when the Senator from New Mexico was \ntalking about the state of play of the nuclear industry and that \nfailure to respond to an equitable process to bring about the \nappropriate handling of waste would ultimately curtail the ability of \nthis industry to grow and provide an environmentally sound and clean \nsource of electrical energy. That is when we were talking about energy \nwhen most of our supplies were in some margin of surplus. Today that \nsurplus does not exist.\n  In the past eight years, with no energy policy from the Clinton \nadministration, we are now without surplus. We are now entering what \ncould well be an energy crisis phase for our country and our economy. \nIf that is true--here we stand with the longest peacetime growth \neconomy in the history of our country--could this be the tripwire that \nbrings mighty America down? Because we have a President and a Vice \nPresident without an energy policy. In fact, under their \nadministration, we have seen a drop in the energy production of our \ntraditional kind. They even want to knock out big hydrodams out in the \nWest that are now supplying enough electricity for all of the city of \nSeattle, WA. And they say, in the name of the environment, we would \ntake these down. Shame on them.\n  Why aren't they leading us? Why aren't they providing, as they \nshould, under policy and direction, abundant production and reliable \nsources?\n  Historically, our economy has been built on that. America has been a \nbeneficiary of it.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9132-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9132-S9134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET PROCESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, what I thought I might do for a few moments \nthis afternoon is talk about the state of play of where we are as a \nSenate and as the 106th Congress trying to complete its work and \nadjourn for the year.\n  I think a good many of us are frustrated at this point. We have tried \nmightily to produce the appropriations bills, to work with our \ncolleagues, Democrat and Republican. Obviously,\n\n[[Page S9133]]\n\nthere are differences in how to resolve those differences. We are \nspending billions and billions of dollars more than we spent a year \nago. Yes, we have a surplus. But, yes, the American people are telling \nus government is as big as it ought to be. There are new national \npriorities, and we are attempting to address those.\n  But what I think needs to happen, and what has historically happened, \nat least, is an effort to move the 13 appropriations bills through the \nprocess, to vote them up or down, and get them to the President. We \ntried that last week, to move two of them together: the Legislative \nBranch appropriations bill and the Treasury-Postal bill. Out of \nfrustration on the floor, and our colleagues on the other side \ndeserting us, those bills failed.\n  I think the average public listening out there says: What's happening \nhere? Why are we almost at the end of the fiscal year and yet a fair \namount of the budgetary work needed to be accomplished in the form of \nappropriations bills to fund the Government for the coming year have \nnot been accomplished?\n  You saw Senator Bob Byrd lament on the floor of the Senate last week, \nabout the Senate working and getting the appropriations bills passed \nand sent to the President. And I have to lament with him. I agree that \nthis work should go on. He said: There are Senators in this body who \nhave never seen a situation work as it has been meant to work. I think \nhe was denoting the budget process itself and whether it worked and \nfunctioned on a timely basis. How well has the appropriations process \nworked?\n  I began to ask that question of my staff, and we did some research \nover the weekend. I thought it was important that I come to the floor \ntoday to talk a little bit about it because I, too, am concerned.\n  Since 1977, Congress has only twice--in 1994 and in 1988 --passed all \nof the 13 appropriations bills in time for the President to sign all \ninto law before the October 1 legal fiscal year deadline. Let me repeat \nthat. Only twice since 1977 has Congress passed all of the 13 \nappropriations bills in time for the President to sign all into law \nbefore the October 1st deadline.\n  Now, that either says something about the budget process and the \nappropriations process itself, or it says how very difficult this is in \na two-party system, and how difficult it is to make these substantive \ncompromises to fund the Government of our United States.\n  Most years, the Congress only gets a handful of appropriations bills \nthrough all the congressional hurdles by October 1, and so, more often \nthan not, has had to pass some, what we call, a stopgap funding bill \nbefore it adjourns for the year.\n  Senator Byrd, on Thursday, said that huge omnibus appropriations \nbills make a mockery of the legislative process. They certainly don't \nsubscribe to the budget process under the law that we have historically \nlaid out. But, then again, from 1977 until now only twice has that \nbudget process worked effectively.\n  So I could lament with Senator Byrd about huge omnibus bills or I \ncould simply say how difficult it really is. Yet bundling the funding \nbills has been more the exception than the rule in the last 23 years. \nIn other words, what we were attempting to do on the floor of the \nSenate last week was not abnormal. We were trying to expedite a process \nto complete our work and to do the necessary budget efforts. In fact, \nin 1986 and in 1987, Congress was unable to send even one funding bill \nto the President by the legal deadline of October 1. That is an \ninteresting statistic. Let me say it again. In 1986 and 1987, by the \nOctober first deadline, the President of the United States had not \nreceived one funding bill for Government from the Congress of the \nUnited States. In 1986, one of those years when Congress passed zero \nfunding conference reports, Senator Robert Dole was the majority leader \nof the Senate.\n\n  I am here today to say I agree with Senator Byrd, and I lament the \nfact that bundling is not a good idea. But in 1987, he took all 13 of \nthe appropriations bills, put them together, and sent them down to the \nPresident as one big bill. I think a little bit of history, maybe a \nlittle bit of perspective, adds to the value of understanding what the \nCongress tries to do. That was 1987. All 13 appropriation bills bundled \nand sent to the President before one separate bill was ever sent to the \nPresident.\n  The year 1986 was the first time since 1977. In 1987--I want to be \naccurate here--was the second time. In 1986 Republicans were in charge. \nThey couldn't get it done. And in 1987, when Senator Byrd was in \ncharge, they couldn't get it done. So here are 2 years, two examples, \none party, the other party, 1986 and 1987, that all 13 appropriation \nbills were bundled into one and sent down for the President's \nsignature.\n  Let's take a closer look at 1987. On October 1, the legal deadline, \nnot a single appropriation bill that passed the Congress had been \ntransmitted to the President. Compare this year, when two have already \nbeen signed. That is now, the year 2000, two have already been signed \nby the President, and we expect to send additional bills to the \nPresident before October 1. At least that is our goal. We will work \nmightily with the other side, whether we deal with them individually or \nput a couple of them together. In fact, no appropriation bill ever went \nto the President, I am told by our research, in 1987. Of the 10 funding \nbills both Houses of Congress passed, none emerged from the Democrat-\ncontrolled House and Senate conferees. It was a difficult year.\n  President Reagan was the first to sign an omnibus 13-bill long-term \ncontinuing funding bill on December 22 of 1987. Remember, the Congress \ncontinued to function late into the year and up until December 22, just \ndays before Christmas, so we could finally complete the work and get it \ndone. Of course, during those years I was not in the Senate. I was in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Now, all said, during that budget battle in 1987, we passed four \nshort-term CRs. During that time, we kept extending the deadlines \nnecessary and passed four short-term CRs to complete the work of the \nCongress. President Reagan did not even receive a bill until the \nmorning after the final short-term CR had expired. The CQ Almanac \ndescribed it as a 10-pound, 1-foot-high, mound of legislation. I \nremember that well. In fact, I was involved in a debate on the floor of \nthe House that year when I actually helped carry that bill to the \nfloor.\n  All 13 bills were passed and signed twice in 1994 and 1998. Excuse \nme, 1988; I said 1998. That is an important correction for the Record.\n  On October 1, the Senate had passed only four appropriation bills, \nand this was with a 55-45 majority. Compared to this year, as of \nSeptember 7, this body had passed nine bills so far.\n  I think it is important to compare. It is not an attempt to \ncriticize. Most importantly, it is an attempt to bring some kind of \nbalance and understanding to this debate.\n  I have been critical in the last several weeks. I have come to the \nfloor to quote minority leader Tom Daschle talking about ``dragging \ntheir feet and not getting the work done, expecting Republican Senators \nto cave.'' Well, certainly with those kinds of quotes in the national \nmedia and then watching the actions on the floor of this past week, you \nwould expect that maybe that is a part of the strategy.\n\n  On October 1, only seven bills had been reported to the Senate. This, \naccording to the 1987 CQ Almanac, is because the Appropriations \nCommittee could not even agree how to meet its subcommittee \nallocations. Compare that to this year. As of September 13, all 13 \nbills have been reported to the Senate.\n  Well, I think what is recognized here is that while bundling bills is \nnot a good idea--and I see the Senator from West Virginia has come to \nthe floor; he and I agree on that. He and I agree that bundling is not \na good process because it does not give Senators an opportunity to \ndebate the bills and to look at them individually and to understand \nthem.\n  At the same time, both sides are guilty. Certainly when Senator Byrd \nwas the majority leader of the United States Senate, that was a \npractice that had to be used at times when Republicans and Democrats \ncould not agree. That is a practice that we will have to look at again \nhere through this week and into next week as we try to complete our \nwork and try to deal with these kinds of issues.\n  You can argue that some of these bills did not get debated on the \nfloor of\n\n[[Page S9134]]\n\nthe Senate. That is true now; it was true in 1987. You can argue that \nthey didn't get an opportunity to have individual Senators work their \nwill on them by offering amendments. That is going to be true now; it \nwas clearly true in 1987.\n  The one thing that won't happen this year--I hope, at least--is that \n13-bill, 10-pound, 1-foot-high mound of legislation. Clearly, I don't \nthink it should happen, and I will make every effort not to let it \nhappen. That isn't the right way to legislate, and we should not \nattempt to do that.\n  The leadership, last year, in a bipartisan way, along with the White \nHouse, ultimately sat down and negotiated the end game as it related to \nthe budget. Many of our colleagues were very upset with that. They had \na right to be because they didn't have an opportunity to participate in \nthe process.\n  The reason I come to the floor this afternoon to talk briefly about \nthis is that, clearly, if we can gain the cooperation necessary and the \nunanimous consents that must be agreed to, that very limited amendments \nshould be applied to these appropriation bills, then we can work them \nthrough. I am certainly one who would be willing to work long hours to \nallow that to happen. But to bring one bill to the floor with 10 or 12 \nor 13 amendments with 60 percent of them political by nature, grabbing \nfor a 30-second television spot in the upcoming election really does \nnot make much sense this late in the game. We are just a few days from \nthe need to bring this Congress to a conclusion, to complete the work \nof the 106th Congress and, hopefully, to adjourn having balanced the \nbudget and having addressed some of the major and necessary needs of \nthe American people. It is important that we do that.\n  I am confident we can do that with full cooperation and the balance, \nthe give-and-take that is necessary in a bipartisan way to complete the \nwork at hand.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the pending question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The period for morning business has just \nexpired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9134-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9134-S9137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COOPERATION AMONG SENATORS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was sitting in my office when I heard the \nvery distinguished Senator from Idaho speaking on the floor and using \nmy name. He asked for cooperation, and, of course, we all want to \ncooperate. We want good will and we want cooperation. But one way to \nget cooperation from this Senator when his name is going to be used is \nto call this Senator before the Senator who wishes to call my name goes \nto the floor and let me know that I am going to be spoken of.\n  I have been in the Senate 42 years, and I have never yet spoken of \nanother Senator behind his back in any critical terms--never. I once \nhad a jousting match with former Senator Weicker. He called my name on \nthe floor a few times, and so I went to the floor and asked the \nCloakroom to get in touch with Senator Weicker and have him come to the \nfloor. I didn't want to speak about him otherwise, without his being on \nthe floor. Frankly, I don't appreciate it. I like to be on the floor \nwhere I can defend myself.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. First, let me apologize to you that a phone call was not \nmade. I meant it with all due respect. I did not misuse your name nor \nmisquote you. Certainly, speaking on the floor in the Senate in an \nopen, public forum is not speaking behind your back. That I do not do \nand I will not do.\n  Mr. BYRD. Whatever the Senator wants to call it, in my judgment, it \nis not fair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. OK.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will never call the Senator's name in public without his \nbeing on the floor. I like to go face to face with anything I have to \nsay about a Senator, and I would appreciate the same treatment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. You know how much I respect you, Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope so.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In no way do I intend to speak behind your back. It is an \nimportant issue that you and I are concerned about.\n  I think it was important to demonstrate what the real record of \nperformance here is in the Senate under both Democrat and Republican \nleadership--how difficult it is to bring about the final processes of \nthe appropriations. You and I would probably agree that maybe we need \nto look at the process because it hasn't worked very well. We have not \nbeen able to complete our work in a timely fashion, and it does take \nbipartisan cooperation.\n  I have been frustrated in the last couple of weeks by quotes such as \nthe one on this chart, which would suggest if the other side does \nabsolutely nothing, somehow we would cave. Last week appeared--I know \nyou had a different argument, and I agreed with you--not to debate an \nappropriations bill on the floor separate from another. That is not \ngood for the process, not good for the legitimacy of getting our work \ndone. But it did seem to purport and confirm the quote on this chart.\n\n  Again, if I have in some way wronged you, I apologize openly before \nthe Senate. But you and I both know that that which we say on the \nrecord is public domain. But I did not offer you the courtesy of \ncalling you, and for that I apologize.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is for the public domain, no question about that. But if \nmy name is going to be used by any Senator, I would like to know in \nadvance so that I may be on the floor to hear what he says about me so \nI may have the opportunity to respond when whatever is being said is \nsaid. That is the way I treat all other Senators; that is the only way \nI know to treat them.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is most appropriate.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is the way I will always treat Senators. I will never \nspeak ill of the Senator, never criticize the Senator, unless he is on \nthe floor. I would like to be treated the same way.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield one last time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have made statistical statements. When I prepared this \ntoday, I double-checked them, to make sure I was accurate, with the \nCongressional Quarterly Almanac so the Record would be replete. If I am \nnot accurate, or if I have misspoken in some of these statements, \nagain, I stand to be corrected. I was simply comparing the years of \n1986, a Republican-controlled Senate, and 1987, a Democrat-controlled \nSenate, when you were the majority leader--recognizing that in both of \nthose years major budget battles ensued and we bundled tremendously in \nthose years individual appropriations bills--in fact, in a considerably \nworse way than we are actually doing this year. I thought that was a \nreasonable thing to discuss on the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am not sure that is accurate.\n  Mr. CRAIG. You can check it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we speak of another Senator in the \nsecond person?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator should \naddress the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. And speak to another Senator in the second person.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And not refer directly to another Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Exactly. I think that rule keeps down acerbities and ill \nwill. I want to retain good will. So when I refer to the distinguished \nSenator, I don't want to point the finger at him by saying ``you.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I am not sure the Senator is entirely accurate in \neverything he has said. I didn't hear everything he said, but I have \nthe impression that what he was saying was that we bundled bills \ntogether in times when I was majority leader, and so on.\n  I am not sure that is even accurate. But let me say to the \ndistinguished Senator that I haven't complained about bundling bills \ntogether. That is not my complaint at all. My complaint is in avoiding \ndebate in the Senate and sending appropriation bills directly to \nconference. That is my problem because that avoids the open debate in \nthe Senate, and Senators are deprived of the opportunity, thereby, to \noffer amendments.\n\n[[Page S9135]]\n\n  I don't mind bundling bills together in conference if they have \npassed the Senate. But if they haven't passed the Senate, I am very \ncritical of sending those bills to the conference. I think the framers \ncontemplated both Houses acting upon bills--and that is the way we have \ndone it heretofore until the last few years; appropriation bills have \npassed the Senate; they have been amended and debated before they went \nto conference. That is my complaint.\n  So I hope the Senator will not feel that I have been complaining \nabout bills being joined in conference. I am not complaining about \nthat.\n  According to the CRS, all regular appropriation bills were approved \nby or on October 1 in 1977--the first year I became majority leader--in \n1989, in 1995, and in 1997. So I have the record before me that shows \nthat four times in those years--that is not a great record, but four \ntimes in those years all of the regular appropriations bills were \napproved by or on October 1.\n  The distinguished Senator, if I understood him correctly, said only \ntwice. Am I correct that only twice had all appropriations bills been \napproved on or before October 1?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I may have misheard the Senator. Yes. I yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. What I quoted was the Congressional Almanac--the CQ \nAlmanac--that said since 1977 only twice, in 1994 and in 1998, has the \nCongress passed all 13 appropriations bills in time for the President \nto sign them into law before the October 1 deadline.\n  Mr. BYRD. Therein lies the tale. The Senator uses the phrase ``in \ntime for the President to sign them into law.''\n  Mr. CRAIG. By October 1.\n  Mr. BYRD. By October 1. The Record shows that in 4 years, all of the \nregular appropriations bills were approved by or on October 1.\n  I can remember in 1977, I believe it was, that all of the \nappropriations bills were passed but the last one, which passed the \nSenate by just a few seconds before the hour of midnight at the close \nof the fiscal year. Obviously, it would not have been in time for the \nPresident to have signed the bill by the next day. But all bills did \npass the Senate even though the last of the appropriations bills only \nmade it by a few seconds or a few minutes. And in 1987, more than 100 \namendments were offered, debated, and disposed of in the consideration \nof the continuing resolution. We took up amendments, we debated them, \nand disposed of them.\n  That is what I am complaining about. I will have more to say about \nthis in a few days. But I am complaining about the fact that \nappropriations bills are brought to the Senate floor, and in many \ninstances Senators don't have the opportunity to offer amendments and \nhave them debated. They don't have the opportunity to debate the bills \nfully.\n  Secondly, I am complaining about sending appropriations bills \ndirectly to conference without the Senate's having an opportunity to \ndebate those appropriations bills and to amend them prior to their \ngoing to conference. That short-circuits the legislative process. We \nrepresent the people who send us here. This is the only forum of the \nStates. I represent a State, the distinguished Senator from Idaho \nrepresents a State, and represents it well. But it doesn't make any \ndifference about the size of the State. Each State is equal in this \nbody--meaning that small, rural States like West Virginia are equal to \nthe large States of New York, California, Texas, and so on.\n  But when the Senate is deprived of the opportunity to debate and to \namend by virtue of appropriations bills being sent directly to \nconference, this means the people of my State, the people of the small \nStates, the people of the rural States--the people of every State, as a \nmatter of fact, represented in the Senate--are deprived of the \nopportunity to debate and are deprived of the opportunity to offer \namendments through their Senators.\n  This is what I am complaining about. I have tried to avoid \npersonalities. I could do that. I don't like to do that. I am just \nstating a fact that we are being deprived, the Senator from Idaho is \nbeing deprived of debating and offering amendments. His people are \nbeing deprived. That is the important thing--his constituents are being \ndeprived. I think we ought to quit that. I think we ought to stop it.\n  I hope the distinguished Senator will stand with me in opposition to \nwhat I call the emasculation of the appropriations process when that is \ndone.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The State of West Virginia and my State of Idaho are very \nsimilar. Both are small, rural States. Both the Senator from West \nVirginia and I are very proud of the fact that we have equal power in \nthe Senate. Our Founding Fathers assured that. That is what created \nthis marvelous balance. Both the Senator from West Virginia and the \nSenator from Idaho serve on the Appropriations Committee. Obviously, \nthe Senator from West Virginia has tremendous seniority and is former \nchairman of that committee. I am still pretty much a freshman. We \nappreciate that debate process. There is no question about it.\n  At the same time, I am one of those Senators who, before the August \nrecess, turned to my majority leader and said something he didn't want \nto hear. I said: You know, I am going to start researching the need for \na lame duck session because we are not going to get our work done. We \nhave not been allowed to move bills to the floor without 100 amendments \nor 50 amendments. The Senator from West Virginia can certainly \ncharacterize those amendments the way he wants. I will characterize \nthem by saying at least 50 percent of them are political. They come \nfrom both sides.\n  I cannot say that the other side is any more guilty than we are for \nmaking a public political statement on an amendment that never passes. \nWe are all frustrated by that. But when you subject a bill to full \ndebate on the floor without being able to get a unanimous consent \nagreement to govern the time, then we could go on for days and \nsometimes an entire week on the floor on a single bill.\n  Is that necessary?\n  Mr. BYRD. May I regain the floor for just a moment?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is the Senator's time.\n  Mr. BYRD. We have had those experiences. That is not an unheard of \nexperience.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is part of the process.\n  When I was majority leader of the Senate in 1977, 1978, 1979, and \n1980 and, again, when I was majority leader of the Senate in 1987 and \n1988, not once did I attempt to say to the leader on the other side of \nthe aisle that I will not take this bill up if you are going to call up \namendments, or if you call up 5 or 10 or whatever it is, I will not \ncall it up; or having called it up, if Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle persisted in calling up amendments, I didn't take the bill \ndown. That is part of the process.\n  That is where we differ. There are now Senators in this body who \nthink that that is the way the Senate has always been. I would say to \nSenator Baker, or to Senator Dole, let's have our respective Cloakrooms \nfind out how many amendments there are. And the Cloakrooms would call \nSenators. They would bring back a list of the Senators on the \nRepublican side and a list of the Senators on the Democratic side who \nindicated they had amendments. I never said: Well, we ought to cut them \ndown. I said: Let's list them.\n  Sometimes there would be 65 amendments, sometimes 80, or whatever. I \nwould say: Let's get unanimous consent that the amendments be limited \nto those on the list. I never attempted to keep Senators from calling \nup their amendments, or to insist the leader of the other side cut down \nhis amendments before we would call up the bill. We listed the \namendments. Then we sought to get unanimous consent. Usually we could \nbecause we worked well together. Once we had the finite list of \namendments and got unanimous consent that that would be all of the \namendments, we began to then work with each individual Senator--Mr. \nDole and Mr. Baker, through their staff on that side, and myself on my \nside. Our staff attempted to get time limitations on those amendments. \nMany of the amendments just went away. Senators would do as I have done \non several occasions: I had my name put on the list just for a \n``germane'' amendment and just for self-protection. So that is the way \nit is. Many times, amendments fall off.\n\n  I have to say that this new way of doing things here is not the way \nthe\n\n[[Page S9136]]\n\nSenate has always done it. There are 59 Senators today in this body--I \nbelieve I am correct--there are 59 Senators out of 100 Senators who \nnever served in the Senate prior to my giving up the leadership at the \nend of 1988.\n  Rules VII and VIII--there are two rules I just happened to think of \nthat have never been utilized since I was majority leader. Never. And \nthere are other rules that have never been utilized since I was \nmajority leader. Fifty-nine Senators have come into the Senate not \nhaving seen the Senate operate as it did when Mr. Mansfield was here, \nwhen Lyndon Johnson was here, and when I was leader. What they see is a \nnew way of operating in the Senate.\n  Many of those Senators--I believe 48 of the Senators--here I am \nspeaking from memory; I may have missed one or two--have come over from \nthe other body. I am one of them. But there are 48, maybe 47 or 52, or \nthereabouts, of today's Senators who have come over to the Senate from \nthe House. They have never seen the Senate operate under its rules, \nreally, unless we call operating by unanimous consent operating by the \nrules--which would be accurate to say, up to a point. But 48 Senators \nhave come over from the House and many of those Senators would like to \nmake the Senate another House of Representatives. The Senate was not \nsupposed to be an adjunct to the House.\n  I have been in the other House. I have long studied the rules and the \nprecedents and worked in the leadership in one capacity or another in \nthis Senate. I served in the Democratic leadership 22 years here, as \nwhip, as secretary of the conference, as majority leader, as minority \nleader, as majority leader again.\n  I grieve over what is happening to the Senate. I say we need to get \nback to the old way of doing things because we are short circuiting the \nprocess. In so doing, we are depriving the people of the States of the \nrepresentation that they are entitled to in this Senate. By that I mean \nthat the people's Senators are not allowed to call up amendments, they \nare not allowed to debate at times. This way of operating would \ncertainly, I think, bring sadness to the hearts of the framers because \nthey intended for this Senate to be a check on the other body. They \nalso intended for this Senate to be a check against an overreaching \nexecutive. But if Senators can't call up bills from the other body and \ndebate them and amend them, then the Senate cannot adequately check the \nother body against the passions that may temporarily sweep over the \ncountry. The Senate cannot bring stability to the body politic and to \nthe government that the framers intended.\n  I am happy to yield again.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield for one last question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I made this comment, and the Senator made a corresponding \ncomment that appears to suggest that my comment is in conflict with his \nand they may not be. I want to correct this for the record.\n  The Congressional Quarterly Almanac says that only seven \nappropriations bills had passed the Senate on October 1 of 1987. But we \ndid not provide for the President an omnibus bill with 13 in it until \nDecember 22, 1987.\n  I am not suggesting by this statement that the Senate didn't go on to \ndebate those individual bills on the floor between October 1 and \nDecember 22; I didn't draw that conclusion.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. May I comment?\n  The Senator is only telling half the story.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am only quoting the Almanac.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, my memory, which is not infallible, reminds me that \nthe President of the United States asked for an omnibus bill that year. \nHe didn't want separate bills. Mr. Reagan didn't want separate bills \nthat year. He wanted an omnibus bill. I hope I am not mistaken in the \nyear that we are discussing.\n  But does the Senator not recall one year in which Mr. Reagan did not \nwant--he wanted one bill because we were entering into some kind of an \nagreement amongst us; he wanted one bill to sign rather than several. \nSo we accommodated him.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I don't recall what President Reagan did or did not want. \nI know what the record shows he got.\n  I guess the question I ask the Senator from West Virginia, from \nOctober 1 to until December 22, did the Senate debate and pass out the \nremainder of the appropriations bills that had not been completed by \nOctober 1, which would have been a total of six, I believe, if the \nCongressional Quarterly Almanac is correct, and we only worked up seven \nprior to the deadline?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am looking at the chart, ``Final Status of Appropriation \nMeasures, First Session, 100th Congress.'' That would have been 1987. \nEvery bill was reported. I think I am getting now to the question that \nthe Senator asked.\n  Some of the bills were reported but not taken up, but floor action \nshows that the Senate continued to act upon appropriations bills: \nTreasury-Postal Service was acted upon on the floor September 25; \nTransportation, October 29; military construction, October 27; \nlegislative, September 30; Labor-HHS-Education, October 14; Interior, \nSeptember 30; energy and water, November 18; Commerce-Justice, October \n15.\n  So they were all acted on. And, yes, the answer is, the Senate \ncontinued to act upon those bills even through the latter months of the \nyear.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Those records comport with what I have said. I wanted to \nmake sure I was not inaccurate. My concern is that we will have not \ncompleted our work on the floor by the deadline unless we can gain the \nkind of cooperative effort to move these pieces of legislation.\n  And by your observation, I was accurate in the sense that five were \ndebated and passed or voted on after the October deadline of 1987.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me respond to that. The Senator] speaks \nof cooperation from the other side. I note that 1, 2, 3, 5, 6--9 of \nthese appropriations bills--10, 11--11 of them were reported from the \nSenate Appropriations Committee this year no later than July 21, \nreported and placed on the calendar--11 of them.\n  Why weren't they called up in the Senate? The Appropriations \nCommittee, on which the distinguished Senator from Idaho and I sit, the \nAppropriations Committee, under the excellent leadership of Senator Ted \nStevens, reported those bills out; 11 of them, I believe--no later \nthan--what date was that? No later than the 21st of July. Why weren't \nthey called up? We had plenty of time. Why weren't they called up?\n  May I say, in addition to that, the Senate certainly had the time to \nact on those bills. We were out of session on too many Fridays. We come \nin here on Monday, many Mondays, and we do not cast a vote, or we cast \na vote at 5 o'clock, or we go out on Fridays, we don't have any session \nat all, or we go out by noon with perhaps one vote having been taken.\n  The Senator and I could talk until we are each blue in the face, but \nit seems to me that someone needs to explain in a reasonable way as to \nwhy we don't act on Mondays and Fridays, act as we ought to as a \nlegislative body--be in session. We are getting paid for the work. Why \ndon't we act on these appropriations bills?\n  When I was majority leader, I stood before my caucus in 207. I can \nremember saying it: ``We are not here to improve the quality of life \nfor us Senators. Our constituents send us here to improve the quality \nof life for our constituents. I am interested in the quality of work.''\n  My own colleagues were doing some complaining. I said: We are going \nto be here, we are going to vote early on Mondays, and we are going to \nvote late on Fridays. You elected me leader. As long as you leave me in \nas leader, I am going to lead.\n  Now, I said, we will take 1 week off every 4 weeks, and we can go \nhome and talk to our constituents, see about their needs. So we will \nhave 1 week off and 3 weeks in, but the 3 weeks that we are in, we are \ngoing to work early and we are going to work late. And we did that in \nthe 100th Congress.\n  If one looks over the records of the 100th Congress, one will find \nthat Congress was one of the best Congresses, certainly, that I have \nseen in my time here in Washington. The productivity was good, we \nworked hard, there was good cooperation between Republicans\n\n[[Page S9137]]\n\nand Democrats. We all worked, and appropriations bills didn't suffer. \nAppropriations bills were never sent to conference without prior action \nby this body. Every Senator in this body on both sides of the aisle was \nallowed to call up his amendment, to offer amendments, as many as he \nwanted to. Nobody was shut off. We just simply took the time. We stayed \nhere and did the work.\n  Nobody can say to me, well, we don't have the time to do these bills. \nMr. President, we have squandered the time. We have squandered the time \nalready. I used to have bed check votes on Monday mornings at 10 \no'clock, bed check votes so that the Senators would be here at 10 \no'clock. It didn't go over well with some of the Senators, even on my \nside. But one leads or he doesn't lead. When one leads, he sometimes \nruns into opposition from his own side of the aisle. I was not unused \nto that. But nobody can stand here and tell me that we have fully \nutilized our time and that we have to avoid bringing bills up in the \nSenate because Senators will offer amendments to them. I am ready to \ndebate that anytime.\n\n  I thank the distinguished Senator. I will yield again if he wishes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have one last question because you have got your ledger \nthere, which is very valuable, making sure that statements are \naccurate, because I focused on 1987, the year of your majority \nleadership.\n  We talked about the bills. I think we confirmed one thing. The \nCongressional Quarterly Almanac also goes on to say that foreign ops, \nAgriculture, and Defense were never voted on on the floor and never \ndebated, that they were incorporated in the omnibus bill. So, in fact, \nthe practice you and I are frustrated by was incorporated that year \ninto that large 13-bill omnibus process; is that accurate?\n  Mr. BYRD. This is accurate. During Senate consideration of the \ncontinuing resolution for fiscal year 1987, which contained full year \nfunding for all 13 appropriations bills, more than 100 amendments were \noffered, debated, and disposed of.\n  Mr. CRAIG. But my question is: The individual foreign ops, \nAgriculture, and Defense bills were in fact not individually debated on \nthe floor and amended?\n  Mr. BYRD. They were in the CR and therefore subject to amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I see. But not individually brought to the floor? I \nunderstand what you are saying. I am not disputing what you are saying \nabout incorporating them into a CR.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator--my distinguished friend from Idaho--misses the \npoint. There may be CRs this year. There have been CRs before.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have never denied that. The point is that the CRs were \ncalled up on the floor, they were debated, and they were amended \nfreely. That is what I am talking about. The Senate had the opportunity \nto work its will even if those bills, two or three, were included in \nthe CR. That is the point. The Senate was able to work its will on the \nCR and to offer amendments and debate and have votes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, that is not the point.\n  If the Senator will yield, we are not in disagreement. We are not yet \nto the CR point. If we get there, I have not yet heard any leader on \neither side suggest that we not amend it. We hope they could be clean. \nWe hope they could go to the President clean, without amendments.\n  But if we are going to incorporate in them entire appropriations \nbills that have not yet been debated--and that was my point here with \nbringing that up; they were in CRs but they were not brought to the \nfloor individually and debated. There was an opportunity--you are not \nsuggesting, you are saying--and it is true--that there was an \nopportunity at some point in the process for them to be amended.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes. We are not in disagreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Except this: The Senator says we hope they can go to the \nPresident clean. I don't hope that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Oh.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, indeed. Never have I hoped that. I would like to have \nseen a time when Senators didn't want to call up amendments. Maybe I \ncould have gone home earlier. But I have never thought that was a \npossibility. And I wouldn't hope they would go to the President clean \nbecause I think Senators ought to have the opportunity to clean up the \nbills, to improve them. Surely they are not perfect when they come over \nfrom the other body, and Senators ought to be at liberty to call up \namendments and improve that legislation. That is the legislative \nprocess. Let's improve it.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for yielding. You see, we do agree on \nsome things but we also disagree on others. There we have a point of \ndisagreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator ought not disagree with me on saying that \nSenators ought to have an opportunity to call up amendments and that we \ndon't necessarily wish to see clean bills sent to the President. I \ndidn't want to see a clean trade bill sent to the President.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield just one last time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If we are attempting to complete our work on a bill-by-\nbill basis and we extend our time to do that with a clean CR, simply \nextending the processes of Government and the financing of Government \nfor another week or two while we debate individual bills--that is what \nI am suggesting.\n  If we are going to incorporate other bills, appropriations bills, in \nthe CR, I am not objecting to amendments. I am saying that if we are \ngoing to deal with them individually on the floor, as you and I would \nwish we could and should, then the CR that extends us the time to do \nso, in my opinion, should be clean in going to the President so he will \nnot argue or attempt to veto something because we would stick an \namendment on it with which he might disagree.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think we are ships going past one another in the dark, \nthe Senator and I, on this. I am for having full debate, having \nSenators offer their amendments. Whether or not bills sent to the \nPresident are clean, to me, I think, is not a matter of great import. I \nthink the framers contemplated that each House, the House in the \nbeginning on revenue bills and then the Senate on revenue bills by \namendment and the House and Senate on other bills, sometimes one House \nwould go first, sometimes the other House would go first except on \nrevenue bills, by practice, appropriations bills.\n  To me, in the legislative process, the people are getting their just \nrights, the people are getting what they are entitled to, and the \nRepublic will flourish and the liberties of the people will endure if \nSenators have an opportunity to debate fully--disagree, agree, offer \namendments, have them tabled, have them voted up or down. This Republic \nwill be in a much safer position and in a much better condition if the \nSenate is allowed to be what the Senate was intended to be by the \nframers.\n  I hope the Senator will join with me in protecting this Senate and in \ndoing so will protect the liberties of the people. Protect the Senate. \nForget about party once in a while. George Washington warned us against \nfactions and about parties. I have never been such a great party man \nmyself, and the Senator will not find me criticizing the ``other side'' \nvery often, or the ``Republicans'' very often. I can do that and have \nbeen known to do it, but there are other things more important, and the \nSenate is one of the other things that is more important. We are \ntalking about the Senate. We are talking about the cornerstone of the \nRepublic. As long as we have freedom to debate in the Senate and \nfreedom to amend, the people's liberties will be secured. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9137-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL ENERGY SECURITY ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was listening to the discussion among my \ncolleagues, Senator Craig, Senator Byrd, and Senator Daschle was here \nearlier. I thought it would be useful to discuss the concept that has \nbeen discussed. In the end, it does not matter\n\n[[Page S9138]]\n\nwhat is said one way or the other about who is at fault for this or for \ndelaying that. The question people ask at the end of a legislative \nsession is, Are things a little better in this country because those \nfolks met and discussed things in the United States, what works, what \ndoes not, what we can do and cannot do?\n  If the answer to that is yes, none of this matters much. But the \nSenator from West Virginia, in responding to some discussions earlier \nby the Senator from Idaho, makes a very interesting point. I have not \nbeen here nearly as long as the Senator from West Virginia has been.\n  This is a calendar which shows this year, the year 2000. The red days \non this calendar are the days the Senate was not in session. We will \nsee the Senate was not in session a fair part of the year. In fact, \nanother chart will show the number of days we have been in session. It \nis now the end of September, and we have been in session 115 days out \nof all of this year. Of those 115 days we were in session, on 34 of \nthem, there were no votes at all. So we have been in session 115 days, \nbut on 34 of those days, there have been no votes.\n  There have been only two Mondays in this entire year in which the \nSenate has voted, and if I may continue with this chart presentation, \nthere have been only six Fridays in all of this year on which the \nSenate has voted. Out of 13 appropriations bills, only two have been \nsigned into law by the President. In the month of September, when we \nmust try to finish the remaining 11 appropriations bills, we have not \nhad any votes on Mondays, except for possibly today if we have a vote \nlater today. And there have been no votes on Fridays in the month of \nSeptember.\n  I thought it would be useful to describe what is going on here. Let \nme read this statement from my friend and colleague, the Senate \nmajority leader, earlier in the year. He said:\n\n       We were out of town two months and our approval rating went \n     up 11 points. I think I've got this thing figured out.\n\n  I know Senator Lott wants this place to work and work well. I \nmentioned the other day to Senator Lott that there is a television \ncommercial about these grizzled, leather-faced cowboys on horseback \nherding cats. It is actually a funny commercial because they even get \nthose cats in a river and try to move them across the river. These big \ncowboys with these leather coats, the big dusters they wear for storms, \nare holding these little stray cats.\n  I said to the Senate majority leader: That reminds me a little \nperhaps of the job you and others have of keeping things moving around \nhere.\n  The Senator from West Virginia makes a very important point, and I \nwant to outline it. We have had plenty of time to get to work to pass \nthis legislation. We just have not been in session in the Senate much \nof the year. Frankly, most people run for the privilege of serving in \nthe Senate because they have an agenda, too, and they want to offer \namendments. They want to offer ideas that come from their \nconstituencies that say: Here is what we think should be done to \nimprove life in this country; here is what we think should be done to \ndeal with education, health care, crime, and a whole range of issues.\n  When there are circumstances like we have seen this year where \nlegislation does not even, in some cases, come to the floor of the \nSenate, but instead goes right to conference, it says to Senators: You \nhave no right to offer any amendments. That does not make sense.\n  The reason I came over, I say to the Senator from West Virginia, is \nthat I heard the discussion by my colleague from Idaho saying Senator \nDaschle is to blame for all of this. Nonsense. Winston Churchill used \nto say the greatest thrill in the world is to be shot at and missed. \nThe Senator from Idaho has just given all of us a thrill. But Senator \nDaschle is at fault?\n  Senator Daschle does not schedule this Senate. We are not in charge. \nI wish we were, but we are not in charge. We are the minority party, \nnot the majority party. I hope that will change very soon.\n  What Senator Daschle said is clear. In fact, he said it again last \nweek: If I had been majority leader, and I am not, today would be a day \nin which we take up an appropriations bill and we would be in session \nuntil we finish that bill and everybody has a chance to offer \namendments. If it takes 24 hours, then we will not get a lot of sleep, \nbut we will finish that bill.\n  Senator Daschle said: My preference is to take these bills up \nindividually. I would be willing to do an appropriations bill a day--\nlong days, sure; tough days, absolutely. But he said let's do them. \nBring them to the floor. Open them up for amendment. Let's have \ndebates, offer amendments, and then let's vote. Democracy, after all, \nis about voting. It is not always convenient.\n  The Senator from West Virginia had a reputation for not always making \nit very convenient for people because he has insisted that \nappropriations bills be brought to the Senate floor and that they be \ndebated fully and that everybody have the opportunity to bring their \namendments to the floor of the Senate, have a debate, and then have a \nvote.\n  Again, sometimes that is difficult. People want to be here and there \nand everywhere else on Fridays and Mondays and parts of the week. But \nthe fact is, we are now in September, towards the end of the month, and \n11 of the 13 appropriations bills are not yet signed. I am a conferee \non at least two of them for which no conference has been held.\n  I might mention to the Senator from West Virginia, I think perhaps \nyou were referring earlier to the Agriculture appropriations bill. The \nHouse passed it July 11. The Senate passed it July 20. I am a conferee. \nThere has been no conference. The House has not even appointed its \nconferees. In today's edition of the CQ Daily Monitor, one of my \ncolleagues is quoted as saying that ``aides'' have worked out a \ncompromise in the Agriculture spending conference report, and it will \ncome to the floor on Wednesday.\n  Now, that is a surprise to those of us who are supposed to be \nconferees. This is a bill on which there has been no conference, and \nsomeone in the majority party is saying aides have worked this all out, \nand it is going to come to the floor of the Senate on Wednesday. Boy, I \ntell you, this system is flat out broken. That is not the way this \nsystem ought to work. Aides do the work without a conference?\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is precisely correct. The system is not \noperating as it was intended to operate. We are improvising it as we go \nalong. We are changing it all the time. The Senate is changing. And I \nregret to say that.\n  I simply want to thank the Senator for using the charts. They are \nvery persuasive. They tell the story. They tell it concisely.\n  I also thank the Senator for standing up for the Senate and the true \nsystem. The Appropriations Committee was created in 1867. So for 133 \nyears we have had this system. The Appropriations Committee was very \nsmall in the beginning. I think it was made up of only five members.\n  The system is being changed by Senators who have come here, most of \nthem, from the other body. They don't know how the Senate is supposed \nto work. They never saw it operate under the rules. It is being run \nmostly by unanimous consent now, not by the rules. For example, we \nnever have calendar Mondays here anymore. We ought to try that just \nonce in a while to keep the system--the real system--alive.\n  I thank the Senator for his timely comments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from West \nVirginia as well. It should never, ever be considered old-fashioned to \nhave the Senate work in a manner in which it was intended to work; that \nis, to have debates and to have votes. That is not old-fashioned. That \nis a timeless truth about how democracy ought to work.\n  A timeless truth here is that we will get the best for the American \npeople by soliciting all of the best ideas that come from every corner \nof this Chamber. Those ideas come from every corner of our country. \nPeople come here not for their own sake; they come to represent the \npeople of West Virginia and Maine and California and my State of North \nDakota. The development of all of those ideas--through debate, through \nthe offering of amendments, and so on--represents what I think can \ncontribute best to America's well-being.\n\n[[Page S9139]]\n\n  There are so many things that I wanted to do this year that we are \nnot doing. There is so little time left. We have a farm program that \ndoes not work. Families out on the land--family farmers are the best in \nAmerica--are just struggling mightily. The farm program does not work. \nIt ought to be repealed and replaced with one that does. That is not \nrocket science. Europe does it. We can do it.\n  A Patients' Bill of Rights: We debated that forever. We ought to pass \nthat. A prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program: We know we \nshould do that and do it soon. Fixing the education system: Again, we \nknow what needs to be done there. There is a whole series of things we \nought to be doing that have not been done this year, let alone most of \nthe appropriations bills, which we should pass.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am constrained to say, as I have said \nbefore, that the fault is not all on one side. And I have complained \nabout this to my own caucus. Too many times, on this side of the aisle, \nwe have called up the same old amendment over and over and over again. \nI have said this in my own caucus, and I have said this before to my \ncolleagues. So we are at fault to an extent in that regard. That is not \nto say a Senator does not have the right to call up an amendment. He \nhas the right to call up his amendment as many times as he wishes. But \nI see no point in beating a dead horse over and over and over. That is \nsomething I think we, on our own side, should talk about and try to \navoid.\n  Now, there are occasions when, for one reason or another, perhaps a \nSenator is absent or a supporter of a given amendment may be away for a \nfuneral or something else, and the amendment may be called up, and it \nloses. Then I think there is real justification for calling up that \namendment again on a future date.\n  But there are times here when it seems to me my own side is only \ninterested in sending a ``message.'' We want to send ``messages.'' This \nis alright up to a point. I have kind of grown tired of just sending \n``messages.''\n  For example, nobody has supported campaign financing longer than I \nhave in this Senate. As a matter of fact, I offered a campaign \nfinancing bill with former Senator David Boren in this Senate in the \n100th Congress. Now, I offered cloture on that bill eight times. No \nother majority leader has ever offered cloture on the same bill eight \ntimes. But I was disappointed eight times because only four or five \nMembers of the Republican Party ever joined the Democrats in supporting \nthat campaign financing bill. So we tried and we tried again.\n  I think we send too many ``messages'' on this side of the aisle. I \ncan understand the majority leader, in trying to avoid this repetition \nof having to vote on the same old amendment--and they are political \namendments--has attempted to bypass the Senate by not calling up bills.\n  Many authorization bills--if one will take a look at this calendar, \nlook at the bills on this calendar. If the Senator will look at the \nbills on this calendar, we have a calendar that is 71 pages in length. \nSome of those probably are authorization bills. They are not called up. \nSo, Senators all too often only have appropriations bills to use as \nvehicles for amendments which they otherwise would call up if the \nauthorization bills were on the calendar and were called up.\n  The authorizing committees need to do their work. They need to get \nthe bills out on the calendars. And then, when the bills are on the \ncalendar, if they are not called up, Senators are going to resort to \ncalling up amendments on appropriations bills. So there is enough fault \nand enough blame here to go around.\n  But I think the greatest danger of all is for the Senate to be \nrelegated to a position in which it cannot be effective in carrying out \nthe intentions of the framers. And that can best be done by not calling \nup appropriations bills, sending them directly to conference, and \npreventing Senators from carrying out the wishes of their constituents, \nby not allowing Senators to debate and call up amendments.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator. He has taken the floor on several \noccasions to mention this and to call our attention to it. I thank him.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from West Virginia will \nrecall that he told me a story some long while ago about this desk that \nI occupy in the Senate. This desk, as do all of these desks, has an \ninteresting history. This desk was the desk of former Senator Robert La \nFollette from Wisconsin. It was Senator Byrd who informed me of \nsomething that happened 91 years ago, I believe, in late May in the \nyear 1909.\n  Senator La Follette was standing at this desk--this desk may not have \nbeen in this exact spot, but it was this desk--involved in a \nfilibuster.\n  During those days, this Senate had a lot of aggressive, robust \ndebates. Senator La Follette was a very forceful man with strong \nfeelings, and he stood at this desk engaged in a filibuster. As the \nstory goes, apparently someone sent up a glass of eggnog for him to sip \non during the filibuster. He brought that glass of eggnog to his lips \nand drank then spat and began to scream that he had been poisoned. He \nthought he had tasted poison in this glass of eggnog. The glass was \nsent away--I believe this was in 1909--to have it evaluated. They \ndiscovered someone had, in fact, put poison in his drink. They never \nfound the culprit.\n  I think of stories such as this one about this Chamber, what a \nwonderful tradition in the Senate of people who feel so strongly. We \nshould not diminish the role of the Senate as the place of great \ndebates.\n  I served in the House. It is a wonderful institution. There are 435 \nMembers. There they package their debates through the Rules Committee. \nThey say: You get 1 minute, you get 2 minutes, you get 5 minutes. We \nwill entertain these 10 amendments, and that is all. And if you are not \non the list, you are not there. That is the way the House works because \nthat is the only way it could work with 435 Members. But the Senate was \nnever designed to work that way. It was never intended to work that \nway. The Senate was to be the center of the great debates, debates that \nare unfettered by time, unfettered by restriction. Is that in some ways \ninefficient? Yes. Is it cumbersome, sometimes inconvenient? Sure. It is \nall of that. But it is also the hallmark of the center of democracy. We \nought not ever dilute that, nor should we ever dilute the opportunity \nof every single person who comes to sit and at times stand in the \nSenate to represent his or her constituents to make the strongest case \nthey can make on whatever the issue is that day.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Speaking of the old days, I sat in that presiding chair up \nthere on one occasion 22 hours. I sat there 22 hours, through a night \nof debate on civil rights legislation, when I first came here. It fell \nto my lot to have that as a chore, as it falls to the lot of newer \nSenators. I sat there 22 hours.\n  I can remember the civil rights debate of 1964. I hope my memory is \nnot playing tricks on me. One hundred sixteen days elapsed between the \nday that Mr. Mansfield motioned up that bill and the day that we cast \nthe final vote on that bill, 116 days. We were on the motion to proceed \nfor 2 weeks. I believe the Senate spent 58 days, including 6 Saturdays \nand, it seems to me, 1 Sunday--the Parliamentarian will remember this--\nbut 6 Saturdays, get me now, in debating the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  I voted against the act. I was the only Northern Democrat who voted \nagainst it. I was the only northern Democrat who voted against cloture. \nAnd the only other Democrats who voted against cloture were Alan Bible \nof Nevada--and I am talking about Senators outside the South--and \nperhaps Senator Hayden of Arizona. We spent six Saturdays. We didn't go \nhome on Saturdays. We stayed here and we voted. I forget how many \nrollcall votes we cast. Even following the cloture, we were on that \nbill, I believe, 10 days or so, on the bill even after cloture was \ninvoked but we stayed here and did the work.\n  Had Everett Dirksen, the Republican leader, not voted for cloture and \nled some of the Senators on the other side to vote for cloture, had \nthat Republican leader not worked with Mr. Mansfield and Hubert \nHumphrey in those\n\n[[Page S9140]]\n\ndays to pass an important act, that act would not have passed. Cloture \nwould never have been invoked on that act, if Everett Dirksen, the \nleader on the other side, and some of the Senators who went with him, \nhad they not decided to vote for cloture and vote for the bill. That \nwas teamwork. That was cooperation. That was stick-to-it-iveness. That \nwas the Senate at its best.\n\n  I spoke against that bill. I spoke 14 hours 13 minutes against that \nbill. If I had it to do over again, I would vote for it. But I was just \nout of law school. I thought I knew a lot about constitutional law. And \nthere were some great constitutional lawyers here then. Sam Ervin was \nhere, Lister Hill, John Sparkman, Richard Russell, Russell Long; these \nwere men who had been in this chamber for a long time. They didn't come \nto the Senate in order to use it as a stepping stone in a lateral move \nto the Presidency. They came here to be Senators. But the Senate \nargued. It debated. It amended. It took whatever time was necessary, \nand the Senate spoke its will. That is what we don't have these days. \nWe don't have that these days.\n  I thank the Senator for the service he is performing.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me try to summarize what brought me \nto the floor.\n  A colleague arrived on the Senate floor and said the reason we are in \nthe circumstance in which, at nearly the end of a legislative session \nand only 2 of 13 appropriations bills have been completed by the \nCongress, and not much of the major legislation we had hopes for in the \n106th Congress has been passed, is that Senator Daschle is stalling, \ncausing problems, is just not going to wash.\n  It is sheer nonsense to suggest somehow that the minority leader of \nthe Senate is determining the schedule of the Senate. There are times \nwhen one has to be repetitious in the Senate.\n  Let me give an example: increasing the minimum wage. When it comes \ntime for increasing the tax benefits for the highest income groups in \nAmerica, we have people rushing to the floor, standing up and talking \nabout tax cuts. Good for them. If you happen to be in the top one-tenth \nof 1 percent of the income earners, there are people here coming to the \nfloor of the Senate saying: Let's give you a big tax cut. They won't \ncall it that. They will say it is for the little guy. But just unwrap \nthe package and see what is there.\n  If you are in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the income earners, \ngood for you. You have great representation in the Senate. At least on \na half dozen occasions this year, you had people coming over to vote \nfor big tax cuts for you.\n  But what if you are at the bottom of the economic ladder? What if you \nare a single mother, working the midnight shift for the minimum wage, \ntrying to make ends meet, trying to pay the rent, trying to buy food \nand see if there is any way you can scratch out money to have health \ninsurance for your children? What about you? Who is rushing to the \nSenate floor to say perhaps we ought to provide a small increase in the \nminimum wage?\n  An increase in the minimum wage doesn't happen very often. Time and \ntime again, we have tried to address the needs by increasing the \nminimum wage. It hasn't gotten done. We are near the end of the \nsession. Is it repetitious to bring it back up? You bet it is. But some \nof us intend to be repetitious when it means standing up for the rights \nof the people at the bottom of the economic ladder who are working hard \nbut who are losing ground because the cost of living is going up and \ntheir wages are not.\n  How about the issue of trying to keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals? Let me describe that problem in this session of the \nCongress. Most everybody agrees--certainly the law requires--that we \nprevent criminals from having access to guns. If you have been \nconvicted of a felony, you don't have a right to own a gun. The second \namendment doesn't apply to you, but it applies to law-abiding citizens. \nCriminals have no right to have a gun.\n  The NRA and virtually everybody else has agreed that we ought to have \nan instant check system where, if somebody wants to buy a gun, there \nname will be run through a computer check to see if this person is a \nconvicted felon. If in running this check you discover the person has \npreviously been convicted of a felony, that person has no right to a \ngun. At every gun store in this country, when you go in to buy a gun, \nthat happens.\n  Everybody supports that--the National Rifle Association, Republicans, \nand Democrats; everybody supports that. But there is a loophole. If you \ndon't go to a gun store but instead go to a Saturday gun show, there is \nno requirement when you purchase a gun at that Saturday gun show that \nthey run your name through an instant check.\n  A fair number of guns are passing from one hand to another on \nSaturdays and Sundays at gun shows with no determination of whether the \nperson buying the gun is a felon. So we in the Congress pass a \nprovision that closes that gun show loophole. Is it erratic? Not at \nall. It is very simple, common sense. It says no matter where you buy a \ngun, a gun store or a gun show, your name has to be run through an \ninstant check to determine whether you are a convicted felon. If you \nare not, you can buy the gun. If you are a convicted criminal, you \ncan't because you don't have a right to a gun. That bill passed the \nSenate by one vote. It went into a piece of legislation and went to \nconference and never came back out.\n  A week or so ago, an appropriations subcommittee was considering \nlegislation that would have allowed the introduction of an amendment to \nclose that loophole once again because that provision is on a bill that \napparently is not going to move in this session. This would have \nprovided an opportunity to offer an amendment to close the gun show \nloophole. Instead of allowing that, guess what? They took that \nappropriations subcommittee bill and moved it directly to conference. \nIt never came to the floor of the Senate. Those who would have offered \nthe amendment to close the loophole were never offered the opportunity \nto do that. That is not the regular process in the Senate, not the way \nthings ought to be done.\n  So there are reasons to insist on some of these issues from time to \ntime. We wish, for example, that on many of these days when we weren't \nin session, we would have been in session. Perhaps we would have \nfinished most of the appropriations bills. Perhaps we would have been \nable to reach agreement on issues such as education.\n  We have had a fairly significant debate, over many months in the \n106th Congress, on the issue of education. We know that smaller class \nsize means better instruction and better education. We know that 1 \nteacher with 30 students is less able to teach those students than 1 \nteacher with 15 students. So we have a proposal to help in that regard \nby helping school districts and States have the resources to hire more \nteachers. Yet we are not able to get that completed because there is \ncontroversy in this Congress about that issue.\n\n  There are also schools in this country that are crumbling. Anybody \nwho visits any number of schools will recognize that there are a lot of \nschools in this country that were built after the Second World War when \nthe folks came back from that war and got married and had families. \nThey built schools in a prodigious quantity all across the country. \nSchool after school was built in the fifties, and now many of those \nschools are 50 years old and in desperate need of repair.\n  Every Republican and Democrat, man or woman, ought to understand that \nwhen we send a kid through a schoolroom door, as I have described Rosie \nTwo Bears going through a third grade door the day I was visiting her \nschool, we ought to have some pride in that school, some understanding \nthat every young ``Rosie'' who is walking through the school doors is \nwalking into a classroom that is the best we can provide, that will \noffer that child the best opportunity for an education we can offer \nthat child.\n  But I have been to schools where 150 kids have 1 water fountain and 2 \ntoilets. I have been to schools where kids are sitting at desks 1 inch \napart, and there is no opportunity to plug in computers and get to the \nInternet because the school is partially condemned and they don't have \naccess to that technology; they don't have a football field, a track, \nor physical education facilities. I have been to those schools. We can \ndo better than that. There are\n\n[[Page S9141]]\n\nways for us to help school districts modernize, rehabilitate, and \nrebuild some of those schools, and proposals to do that have largely \nfallen on deaf ears in this Congress.\n  Prescription drugs: We know what we should do on that issue. We know \nlife-saving drugs only save lives if you can afford to access those \ndrugs. The current Medicare program doesn't provide a prescription drug \nbenefit. 12 percent of our population are senior citizens and they \nconsume one-third of all the prescription drugs. The cost of \nprescription drugs increased 16 percent last year alone. It is hard \nwhen you go to the homes of older Americans or go to meetings and have \nthem come talk to you about the price of prescription drugs and see \ntheir eyes fill with tears and their chins begin to quiver as they talk \nabout having diabetes, heart troubles, and other problems. They say \nthey have been to the doctor and the doctor prescribed drugs, but they \ncan't afford them. They ask, ``What shall we do?'' It happens all \nacross the country all the time. We know we should add a prescription \ndrug benefit to the Medicare program.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights: If any issue ought to be just a slam \ndunk, it is this issue. Yet we are at the end of this session and can't \npass a real Patients' Bill of Rights. The House passed one; it was \nbipartisan. And then the Senate passed a ``patients' bill of goods''--\nwell, they don't call it that, but that is what it is. It is just an \nempty vessel to say they have done something.\n  We should pass the Patients' Bill of Rights and make sure that in \ndoctors' offices and in hospital rooms across this country, medical \ncare is administered by the doctors and by skilled medical personnel.\n  I won't recite all the stories. One is sufficient to make the point.\n  A woman fell off a cliff in the Shenandoah mountains and was in a \ncoma. She had multiple broken bones. She was taken to an emergency room \non a gurney and unconscious. She was treated and eventually recovered. \nHer managed care organization said it would not pay for her emergency \ncare because she didn't have prior approval to visit the emergency \nroom. This is a person hauled in on a gurney, unconscious, and she was \ntold she needed prior approval in order to have the emergency room \ntreatment covered by her managed care organization. Examples of that \nsort of treatment go on and on and on.\n\n  Patients should have a right to know all of their medical options, \nnot just the cheapest. Patients ought to have a right to get emergency \nroom treatment during emergencies. A patient ought to be able to \ncontinue treatment with the same oncologist. If a woman is being \ntreated for breast cancer and her spouse has an employer who changes \nhealth care plans, she ought to be able to continue treatment with the \nsame cancer specialist she had been working with for 3 or 5 years. \nThose are basic rights, in my judgment, which are embodied in the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. It is so simple and so straightforward and so \ncompelling. Yet this Congress has not been able to get it done.\n  The list goes on. Agriculture sanctions: We have sanctions \nprohibiting food shipments to so many countries--about a half dozen \naround the world. We have economic sanctions against them, and those \nsanctions include a sanction on the shipment of food. President Clinton \nhas relaxed that some; he is the first President to do so, and good for \nhim. But he can't relax it, for example, with respect to Cuba. That is \na legislative sanction, and we have to repeal it.\n  We ought not to use food as a weapon in the world. There should be no \nmore sanctions on food shipments anywhere. The same ought to be true \nwith medicine. The Senate has spoken on that by 70 votes. We said let's \nstop it. We are too big and too good a country to use food as a weapon. \nWe try to hit Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro and we end up hitting \npoor, sick, hungry people. It ought to stop. Yet we are near the end of \nthis session and we don't seem to be able to do that.\n\n  It does not wash for anyone to come to this Chamber and say the \nproblem is the minority party. That is nonsense. The problem is we \nhaven't been in session a majority of this year. These red dates are \nthe dates in which we have not been in session. The problem is we have \npeople who do not want to schedule debate on the floor of the Senate on \namendments because they do not want to cast votes on those amendments. \nWe ought to change that. Let's decide whatever the amendments are and \nwhatever the policy is and debate it and vote and whoever has the votes \nwins. In a democracy, you don't weigh votes. You count votes. Whoever \nends up with the most votes at the end wins. That, again, is not rocket \nscience. But that is the way democracy ought to work.\n  We have not been in session most of the year, and now we have people \ncoming out suggesting that somehow the minority leader is responsible \nfor the problems of scheduling in this session. It just does not wash. \nIt is just not so.\n  I hope perhaps in the coming 2 weeks that remain in this 106th \nCongress that we will have some burst of energy, some burst of \ncreativity, and perhaps some industrial strength vitamin B-12 \nadministered to the entire Congress as a whole that would make us \ndecide to do the things we know need doing.\n  As I indicated when I started, at the end of the day, the American \npeople do not care much about who offered amendments and who didn't, \nand who brought legislation to the floor trying to shut debate off and \nwho didn't. They are interested at the end of the day in whether this \n106th Congress met and made much of a difference in their lives and in \ntheir families' lives. What people care about is the things they talk \nabout around the supper table: Are my kids going to a good school? If \nnot, what can I do about that? Do I have a good job that has some job \nsecurity? Do I have a decent income? Am I able to believe that my \nparents and grandparents will have access to good health care? Do I \nlive in a neighborhood that is safe?\n  All of these are issues that affect American families. All of these \nare issues that we are working on. And, regrettably, in the 106th \nCongress we are not working on them in a very effective way because we \nhave not been meeting most of the year.\n  On those critical issues--health care, education, economic security, \nand a range of other issues--the things that will most affect working \nfamilies in this country are things that this Congress is not inclined \nto want to work on, or are not inclined to want to pass. It would be \none thing if we couldn't pass legislation addressing these issues \nbecause we had votes on these matters and we lost. But often we \ndiscover there are other ways to kill something by denying the \nopportunity to bring up the amendment for a vote.\n  It is interesting. In this Congress, we have had something pretty \nunusual. We have actually had legislation brought to the floor of the \nSenate and then cloture motions are filed to shut debate off before the \ndebate even begins. We have had legislation brought to the floor of the \nSenate with cloture motions designed to shut amendments off before the \nfirst amendment was offered.\n  You wonder: How does that work? How does that comport with what the \ntradition of the Senate should be as a great debating society on which \nwe take on all of the issues and hear all of the viewpoints and then \nhave a vote about the direction in which we think this country should \nbe moving?\n  When I came to the Congress some years ago, one of the older Members \nof Congress was Claude Pepper, who was then in his eighties--a \nwonderful Congressman from Florida. He used to talk about the miracle \nin the U.S. Constitution--the miracle that says every even-numbered \nyear the American people grab the steering wheel and decide which way \nthey want to nudge this country. That is how he described the process \nof voting. That is the power that the American people have. The \nAmerican people choose who comes to this Chamber. The rules of this \nChamber provide that we do the same as the American people. We take \ntheir hopes and we take their aspirations and their thoughts for a \nbetter life and we offer them here in terms of public policy. Then we \nare supposed to vote. That is the bedrock notion of how you conduct \ndemocracy.\n\n  Yet we are all too often getting in this rut of deciding that we \ndon't have time; we don't want to have a vote on this; we want to \nsidetrack that; we want to hijack this.\n  That is not the way the Senate ought to work.\n\n[[Page S9142]]\n\n  Again, I didn't intend to come to the floor this afternoon, but nor \ndid I want to sit and listen to debate which suggests that the minority \nleader, or the Democratic caucus, or anybody else for that matter, is \nat fault for what is taking place.\n  As the Senator from West Virginia indicated, there is perhaps \nsufficient blame to go around. I don't disagree with that. But I also \nknow that we didn't win the election. I wish we had. We don't control \nthe Senate. I wish we did.\n  But between now and the date we finish in this session of Congress, \nlet me encourage those who make schedules around here to heed the words \nof the minority leader, Senator Daschle. If we have a fair number of \nappropriations bills remaining and people are worrying about whether we \nare going to get them done, then what Senator Daschle suggests, and I \nfirmly support, is to do one appropriations bill a day. Bring up a bill \ntoday. It is Monday. It is 3:30. Let's bring a bill up and debate it \nand stay here until it is done. That is a sure way of getting the bills \ndone. It is a sure way of providing everybody with an opportunity to be \nheard. It is also a way perhaps to get the votes on the issues I \ndescribed that I think this Congress ought to be doing.\n  I assume we will have an interesting debate in the coming days. I \nhope Congress will be able to finish its work in the next 2 or 3 weeks. \nI hope that when we finish our work Democrats and Republicans can \ntogether say at the conclusion of the 106th Congress that we have done \nsomething good for America. But that will not happen unless things \nchange, and unless we take a different tact in the next 3 weeks. There \nis a list of about 8 or 10 pieces that we ought to do. Bring them to \nthe floor. Let's get them done, and then let's adjourn sine die feeling \nwe have done something good for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Maine, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9142-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9142-S9181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, what is the pending \nbusiness before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3:50 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 2796, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2796) to provide for the conservation and \n     development of water and related resources, to authorize the \n     Secretary of the Army to construct various projects for \n     improvements to rivers and harbors of the United States, and \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 1 hour for closing remarks.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, this is the first major \npiece of environmental legislation debated on the floor since I assumed \nthe chairmanship of this committee nearly 1 year ago. I am proud to \nbring the Water Resources Development Act before the Senate, of which a \nmajor portion is the Everglades which I will talk about in a moment.\n  This is a good bill. I am very proud of it. It is fiscally \nresponsible. At the same time, it recognizes our obligation to preserve \none of the most important and endangered ecosystems in the Nation, if \nnot the world--America's Everglades.\n  This bill gets us back on track toward regular biennial Water \nResources Development Act bills. The committee produced a so-called \nWRDA bill last year, but that bill was 1 year late.\n  I am proud of the WRDA portion of this bill. This is not a bill that \nincludes numerous unnecessary projects. The committee established some \ntough criteria on which we worked very closely. We evaluated the old \ncriteria and put in new criteria. We scrupulously followed this \ncriteria in an effort to not let projects make their way into this bill \nthat did not belong there.\n  As I noted in my opening statement a few days ago, the committee \nreceived requests to authorize more than 300 new projects. By holding \nfirm on our criteria in this WRDA bill, we only authorized 23 new \nprojects. We authorize 40 feasibility studies, and the bill contains 65 \nproject-related provisions or modifications that affect existing \nprojects.\n  I remain very concerned about clearing the backlog of previously \nauthorized projects that will not or should not be constructed. Along \nwith Senator Voinovich, we are working very hard to clear that backlog. \nCalled the deauthorization process, this will be an element of the \ncommittee's efforts to reform the Corps and to get those projects \ndeauthorized that should not be there.\n  This bill tightens that process by shortening the length of time that \nan authorized project can stay on the books without actual funding. It \nis not the full answer, but it is a good answer, and it is a good \nbeginning.\n\n  During floor consideration of the bill last week, we accepted an \namendment that requires the National Academy of Sciences to perform two \nstudies relating to independent peer review of the analyses performed \nby the Corps of Engineers.\n  I would like to make a few points about that amendment because it was \na very important amendment. We certainly have read a lot about Corps \nreform in the local newspapers, specifically the Washington Post, over \nthe last few months. The stories raised very legitimate issues about \nthe economic modeling used to justify some of these water resources \nprojects.\n  However, it is important to understand that a series of articles in a \nnewspaper is no substitute for careful consideration of the facts and \nof the issues by the Congress. We have the oversight responsibility for \nthe Army Corps, not the Washington Post.\n  Some Senators, such as Senator Feingold, have proposed reforms that \nfocus on one element in the Corps reform--whether or not to impose a \nrequirement that the feasibility reports for certain water resources \nprojects be subject to peer review. Others, such as Senator Daschle, \nintroduced more comprehensive bills that would examine a number of the \nCorps reform issues, including peer review.\n  The committee needs more information before we can proceed with any \nbill that would impose peer review on the lengthy project development \nprocess that is already in place. We need to know the benefits of peer \nreview and its impacts before starting down that road.\n  Senator Baucus and I are committed to examining this issue and other \nissues related to the operation and management of the Corps of \nEngineers next year. This will include hearings on Corps reform.\n  The hearings will take comments on the NAS study--the National \nAcademy of Sciences study--the bills that have been introduced, as well \nas the issue in general.\n  I was very encouraged that the nominee to be the next Chief of \nEngineers, General Flowers, is receptive to working with the Congress \non a wide range of reform-related issues.\n  I want to speak specifically about one major element in this \nlegislation, the Everglades. There is an important element that \nseparates this WRDA bill from all others, something that makes this \nWRDA truly historic. This WRDA bill includes our landmark Everglades \nbill, S. 2797, the Restoring of the Everglades, an American Legacy Act, \nvery carefully named because it is an American legacy. We do have to \nrestore it. That is what we have done. We have begun the process.\n  So many have asked--especially some of my conservative friends--why \nshould the Federal Government, why should this Congress take on this \nlong-term expensive effort? The answers really are not that difficult, \nif you look at them.\n  First, the Everglades is in real trouble, deep trouble. We could lose \nwhat is left of the Everglades in this very generation.\n  Secondly, the Federal Government, despite the best of intentions, is \nlargely responsible for the damage that was done to the Everglades. The \nCongress\n\n[[Page S9143]]\n\ntold the Corps of Engineers to drain that swamp in 1948--and drain it \nthey did, all too well.\n  Finally, the lands owned or managed by the Federal Government--four \nnational parks and 16 national wildlife refuges which comprise half of \nthe remaining Everglades--will receive the benefits of the restoration.\n\n  So there is a lot of Federal involvement here. This is a Federal \nresponsibility. There is a compelling Federal interest. The State of \nFlorida, to its credit, has already stepped up and committed $2 billion \nto the effort. And Congress needs to respond to that pledge.\n  Let's be clear on one thing right now: This plan is not without \nrisks. This comprehensive plan is based on the best science we have. \nBecause of the very nature of the plan, and the additional requirements \nin the bill, we are certain we will know more about the Everglades and \nthe success of the plan in the future.\n  To those of you who want guarantees, who want to be absolutely \ncertain every dime we spend is going to be spent in a way that is going \nto restore the Everglades, then I say to you you probably should not \nsupport us because I cannot make that guarantee. But what I can say to \nyou is, if we do nothing we lose the Everglades. So if you want to \nrestore this precious national treasure, then you have to be willing to \ntake the risk. And we are cutting that risk dramatically by the way we \nare doing this.\n  But we take risks all the time. We take risks every time we invest in \na new weapons program for the Defense Department or when we invest in \ncancer research. I am sure there would be no Senator who would come to \nthe floor and say: We have not yet found a cure for cancer; therefore, \nwe should not risk any more money.\n  We need to take this risk to save this precious ecosystem. It is well \nworth it. We have cut the odds. Because of the nature of this plan, and \nthe additional requirements in our bill, we are certain we are going to \nknow much more about the Everglades in the future; and we are going to \nbe able, through the process of adaptive management, to change every \nyear or so. If something is not going right, we can pull back, try \nsomething new, so we do not waste a lot of dollars doing things that we \ndo not want to do.\n  We acknowledge uncertainty. The plan acknowledges uncertainty. So \nwhen my colleagues come down and say there is some uncertainty about \nthis, we know that. We anticipate that this plan will change as we gain \nmore knowledge, while we implement it over the next 36 years.\n  This is a 36-year plan that is going to spend in the vicinity of $8 \nbillion, split equally between the State of Florida and the Federal \nGovernment. It works out to a can of Coke per U.S. citizen per year. \nThat is not a bad investment to be able to save the wading birds and \nthe alligators and this precious river of grass of which we are all so \nproud.\n  I am confident, because of the time I have spent on this issue, that \nadaptive assessment or adaptive management--whatever you want to call \nit--will succeed, even if the plan is modified based on the new \ninformation that we get in the future.\n  The Everglades portion of WRDA has broad bipartisan support. Every \nmajor constituency involved in the Everglades restoration supports this \nbill--every one of them.\n  Is it perfect? Did everybody get exactly what they wanted? No. But \neverybody is on board. It is bipartisan and it is wide ranging. It goes \nfrom the liberal side of the equation to the conservative side. It \nincludes the administration. It includes both Presidential candidates: \nVice President Gore and Gov. George Bush. It includes the Florida \nGovernor, Jeb Bush. It includes the Florida Legislature, both sides of \nthe aisle unanimously. It includes the Seminole Tribe of Florida and \nthe Miccosukee Tribe of Indians in Florida.\n\n  It includes major industry groups, such as the Florida Citrus Mutual, \nFlorida Farm Bureau, Florida Home Builders, The American Water Works \nAssociation, Florida Chamber of Commerce, Florida Fruit and Vegetable \nAssociation, Southeast Florida Utility Council, Gulf Citrus Growers \nAssociation, Florida Sugar Cane League, Florida Water Environmental \nUtility Council, Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida, Florida \nFertilizer and Agri-chemical Association; and environmental groups as \nwell, including the National Audubon Society, National Wildlife \nFederation, World Wildlife Fund, Center for Marine Conservation, \nDefenders of Wildlife, National Parks Conservation Association, The \nEverglades Foundation, The Everglades Trust, Audubon of Florida, 1000 \nFriends of Florida, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental \nDefense, and the Sierra Club.\n  I think it is pretty unusual to bring a major environmental bill to \nthe Senate floor with that breadth of support. Support for the bill, as \nit stands today, is even broader than the support that existed for the \nadministration's comprehensive plan.\n  We have taken a good product and have made it better. How have we \nmade it better? It is more fiscally responsible. We defer decisions on \nsome of the riskiest new technologies until we have more information \nfrom the pilot projects, which will help us to understand whether these \nprojects should be continued. It has ground-breaking provisions to \nassure that the plan attains its restoration goals. It has the creation \nof a true partnership between the Federal Government and the State. \nThis type of partnership--State concurrence in all important decisions \nand regulations--has no precedent in our environmental statutes. It has \nmore detailed and meaningful reports to Congress on the progress of the \nplan, almost on a yearly basis.\n  The Everglades bill is a great model for environmental policy \ndevelopment, a model I endorse, a model I have worked hard to implement \nsince I have been the chairman. It is cooperative. It is not \nconfrontational. It is bipartisan. It is flexible. It is adaptive. It \nestablishes a partnership between the Federal Government and the State.\n  Already, there is support for this bill in the House. Congressman \nClay Shaw introduced this bill as H.R. 5121 on September 7. He deserves \ncredit for his leadership in that regard. Many others in the House on \nboth sides of the aisle are ready to join the effort. I am asking my \ncolleagues to join with me in support of this major piece of \nlegislation.\n\n  I see my colleague and good friend from the State of Florida, Senator \nGraham, is on the floor at this time. I will yield the floor in just a \nmoment so he may speak.\n  Before doing so, I thank him, as well as Senator Mack, for his \nabsolute and resolute involvement in this project. I went to Florida in \nearly January at the request of Senator Graham and Senator Mack to see \nfor myself what the situation was. I spent several days there. We had a \nhearing in Florida. We listened to the people who were speaking on this \nissue.\n  I made a promise at that hearing that I would bring this bill to the \nSenate floor before the end of the year. With the help of good people \nsuch as Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator Mack, Senator Baucus, \nand others, we have made that happen. I thank Senator Graham publicly \nand personally for that. His cooperation has been splendid. Without \nhim, we would not be here.\n  I yield the floor so my colleague from Florida may have a chance to \naddress this issue that is so important to his State and to the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair. I express my deepest appreciation and \ngratitude to Senator Smith for the great leadership he has provided to \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee in many areas but especially \nfor what he has done for the Florida Everglades, America's Everglades.\n  Senator Smith, shortly after he assumed the chairmanship of the \ncommittee, after the untimely death of our friend and colleague Senator \nChafee, made one of his first acts as chairman of the committee coming \nto the American Everglades. He did not just come. He absorbed the \nAmerican Everglades through a series of briefings, field visits, and \nthen concluded with a very long hearing before the annual Everglades \nConference.\n  At that hearing, Senator Smith gave a forum to all the diverse points \nof view as to what should be appropriate national policy as it relates \nto America's Everglades. He gave comfort to the people there that these \ndecisions were going to be made in a rational,\n\n[[Page S9144]]\n\nthoughtful manner. That contributed immeasurably to the bringing \ntogether of all of those groups behind the plan which is before us \ntoday. I take this opportunity to thank the Presiding Officer's \nneighbor from New Hampshire for the tremendous leadership he has given.\n  Earlier today I was listening to National Public Radio where there \nwas some grousing about the fact that bipartisanship seems to be a lost \ncomponent of the congressional process. It is not lost on the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire because he has displayed it at its very best. On \nbehalf of Senator Mack, I express our appreciation for that fact.\n  The legislation before us today represents an unprecedented \ncompromise by national and State environmental groups, agriculture and \nindustry. These diverse interests are united in support of the \nEverglades restoration bill, title VI of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2000. This is the legislation we will have the \nopportunity to pass through the Senate today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support for this bill be \nprinted in the Record. This letter carries with it the names of many of \nthe groups just listed by Chairman Smith.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                               September 14, 2000.\n\n         An Open Letter on Restoration of America's Everglades\n\n       Dear Florida Congressional Delegation, Congressional \n     Leadership, and Committee Leadership: We are writing to urge \n     Congress to take immediate and decisive action on a historic \n     accord recently reached on legislation to protect one of the \n     nation's most precious natural resources, America's \n     Everglades. We present a diverse group of interests that \n     includes conservation organizations, agricultural producers, \n     homebuilders, water utilities, and others that don't always \n     agree on Everglades issues. However, we are united with \n     Florida's two Senators, the bipartisan leadership of the \n     Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works, the \n     Clinton Administration, and Florida's Governor Jeb Bush to \n     endorse a legislative package that will protect America's \n     Everglades while respecting the needs of all water users in \n     Florida.\n       This legislation, currently embodied in a manager's \n     amendment to S. 2797 and recently introduced in the House by \n     Congressman Clay Shaw, H.R. 5121, was agreed to as a package \n     and on the condition that all parties would support it in the \n     Senate and the House. We are greatly encouraged that an \n     agreement has been reached on this basis.\n       This legislation can be a sound framework for future \n     management of South Florida's water resources and Congress \n     should approve its orderly implementation as soon as \n     possible. We consider this legislation as currently drafted \n     to be a fair and balanced plan to restore the Everglades \n     while meeting the water-related needs of the region. While \n     there are other changes we all would have preferred, we \n     believe the long and difficult process has produced a \n     reasonable compromise.\n       This agreement has brought an unprecedented level of \n     support for Everglades' restoration legislation. The greatest \n     threat now facing the Everglades is the profound lack of time \n     left in this Congressional session. We urge the Senate to \n     pass expeditiously S. 2797, Restoration of the Everglades, An \n     American Legacy Act. We further urge the Florida \n     Congressional delegation, the Transportation and \n     Infrastructure Committee, its Water Resources and Environment \n     Subcommittee, and House Leadership to unite with the State, \n     Administration, environmental organizations, and the \n     agriculture, water utilities and homebuilders stakeholder \n     coalition, to pass the bill in the House of Representatives \n     and send it to the President for his signature before \n     Congress adjourns for the November elections.\n           Sincerely,\n         Florida Citrus Mutual, Ken Keck; Florida Farm Bureau, \n           Carl B.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing my remarks, a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency \nAdministrator, Ms. Browner; Secretary of Interior, Mr. Babbitt; and \nAssistant Secretary for Civil Works, Mr. Westphal; expressing their \nsupport for this legislation also be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Everglades is sick. This sickness has been long \ncoming.\n  It was approximately 120 years ago that man looked at the Everglades \nand realized that it was different, different than almost anything he \nor she had seen before, and seeing this phenomenon of the Everglades, \nmade a commitment. The commitment was to turn the unique into the \npedestrian by converting the Everglades into something that would look \nmore like man and woman had seen in other areas of this country or \nother areas of the world.\n  The result of that has been 120 years of an effort to change the \nEverglades, to convert the singular into the common. The results of \nthat 120 years have brought the Everglades to their current position. \nThis cannot be cured without the serious surgery that we are about to \nsanction by the passage of this legislation.\n  Since the passage of the central and south Florida flood control \nproject in 1948, placing the Everglades in the responsibility of the \nCorps of Engineers at the direction of Congress, nearly half of the \noriginal Everglades have been drained or otherwise altered. According \nto the National Parks and Conservation Association, the parks and the \npreserves of the Everglades, of whichever Everglades National Park is \nthe jewel, are among the 10 most endangered national parks in the \ncountry.\n  As Florida's Governor in 1983, I launched an effort known as ``Save \nOur Everglades.'' Its purpose was to revitalize this precious \necosystem. The goal was simple. We wanted to turn back time. We wanted \nthe Everglades to look and function more as they had at the end of the \n19th century than they did in 1983.\n  In 1983, restoring the natural health and function of this precious \nsystem seemed to be a distant dream. But after 17 years of bipartisan \nprogress in the context of a strong Federal-State partnership, we now \nstand on the brink of this dream becoming a reality.\n  I will speak for a moment about this unprecedented Federal-State \npartnership. I often compare this unique partnership to a marriage. If \nboth partners respect each other and pledge to work through any \nchallenges together, if they are willing to grow together, the marriage \nwill be strong and successful.\n  Today, we are again celebrating the strength of that marriage. This \nlegislation contains several provisions which were born out of the \nrespect that sustains this marriage.\n  It offers assurances to both the Federal and the State governments on \nthe use and distribution of water in the Everglades ecosystem.\n  It requires that State government pay half the costs of construction. \nIt requires the Federal Government to pay half the costs of operation \nand maintenance. Everglades restoration cannot work unless the \nexecutive branch, Congress, and State government move forward together. \nThe legislation before us today accomplishes that goal.\n  The legislation before us today represents not only unprecedented \ncompromise and partnership but also unprecedented complexity. Just as \nthe Panama Canal, which this Congress authorized almost a hundred years \nago, was the first of its kind, so is Everglades restoration. It is the \nlargest, most complex environmental restoration project not only in the \nhistory of the United States of America but in the history of the \nworld.\n  The lessons we will learn here will be exported to other projects \nthroughout America and throughout the world. I trust that today the \nSenate will make the right choice. Today will be the day the Senate has \nan opportunity to make\n\n[[Page S9145]]\n\na bipartisan commitment to an Everglades restoration plan that reflects \na true partnership between the State and Federal governments. If we \naccomplish the historic goal of restoring America's Everglades, then \ntoday will be one of the most precious memories of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  In the words of President Lyndon Johnson:\n\n       If future generations are to remember us with gratitude \n     rather than contempt, we must leave them more than the \n     miracles of technology. We must leave them a glimpse of the \n     world as it was in the beginning, not just after we got \n     through with it.\n\n  Today is the day we have an opportunity to leave a glimpse of \nAmerica's Everglades as they were when we first found them for future \ngenerations--beautiful, serene, a river of grass.\n  Madam President, we have commended a number of people who have worked \nhard to bring us to this day. I want to take this opportunity to \ncommend members of the individual and committee staffs in the Senate \nwho have played an immeasurable role in the success we will soon \ncelebrate. Many people have worked with Senator Smith, and I want to \nparticularly recognize Chelsea Henderson, Tom Gibson, and Stephanie \nDaigle for their work on behalf of the American Everglades. With \nSenator Baucus, I thank Jo-Ellen Darcy and Peter Washburn. With Senator \nMack, I thank C.K. Lee. And from my office, I thank Catherine Cyr, who \nhas done work of negotiation that would do the most experienced \ndiplomat honor.\n  So it is my hope we will grasp the opportunity that is before us and \ncommence a long adventure--as long an adventure as is required to \noverturn 120 years of attempts to convert the Everglades into the \ncommon, so that we can leave to our children and grandchildren an \nAmerican Everglades which salutes the highest standards of the words \n``unique,'' ``special,'' and ``unprecedented.'' Those are the words \nthat properly describe this marvelous system of nature.\n  Thank you.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Department of the Interior, Environmental Protection \n           Agency, Department of the Army,\n                                  Washington, DC, August 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Robert Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We strongly support your bill. S. 2797, \n     ``Restoring the Everglades, an American Legacy Act,'' and \n     recommend its passage by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives as soon as possible. If enacted, this bill \n     will help achieve the bipartisan goal of re storing a \n     national treasure, America's Everglades.\n       S. 2797 is the product of hard work and negotiation among \n     the Administration, the State of Florida and your Committee. \n     Indeed, the proposed manager's amendment reflects full \n     agreement between the Administration and the State of Florida \n     on the bill. Accordingly, with adoption of the manager's \n     amendment, we will recommend that the President sign the \n     bill. The bill represents a highly effective approach for \n     meeting essential restoration objectives while recognizing \n     other issues important to the citizens of Florida.\n       We commend you, along with Senators Max Baucus, Bob Graham \n     and Connie Mack, for your leadership and commitment to making \n     Everglades legislation a top priority. We stand ready to do \n     all we can to secure passage their year.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bruce Babbitt,\n       Secretary of the Interior.\n      Carol Browner,\n       Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency.\n     Joseph W. Westphal,\n       Assistant Secretary for Civil Works Department of the Army.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I thank my colleague for \nhis very kind remarks. I very much appreciate his hard work on behalf \nof the Everglades, which dates back prior to his time in the Senate, as \nwe all know, when he was the Governor of Florida. Then-Governor Graham \nwas very instrumental in keeping this project on line.\n  I think it is also important to understand that the Founding Fathers \nwere a lot more brilliant than we sometimes give them credit. In this \nprocess, I think they foresaw an opportunity where a Senator from a \nState such as New Hampshire, which has nothing to do with the \nEverglades, could be chairman of a committee that would bring forth a \nmajor piece of environmental legislation in conjunction with the \nFlorida Senators--a piece of environmental legislation as to another \nState about 2,000 miles to the south. It is a remarkable process we \nhave here that would see that happening. I think the founders knew it. \nThat is why we have a Senate, where we can work these things through in \na way that has a national touch.\n  As I went down there and saw the Everglades firsthand and had the \nopportunity to have a hearing with Senators Graham and Voinovich, who \nwas also there, I realized--and I had visited there many times as a \ntourist--that the Everglades was in fact draining, that some 90 percent \nof the wading birds were lost, and animals and plant life were dying. \nOn the one hand, on one side of the Tamiami Trial you had a desert; on \nthe other side you basically had the wetlands that it was supposed to \nbe. But the Tamiami Trail is a dam that needs to be removed to allow \nthat water to flow all through that ecosystem from Lake Okeechobee to \nthe Gulf of Mexico. It is a great project.\n  People might say, What is the Senator from New Hampshire doing here? \nWell, I remember the first time my son saw an alligator in Florida as a \n6-year-old boy. It was a very poignant moment, and you don't forget \nthose things. In talking to the park rangers over the years--and, most \nspecifically, the last time I was there in January--you realize that \nthe Everglades are in trouble. As I said earlier, there are no \nguarantees here, but I think we have cut the odds dramatically. I am \nvery optimistic that this will work and work well. So I am certainly \nlooking forward to the passage of this bill. I hope the House will \nquickly follow suit so that we can make this law before the end of the \nyear.\n  I see Senator Baucus has arrived. I want to say before yielding to \nhim how much I appreciate his help throughout this process. It has been \na bipartisan effort. We are all guilty of partisanship from time to \ntime, as well we should be; I think there are times when partisanship \nis important. But there was no partisanship on this issue. We worked \ntogether on it to bring this bill forward. Senator Baucus and his staff \nwere very helpful, and we are grateful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank my good friend, Senator Smith, \nfor his comments.\n  I join him in urging my colleagues to support final passage of the \nlegislation before us.\n  As we stated on the floor last week, this important bill authorizes \nprojects for flood control, navigation, shore protection, environmental \nrestoration, water supply storage, and recreation. All very important \nmatters across the country. These projects often don't get headlines or \nmuch attention, but they clearly mean a lot to many people.\n  Each of these projects meet our committee criteria. That is \nimportant, too, because the Environment and Public Works Committee gets \nlots of requests. The projects are technologically feasible, \neconomically justified, and environmentally sound. In addition, each \nproject has a local sponsor willing to share a portion of the cost, \nwhich is something we insist upon in order to show that the project is \nimportant locally.\n  Passage of this bill will advance two projects that are very \nimportant for my State of Montana--the fish hatchery at Fort Peck Lake \nand the exchange of cabin site leases in the C.M. Russell Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  The fish hatchery is particularly important since it will create more \njobs and help our State's economy in northeastern Montana, a part of \nthe State which is, frankly, hurting.\n  The cabin lease exchange provision will also benefit the government, \nsportsmen, and cabin site owners by acquiring inholdings that are \nwithin the refuge and that have high value for wildlife in return for \ncabin sites now managed by the Corps.\n  Finally, this bill will start us on the path to restoration of that \nunique national treasure known as the Everglades.\n  Last week we heard my colleagues from Florida, as well as the leaders \nof\n\n[[Page S9146]]\n\nthe Environment and Public Works Committee elaborate on the importance \nof this effort. We all know how important it is. It is one of our \nnatural treasures.\n  This provision is a testament to true bipartisanship. Senators Graham \nand Mack have been at the forefront of this effort. Governor Jeb Bush \nand the Clinton administration, particularly Interior Secretary Bruce \nBabbitt, have also worked closely to achieve this result.\n  And, of course, it could not have happened without the support of \nSenator Smith, our chairman, who put this issue at the top of the \ncommittee's agenda this year and has worked tirelessly throughout the \nyear to make this bill happen, and Senator, Voinovich, the subcommittee \nchairman. This has been an effort of his as well.\n  Without this bipartisan support in Washington, and throughout \nFlorida, this project would not be where it is today. It would still be \non the drawing board. And the Everglades would still be destined to \ndie.\n  In conclusion, I want to assure our colleagues that this bill is the \nright thing to do. And it is worthy of their support.\n  Before yielding the floor, let me also mention some of the staff who \ndeserve recognition for putting this bill together. I will submit a \nlonger list for the Record.\n  But let me mention here my fine staff, particularly Jo-Ellen Darcy, \nwho is sitting to my immediate left. Her expertise and experience in \nwater issues has been a real asset to me and the committee.\n  I'll also tell you that she has become more familiar with the State \nof Florida than I think she ever imagined.\n  And Peter Washburn, who is sitting to Jo-Ellen's left, a fellow from \nEPA on the staff of the Environment Committee. He has provided \ninvaluable assistance in shepherding this bill through the legislative \nprocess, and on many other issues before the committee.\n  Senator Smith's staff, Chelsea Henderson, Stephanie Daigle, and Tom \nGibson have similarly provided the leadership necessary to get this \nbill done. And Senator Voinovich's staff, Ellen Stein and Rich \nWorthington, were instrumental in negotiating this bill from the \nbeginning.\n  Finally, staff from Senator Graham's office, Catharine Cyr, and from \nSenator Mack's office, C.K. Lee, at times probably felt that they were \non the staff of the committee for all the time they put into this \neffort.\n  All of us in the Senate, and all Floridians, should appreciate their \ndedication and hard work. They are people whose names aren't often \nmentioned. In fact, to be honest about it, they do most of the hard \nwork. They are true servants in the best sense of the term because they \nare doing work for our country, yet do not seek to have their names in \nheadlines.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the many other people who \ndeserve thanks for their part in making this bill a reality be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Senate Staff Deserving Thanks\n\n       EPW Committee: Tom Sliter, David Conover, Tom Gibson, \n     Chelsea Henderson, Stephanie Daigle, Peter Washburn, and Jo-\n     Ellen Darcy.\n       Catherine Cyr with Senator Graham; C.K. Lee with Senator \n     Mack; Ellen Stein with Senator Voinovich; Rich Worthington \n     with Senator Voinovich; Kasey Gilette with Senator Graham; \n     Ann Loomis with Senator Warner; and Janine Johnson and Darcie \n     Tomasallo-Chen with Legislative Counsel.\n       Army WRDA or Everglades Participants: Assistant Secretary \n     of the Army for Civil Works, Dr. Joseph Westphal; Michael \n     Davis; Jim Smyth; Chip Smith; Earl Stockdale; Susan Bond; \n     Larry Prather; Gary Campbell; Milton Rider; and Stu \n     Appelbaum.\n       Department of the Interior CERP legislative team: Secretary \n     Bruce Babbitt; Mary Doyle, Acting Assistant Secretary for \n     Water and Science; Peter Umhofer, Senior Advisor; Don Jodrey, \n     Attorney, Office of the Solicitor; David Watts, Attorney, \n     Office of the Solicitor; and Dick Ring, Superintendent, \n     Everglades National Park.\n       Environmental Protection Agency: Administrator Carol \n     Browner; Gary Guzy; Bob Dreher; Jamie Grodsky; John \n     Hankinson; Richard Harvey; Philip Mancusi-Ungaro; Eric \n     Hughes; and Dana Minerva.\n       White House Council of Environmental Quality: Bill Leary.\n\n\n                    state of florida everglades team\n\n       Florida Governors Office: Governor Jeb Bush, J. Allison \n     DeFoor, R. Clarke Cooper, Rick Smith, and Nina Oviedo.\n       Florida Department of Environmental Protection: Secretary \n     David B. Struhs, Ernie Barnett, Leslie Palmer, John Outland, \n     and Jennifer Fitzwater.\n       South Florida Water Management District: Executive Director \n     Frank Finch, Kathy Copeland, Mike Collins, Tom Teets, John \n     Fumero, Elena Bernando, Paul Warner, Abe Cooper, and Cecile \n     Ross.\n       South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force: Rock Salt.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, since both Senator \nGraham and Senator Baucus have both mentioned so many people to thank, \nwe always run the risk of leaving someone out whenever we do that. With \napologies to anyone that I do, I would like to reiterate and reinforce \nsome of those who have already been thanked as well as perhaps a couple \nmore.\n  I think first and foremost we should mention Senator John Chafee who \ncertainly started the process of the efforts on the Everglades, along \nwith Senator Baucus. I know that John Chafee would be very proud of \nthis moment because he felt deeply about this ecosystem. I think it is \na great honor to be here now and be at this point knowing that John \nChafee would have wanted this. It is a great tribute to him because he \nstarted the process. All we did was jump into the harness that he had \nalready put on the team.\n  I also thank Senator Voinovich, subcommittee chairman, because he \nbrought a lot of debate on this issue. He helped us correct many \nprovisions--certainly on the financing end and the cost end. We look a \nlot more closely at projects because of him. He was certainly a \nstalwart in seeing that this was a more fiscally responsible item than \nperhaps it may have otherwise been.\n  Certainly Senator Baucus, who I already thanked, and Senators Mack \nand Graham. As Senator Baucus correctly said, it seemed as if Senator \nMack was on the committee. But that is the way we worked it. They are \nthe two Senators. We worked with them. Senator Graham, of course, is on \nthe committee. But we worked together, knowing that we wanted all the \ninput we could get from all of them.\n  The administration was helpful. Mary Doyle and Peter Umhofer at the \nDepartment of the Interior. And Secretary Babbitt who was here for a \npress conference when we announced and released the bill; Joe Westphal \nand Mike Davis from the Department of the Army; Gary Guzy from EPA; Stu \nApplebaum, Larry Prather, and many others from the Corps of Engineers; \nand Bill Leary from CEQ.\n  From the State of Florida--they have been absolutely fantastic on \nboth sides of the aisle: David Struhs, Leslie Palmer, and Ernie Barnett \nfrom the Florida Department of Environmental Protection; Governor Bush \nhimself, who has just been outstanding in conversation after \nconversation, working together on all of the provisions of this bill; \nand Kathy Copeland from the South Florida Water Management District.\n  From Senator Bob Graham's staff, Catharine Cyr Ranson and Kasey \nGilletteand, have been wonderful. We appreciate all they have done.\n  Senator Mack's staff has already been mentioned by Senator Baucus. \nBut I would also like to thank C.K. Lee, who was really the honorary \nmember of the committee staff.\n  Senator Voinovich's staff: Ellen Stein, Rich Worthington; and, of \ncourse, Senator Baucus' staff: Tom Sliter, Jo-Ellen Darcy, and Peter \nWashburn, all worked together in a nonpartisan way. We tried to keep \nthe doors open at all times.\n  Of course, my own staff, Dave Conover, who is the chief of staff on \nthe committee; Ann Klee, Angie Giancarlo, and Chelsea Henderson, now \nMaxwell--she found time to get married after they got the Everglades \nset and ready to go. We let her get married and go on her honeymoon and \ncome back to be here for the finale--and Stephanie Daigle and Tom \nGibson, all brought a great blend of knowledge of the water issues and \nengineering, as well, to the whole debate.\n\n  Let me say in closing to my colleagues that when you look back on \nyour career in the Senate, I think you can be very proud of what you \ndid. When you cast a vote to save the Everglades, I don't know if you \nare ever going to regret it. I think it is going to be a defining \nmoment. Fifty years from\n\n[[Page S9147]]\n\nnow when the historians look back, they are going to say when it came \ntime to stand up for the Everglades, they did. I think it will be one \nof the finest things that you have done in your careers. I certainly \nfeel that way about mine. The only regret would be if we didn't try. We \ndid try, and I believe we will succeed as a result of the fact that we \ntook this risk.\n  Some have said it would be ``bad politics,''--bad politics for the \nadministration to work with the Republican Congress on an environmental \nissue; bad politics for Republicans to work with the administration \nwith Florida as a ``swing State''; that maybe Governor George Bush will \nget too much credit, or Al Gore, who has been closely associated with \nthe Everglades, is going to get too much credit. There is enough credit \nto go around. Who cares.\n  The point is that most everyone in Florida--and I do not know too \nmany on the other side who do not--supports restoring the Everglades. \nLet the credit fall where it may. Let the credit be taken where people \nwant to take it. But the truth is we did the right thing. That is all \nthat matters in the long run.\n  There is a lot of history here. Congress initiated this plan in WRDA \nin 1992 when George Bush was in office and the Democrats were in the \nmajority. It then refocused the Everglades effort in WRDA in 1996 when \nthe Republicans were in the majority and Bill Clinton was in the White \nHouse.\n  I think you see that there is plenty of evidence of bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Congress set up the process under which this comprehensive plan was \ndeveloped, but it was developed by this administration in cooperation \nwith Florida, with tribes, and all other stakeholders.\n  Florida, under Jeb Bush, stepped up to the plate and passed the \nlegislation, along with the funding, to keep this moving forward even \nbefore the Federal Government made its commitment. Florida made its \ncommitment to put their money up.\n  When I became chairman, as has already been said, I took up the \nmantle and made this a priority. I believe in it. I made this \nrestoration of the Everglades my highest priority. I am very grateful \nthat my colleagues felt the same way and joined with me because, \nobviously, we wouldn't be here if it was just my priority. It takes at \nleast 51 Senators to have that priority as well or we wouldn't be here.\n\n  The Senate took the plan and made some important modifications, \nstrengthened it, broadened the support; Senator Voinovich's input \nstrengthened it.\n  We are poised to send the bill to the House, a bill that has the \nsupport of every major south Florida stakeholder, the State of Florida, \nthe administration, and I think most Members of the Senate.\n  Restoration of the Everglades is not a partisan issue. I ask my \ncolleagues, if you have any doubts and you are worried about every \nsingle ``i'' being dotted and every ``t'' being crossed, take the risk. \nYou will be glad you did. This is the right thing to do.\n  I am very excited about this action. I am very excited by the fact we \nhave looked to the future. In politics, sometimes we look to the next \nelection. This time, with this vote, we are going to look to the next \ngeneration and respond so our grandchildren and their children will \nenjoy alligators and wading birds and the river of grass once again--\nnot only those who have had the chance to experience it now, but it \nwill still be there for centuries to come because of what we did. I am \nproud of everyone for help in doing this.\n\n\n                          everglades ecosystem\n\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today to engage my colleague from \nFlorida in a colloquy. Specifically, I want to clarify our \nunderstanding of the portion of the legislation we're considering today \nto restore, preserve and protect the Everglades ecosystem. My \nunderstanding is that the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan \nauthorized by this bill create a balance between state and federal \ninterests in ensuring that the predicted Plan benefits--including \nbenefits to both state and federal lands--are attained. It is my view \nthat this bill is intended to recognize and maintain the State's \ninterest in preserving the sovereignty, in State law, over the \nreservation and allocation of water within the State's boundaries. It \nis my further understanding that the Agreement called for between the \nPresident and the Governor of Florida will not result in a \nfederalization of State water law. Florida water law requires that all \nreasonable beneficial water uses and natural system demands are subject \nto a public interest balancing test. Implementation of the Plan will \nrely upon State law and processes for reserving and allocating water \nfor all users, according to the principles set out in the legislation \nbefore us. It is not the intent of this Act, or the President/Governor \nAgreement required by this Act, to create a procedure where all of the \nnew water made available by the Plan will be allocated to the natural \nsystem leaving nothing for other water users. Rather, the agreement \nwill simply ensure that water for the natural system is reserved first, \nand any remaining water may be allocated among other users according to \nthe provisions of State water law. I yield to my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Graham.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I would join my colleague from Florida, \nMr. Mack in clarifying our understanding. I agree with his remarks, and \nmake the further point that the Plan authorized by this bill will \ncapture a large percentage of the water lost to tide or lost through \nevapotranspiration for use by both the built and natural systems, with \nthe natural system having priority over the water generated by the \nPlan.\n  Mr. MACK. I appreciate the comments of my colleague and yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                  secton 211, project deauthorization\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, Sec. 211 of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2000 includes a provision to accelerate the process \nto deauthorize inactive civil works projects. I am concerned, however, \nthat this provision will have unintended consequences for deep-draft \nnavigation projects.\n  In 1986 the Congress authorized many port improvement projects after \na 16-year deadlock with the Executive Branch. At that time, these \nprojects were authorized according to the Report of the Chief of \nEngineers. Subsequently, with the concurrence of the non-Federal \nsponsor, elements of these major projects were constructed in phases. \nFor example, in the case of the Norfolk Harbor and Channels Deepening \nProject, the project authorizes the deepening of the main channels to \n55 feet, deepening anchorages to 55 feet and deepening secondary \nchannels to 45 feet.\n  Significant progress has been made to deepen our nation's most active \nports. These projects are critical to America's competitiveness in the \nglobal marketplace and to securing a favorable balance of trade. Like \nother major port navigation projects, construction under the Norfolk \nHarbor and Channels project has occurred in increments or phases. The \noutbound channel, anchorages and Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River \nhave all been deepened under the current authorization. Work is \nunderway to deepen the inbound channel to 50-feet, and the Commonwealth \nhas fully funded this increment.\n  The remaining elements of the project are still vitally important and \nwholly supported by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Port of Virginia \nis the second busiest general cargo port on the East Coast and the \nlargest port in terms of total cargoes, which include bulk commodities \nsuch as coal and grain. The port complex consists of the Newport News \nMarine Terminal, Norfolk International Terminals, Portsmouth Marine \nTerminals, and the Virginia Inland Port.\n  In fiscal year 2000, over 12 million tons of containerized cargo \nmoved through the ports. Virginia's general cargo facilities are \nresponsible for more than $800 million a year in commerce and tax \nrevenue. Also, Hampton Roads ranks among the world's largest coal \nexporting ports--handling more than 50 tons annually. Virginia's ports \nare one of the few in this country capable of loading and unloading the \nnew generation of container ships.\n  I am concerned that the provision in section 211 relating to \nseparable elements in subsection (b)(2), will deauthorize the 55-foot \nphases of this project within 1 year. This section fails to recognize \nthat it makes good economic sense, from the federal and state \nperspective, to construct these large projects in phases.\n\n[[Page S9148]]\n\n  I would ask the Chairman if my understanding of this section is \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, is \ncorrect in his understanding of the potential impact of the provision. \nHowever, it is not my intent to deauthorize large navigation projects \nwhich enjoy strong state and federal support. The Committee has \ndiscussed this matter with the Corps of Engineers and we are aware that \nthe provision may inadvertently capture a universe of active, ongoing \nprojects. I can assure my colleague that we will work in conference to \nbe sure that projects like the Norfolk Harbor and Channels project, as \nwell as other critically important projects are not deauthorized as a \nresult of this provision.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chairman and I look forward to working with \nhim on this issue. I have offered two provisions to clarify the intent \nof this section to the Chairman. I am aware that the Assistant \nSecretary of the Army's office also has provided technical assistance \non this matter. I trust that before we conference with the House of \nRepresentatives, we will have language recommended by the Corps to \ncorrect the scope of this section.\n\n\n                        homestead air force base\n\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today to call the Senate's \nattention to a provision of the bill before us expressing the sense of \nthe Senate concerning Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. I want to \ntake a moment of the Senate's time today to express my understanding of \nthis resolution and my own intent in agreeing to its inclusion in the \nbill before us today.\n  As my colleagues are aware, this Air Force base is currently in the \ndisposal process set forth by Congress when it established a fair and \nimpartial system for closing military facilities around the country. \nSince Hurricane Andrew devastated the region in 1992, the citizens of \nSouth Florida have waited for a disposal decision from the federal \ngovernment. It is anticipated the property could provide a stable \neconomic platform for a community that is in need of jobs and economic \ndevelopment. Clearly, it is my intent that whatever use to which the \nproperty is ultimately put be accomplished in a manner that does not \nadversely impact the surrounding environment or the Everglades \nrestoration plan we're considering today.\n  But let me be clear, Mr. President. It is emphatically not my intent \nthat this resolution be read by the United States Air Force to mean \nthey should add to, alter, or amend the existing process for disposing \nthe property at Homestead Air Force Base. It is my strong view that the \nprocess for conveying surplus military property is clearly set forth in \nthe law and that process should be followed until the final \nSupplemental Environmental Impact Statement on the property is \ncompleted and the Air Force disposes the property.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MACK. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I agree with the remarks by my colleague from Florida, \nand I would add that, in my view, the resolution makes clear that--once \nthe conveyance process is complete--the Secretary of the Army should \nwork closely with the parties to which the property is conveyed to \nensure compatibility with the surrounding environment and the \nrestoration plan. Further, the resolution requests the Secretary of the \nArmy report to Congress in two years on any steps taken to ensure this \ncompatibility and any recommendations for consideration by the \nCongress. While this is laudable, and has my full support, this \nresolution should not be read to mean the Air Force must add any new \nhurdles to the existing base closure and disposal process.\n  I notice my colleague, Senator Inhofe, on the floor. I would ask my \ncolleague for his thoughts on the Homestead matter and ask him if it is \nhis understanding that the base closure law clearly sets out the \nprocess for disposing surplus military facilities and that this \nresolution does not alter or amend that law?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the comments of my colleagues from Florida. \nI have worked in the Armed Services Committee of the Senate to protect \nand defend the base closure and disposal process from political \nmanipulation. I would agree that the resolution in the legislation \nbefore us today should not be read to mean the Air Force should delay \nits decision on the disposal of Homestead Air Force Base or otherwise \nalter its decision making process. The law is clear on how surplus \nmilitary facilities in this country are disposed and it is my intent \nthat this law be followed and adhered to by the Air Force. I note the \npresence on the floor of the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee on the floor. I yield to Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for his courtesy. I have listened \ncarefully to the discussion between my colleagues. I would agree with \nthe remarks of Senator Inhofe. The base closure process now in law \nshould work its will in the case of Homestead Air Force Base according \nto the principles set forth in the law. No new layers of decision \nshould be added as a result of the action we're taking here today.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 2796, The \nWater Resources Development Act of 2000. I want to thank the Chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Smith of New \nHampshire, and my colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus for working \nwith me to include two provisions in this year's bill.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the Fort Peck Fish Hatchery \nAuthorization Act of 2000. As you may know, the Fort Peck Reservoir is \na very prominent feature of North Eastern Montana. The Fort Peck \nproject was built in the 1930s to dam the Upper Missouri River. The \nresult was a massive reservoir that spans across my great state.\n  The original authorization legislation for the Fort Peck project, and \nsubsequent revisions and additions, left a great many promises unmet. A \nvalley was flooded, but originally Montana was promised increased \nirrigation, low-cost power, and economic development. Since the \noriginal legislation, numerous laws have been enacted promising \nincreased recreational activities on the lake, and also that the \nfederal government would do more to support the fish and wildlife \nresources in the area.\n  In this day and age, economic development in rural areas is becoming \nmore and more dependent upon recreation and strong fish and wildlife \nnumbers. The Fort Peck area is faced with a number of realities. First, \nthe area is in dire need of a fish hatchery. The only hatchery in the \nregion to support warm water species is found in Miles City, Montana. \nIt is struggling to meet the needs of the fisheries in the area, yet it \ncontinues to fall short. Additionally, an outbreak of disease or \nfailure in the infrastructure at the Miles City hatchery would leave \nthe entire region reeling with no secondary source to support the \narea's fisheries.\n  We are also faced with the reality that despite the promises given, \nthe State of Montana has had to foot the bill for fish hatchery \noperations in the area. Since about 1950 the State has been funding \nthese operations with little to no support from the Corps of Engineers. \nA citizens group spanning the State of Montana finally decided to make \nthe federal government keep its promises.\n  Last year the citizens group organized, and state legislation \nsubsequently passed to authorize the sale of a warm water fishing stamp \nto begin collecting funds for the eventual operation and maintenance of \nthe hatchery. I helped the group work with the Corps of Engineers to \nensure that $125,000 in last year's budget was allocated to a \nfeasibility study for the project, and Montanans kept their end of the \nbargain by finding another $125,000 to match the Corps expenditure. \nClearly, we are putting our money, along with our sweat, where our \nmouth is.\n  Recreation is part of the local economy. But the buzzword today is \ndiversity. Diversify your economy. The Fort Peck area depends almost \nsolely on agriculture. More irrigated acres probably aren't going to \nhelp the area pull itself up by its boot straps. But a stronger \nrecreational and tourism industry sure will help speed things up.\n  A lot of effort has already gone into this project. A state bill has \nbeen passed. The Corps has dedicated a project manager to the project. \nCitizens have raised money and jumped over more hurdles than I care to \ncount. But the bottom line is that this is a great project with immense \nsupport. It is a good investment in the area, and it\n\n[[Page S9149]]\n\nhelps the federal government fulfill one thing that it ought to--its \npromises.\n  Unfortunately, everything we wanted wasn't included in this \nlegislation. As I originally drafted the legislation it ensured that \nthe federal government would pick up part of the tab for operation and \nmaintenance. Unfortunately, as Chairman Smith and Senator Baucus worked \nout the details of the legislation for inclusion in the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, they were unable to support this provision. I had \nhoped that, as in the portion of this bill dealing with the Everglades, \nthey would allow the federal government to pick up a larger portion of \nthe operation and maintenance overhead.\n  Second, the legislation continues to include a section for power \ndelivery that directs the Secretary of the Army to deliver low cost \nPick-Sloan project power to the hatchery. This provision in the bill \nhas raised the concerns of the local electric co-operatives and those \nthat use Pick-Sloan power. I have worked with the Corps and the local \ninterests to assure that this provision is not needed as drafted. I \nhave discussed the need for changes with both the Chairman and Senator \nBaucus. I have secured a commitment from both of them to resolve this \nissue when the legislation goes to conference committee.\n  Despite this shortcoming with the legislation, I am have worked hard \non the hatchery project and feel it is necessary that we must move \nahead as it has been included. I thank the Committee for working with \nme to ensure the hatchery project was included on my behalf.\n  Another Montana specific provision, recently added to the \nlegislation, allows the Corps of Engineers and the United States Fish \nand Wildlife Service to dispose of sites that are currently occupied by \ncabin leases and use the proceeds to purchase land in, or adjacent to, \nthe Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge that surrounds Fort \nPeck Reservoir. This provision is a classic example of a win-win \nsituation that will help support recreation and wildlife habitat in the \nregion. By selling these cabin sites, we are reducing government \nmanagement considerations, offering stability to the cabin owners, and \nproviding a revenue source to purchase inholdings. Senator Baucus and I \nhave been working on this legislation for a few years, and to see it \nincluded in this legislation is a great accomplishment for both of us.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I rise to address a provision \nincluded in WRDA that will help local communities in many parts of the \nnation deal with the burden they often face when the federal government \nundertake dredging projects in their region.\n  Before discussing the merits of this legislation, I want to first \nthank my colleagues, particularly Senators Smith, Baucus, and Voinovich \nfor their assistance and cooperation. My colleagues have been \nremarkably helpful in this matter, they have understood the need, and I \nam grateful that they have agreed to include it in the managers \npackage.\n  Within WRDA there is a $2 million annual authorization to allow the \nU.S. Army Corp of engineers to develop a program that will allow all \neight of its regional offices to market eligible dredged material to \npublic agencies and private entities for beneficial reuse.\n  Beneficial reuse is a concept which has largely been largely \nunderutilized. As a result, dredged material is often dumped on the \nshorelines of local communities to their disadvantage, instead of sold \nto construction companies and other developers who would be eager to \nhave this material available. We have known about this strange and \nironic, even tragic, situation for some time, yet until now, not enough \nhas been done to bring relief to these communities.\n  The people of southern New Jersey are all too familiar with this \nsituation. Current plans by the U.S. Army Corps call for more than 20 \nmillion cubic yards of material dredged from the Delaware River to be \nplaced on prime waterfront property along the Southern New Jersey \nshoreline. However, with some effort and encouragement, the Army corps \nhas recently identified nearly 13 million cubic yards of that material \nfor beneficial reuse in transportation and construction projects that \nwould have otherwise been simply placed in upland sites.\n  From this experience, which is also happening in port projects in \nother parts of the country, we should learn that contracting companies, \nland development companies, and major corporations want this material. \nThis means we need to encourage the Army corps to be thinking about \nways to beneficially reuse dredged material up-front so that \ncommunities will not be confronted with the same problems faced by the \ncitizens of Southern New Jersey.\n  The program created by this legislation will give the Army Corps the \nauthority and the funding they require to begin actively marketing \ndredged material from projects all across the United States. It \nrecognizes the need to keep our nation's rivers and channels efficient \nand available to maritime traffic while ensuring that local communities \nare treated fairly.\n  I would again like to thank chairman Smith, Ranking Member Baucus, \nand Senator Voinovich for their commitment and attention to this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise to express my support \nfor S. 2796, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. This bill, \nwhich authorizes numerous Army Corps of Engineers' programs throughout \nthe Nation, is of vital importance to my state of Oregon.\n  Oregon has both coastal and inland ports that rely heavily on the \ntechnical assistance provided by the Corps' programs for their \ncontinued operation. Dredging and flood control activities are also \nimportant to the economic vitality of Oregon. The Corps also operates a \nnumber of dams in the Columbia River basin and the Willamette River \nbasin that generate clean hydroelectric power.\n  S. 2796 authorizes the study of several small aquatic ecosystem \nrestoration projects in Oregon. It also designated the Willamette River \nbasin, Oregon, as a priority watershed for a water resource needs \nassessment.\n  I would like to express my deep concerns about one provision in the \nbill, however. It has come to my attention that Section 207 of the \nbill, which is worded very innocuously, would allow for contracting out \nof operations and maintenance activities at Federal hydropower \nfacilities. The dedicated men and women, many of whom are my \nconstituents, who currently provide operations and maintenance at \nCorps' hydropower facilities in the Pacific Northwest are professionals \nof the highest order. Any problems related to the operations and \nmaintenance at hydropower facilities on the Columbia River are the \nresult of the Corps' failure to sign a direct funding agreement with \nthe Bonneville Power Administration for almost 7 years after being \nauthorized to do so.\n  As the Water Resources Development Act moves to conference, I urge \nthat this provision be deleted from the bill, as it already has been in \nthe House version.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to offer my thanks to \nSenator Smith, the chairman of the Environment Committee and commend \nhim for his successful effort to pass the Water Resources Development \nAct of 2000.\n  Included in this legislation is language I crafted with \nRepresentatives Ehlers and Camp to further clarify the extent of the \nGreat Lakes Governors' authority over diversions of Great Lakes water \nto locations outside the basin. This amendment makes clear that both \ndiversions of water for use within the U.S. and exports of water to \nlocations outside the U.S. may occur only with the consent of all eight \nGreat Lakes governors. Questions over the definition of ``diversion'' \nmade this clarification necessary.\n  Almost as important, this amendment demonstrates that it is the \nintent of the Congress that the states work cooperatively with the \nProvinces of Ontario and Quebec to develop common standards for \nconservation of Great Lakes water and mechanisms for withdrawals. Such \ncooperation is crucial if we are to have equal and effective programs \nfor conserving these waters and maintaining the health of the Great \nLakes.\n  In closing, let me state that I regret that my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Michigan did not join me in this effort. We share \ndiffering opinions over\n\n[[Page S9150]]\n\nthe need for clarification of the 1986 act. And while I disagreed with \nhis interpretation of the definition of ``bulk fresh water,'' because \ndiversions of water for use within the U.S. are already distinctly \ncovered in the 1986 act, I nevertheless modified the amendment at his \nrequest, and I share his commitment to protecting the tremendous \nresources for future generations.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I will only take a moment of the Senate's \ntime today--prior to the vote on the Water Resources Development Act--\nto acknowledge the importance of this moment and the action the Senate \nwill take today to restore and preserve America's Everglades.\n  My colleague, Senator Graham, and I have worked for eight years to \nbring this bill to the floor and it gives me great satisfaction that \ntoday it will be approved by the Senate.\n  I want especially to thank Chairman Smith for his dedication to this \neffort over the past few months. He has worked side-by-side with us to \ndevelop the consensus product we're voting on today. As we developed \nthis legislation, he and his staff provided valuable input into the \nprocess and we appreciate the long hours they put in on our behalf.\n  Further, I want to--once again--acknowledge my colleague, Senator \nGraham. He has worked on Everglades issues for years--even prior to his \ntime in the Senate--and it has been a pleasure to work with him over \nthe years as we worked on the legislation before us.\n  The Corps of Engineers, the Department of Interior, and the Council \non Environmental Quality have worked long hours to turn this bill into \nreality. I appreciate the support of these agencies throughout the \nprocess and for the proof--once again--that saving the Everglades is \nnot a partisan issue.\n  And finally, I want to acknowledge the hard work and steadfast \nsupport of Governor Bush. The State of Florida is a full partner with \nus in this restoration effort, and I believe the work we've put in \ntogether in writing this bill bodes well for a lasting partnership on \nbehalf of the Everglades.\n  The Everglades is an American treasure. Today we in the Senate will \ntake a major step forward in passing a restoration plan that is rooted \nin good science, common sense, and consensus. I thank everyone who \nparticipated in this process for their hard work and dedication to the \neffort.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is poised \nto pass the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA). This \nlegislation includes critical provisions to restore the Florida \nEverglades and the Missouri River in South Dakota and I am hopeful that \nit will be enacted this year.\n  Among the provisions of WRDA that will most benefit South Dakota is a \nsection incorporating elements of S. 2291, the Missouri River \nRestoration Act. I introduced this legislation last May to address the \nsiltation of the Missouri River in South Dakota and the threat to \nIndian cultural and historic sites that border the river. The WRDA bill \nunder consideration today takes an important first step to address \nthese problems, and I want to thank all of my colleagues for their help \nto secure the passage of this legislation. In particular, Senator \nJohnson, Senator Baucus, Senator Smith of New Hampshire and Senator \nVoinovich deserve praise for their efforts to incorporate this \nlegislation into the larger bill. It is my hope that Congress will \nadopt the remaining elements of my comprehensive proposal to restore \nthe Missouri River, including the creation of a Missouri River Trust \nFund, in the foreseeable future.\n  The need for this legislation stems from the construction of a series \nof federal dams along the Missouri River in the 1950s and 1960s that \nforever changed its flow. For decades, these dams have provided \naffordable electricity for millions of Americans and prevented billions \nof dollars of damage to downstream states by preventing flooding. They \nhave also created an economically important recreation industry in \nSouth Dakota.\n  However, one of the consequences of the dams is that they have \nvirtually eliminated the ability of the Missouri River to carry \nsediment downstream. Before the dams, the Missouri was known as the Big \nMuddy because of the heavy sediment load it carried. Today, that \nsediment is deposited on the river bottom in South Dakota, and \nsignificant build-ups have occurred where tributaries like the Bad \nRiver, White River and Niobrara River empty into the Missouri.\n  The Bad River, for example, deposits millions of tons of silt into \nthe Missouri River each year. This sediment builds up near the cities \nof Pierre and Ft. Pierre, where it has raised the local water table and \nflooded area homes. Already, Congress has had to authorize a $35 \nmillion project to relocate hundreds of families. To prevent more \nserious flooding, the Corps has had to lower releases from the Oahe \ndam, causing a $12 million annual loss due to restricted power \ngeneration.\n  Farther south, near the city of Springfield, sediment from the \nNiobrara River clogs the Missouri's channel for miles. Boats that used \nto sail from Yankton to Springfield can no longer navigate the channel, \neroding the area's economy. This problem will only grow worse. \nAccording to the Corps of Engineers, in less than 75 years Lewis and \nClark lake will fill entirely with sediment, ending the ability of that \nreservoir to provide flood control and seriously threatening the \neconomies of cities like Yankton and Vermillion.\n  In addition to the impact of sediment on flood control, over 3000 \ncultural and historic sites important to Indian tribes, including \nburial grounds, campsites, and ancient villages, are found along the \nMissouri River in the Dakotas. Many of these sites are threatened by \nerosion, and each year some of them are irretrievably lost as they \ntumble into the river. Critical points of the Lewis and Clark trail \nalso follow the Missouri through South Dakota, and they are threatened \nby erosion as well.\n  The elements of the Missouri River Restoration Act included in WRDA \ntoday address these problems by establishing a Missouri River Task \nForce composed of federal officials, representatives of the State of \nSouth Dakota and area Indian tribes. It will be responsible for \ndeveloping and implementing a Missouri River Restoration Program to \nreduce sedimentation and protect cultural and historic sites along the \nriver.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to explain in detail how this \nprocess will work First, the bill establishes a 25-member Missouri \nRiver Trust. Appointments will be made to the Trust by the Secretary of \nthe Army. These appointments must be in accordance with the \nrecommendations of the Governor of South Dakota and area Indian tribes \nto ensure that there is a strong local voice on the Trust. Second, the \nbill establishes a Missouri River Task Force, chaired by the Secretary \nof the Army and including representatives of the Department of \nInterior, Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. It also \nincludes the Missouri River Trust.\n  Once funding for this legislation becomes available, the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers will prepare an assessment of the Missouri River \nwatershed in South Dakota that reviews the impact of siltation on the \nriver, including its impact on a variety of issues: the Federal, State \nand regional economies; recreation; hydropower; fish and wildlife; and \nflood control. Based upon this assessment and other pertinent \ninformation, the Task Force will develop a plan to improve conservation \nin the Missouri River watershed; control and remove sediment from the \nMissouri River; protect recreation on the Missouri from sedimentation; \nprotect Indian and non-Indian cultural and historic sites from erosion; \nand improve erosion control along the river.\n  Once this plan is approved by the Task Force, the Task Force will \nreview proposals from local, state, federal and other entities to meet \nthe goals of the plan and recommend to the Secretary of the Army which \nof these proposals to carry out. It is the intention of this \nlegislation that the Corps contract with, or provide grants to, other \nagencies and local entities to carry out these projects. To the extent \npossible, the Secretary should ensure that approximately 30 percent of \nthe funds used to carry out these projects are spent on projects within \nIndian reservations or administered by Indian tribes. The bill \nauthorizes a total of $4 million per year for the next 10 years to \ncarry out these goals.\n  While the Task Force will have the flexibility it needs to take \nappropriate actions to restore the Missouri River,\n\n[[Page S9151]]\n\nit is my expectation that a significant effort will be made to improve \nconservation in the Missouri River watershed. Pilot projects have shown \nalready that the amount of sediment flowing into the Missouri's \ntributaries can be reduced by as much as 50 percent with appropriate \nconservation practices. If requested, the Task Force will also have the \nauthority to work with farmers across the river in Nebraska, for \nexample, to reduce the amount of sediment flowing in from the Niobrara \nRiver.\n  The conceptual underpinnings of this legislation were developed \nthrough numerous public discussions that I have held in South Dakota \nover the last year. Last January, I held a Missouri River Summit in the \ntown of Springfield with Governor Janklow, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe \nChairman Mike Jandreau, and other experts to discuss how to address \nthese critical problems. In April, Governor Janklow and I held a \nhearing in Pierre to gather public comment about proposals to restore \nthe river.\n  I have been pleased by the outpouring of support I have seen for \nefforts to restore the river. Dozens of communities such as Yankton, \nChamberlain, Springfield, Wagner, Pickstown, Mitchell and others have \npassed resolutions in support river restoration. American Rivers, a \nnational leader in river protection, has recognized this need as well. \nThe legislation passed today takes the first important step we need to \ntake to get this job done. I'd like to thank all those in South Dakota \nwho contributed to this process, and my colleagues in the Senate for \nall of their support. I look forward to our continued work together.\n  Finally, the WRDA bill includes an amendment to the Cheyenne River \nSioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and State of South Dakota \nTerrestrial Wildlife Habitat Restoration Act. This amendment requires \nthe Corps of Engineers to meet its legal responsibilities to identify \nand stabilize Indian cultural sites, clean up open dumps, and mitigate \nwildlife habitat along the river. It also makes important technical \nchanges to that law that will help ensure its smooth implementation. It \nis my hope that the Corps of Engineers will respond by working closely \nwith the tribes and the state to clean up those lands, stabilize Indian \ncultural sites, and transfer the lands along the river to the tribes \nand state in a timely manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, in a few minutes we will vote on \nfinal passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. The bill \nis a product of months of hard work by the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works and the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. \nI thank those Senators and staff members whose efforts have brought us \nwhere we are today.\n  First, I thank Ellen Stein, Rich Worthington, and Karen Bachman of my \nstaff for their dedicated effort on this bill. The number of hours they \nput in on this is unbelievable.\n  I also thank my chairman, Bob Smith, and his staff for all their \nefforts in making this bill a reality, particularly in the very \ndifficult negotiations on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration \nPlan.\n  My thanks to staff director Dave Conover, Tom Gibson, Stephanie \nDaigle, and Chelsea Henderson Maxwell for all the hard work they put in \non this piece of legislation.\n  As most successful bills in the Senate--and I am learning this pretty \nquickly as a new Member of the Senate--ours has been a product of \nbipartisanship. Senator Max Baucus and his staff, in putting this bill \ntogether, have put in long hours. I recognize the efforts of minority \nstaff director Tom Sliter, Jo-Ellen Darcy, and Peter Washburn for the \ngood work they did in putting this legislation together.\n  I also acknowledge the work of Senator Bob Graham and Senator Connie \nMack and their staff in helping to forge a consensus on the \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. I suspect they looked at \nsome of the things I was involved in as maybe getting in the way and \nholding things up, but I want them and their staff to know we were \nconscientiously trying to make this something we could all be proud of \nand get the support of the Senate. I particularly thank C.K. Lee of \nSenator Mack's staff and Catherine Cyr Ranson of Senator Graham's staff \nfor their work.\n\n  We know the essential role of the Senate Legislative Counsel's Office \nin helping to draft legislation. I thank Janine Johnson for her \ninvaluable help. Again, I think so often we take for granted the \nterrific work these folks do in putting these bills together.\n  Further, any water resources development bill involves the \nevaluations of hundreds of projects and proposals. We depend on the \nCorps of Engineers in supplying information and expertise in this \nprocess. Larry Prather and his staff at the Legislative Management \nBranch at the Corps have provided invaluable assistance to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works and to this Senator. I give \nthem the recognition they deserve.\n  As I stated in my opening remarks, when we began debate on this \nlegislation, I am proud of the work our committee and subcommittee have \naccomplished in putting together this bill. This is a disciplined bill \nthat maintains the committee's commitment to the principles of high \nstandards of engineering, economic, and environmental analysis, and \nadherence to cost-sharing principles and resistance to mission creep.\n  This has not been an easy process, and we have not always agreed on \nthe content of the legislation. But this effort has been marked \nthroughout by cooperation and compromise. To me, this was highlighted \ndramatically in the negotiation over the bill's discussion of the \nrelationship between Homestead Air Force Base and Everglades \nrestoration. I particularly thank the environmental groups--\nspecifically, the National Resource Defense Council and the Sierra \nClub--for their critical roles in this effort.\n  All in all, I think this is a well-balanced bill that provides \nauthorization to a number of needed water development projects across \nthis Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4188\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment currently at the desk be agreed to. This amendment has been \nagreed to by the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4188) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4188\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress with respect to U.S.-\nCanadian cooperation on development of conservation standards embodying \n   the principles of water conservation and resource improvement for \n making decisions concerning the withdrawal and use of water from the \n               Great Lakes Basin, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . EXPORT OF WATER FROM GREAT LAKES.\n\n       (a) Additional Finding. Section 1109(b) of the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 1962d-20(b)) is \n     amended by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as paragraphs \n     (3) and (4), and by inserting after paragraph (1) the \n     following:\n       (2) to encourage the Grant Lakes States, in consultation \n     with the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, to develop and \n     implement a mechanism that provides a common conservation \n     standard embodying the principles of water conservation and \n     resource improvement for making decisions concerning the \n     withdrawal and use of water from the Great Lakes Basin;\n       (b) Approval of Governors for Export of Water. Section \n     1109(d) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1962d-20(d)) is amended by\n       (1) inserting or exported after diverted; and\n       (2) inserting or export after diversion.\n       (c) Sense of the Congress. It is the Sense of the Congress \n     that the Secretary of State should work with the Canadian \n     Government to encourage and support the Provinces in the \n     development and implementation of a mechanism and standard \n     concerning the withdrawal and use of water from the Great \n     Lakes Basin consistent with those mechanisms and standards \n     developed by the Great Lakes States.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we have before the Senate the Water \nResources Development Act of 2000. I had great concern with the \namendment offered last week by Senator Abraham because the amendment \nsought to define terms which could have resulted in\n\n[[Page S9152]]\n\nincreased domestic diversion of Great Lakes water. This amendment, \nwhich was accepted as part of the manager's package until I asked that \nit be removed, could have led to the opposite of what we need for the \nGreat Lakes. Specially, the amendment as accepted by the managers last \nweek defined bulk fresh water as ``fresh water extracted in amounts \nintended for transportation outside the United States by commercial \nvessel or similar form of mass transportation, without further \nprocessing.'' This definition could have been interpreted as allowing \nmore diversion of Great Lakes water within the United States. This \nthreat to the Great Lakes was unacceptable and I would have strongly \nopposed the amendment with that definition.\n  I still have reservations about the amendment because some might try \nto use it to argue that the current protections against diversions of \nGreat Lakes water provided by existing law are not sufficient. We \ncurrently have an effective veto over bulk removals of Great Lakes \nwater outside of the Great Lakes basin. When we passed WRDA in 1986, we \nacted to make sure that each Great Lakes governor would have a veto \nover such removals. This protection is legally sufficient and we should \ndo nothing to imply otherwise.\n  If the states formally adopt a conservation strategy and standards, \nand the governors are currently working on those standards, such \nstandards might provide an additional safeguard to strengthen our \nposition that our current gubernatorial veto policy over bulk removals \nof Great Lakes water is consistent with the rules of international \ntrade. This conservation strategy and standards might also provide \nadditional protection against removals from the basin. But I favor \nseeking that additional strength for our position in a way which has no \npossible implication that it is necessary. While this amendment falls \nshort in this regard, once offered, it would be worse if it were not \nadopted so I will not object to it.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield the remainder of time to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the leader. First of all, there are no two people \nI respect more than the two Senators from Florida. They certainly have \ndone a very good job on the Everglades portion of the bill.\n  However, I have to get on record. I will oppose the bill because of \nthese elements that have been introduced. This is of great concern to \nme. Looking at the fiscal end, I see four reasons we should not have \nthis on the bill. First of all, if we do this, and we have already done \nit--and on the Everglades portion I pleaded with everyone it should \nhave been a stand-alone bill because it is too big to be incorporated \ninto this resources bill--this will be the first time we have actually \nhad projects without first having the Chief of the Corps of Engineers \ngive a report. That has been something we have said is necessary.\n  Second, we are looking at questionable technology. Everyone has \nadmitted this. Certainly, the chairman of the committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire, was very honest about it and \nstraightforward. He said he felt strongly enough about it that we will \nhave to try some things that perhaps have not been proven. This is \nunprecedented.\n  Third, the amount of money we are talking about is open ended. We say \nthis will be $7.8 billion in 38 years. But when we first started \nMedicare, approximately the same length of time ago, they said it would \ncost $3.4 billion, and this year it is $232 billion.\n  A major concern I have is changing a precedent that has been there \nfor 16 years; that is, that the operation and maintenance costs should \ncome from the States. Now we are absorbing those costs, or at least 50 \npercent of those costs, operation and maintenance, by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I think we are opening up something here. Yes, it is popular. There \nis a big constituency. It is open ended. It could end up costing us a \ntremendous amount of money.\n  I wanted a chance, Madam President, to explain why I have to vote \nagainst this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for the third reading and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall it \npass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nMcConnell), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas), the Senator from \nWyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Smith) the Senator from Washington (Mr. Gorton), and \nthe Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask to reconsider the vote, and on \nbehalf of the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, I move to table my \nown motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I regret I was unable to vote on \nthe final passage of the Water Resources Development Act, S. 2796. Had \nI been present, I would have voted in favor of this legislation.\n  The bill contains authorizations for several important projects for \nWashington State. I would like to thank the chairman of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Senator Bob Smith, and the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \nSenator George Voinovich, for their assistance in addressing the water \nresource needs of the Pacific Northwest. I'd like to highlight four \nprojects critical to my constituents.\n  The bill provides authorization for the Puget Sound Ecosystem \nRestoration Project, an environmental restoration program designed to \nimprove habitat for four threatened anadromous fish species in the \nPuget Sound basin. The Corps of Engineers, contingent on available \nappropriations, will be authorized to spend $20 million in cooperation \nwith local governments, tribes, and restoration groups to make existing \nCorps projects more salmon-friendly and enhance critical stream \nhabitat.\n  WRDA 2000 also includes an authorization for the Corps of Engineers \nto study and construct an erosion control project for the Shoalwater \nBay Indian Tribe. The Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe, located on a 335-\nacre reservation in southwest Washington, has experienced dramatic \nerosion events for the past several winters. During the 1998-1999 \nwinter storms alone, the tribe lost several hundred feet of shoreline. \nThese events have been particularly damaging to this small tribe of 245 \npeople, most of whom depend on the tribe's shellfish resource along the \n700 acres of tidelands.\n  Another provision will assist the communities along the Columbia, \nCowlitz, and Toutle rivers. During the early 1980s after the eruption \non Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, the Corps of Engineers engaged in \na series of emergency and congressionally authorized projects to stop \nor control the flow of sediment from Mount St. Helens into the Toutle, \nCowlitz, and Columbia rivers. Since the major Northwest Washington \nflood of 1996, which severely impacted the communities surrounding \nthese three rivers, the Corps of Engineers and county governments in \nSouthwest Washington have engaged in discussions over the level of \nflood protection to be maintained for the Mount St. Helens Sediment \nControl Project. The WRDA bill clarifies the Corps' responsibility to \nmaintain this project and provides certainty for the communities in the \nfuture.\n  Finally, the bill includes authorization for the Corps to accept \nfunding from non-federal public entities to improve and enhance the \nregulatory activities of the Corps of Engineers. Since the listing of \nthe four Puget Sound salmon species last year, the Seattle office of \nthe Corps of Engineers has been inundated with permits that requires \nadditional consultation order the Endangered Species Act. \nUnfortunately, this additional responsibility requires additional staff \nand resources to occur in a timely manner. At the beginning of this \nyear, the Seattle regulatory office had a backlog of 300 permit \napplications. Today that backlog has grown to nearly 1,000. This \nprovision will provide the Corps the additional resources it needs to \ncomply with the Endangered Species Act.\n  Once again, I would like to thank the members of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee for their assistance in providing authorization \nfor projects important to the residents of Washington state. I am \npleased the Senate passed this legislation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9181-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

WILHELM\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, late in the afternoon of this coming \nThursday, the U.S. Marine Corps will conduct a retirement ceremony at \nthe Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, VA.\n  It would not be too surprising for all who know the honoree, if those \nlegendary marines raising the flag atop Mt. Suribachi at the Iwo Jima \nMemorial and ensconced in statuary history might actually plant the \nflag, come to attention and give a proud salute to Gen. Charles E. \nWilhelm. Now retired after 35 years of service and the former commander \nof the U.S. Southern Command, Charles Wilhelm has been the epitome of \ndedication, professionalism, and pride. Simply put, he has been a \nmarine's marine. In paying tribute to General Wilhelm, my remarks are \nin keeping with the appreciation, admiration, and thanks of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, more especially the chairman and members of \nthe Armed Services Committee, all those privileged to serve on \ncommittees of jurisdiction dealing with our national defense and \nforeign policy and former marines who serve in the Congress. I think \nCharles Wilhelm was destined to serve in our Nation's sea service and \nbecome an outstanding marine in that he was born of the shores of \nAlbemarle Sound in historic Edenton, NC. He graduated from Florida \nState University and later earned a master of science degree from Salve \nRegina College in Newport, RI. He was commissioned a second lieutenant \nin 1964 and saw two tours of service in Vietnam where in the full \ncomponent of command positions, he served with distinction: as a rifle \nplatoon commander; company commander; and senior advisor to a \nVietnamese Army battalion.\n  For his heroism under fire, he was awarded the Silver Star Medal, \nBronze Star Medal with Combat V, Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V, \nand the Army Commendation Medal with Combat V. General Wilhelm's other \npersonal decorations include the Defense Service Medal with Oak Leaf \nCluster, the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Navy Commendation Medal, and Combat Action Ribbon. The last \nthing that Charley Wilhelm would want or stand for would be for some \nSenator like myself to stand on the Senate floor and list the rest of \nall of\n\n[[Page S9182]]\n\nthe assignments and tours and accomplishments that make up his \noutstanding career. But, since I am on the Senate floor and relatively \nsafe, I hope, from the well known and respected iron will of the \ngeneral, a marine, who with respect and admiration and a great deal of \ncircumspect care--certainly not in his presence--was called ``Kaiser \nWilhelm,'' I'm going to give it a try. I do so because of the immense \nrespect this man has within the ranks of all the services, U.S. and \ninternational, whohave served under his command.\n  General Wilhelm's service was universal in scope and outstanding in \nperformance: inspector-instructor to the 4th Reconnaissance Battalion, \na Reserve unit in Gulfport, Mississippi; Deputy Provost Marshal, U.S. \nNaval Forces Philippines; operations officer and executive officer, 1st \nBattalion, 1st Marines, Camp Pendleton, California; staff officer for \nLogistics, Plans and Policy Branch, Installations and Logistics \nDepartment, Headquarters Marine Corps; J-3, Headquarters, U.S. European \nCommand. Then in August of 1998, while assigned as the Assistant Chief \nof Staff for Operations of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force, \nCharles Wilhelm was promoted to brigadier general and assigned as the \nDirector of Operations, Headquarters Marine Corps. Two years later, he \nwas chosen to serve as Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for \nPolicy and Missions within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict.\n  This experience served him well, when, as commanding general of the \n1st Marine Division, General Wilhelm served as Commander, Marine Forces \nSomalia as part of Operation Restore Hope. I might add a personal \nobservation at this point in stating with Charles Wilhelm, the United \nStates has a respected resource with regard to the difficult but \nnecessary challenge our military has in meeting vital national security \ninterests and balancing those interests with the many, if not \noverwhelming, peacekeeping and humanitarian missions we find ourselves \ninvolved in today.\n  It goes without saying that in the past members of our military have \nbeen sent into peacekeeping missions where there was no peace to be \nkept. When that happens, why peacekeepers become targets and tragedy \nresults. Gen. Charles Wilhelm knows the difference and we should take \nheed. He went on to serve in a series of command positions to include: \nCommanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command; Commander, \nU.S. Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic; Commander, U.S. Marine Corps \nForces, South; Commanding General, Second Marine Expeditionary Force; \nCommanding General, Marine Strike Force Atlantic.\n  General Wilhelm assumed duties at U.S. Southern Command in September, \nin 1997 where he served until his retirement just a few weeks ago. As \ncommander of the U.S. Southern Command, General Wilhelm devoted his \nenormous personal energy--and boy does he have that--his visionary \nleadership and his remarkable diplomatic skills to achieving vital \nnational security objectives and strengthening democratic institutions \nand governance--and thereby individual freedom and economic \nopportunity--throughout the Southern Hemisphere.\n  General Wilhelm's personal decorations are testimony to his valor and \nbravery. He is indeed recognized within the U.S. Marine Corps as a \nwarrior among warriors. But, he is also part military and political \ntheorist, diplomat, and humanitarian. He enhanced civilian control of \nmilitary institutions throughout Latin America; he improved \nmultilateral relations among the 32 nations--that is 32 nations and \n12.5 million square miles stretching from Antarctica to the Florida \nKeys.\n  Concurrently, General Wilhelm oversaw the integration of the \nCaribbean into the command's theater, supervised the implementation of \nthe 1977 Panama Canal treaties--no small feat--he energized United \nStates Interagency efforts to counter the flow of illegal narcotics \ninto the United States and finally, sought and obtained congressional \nsupport for the U.S. assistance plan for Colombia's counter drug \nprogram. While doing all of this in his 3 year stint, he restructured \nhis command's architecture and theater engagement strategy to position \nthe command to meet the challenges of the 21st century. I am tempted to \nsay that in the midst of all this he rested on the 7th day but in fact \nhe did not.\n  As chairman of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee--that is the subcommittee of jurisdiction over \nvirtually all of the missions within the Southern Command--I want the \nrecord to show that the general accomplished his goals at precisely the \nsame time the Southern Command suffered tremendous budget and \ninfrastructure challenges. That is the nicest way I can put it. He \nalways said he did not have problems; he had challenges. That was due \nto U.S. involvement in the Balkans and the drawdown of the tremendous \nbudget and essential infrastructure support to the general's mission \nand the mission of the Southern Command.\n  I do not know how, quite frankly, he accomplished his tasks. I might \nadd, from my personal standpoint, in terms of our immediate and \npressing challenges with regard to refugees, more than in the Balkans, \nthe problems and challenges of immigration, drugs, terrorism, trade, \nthe commonality of interests within our own hemisphere, and our \ndomestic energy supply--we now get roughly 17 to 18 percent of our \nenergy supply from Venezuela; there are real problems in Venezuela--our \nvital national interests, General Wilhelm has tried his very best to \nalert the Pentagon, the administration, and the Congress to these \nconcerns and suggest rational and reasonable policy options. His advice \nis sound, based upon years of experience and hard, hard work. The value \nand worth of his policy recommendations, I will predict, and his \ncornerstone efforts to build on that success will be proven correct.\n  Carol Rosenberg of the Miami Herald newspaper recently captured what \nI am trying to say in an article that accurately describes the \nsuccesses General Wilhelm has achieved and the character of the man as \nwell.\n  Ms. Rosenberg simply put it this way:\n\n       A Black Hawk helicopter landed in the center of a crude \n     baseball diamond on a recent morning, delivering a four-star \n     U.S. Marine general bearing baseballs and money.\n       Chopper blades were still kicking dust when hundreds of \n     residents crowded around, some sporting American League style \n     uniforms donated by a California bike shop owner--\n\n  At the request of the general.\n\n       Then a nine-man Nicaraguan band pulled out sheet music and \n     played The Star Spangled Banner for the general.\n\n  According to the article, he said:\n\n       This is why I love this job. I've never heard it played any \n     better.\n\n  His career stretches back to Vietnam, as noted by Ms. Rosenberg. She \nwent on to point out in her article the general has been part military \nstrategist and diplomat. She outlined his leadership, as I said before, \nin the tremendous U.S. humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Mitch and \nother medical and disaster recovery missions demonstrating the United \nStates bid to be a good neighbor and an ally in the Americas and the \nexample of a civilian-controlled military to the emerging democracies.\n  In the article, Ms. Rosenberg also pointed out that last month \nGeneral Wilhelm paid a last visit to Managua, Nicaragua, and stood \nproudly as the Nicaragua Army chief, General Javier Carrion, draped him \nwith a blue and white sash, the army's highest honor in Nicaragua, for \n``building respectful relations'' between the two countries.\n  For a decade, our Nation was allied with the Nicaraguan Army's \nadversary, i.e. the Contras, in a 10-year-old civil war. According to \nveteran observers, only 2 years ago, the tension and suspicion was \nstill so thick between the two countries that you could cut it. Last \nmonth, through the efforts of one man, General Wilhelm received a medal \nfor building respect between the two nations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article by Carol Rosenberg in the \nMiami Herald be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Sept. 3, 2000]\n\n                Southcom General Bows Out After 37 Years\n\n\n          politics, strategy--and a dash of baseball diplomacy\n\n                          (By Carol Rosenberg)\n\n       Boaco, Nicaragua--A Black Hawk helicopter landed in the \n     center of a crude baseball diamond on a recent morning, \n     delivering\n\n[[Page S9183]]\n\n     a four-star U.S. Marine general bearing baseballs and money.\n       Chopper blades were still kicking up dust when hundreds of \n     curious residents crowded around, some sporting American \n     League-style uniforms donated by a California bike shop \n     owner. Then, a nine-man Nicaraguan band pulled out sheet \n     music and played The Star Spangled Banner for the general and \n     his entourage--colonels and bodyguards, fixers and escort \n     officers.\n       ``This is why I love this job. I've never heard it played \n     better,'' confided Gen. Charles Wilhelm, whose 37-year Marine \n     career stretches back to Vietnam.\n       Part military strategist, part diplomat, Wilhelm, 59 \n     retires this week from a three-year tour of duty as chief of \n     the Southern Command, the Pentagon's Miami-based nerve center \n     for Latin America and the Caribbean, staffed by about 1,000 \n     service members and civilians.\n       Southcom, as it is called, is in charge of U.S. military \n     activities across 12.5 million square miles stretching from \n     Antarctica to the Florida Keys. Based in Panama for decades, \n     it evolved out of U.S. construction of the Panama Canal and \n     moved to Miami in 1997, as Wilhelm took charge. The move was \n     part of a phased withdrawal to prepare for this past New \n     Year's retreat from the Canal Zone.\n       Among its most high-profile missions: the 1989 seizure of \n     Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega. Southcom also directed \n     U.S. support for the Nicaraguan contras in the 1980s and has \n     for years sent doctors and other military experts for joint-\n     training missions in Latin America.\n       Now is a pivotal time: Congress has just approved $1.3 \n     billion in U.S. aid for Plan Colombia--an ambitious campaign \n     to fight the drug trade in the nation that supplies the bulk \n     of the cocaine distributed in the United States. The effort--\n     the United States' most ambitious military activity in the \n     Americas in years--provides for 60 helicopters, 500 U.S. \n     troops, and 300 civilian contractors.\n       And Wilhelm, an architect by virtue of his position at \n     Southcom, is one of its greatest champions.\n       Yet, as the recent dabble in baseball diplomacy shows, the \n     job of Southcom's commander in chief is a curious blend of \n     politics and strategy. A California congressman had asked \n     Southcom to rebuild the baseball diamond, damaged by \n     flooding, at the request of a constituent who had once played \n     baseball in the area.\n       But after crunching numbers back in Doral, Wilhelm \n     concluded the cost of Operation Field of Dreams would be too \n     high: $250,000 to move in heavy equipment, as unreasonable \n     1.25 percent of his discretionary budget. So, instead, he \n     brought three-dozen baseballs, a $300 donation, and gave \n     townspeople a first-hand look at U.S. helicopter technology, \n     carefully monitored by U.S. Army flight crews watching to \n     make sure nobody made off with a removable part.\n       And he added the baseball diamond to a Southcom ``to-do'' \n     list, just in case future relief efforts bring the necessary \n     equipment and U.S. forces back to Boaco.\n       The last August visit illustrated how much Southcom has \n     changed since Wilhelm inherited the command. Now entrenched \n     in Miami, Southcom today is leaner than its huge outpost in \n     Panama of the 1990s, and with a curious mosaic of military \n     relations.\n       Thanks to U.S. humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Mitch, \n     it has the best relationship in years with Nicaragua and a \n     patchwork of mini bases for drug hunting and humanitarian \n     relief missions in the Caribbean and Central America. U.S. \n     troops that before Wilhelm's arrival swelled to 11,000-plus \n     in Southcom's 12.5 million square miles of territory--most at \n     sprawling bases in Panama--have been largely reassigned to \n     the continental United States.\n       Now Southcom has a permanent presence of 2,479 soldiers, \n     sailors and air force personnel, most in Puerto Rico, and \n     relies on periodic training exercises of reservists and \n     National Guard members to carry out a key part of the \n     command's activities--medical and disaster recovery missions \n     offered to host countries by embassies. They demonstrate \n     Washington's bid to be a good neighbor in the Americas and \n     illustrate the grandeur of a civilian-controlled military, a \n     good example for emerging democracies.\n       On the down side, Washington has been unable so far to \n     persuade Venezuela to permit flights over the country for \n     U.S. drug-hunting operations--a significant blind spot in the \n     hemispheric war on narcotrafficking. U.S. aircraft patrolling \n     the skies over Latin America now have to fly around \n     Venezuela, adding as much as 90 minutes to their missions in \n     their pursuit of drug runners, mostly from Colombia.\n       Nor has U.S. diplomacy convinced Panama to accept a \n     permanent military presence, for drug operations or any other \n     U.S. activities. The last U.S. forces departed on New Year's \n     Eve and sentiments are not yet ripe for a return of U.S. \n     military personnel.\n       In Haiti, successive exercises and training programs by \n     Southcom have not been able to meaningfully enhance the rule \n     of law, and U.S. drug interdiction monitors, who see it as a \n     trans-shipment spot, have not been able to enlist local \n     authorities there as allies in their anti-drug campaign. \n     Cooperation by foreign police and militaries is key to the \n     U.S. war on drug trafficking. But drug monitors say they have \n     not found partners in Port-au-Prince, whose security forces \n     are still in chaos, to make seizures and arrests when they \n     detect drug smugglers.\n\n\n                             No funding yet\n\n       And Wilhelm has yet to win congressional funding to \n     permanently base Southcom in Miami, now in an industrial park \n     not far from the airport, a $40 million measure. Wilhelm's \n     tenure ends Friday with a change-of-command ceremony presided \n     over by Defense Secretary William Cohen. If Congress confirms \n     President Clinton's choice of Marine Lt. Gen. Peter Pace in \n     time, it will be only the second time in history that a \n     Marine will head Southcom, a job traditionally held by the \n     Army. Wilhelm will wind up his Marine career by moving back \n     to suburban Washington, D.C. under mandatory retirement, \n     which only could have been averted by promotion to the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff--or a transfer to another four-star post--for \n     example, overseeing military operations in Europe or the \n     Persian Gulf.\n       But, Wilhelm said, he aspires to re-emerge in civilian life \n     as a player in Latin America--perhaps as a troubleshooter, \n     capitalizing on his civilian and military contacts throughout \n     the Americas. He espouses a fascination with the region.\n       ``It interests me for a lot of very good reasons--and \n     they're not all altruistic,'' he said in a recent interview.\n       ``I see our future prosperity in the Americas, not in the \n     Far East . . .  Forty-six percent of our exports flow within \n     the Americas, 28 percent to the FAR East and 26 percent to \n     Europe and I see that balance shifting even more to the \n     Americas at least over the first 25 years of this century. So \n     I think the future prosperity of the United States is \n     inextricably linked to the Americas.''\n       Last month's two-day trip to Nicaragua and Honduras--\n     Wilhelm's last on the road aside from Wednesday's trip to \n     Colombia with President Clinton--gave a glimpse into the \n     hemisphere-hopping style of work he seems to relish.\n       In Tegucigalpa, he met President Carlos Flores and then \n     choppered to Honduras' Soto Cano Air Base, where the U.S. has \n     its only permanent military outpost in the region. With a \n     single landing strip stocked with Chinook and Black Hawk \n     helicopters, it is home to about 600 Air Force and Army \n     personnel who mostly support disaster relief and drug \n     operations. There he took part in a promotion ceremony, and \n     gave U.S. soldiers and airmen a pep talk.\n       ``When I call, you haul--no whimpering or whining. That's \n     what service is all about,'' said Wilhelm.\n\n\n                             ``respectful''\n\n       In Managua, he stood surrounded by dozens of local \n     reporters and camera crews as Nicaraguan Army Chief Gen. \n     Javier Carrion draped him in a blue and white sash--the \n     army's highest honor--``for building respectful relations'' \n     between the armies.\n       Army Col. Charles Jacoby, Wilhelm's executive officer, was \n     in awe.\n       In early 1998, Jacoby came to Managua as head of a mission \n     to negotiate the return of an old B-26 aircraft that crashed \n     in the jungle after flying missions from a clandestine CIA \n     airfield for the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion. The tension \n     and suspicion was so thick, you could cut it.\n       Months later, Hurricane Mitch cut a swath of destruction \n     through Central America. Wilhelm sent thousands of U.S. \n     forces to rebuild bridges and schools, clinics and roads--a \n     goodwill gesture that broke the ice in chilly relations with \n     the Nicaraguan Army. For a decade, Washington had allied with \n     the army's adversary, the contras, in a decade-long civil war \n     that ended in 1990.\n       ``To see him standing here today getting an award is just \n     unbelievable,'' Jacoby said moments before a Nicaraguan \n     officer served champagne.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am not really surprised at this man's \nmany accomplishments. Several years ago, our distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Lott, took an overdue codel to Latin and Central \nAmerica. I was privileged to go. On one of our first stops, we were \nbriefed on the overall situation, again within the 32-nation sprawling \nSouthern Command. Pressed for time, General Charles Wilhelm gave one of \nthe most complete, pertinent, and helpful briefings I have ever heard. \nI have been a Wilhelm fan ever since, and I certainly value his advice \nand his suggestions.\n  General Wilhelm stated our vital national security interests very \nwell when he said the following:\n\n       I see our future prosperity in the Americas, not in the Far \n     East. . . . Forty-six percent of our exports flow within the \n     Americas, 28 percent to the Far East and 26 percent to \n     Europe. I see the balance shifting even more to the Americas \n     over the first 25 years of this century. The future \n     prosperity of the United States is linked to the Americas.\n\n  Throughout his career as a United States Marine, General Charles \nWilhelm demonstrated uncompromising character, discerning wisdom, and a \nsincere, selfless sense of duty to his Marines and members of other \nservices assigned to his numerous joint commands.\n  His powerful leadership inspired his Marines to success, no matter \nwhat the task. All Marines everywhere join me in saying to the general: \nThank you\n\n[[Page S9184]]\n\nand well done. The results have guaranteed United States security in \nthis hemisphere and throughout the world.\n  In behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, our \ncongratulations to him and to his wife Valerie and his son Elliot on \nthe completion of a long and distinguished career, and I trust more to \ncome. God bless this great American and Marine.

Mr. President, last week the Senate unanimously approved \nfor ratification the International Labor Organization Convention 176 on \nmine safety and health. I thank the Chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, for his \ncommittee's efforts in expeditiously approving this convention. I also \nthank the mining state senators from New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Montana, \nKentucky, Nevada, Idaho, and my own West Virginia, who joined me in \nchampioning this convention.\n  Coal mining has long been recognized as one of the most dangerous \noccupations in the world. In the United States, the frequency and \nmagnitude of coal mining disasters and intolerable working conditions \nin the 19th century created a public furor for mine health and safety \nlaws. The Pennsylvania legislature was the first to pass significant \nmine safety legislation in 1870, which was later followed by the first \nfederal mine safety law that was passed by Congress in 1891. Over the \nyears, these state and federal laws were combined into what are today \nthe most comprehensive mine safety and health standards in the world. \nSince the beginning of the 20th century, mine-related deaths have \ndecreased from 3,242 deaths in 1907, the highest mining fatality rate \never recorded in the United States, to 80 deaths in 1998, the lowest \nmining fatality rate ever recorded in the United States.\n  These numbers stand in stark contrast to the recorded fatalities in \nother parts of the world. In China, for example, the government \nrecently reported 2,730 mining fatalities in the first six months of \nthis year. That is more than thirty times the number of fatalities \nrecorded in the United States for all of 1999. And, this number does \nnot even include metal and nonmetal mining fatalities in China.\n  Many countries in the world have national laws specific to mine \nsafety and health. Yet, in most of these countries, the laws are often \ntimes inadequate. In many South American and Asian countries, national \nlaws have not kept pace with the introduction of new mining equipment, \nsuch as long-wall mining machines and large surface mining equipment, \nwhich create new hazards for miners. Similarly, many of these countries \ndo not require employers to inform miners of workplace hazards or allow \nfor workers to refuse work because of dangerous conditions without fear \nof penalties. What is worse is that even if these countries do have \nadequate laws, in most cases, the inexperience and limited resources of \ntheir mine inspectors often means that egregious violations by foreign \ncoal companies are never penalized, encouraging repeat violations.\n  As a result, miners in developing countries are exposed to risks and \nhazards that claim up to 15,000 lives each year. Severe mine disasters \ninvolving large loss of life continue to occur throughout Europe, \nAfrica and Asia. The most recent accident to gain worldwide attention \noccurred in Ukraine in March of this year, when 80 miners were killed \nafter a methane gas explosion because of an improperly ventilated air \nshaft.\n\n  The United States competes against these countries with notoriously \nlow mine safety standards in the global energy market. However, the \ndisparity in mine safety and health standards with which foreign and \ndomestic coal companies must comply, places U.S. coal companies at a \ndisadvantage by allowing foreign coal companies to export coal at a \ncheaper cost. This has contributed to a decrease in U.S. coal exports \nin the global energy market. According to the Department of Energy, \nU.S. coal exports to Europe and Asia have decreased from 78 million \ntons to 63 million tons between 1998 and 1999. The Administration \nprojects that U.S. coal exports will continue to decrease to \napproximately 58 million tons by 2020. This reduction in coal exports \nfalls on an industry that is already experiencing a steady decrease in \nthe number of active coal mining operations and employment in the \nUnited States. Faced with strong competition from other coal exporting \ncountries and limited growth in import demand from Europe and Asia, the \nUnited States needs to level the playing field as much as possible with \nits foreign competitors, and should encourage foreign governments to \nadopt safety and health standards similar to those in the United \nStates.\n  Accordingly, representatives from the National Mining Association, \nthe United Mine Workers of America, and the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration helped to draft a treaty in 1995 that would establish \nminimum mine safety and health standards for the international \ncommunity. This treaty was based on the federal mine safety and health \nlaws in the United States. Convention 176 was adopted by the General \nConference of the International Labor Organization in 1995, and would \ndesignate that a competent authority monitor and regulate safety and \nhealth in mines and require foreign coal companies to comply with \nnational safety and health laws. It would also encourage cooperation \nbetween employers and employees to promote safety and health in mines.\n  By encouraging other countries to ratify Convention 176, the United \nStates can increase the competitiveness of U.S. coal prices in the \nglobal market place, while, at the same time, increasing protections \nfor miners in all parts of the world. In addition, the United States \ncan build a new market for itself where it can provide training and \nsuperior mine safety equipment to nations struggling to increase their \nmine safety standards.\n  The United States prides itself on having the safest mines in the \nworld, while, at the same time, remaining a competitive force in the \nglobal energy market. This convention embraces the belief that other \ncountries would do well to follow the U.S. example. I support this \nconvention, and applaud the Senate for its approval.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9184-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9184-S9187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RICHARD GARDNER URGES HIGHER BUDGET PRIORITY FOR U.S. FOREIGN POLICY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in an article published in the July/\nAugust issue of Foreign Affairs, Richard Gardner argues persuasively \nthat at this time of record prosperity, America must commit itself to \nan increased budget for foreign policy in order to protect our vital \ninterests and carry out our commitments around the world. He argues \nthat America's security interests must be protected not only by \nmaintaining a superior military force, but also by focusing on other \ninternational issues that are essential to our national security, such \nas global warming, AIDS, drug-trafficking, and terrorism. He asserts \nthat to achieve these goals, foreign aid must be given higher spending \npriority, and the current trend of decreased funding for our \ninternational commitments must be reversed.\n  Mr. Gardner is well known to many of us in Congress. For many years, \nand under many Administrations, he has served our nation well as a \ndistinguished diplomat. He skillfully represented U.S. interests \nabroad, and has made valuable contributions to advancing America's \nforeign policy objectives. He continues this important work today, \nserving as a Professor of Law and International Organization at \nColumbia University and a member of the President's Advisory Committee \non Trade Policy and Negotiations.\n  I believe that Ambassador Gardner's article will be of interest to \nall of us in Congress, and I ask unanimous consent that it may be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Foreign Affairs, July/August 2000]\n\n    The One Percent Solution--Shirking the Cost of World Leadership\n\n                        (By Richard N. Gardner)\n\n       A dangerous game is being played in Washington with \n     America's national security. Call it the ``one percent \n     solution''--the fallacy that a successful U.S. foreign policy \n     can be carried out with barely one percent of the federal \n     budget. Unless the next president moves urgently to end this \n     charade, he will\n\n[[Page S9185]]\n\n     find himself in a financial straitjacket that frustrates his \n     ability to promote American interests and values in an \n     increasingly uncertain world.\n       Ultimately, the only way to end the dangerous one percent \n     solution game is to develop a new national consensus that \n     sees the international affairs budget as part of the national \n     security budget--because the failure to build solid \n     international partnerships to treat the causes of conflict \n     today will mean costly military responses tomorrow. Those who \n     play the one percent solution game do not understand a post-\n     Cold War world in which a host of international problems now \n     affects Americans' domestic welfare, from financial crises \n     and the closing of markets to global warming, AIDS, \n     terrorism, drug trafficking, and the spread of weapons of \n     mass destruction. Solving these problems will require \n     leadership, and that will cost.\n\n\n                        money changes everything\n\n       If this all sounds exaggerated, consider the way the one \n     percent solution game is being played this year, when America \n     has a GDP of nearly $10 trillion and a federal budget of over \n     $1.8 trillion. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asked \n     the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for $25 billion in \n     the budget for fiscal year (FY) 2001, which begins October 1, \n     for the so-called 150 Account, which covers the nonmilitary \n     costs of protecting U.S. national security. OMB cut that \n     figure to $22.8 billion to fit President Clinton's commitment \n     to continued fiscal responsibility and limited budgetary \n     growth.\n       The congressional budget committees cut it further to $20 \n     billion, or $2.3 billion less than the $22.3 billion approved \n     for FY 2000. At the same time, the budget committees raised \n     defense spending authority for FY 2001 to $310.8 billion--\n     $4.5 billion more than the administration requested.\n       Clinton and Albright strongly protested the congressional \n     cuts. They will undoubtedly protest even more when the \n     appropriations committees of the Senate and the House divide \n     up the meager 150 Account pie into inadequate slices for \n     essential foreign affairs functions. At the end of this \n     congressional session, $1 billion or so of the foreign \n     affairs cuts may be restored if Clinton threatens to veto the \n     appropriation bills--not easy to do in an election year. Of \n     course, the next president could make another familiar move \n     in the one percent solution game--ask for a small \n     supplemental appropriation to restore the previous cuts. But \n     if the past is any guide, Congress will do its best to force \n     the next administration to accommodate most of its \n     supplemental spending within the existing budget. (This year, \n     for instance, Congress resisted additional spending to pay \n     for the U.S. share of multilateral projects such as more U.N. \n     peacekeeping and debt reduction for the poorest countries.)\n       Even more discouraging for the next president are the \n     projections for the 150 Account that the Clinton \n     administration and the budget committees have presented as \n     spending guidelines until 2005. The president's projected \n     foreign affairs spending request of $24.5 billion for 2005 \n     hardly keeps up with inflation, and the budget committees' \n     target of $20 billion means a decrease of nearly 20 percent \n     from FY 2000, adjusted for inflation. By contrast, the \n     administration's projected defense spending authority goes up \n     to $331 billion in FY 2005; the budget committees' defense \n     projection is comparable. Thus the ratio of military spending \n     to foreign affairs spending would continue to increase in the \n     next few years, rising to more than 16 to 1.\n       The percentage of the U.S. budget devoted to international \n     affairs has been declining for four decades. In the 1960s, \n     the 150 Account made up 4 percent of the federal budget; in \n     the 1970s, it averaged about 2 percent; during the first half \n     of the 1990s, it went down to 1 percent, with only a slight \n     recovery in FYs 1999 and 2000. The international affairs \n     budget is now about 20 percent less in today's dollars than \n     it was on average during the late 1970s and the 1980s.\n       A nation's budget, like that of a corporation or an \n     individual, reflects its priorities. Both main political \n     parties share a broad consensus that assuring U.S. national \n     security in the post-Cold War era requires a strong military \n     and the willingness to use it to defend important U.S. \n     interests and values. The Clinton administration and Congress \n     have therefore supported recent increases in the defense \n     budget to pay for more generous salaries and a better quality \n     of life in order to attract and retain quality personnel; \n     fund necessary research, training, and weapons maintenance; \n     and procure new and improved weapons systems. Politicians and \n     military experts may differ on the utility and cost-\n     effectiveness of particular weapons, but after the catch-up \n     defense increases of the last several years, Washington \n     appears to be on an agreed course to keep the defense budget \n     growing modestly to keep up with the rate of inflation.\n       Why then, at a time of unprecedented prosperity and budget \n     surpluses, can Washington not generate a similar consensus on \n     the need to adequately fund the nonmilitary component of \n     national security? Apparently spending on foreign affairs \n     is not regarded as spending for national security. \n     Compounding the problem is Washington's commendable new \n     commitment to fiscal responsibility after years of huge \n     budget deficits--a commitment reflected in the tight cap \n     that Congress placed on discretionary spending in 1997. \n     Even though that cap is already being violated and will \n     undoubtedly be revised upward this year, the new \n     bipartisan agreement to lock up the Social Security \n     surplus to meet the retirement costs of the baby boomers \n     will continue to make for difficult budget choices and \n     leave limited room for increased spending elsewhere, \n     foreign affairs included.\n       The non-Social Security surplus--estimated at something \n     more than $700 billion during the decade 2000-2010--will \n     barely cover some modest tax cuts while keeping Medicare \n     solvent and paying for some new spending on health care and \n     education. Fortunately, higher-than-expected GDP growth may \n     add $20-30 billion per year to the non-Social Security \n     surplus, affording some additional budgetary wiggle room. \n     Even so, that windfall could be entirely eaten up by larger \n     tax cuts, more domestic spending, or unanticipated defense \n     budget increases--unless foreign affairs spending becomes a \n     higher priority now.\n       More money is not a substitute for an effective foreign \n     policy, but an effective foreign policy will simply be \n     impossible without more money. Foreign policy experts \n     therefore disdain ``boring budget arithmetic'' at their \n     peril.\n       The State Department recently set forth seven fundamental \n     national interests in its foreign affairs strategic plan: \n     national security; economic prosperity and freer trade; \n     protection of U.S. citizens abroad and safeguarding of U.S. \n     borders; the fight against international terrorism, crime, \n     and drug trafficking; the establishment and consolidation of \n     democracies and the upholding of human rights; the provision \n     of humanitarian assistance to victims of crisis and disaster; \n     and finally, the improvement of the global environment, \n     stabilization of world population growth, and protection of \n     human health. This is a sensible list, but in the political \n     climate of today's Washington, few in the executive branch or \n     Congress dare ask how much money will really be required to \n     support it. Rather, the question usually asked is how much \n     the political traffic will bear.\n       Going on this way will force unacceptable foreign policy \n     choices--either adequate funding for secure embassies and \n     modern communications systems for diplomats or adequate \n     funding for U.N. peacekeeping in Kosovo, East Timor, and \n     Africa; either adequate funding for the Middle East peace \n     process or adequate funding to safeguard nuclear weapons and \n     materials in Russia; either adequate funding for family \n     planning to control world population growth or adequate \n     funding to save refugees and displaced persons. The world's \n     greatest power need not and should not accept a situation in \n     which it has to make these kinds of choices.\n\n\n                           The state of state\n\n       Ideally, a bipartisan, expert study would tell us what a \n     properly funded foreign affairs budget would look like. In \n     the absence of such a study, consider the following a rough \n     estimate of the increases now required in the two main parts \n     of the 150 Account. The first part is the State Department \n     budget, which includes not only the cost of U.S. diplomacy \n     but also U.S. assessed contributions to international \n     organizations and peacekeeping. The second part is the \n     foreign operations budget, which includes bilateral \n     development aid, the bilateral economic support fund for \n     special foreign policy priorities, bilateral military aid, \n     and contributions to voluntary U.N. programs and \n     multilateral development banks.\n       Take State's budget first. The United States maintains 250 \n     embassies and other posts in 160 countries. Far from being \n     rendered less important by the end of the Cold War or today's \n     instant communications, these diplomatic posts and the State \n     Department that directs them are more essential then ever in \n     promoting the seven fundamental U.S. foreign policy interests \n     identified above.\n       Ambassadors and their staffs have to play multiple roles \n     today--as the ``eyes and ears'' of the president and \n     secretary of state, advocates for U.S. policies in the upper \n     reaches of the host government, resourceful negotiators, and \n     intellectual, educational, and cultural emissaries in public \n     diplomacy with key interest groups, opinion leaders, and the \n     public at large. As Albright put it in recent congressional \n     testimony, the Foreign Service, the Civil Service, and the \n     Foreign nationals serving in U.S. overseas posts contribute \n     daily to the welfare of the American people ``through the \n     dangers they help contain; the crimes they help prevent; the \n     deals they help close; the rights they help protect, and the \n     travelers they just plain help.''\n       Following the tragic August 1998 bombings of American \n     embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the secretary of \n     state, with the support of the president and Congress, \n     established the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel (OPAP), \n     composed of current and former diplomats and private-sector \n     representatives, to recommend improvements in America's \n     overseas diplomatic establishment. ``The United States \n     overseas presence, which has provided the essential \n     underpinnings of U.S. foreign policy for many decades, is \n     near a state of crisis,'' the panel warned. ``Insecure and \n     often decrepit facilities, obsolete information technology, \n     outmoded administrative and human resources practices, poor \n     allocation of resources, and competition from the private \n     sector for talented staff threaten to cripple America's \n     overseas capability, with far-reaching consequences for \n     national security and prosperity.''\n       The OPAP report focused more on reforms than on money, but \n     many of its recommendations have price tags. The report\n\n[[Page S9186]]\n\n     called for $1.3 billion per year for embassy construction and \n     security upgrades--probably $100 million too little, since an \n     earlier and more authoritative study by the Accountability \n     Review Boards under former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair \n     William Crowe proposed $1.4 billion annually for that \n     purpose. OPAP also called for another $330 million over \n     several years to provide unclassified and secure Internet and \n     e-mail information networks linking all U.S. agencies and \n     overseas posts.\n       Moreover, OPAP proposed establishing an interagency panel \n     chaired by the secretary of state to evaluate the size, \n     location, and composition of America's overseas presence. \n     Visitors who see many people in U.S. embassies often do not \n     realize that the State Department accounts for only 42 \n     percent of America's total overseas personnel; the Defense \n     Department accounts for 37 percent, and more than two dozen \n     other agencies such as the Agency for International \n     Development and the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and \n     Justice make up the rest. If one includes the foreign \n     nationals hired as support staff, State Department personnel \n     in some large U.S. embassies are less than 15 percent of the \n     employees, and many of them are administrators.\n       The State Department's FY 2001 budget of $6.8 billion \n     provide $3.2 billion for administering foreign affairs. Of \n     that, even after the East Africa bombings, only $1.1 billion \n     will go toward embassy construction and security upgrades, \n     even though $1.4 billion is needed. Moreover, only $17 \n     million is provided for new communications infrastructure, \n     although $330 million is needed. Almost nothing is included \n     to fill a 700-position shortfall of qualified personnel. The \n     State Department therefore requires another $500 million just \n     to meet its minimal needs.\n       The FY 2001 State Department budget contains a small but \n     inadequate increase--from $204 million in FY 2000 to $225 \n     million--for the educational and cultural exchanges formerly \n     administered by the U.S. Information Agency. Most of this \n     money will go to the Fulbright academic program and the \n     International Visitors Program, which brings future foreign \n     leaders in politics, the media, trade unions, and other \n     nongovernmental organizations (NGOS) to meet with their \n     American counterparts. These valuable and cost-effective \n     exchanges have been slashed from their 1960s and 1970s \n     heights. A near-doubling of these programs' size--with \n     disproportionate increases for exchanges with especially \n     important countries such as Russia and China--would clearly \n     serve U.S. national security interests. A sensible annual \n     budget increase for educational and cultural exchanges would \n     be $200 million.\n       The budget includes $946 million for assessed contributions \n     to international organizations, of which $300 million is for \n     the U.N. itself and $380 million more is for U.N.-affiliated \n     agencies such as the International Labor Organization, the \n     World Health Organization, the World Health Organization, the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency, and the war crimes \n     tribunals for Rwanda and the Balkans. Other bodies such \n     as NATO, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) \n     account for the rest.\n       Richard Holbrooke, the able American ambassador to the \n     U.N., is currently deep in difficult negotiations to reduce \n     the assessed U.S. share of the regular U.N. budget and the \n     budgets of major specialized U.N. agencies from 25 percent to \n     22 percent--a precondition required by the Helms-Biden \n     legislation for paying America's U.N. arrears. If Holbrooke \n     succeeds, U.S. contributions to international organizations \n     will drop slightly.\n       But this reduction will be more than offset by the need to \n     pay for modest U.N. budget increases. The zero nominal growth \n     requirement that Congress slapped on U.N. budgets is now \n     becoming counterproductive. To take just one example, the \n     U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations is now short at \n     least 100 staffers, which leaves it ill-prepared to handle \n     the increased number and scale of peacekeeping operations. If \n     Washington could agree to let U.N. budgets rise by inflation \n     plus a percent or two in the years ahead and to channel the \n     increase to programs of particular U.S. interest, America \n     would have more influence and the U.N. would be more \n     effective. Some non-U.N. organizations, such as NATO, the \n     OECD, and the WTO, also require budget increases beyond the \n     rate of inflation to do their jobs properly. Moreover, \n     America should rejoin the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and \n     Cultural Organization (UNESCO), given the growing foreign \n     policy importance of its concerns and the role that new \n     communications technology can play in helping developing \n     countries. The increased annual cost of UNESCO membership \n     ($70 million) and of permitting small annual increases in the \n     U.N.'s and other international organizations' budgets ($30 \n     million) comes to another $100 million.\n       Selling this will take leadership. In particular, a \n     showdown is brewing with Congress over the costs of U.N. \n     peacekeeping. After reaching a high of 80,000 in 1993 and \n     then dropping to 13,000 in 1998, the number of U.N. \n     peacekeepers is rising again to 30,000 or more as a result of \n     new missions in Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone, and the \n     proposed mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n     (DRC). So the State Department had to ask Congress for $739 \n     million for U.N. peacekeeping in the FY 2001 budget, compared \n     to the $500 million it received in FY 2000. (The White House \n     also requested a FY 2000 budget supplement of $143 million, \n     which has not yet been approved.) But even these sums fall \n     well short of what Washington will have to pay for \n     peacekeeping this year and next. In Kosovo, the mission is \n     seriously underfunded; the U.N. peacekeeping force in \n     southern Lebanon will have to be beefed up after an Israeli \n     withdrawal; and new or expanded missions could be required \n     for conflicts in Sierra Leone, Ethiopia-Eritrea, and the DRC. \n     So total U.N. peacekeeping costs could rise to $3.5-4 billion \n     per year. With the United States paying for 25 percent of \n     peacekeeping (although it is still assessed at the rate of 31 \n     percent, which is unduly high), these new challenges could \n     cost taxpayers at least $200 million per year more than the \n     amount currently budgeted. Washington should, of course, \n     watch the number, cost, and effectiveness of U.N. \n     peacekeeping operations, but the existing and \n     proposed operations serve U.S. interest and must be \n     adequately funded.\n       Add up all these sums and one finds that the State \n     Departments budget needs an increase of $1 billion, for a \n     total of $7.9 billion per year.\n\n\n                            a decent respect\n\n       The Clinton administration has asked for $15.1 billion for \n     the foreign operations budget for FY 2001--the second part of \n     the 150 Account. Excluding $3.7 billion for military aid and \n     $1 billion for the Export-Import Bank, that leaves about \n     $10.l4 billion in international development and humanitarian \n     assistance. This includes various categories of bilateral \n     aid: $2.1 billion for sustainable development; $658 million \n     for migration and refugee assistance; $830 million to promote \n     free-market democracies and secure nuclear materials in the \n     countries of the former Soviet Union; and $610 million of \n     support for eastern Europe and the Balkans. It also covers \n     about $1.4 billion for multilateral development banks, \n     including $800 million for the International Development \n     Association, the World Bank affiliate for lending to the \n     poorest countries. Another $350 million goes to international \n     organizations and programs such as the U.N. Development \n     Program ($90 million), the U.N. Children's Fund ($110 \n     million), the U.N. Population Fund ($25 million), and the \n     U.N. Environment Program ($10 million).\n       The $10.4 billion for development and humanitarian aid is \n     just 0.11 percent of U.S. GDP and 0.60 percent of federal \n     budget outlays. This figure is now near record lows. In 1962, \n     foreign aid amounted to $18.5 billion in current dollars, or \n     0.58 percent of GDP and 3.06 percent of federal spending. In \n     the 1980s, it averaged just over $13 billion a year in \n     current dollars, or 0.20 percent of GDP and 0.92 percent of \n     federal spending. Washington's current 0.11 percent aid-to-\n     GDP share compares unflatteringly with the average of 0.30 \n     percent in the other OECD donor countries. On a per capita \n     basis, each American contributes about $29 per year to \n     development and humanitarian aid, compared to a media of $70 \n     in the other OECD countries. According to the Clinton \n     administration's own budget forecasts, the FY 2001 aid figure \n     of $10.4 billion will drop even further in FY 2005, to $9.7 \n     billion. Congress' low target for total international \n     spending that year will almost certainly cut the FY 2005 aid \n     figure even more.\n       Considering current economic and social trends in the \n     world's poor countries, these law and declining aid levels \n     are unjustifiable. World Bank President James Wolfensohn is \n     right: the global struggle to reduce poverty and save the \n     environment is being lost. Although hundreds of millions of \n     people in the developing world escaped from poverty in recent \n     years, half of the six billion people on Earth still live on \n     less than $2 a day. Two billion are not connected to any \n     energy system. One and a half billion lack clean water. More \n     than a billion lack basic education, health care, or modern \n     birth control methods.\n       The world's population, which grows by about 75 million a \n     year, will probably reach about 9 billion by 2050; most will \n     live in the world's poorest countries. If present trends \n     continue, we can expect more abject poverty, environmental \n     damage, epidemics, political instability, drug trafficking, \n     ethnic violence, religious fundamentalism, and terrorism. \n     This is not the kind of world Americans want their children \n     to inherit. The Declaration of Independence speaks of ``a \n     decent respect for the opinion of mankind.'' Today's \n     political leaders need a decent respect for future \n     generations.\n       To be sure, the principal responsibility for progress in \n     the developing countries rests with those countries \n     themselves. But their commitments to pursue sound economic \n     policies and humane social policies will fall short without \n     more and better-designed development aid--as well as more \n     generous trade concessions--from the United States and its \n     wealthy partners. At the main industrialized nations' summit \n     last year in Birmingham, U.K. the G-8 (the G-7 group of \n     highly industrialized countries plus Russia) endorsed such \n     U.N.-backed goals as halving the number of people suffering \n     from illiteracy, malnutrition, and extreme poverty by 2015.\n       Beyond these broad goals, America's next president should \n     earmark proposed increases in U.S. development aid for \n     specific programs that promote fundamental American interests \n     and values and that powerful domestic constituencies could be \n     mobilized to support. These would include programs that \n     promote clean energy technologies to help fight global \n     warming; combat the spread of\n\n[[Page S9187]]\n\n     diseases such as AIDS, which is ravaging Africa; assure \n     primary education for all children, without the present \n     widespread discrimination against girls; bridge the \n     ``digital divide'' and stimulate development by bringing \n     information technology and the Internet to schools, \n     libraries, and hospitals; provide universal maternal and \n     child care, as well as family planning for all those who \n     wish to use it, thus reducing unwanted pregnancies and \n     unsafe abortions; support democracy and the rule of law; \n     establish better corporate governance, banking \n     regulations, and accounting standards; and protect basic \n     worker rights.\n       What would the G-8 and U.N. targets and these specific \n     programs mean for the U.S. foreign operations budget? \n     Answering this question is much harder than estimating an \n     adequate State Department budget. Doing so requires more \n     information on total requirements, appropriate burden-sharing \n     between developed and developing countries, the share that \n     can be assumed by business and NGOs, the absorptive capacity \n     of countries, and aid agencies' ability to handle more \n     assistance effectively.\n       Still, there are fairly reliable estimates of total aid \n     needs in many areas. For example, the 1994 Cairo Conference \n     on Population and Development endorsed an expert estimate \n     that $17 billion per year is now required to provide \n     universal access to voluntary family planning in the \n     developing world, with $5.7 billion of it to be supplied by \n     developed countries. Were the United States to contribute \n     based on its share of donor-country GDP, U.S. aid in this \n     sector would rise to about $1.9 billion annually. By \n     contrast, U.S. foreign family-planning funding in FY 2000 was \n     only $372 million; the Clinton administration has requested \n     $541 million for FY 2001.\n       We already know enough about aid requirements in other \n     sectors to suggest that doing Washington's fair share in \n     sustainable-development programs would require about $10 \n     billion more per year by FY 2005, which would bring its total \n     aid spending up to some $20 billion annually. This would \n     raise U.S. aid levels from their present 0.11 percent of GDP \n     to about 0.20 percent, the level of U.S. aid 20 years ago. \n     That total could be reached by annual increases of $2 billion \n     per year, starting with a $1.6 billion foreign-aid supplement \n     for FY 2001 and conditioning each annual increase on \n     appropriate management reforms and appropriate increases in \n     aid from other donors.\n       An FY 2005 target of $20 billion for development and \n     humanitarian aid would mean a foreign operations budget that \n     year of about $25 billion; total foreign affairs spending \n     that year would be about $33 billion. This sounds like a lot \n     of money, but it would be less than the United States spent \n     on foreign affairs in real terms in 1985. As a percentage of \n     the FY 2005 federal budget, it would still be less than \n     average annual U.S. foreign affairs spending in the late \n     1970s and 1980s.\n\n\n                             sticker shock\n\n       For a newly elected George W. Bush or Al Gore, asking for \n     $2.6 billion in additional supplemental funds for FY 2001 on \n     top of reversing this year's budget cuts--thus adding $1 \n     billion for the State Department and $1.6 billion more for \n     foreign operations--would produce serious ``sticker shock'' \n     in the congressional budget and appropriations committees. \n     So would seeking $27 billion for the 150 Account for FY \n     2002 and additional annual increases of $2 billion per \n     year in order to reach a total of $33 billion in FY 2005. \n     How could Congress be persuaded?\n       The new president--Democrat or Republican--would have to \n     pave the way in meetings with congressional leaders between \n     election day and his inauguration, justifying the additional \n     expenditures in national security terms. He would need to \n     make the case with opinion leaders and the public, explaining \n     in a series of speeches and press conferences that America is \n     entering not just a new century but also a new era of global \n     interaction. He would need to energize the business \n     community, unions, and the religious and civic groups who are \n     the main constituencies for a more adequate foreign affairs \n     budget. Last but not least, he would need to emphasize \n     reforms in the State Department, in foreign-aid programs, and \n     in international agencies to provide confidence that the \n     additional money would be spent wisely.\n       Starting off a presidency this way would be a gamble, of \n     course. But most presidents get the benefit of the doubt \n     immediately after their first election.

Mr. President, I want to speak today about the provisions \nin H.R. 4365--which passed the Senate on Friday, that address our \nNation's growing problems with methamphetamines and ecstasy and other \nclub drugs. I am happy to have worked with Senator Harkin and Senator \nBiden to ensure that these provisions could be included in the \nconference report. Indeed, Senator Harkin has worked tirelessly to \naddress this issue, and I commend him for his efforts; without his \ninvolvement, this legislation would not have passed.\n  I believe that the methamphetamine provisions in this report embody \nthe best elements of S. 486, which the Senate passed last year, while \ncasting aside the more ill-advised ideas in that legislation. The \nmanufacture and distribution of methamphetamines and amphetamines is an \nincreasingly serious problem, and the provisions we have retained in \nthis legislation will provide significant additional resources for both \nlaw enforcement and treatment. In addition to creating tougher \npenalties for those who manufacture and distribute illicit drugs, this \nbill allocates additional funding to assist local law enforcement, \nallows for the hiring of new DEA agents, and increases research, \ntraining and prevention efforts. This is a good and comprehensive \napproach to deal with methamphetamines in our local communities.\n  Meanwhile, we have not included in this legislation the provision in \nS. 486 that would have allowed law enforcement to conduct physical \nsearches and seizures without the existing notice requirement, a \nserious curtailment of the civil liberties that Americans have come to \nexpect. It would have also amended the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nso that Rule 41(d)'s requirements concerning the notice, inventory, and \nreturn of seized property would only apply to tangible property, thus \nexempting the contents of individuals' computers from the property \nprotections provided to American citizens under current law. I worked \nhard to make sure that that provision did not become law, and I had \neffective and dedicated allies on both sides of the aisle in the House \nof Representatives. Indeed, the methamphetamine legislation approved by \nthe House Judiciary Committee did not include this provision.\n  We have also not included those provisions from S. 486 that concerned \nadvertising and the distribution of information about methamphetamines. \nBoth of those provisions raised First Amendment concerns, and I believe \nthe legislation is stronger without them. Once again, the House \nJudiciary Committee acted wisely, leaving those provisions out of its \nmeth legislation.\n  The meth bill has taken a lengthy path from introduction to passage, \nand I believe it has been improved at each step. For example, we \nsignificantly improved this bill during committee considerations. As \nthe comprehensive substitute for the original bill was being drafted, I \nhad three primary reservations: First, earlier versions of the bill \nimposed numerous mandatory minimums. I continue to believe that \nmandatory minimums are generally an inappropriate tool in our \ncritically important national fight against drugs. Simply imposing or \nincreasing mandatory minimums subverts the more considered process \nCongress set up in the Sentencing Commission. The Federal Sentencing \nGuidelines already provide a comprehensive mechanism to equalize \nsentences among persons convicted of the same or similar crime, while \nallowing judges the discretion they need to give appropriate weight to \nindividual circumstances.\n\n  The Sentencing Commission goes through an extraordinary process to \nset sentence levels. For example, pursuant to our 1996 anti-\nmethamphetamine law, the Sentencing Commission increased meth penalties \nafter careful analysis of recent sentencing data, a study of the \noffenses, and information from the DEA on trafficking levels, dosage \nunit size, price and drug quantity. Increasing mandatory minimums takes \nsentencing discretion away from judges. We closely examine judges' \nbackgrounds before they are confirmed and should let them do their \njobs.\n  Mandatory minimums also impose significant economic and social costs. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the annual cost of \nhousing a federal inmate ranges from $16,745 per year for minimum \nsecurity inmates to $23,286 per year for inmates in high security \nfacilities. It is critical that we take steps that will effectively \ndeter crime, but we should not ignore the costs of the one size fits \nall approach of mandatory minimums. We also cannot ignore the policy \nimplications of the boom in our prison population. In 1970, the total \npopulation in the federal prison system was 20,686 prisoners, of\n\n[[Page S9188]]\n\nwhom 16.3 percent were drug offenders. By 1997, the federal prison \npopulation had grown to almost 91,000 sentenced prisoners, \napproximately 60 percent of whom were sentenced for drug offenses. The \ncost of supporting this expanded federal criminal justice system is \nstaggering. We ignore at our peril the findings of RAND's comprehensive \n1997 report on mandatory minimum drug sentences: ``Mandatory minimums \nare not justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing \ncocaine consumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related crime.''\n  This is why I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about creating \nnew mandatory minimum penalties, including in the last Congress, when \nanother anti-methamphetamine bill was before the Judiciary Committee.\n  Second, earlier drafts of this bill would have contravened the \nSupreme Court's 1999 decision in Richardson versus U.S. I, along with \nsome other members of the Committee, believed that it would be \ninappropriate to take such a step without first holding a hearing and \ngiving thorough consideration to such a change in the law. The Chairman \nof the Committee, Senator Hatch, was sensitive to this concern and he \nagreed to remove that provision from this legislation.\n  Third, an earlier version of the bill contained a provision that \nwould have created a rebuttable presumption that may have violated the \nConstitution's Due Process Clause. Again, I believed that we needed to \nseriously consider and debate such a provision before voting on it. And \nagain, the Chairman was sensitive to the concerns of some of us on the \nCommittee and agreed to remove that provision.\n  The SAMHSA authorization bill also dealt with ecstasy and other so-\ncalled ``club drugs.'' Ecstasy is steadily growing in popularity, \nespecially among younger Americans. It is perceived by many young \npeople as being harmless, but medical studies are beginning to show \nthat it can have serious long-term effects on users. This bill asks the \nSentencing Commission to look at our current sentencing guidelines for \nthose who manufacture, import, export, or traffic ecstasy, and to \nprovide for increased penalties as it finds appropriate. It also \nauthorizes $10 million for prevention efforts. These efforts are \nparticularly crucial with new drugs like ecstasy, so that our young \npeople can learn the true consequences of use.\n  This legislation took a tough approach to drugs without taking the \neasy way out of mandatory minimums, and without undue Congressional \ninterference with the Sentencing Commission. I hope that any future \nefforts we must take to address our drug problem will use these \nprovisions as a model.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9188-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE NATIONAL RECORDING PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues support \nthe National Recording Preservation Act, legislation that maintains and \npreserves America's most significant recordings during the first \ncentury of recorded sound for future generations to enjoy. This \nlegislation is especially important to my state of Louisiana, which has \nits own rich and distinct musical tradition.\n  Louisiana is known around the world for having a culture all its own. \nWe are best known for our good music, good food and good times. We \nespecially celebrate our cultural heritage through our music.\n  The Storyville district in New Orleans is said to be the birthplace \nof jazz--America's only indigenous musical genre. Louis Armstrong, \nperhaps the most influential jazz artist of all time, grew up orphaned \nin New Orleans when jazz music was coming of age.\n  Acadiana is the home of great cajun and zydeco artists like the late \nBeau Jocque, the late Clifton Chenier, Michael Doucet and Beausoleil, \nand Zachary Richard, all of whom communicate to the rest of the world \nwhat life is like on the bayou.\n  In the northern part of our state, Shreveport's Municipal Auditorium \nwas the home of the Louisiana Hayride, where Elvis Presley got his \nfirst break after being turned down by the Grand Ole Opry in Tennessee. \nThe Louisiana Hayride shaped the country music scene in the 1940's and \n50's by showcasing artists like Hank Williams, Johnny Cash and Willie \nNelson in its weekly Saturday night radio broadcasts.\n  Bluesmen like Tabby Thomas and Snooks Eaglin have kept the Delta \nblues tradition alive and well in Louisiana. The Neville Brothers, \nKenny Wayne Shepherd, all the talented members of the Marsalis family, \nand many others, continue to keep us connected to our culture and help \nus celebrate it.\n  According to the Louisiana Music Commission, the overall economic \nimpact of the music industry in Louisiana is about $2.2 billion as of \n1996, up from $1.4 billion in 1990. So music isn't just important to my \nstate's culture, it is important to its economy. Unfortunately, since \nmany recordings are captured only on perishable materials like tape, we \nare in danger of losing these priceless artifacts to time and decay.\n  Recognizing the importance of preserving Louisiana's musical \nheritage, I have sponsored The National Recording Preservation Act. \nThis legislation, which is modeled after a similar law to preserve \nAmerica's disappearing film recordings, creates a National Recording \nRegistry within the Library of Congress\n  The registry will identify the most historically, aesthetically and \nculturally significant recordings of the first century of recorded \nsound and maintains these for future generations to enjoy. The registry \nwill include works as diverse as slave songs, opera, world music and \nheavy metal. I hope Louisiana's many and varied contributions to the \nfield of music would be well represented in this national registry.\n  The National Recording Preservation Act directs the Librarian of \nCongress to select up to 25 recordings or groups of recordings for the \nregistry each year. Nominations will be taken from the general public, \nas well as from industry representatives. Recordings will be eligible \nfor selection 10 years after their creation.\n  To help the Librarian of Congress implement a comprehensive recording \npreservation program, this legislation establishes a National Recording \nPreservation Board. The board will work with artists, archivists, \neducators, historians, copyright owners, recording industry \nrepresentatives and others to establish the program.\n  The bill also charters a National Recording Preservation Foundation \nto raise funds to promote the preservation of recordings and ensure the \npublic's access to the registry.\n  To maintain the success of the music industry in Louisiana, we must \nstrive to inspire our youth by exposing them to their musical heritage. \nThis legislation helps us take steps to cultivate our traditions and \nour young artists, and will allow us to continue to attract tourists to \nthe New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and the Zydeco Festival in \nPlaisance, Louisiana.\n  Congress should enact the National Recording Preservation Act so \nfuture generations can fully appreciate Louisiana's contributions to \nthe history of recorded music in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9188-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

They will be presented this award at a dinner \nbenefitting the March of Dimes on September 27, 2000.\n  Mr. Greco and Mrs. Greco Issa hold the position of President and \nTreasurer, respectively, at the Philip F. Greco Title Company, which \nwas founded by their father in 1972. The two learned the business \nworking alongside their father, and helped the company establish three \nregional offices and five satellite businesses.\n  Both Mr. Greco and Mrs. Greco Issa are very active within the Macomb \nCounty community. Mr. Greco is President of the advisory board for the \nSt. John's North Shore Hospital. He is also a member of the Italian \nAmerican Chamber of Commerce of Michigan, a past Commodore of both the \nNorth Channel Yacht Club and the Idle Hour Yacht Club, and has served \non numerous charity golf committees.\n  Mrs. Greco Issa contributes time to St. Joseph's Hospital, the \nItalian American Cultural Center, the Macomb Medical Society, and Toys \nfor Tots. She has also always been very active in volunteering her time \nand effort to the March of Dimes. Since 1986, she has been involved \nwith the Alexander Macomb Dinner and March of Dimes WalkAmerica. \nIndeed, due to her personal commitment and contributions to the March \nof Dimes, Mrs. Greco Issa has become a member of the March of Dimes \nSoutheast Michigan Chapter Board of Directors.\n  There is potential that this will not be the last time members of the \nGreco family are recognized for their charitable endeavors.

Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \nNelson Lagendyk of Avon, South Dakota on being inducted into the South \nDakota Aviation Hall of Fame Combat Wing for his contributions to both \nstate and national aviation.\n  Mr. Lagendyk enlisted in the Air Force in June 1941 where he became a \nsquadron clerk and joined the all volunteer glider program. His \noutstanding aviation skills led to his promotion to staff sergeant and \na transfer to Lubbock, Texas for glider combat training. Once in Texas, \nNelson was again promoted, this time to the position of Flight Officer. \nFollowing his new promotion, he then traveled to Louisville, Kentucky \nfor continued training in preparation of his flight to Europe.\n  Leadership, courage and honor define Nelson's heroic actions on June \n6, 1944 when he joined 4,000 glider and tow planes for a dangerous \nflight into Hitler's occupied France. Nelson Lagendyk courageously \nrisked his life to secure the airfield behind enemy lines, so that \nGerman prisoners may be transported to England where they would later \nbe held accountable for the grave atrocities committed against the \nJewish people under Hitler's infamous reign.\n  Nelson's honors for his exemplary service include the distinguished \nAir Medal and the prestigous Battle Field Commission to 2nd Lieutenant, \nas well as the Normandy Medal of the Jubilee of Liberty'', which was \npresented to him by the French government in appreciation for the World \nWar II liberation. Upon his retirement with the rank of General, Nelson \nenlisted in the Air Force Reserves as a ready reservist. He presently \nserves as South Dakota's Commander of the World War II Glider Pilot \nAssociation.\n  Mr. President, Nelson Lagendyk richly deserves this noble \ndistinction. It is an honor for me to share his heroic accomplishments \nwith my colleagues and to publicly commend him for serving South Dakota \nand our country valiantly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9189-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9189-S9190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO JIM KANOUSE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to Jim \nKanouse of The Boeing Company, who is retiring after fourteen years of \nservice with the aerospace company and over 30 years of service with \nthe United States Army and the United States Congress.\n  Jim grew up in America's heartland, South Bend, Indiana, and \ngraduated from Indiana University. He also attended the University of \nNotre Dame, and throughout his career has maintained the highest \nstandards of his alma maters, always leading by example as a proud \nmember of the ``Indiana Hoosiers'' and the ``Fighting Irish.''\n  Jim continued his career as an officer and Army Aviator with the \nUnited States Army including three tours of duty in Vietnam. He was \nhighly decorated for valor and wounds in combat. As a pilot of numerous \naircraft, including the very dangerous and very demanding OV-1 \n``Mohawk,'' Jim survived many encounters and engagements with enemy \nforces ranging from an arrow shot at his aircraft in a rice paddy to a \n.50 caliber round piercing his fuselage and striking his pilot seat. He \nwas highly decorated for valor and wounds in combat, including the \nDistinguished Flying Cross for rescuing a downed pilot. Like so many of \nhis generation, Jim served proudly, unselfishly and bravely with little \nfanfare, recognition or appreciation. On behalf of the United States \nSenate, the United States Congress and the American people, I salute \nJim Kanouse and all the veterans of his generation.\n  Jim eventually brought his skills to Washington, D.C. representing \nU.S. Army Legislative Affairs in the House of Representatives. \nEscorting members overseas, representing Army programs to members and \nstaff, and responding to constituent inquiries about Army affairs, he \nagain proudly served his nation and service. Members who traveled with \nJim respected his knowledge, expertise and easygoing style. Respected \nby Democrats and Republicans alike, he then left Capitol Hill to pursue \na career in legislative affairs with The Boeing Company.\n  For over a decade, Jim Kanouse was one of the primary focal points \nfor Senators and Representatives with the world's largest aerospace \ncompany, representing revolutionary aircraft programs ranging from the \nRAH-66 ``Comanche'' Army scout helicopter to the F-22 ``Raptor'' Air \nForce jet fighter.\n  I consider Jim Kanouse a friend. We all in Congress wish you well \ndeserved time to enjoy life with your lovely wife, Eileen, and your \nloving children\n\n[[Page S9190]]\n\nand grandchildren.

Mr. President, last week nearly 200 high school \nand college student members of Skills USA-Vocational Industrial Clubs \nof America, their instructors, and corporate sponsors came to Capitol \nHill to report the results of their year-long ``Building Skills for \nAmerica'' signature campaign. Building Skills for America is a public \nawareness initiative by Skills USA-VICA to demonstrate the urgent needs \nof business and industry for a highly-skilled work force and the \nprivate sector's effective support for occupational instruction.\n  The campaign has given these students the opportunity to speak to \ntheir communities about their pride in their chosen professions and the \nmany opportunities available through good technical education. The \nstudents were able to collect 200,000 signatures for the campaign. I \ncongratulate all of these students for their skillful work and \ndedication in promoting state-of-the-art vocational education and job \ntraining programs.\n  I ask that a congratulatory letter to these outstanding young \nleaders, signed by Senators Collins, Reed, Grassley, Kerry, Inhofe, \nMiller, Lugar, Bryan, Murkowski, Dodd, Roth, Kerrey, DeWine, Murray, \nHagel, Mikulski, Hatch, Harkin, Reid, Lincoln, Bingaman, Hollings, \nLevin, Conrad, Cleland, Wyden and myself may be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2000.\n     Student Members and Staff,\n     SkillsUSA-VICA.\n       Warmest congratulations on your impressive efforts to raise \n     the awareness of all Americans about the importance of a \n     well-trained workforce.

Clearly, we must do \n     more to promote the training necessary to respond to this \n     challenge.\n       Education and technical training offered through the \n     nation's colleges and schools in conjunction with the \n     SkillsUSA-VICA program is a national resource for teaching \n     the academic, occupational, and professional skills that will \n     help students to become well-trained workers and responsible \n     citizens. The 200,000 signatures that you collected over the \n     past year in your Building Skills for America campaign have \n     increased public support for the on-going education and \n     training of the workforce across the country.\n       You deserve great credit for the success of your Building \n     America Campaign. We are proud to support continuing state-\n     of-the-art vocational education programs and job training \n     programs that reflect the changing needs of American business \n     and industry.

I rise today to recognize Ms. Lillian Adams, who will \nreceive an Alexander Macomb Citizen of the Year Award at a dinner \nbenefitting the March of Dimes on September 27, 2000.\n  Ms. Adams has served as Executive Director of the Sterling Heights \nArea Chamber of Commerce for the past 24 years, after having held the \nsame position on St. Clair Shores Chamber of Commerce for eight years. \nHer duties within these organizations have included small business \nadvocacy, service as community ombudsman, and hosting local business \ncable programs.\n  Ms. Adams is a devoted participant in the Macomb County Community \nGrowth Alliance and the St. Joseph Mercy Community Foundation. She has \nbeen an active supporter of the March of Dimes and the Kiwanis Club and \nserves on the boards of the Otsikita Girl Scouts and the Macomb \nSymphony Orchestra.\n  Ms. Adams also was a founding member of the Sterling Heights \nFoundation and the Shelby Township Community Foundation, and a past \npresident of the Utica Community Schools Foundation for Educational \nExcellence.\n  And, as dedicated as she has been to these many causes, Ms. Adams is \neven more dedicated to her two sons, Micheal and Brian, and her \ngrandchild, Brigette.\n  I applaud Ms. Adams on the dedication she has demonstrated to Macomb \nCounty, and the many successful efforts she has made to improve the \nquality of life for its citizens. On behalf of the entire United States \nSenate, I congratulate Ms. Lillian Adams on receiving the 2000 \nAlexander Macomb Citizen of the Year Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9190-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF THOMAS W. CORCORAN\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one \nof the truly dedicated public servants of the State of New Jersey. It \ngives me pleasure to extend my congratulations to Thomas Corcoran on \nreceiving the Outstanding Citizen Award for 2000 from the Phillipsburg \nArea Chamber of Commerce.\n  Over the years, Mr. Corcoran has done a great deal for the betterment \nof Phillipsburg, New Jersey. He has fought for a better education for \nthe children of the area through his efforts to promote a bond issue \nfor the construction of new schools. He was appointed by former \nGovernor Florio to serve as a commissioner on the Phillipsburg Housing \nAuthority. Further, he has worked towards the revitalization of \nPhillipsburg's tourist industry by working with New Jersey State \nLegislators and other prominent individuals to promote Phillipsburg as \nthe site of the New Jersey Railroad Museum.\n  Mr. Corcoran has always been there for the Town of Phillipsburg. Be \nit serving as town mayor and other public posts, or taking the time to \nserve as the public address announcer for Phillipsburg High School \nfootball games, Mr. Corcoran has been an exemplar of citizenship, town \npride, and selflessness.\n  Through his efforts, Mr. Corcoran has shown the great dedication he \nholds for the town he calls home. Those efforts make it an honor for me \nto be able to stand with the Phillipsburg Area Chamber of Commerce and \nrecognize an individual such as Mr. Corcoran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9190-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9190-S9191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMENDING IDAHO OLYMPIAN, CHARLES BURTON\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nremarkable accomplishments of Charles Burton, an Idaho native and \nwrestler for the U.S. Olympic team.\n  Charles was born in Ontario, Oregon and raised in Boise, Idaho. He \ngraduated from Centennial High School in Boise, where he was a state \nchampion, and Boise State University, where he won All-American status. \nIn 1997, Charles won the University Freestyle National Championship and \nbecame a Pan American bronze medalist. Charles earned the number two \nspot on the US National team in 1999 after earning a silver medal at \nthe world team trials in Seattle, Washington. He will wrestle in the \nOlympics from September 29th through October 1st.\n  This Idahoan, and other devoted athletes, serve as reminders that \nthrough healthy competition, our challengers can inspire us to excel. \nThey unify those of us who watch them through shared pride and passion. \nTheir victories leave our souls soaring high and our feet light. In \ntimes of defeat, we are humbled by the fact that there is more work to \nbe done to reach our team's victory.\n  The Olympic ideal is perhaps the best evidence that endurance, the \ndesire to challenge oneself, and the pursuit of achieving top physical \nform are age-old endeavors. The events demonstrate\n\n[[Page S9191]]\n\nthat the will to compete in the athletic arena is nearly universal, \ncrossing boundaries of culture and geography to bring together most of \nthe world's nations. It is one of the great celebrations of the human \nspirit and one of the finest examples of our time of peaceful multi-\nnational competition.\n  I am very proud of Charles' accomplishments and the role that he will \nplay in this international competition. I wish Charles, and all the \nother athletes who are participating in the Olympics this year, the \nchallenge of vigorous competition. May they again know the exaltation \nof pushing themselves to their limits and the roar of a crowd that \nlives vicariously through their triumph.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9191-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   101ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars on the 101st anniversary of its founding, \nwhich is to be celebrated this Friday, September 29, For over a \ncentury, the men and women of the VFW and the VFW Ladies Auxiliary have \nworked tirelessly to ensure that veterans are treated with the respect \nthey deserve.\n  The Veterans of Foreign Wars can trace its origins to 1899, with the \nfounding of several local organizations composed of veterans of the \nSpanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection. Members of these \norganizations were interested in securing medical care and pensions \nrelated to their military service. Over the next few years, these \ngroups took part in a series of mergers, until by 1913 a single group \ncalling itself ``the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States'' \nwas formed. The VFW was chartered by the U.S. Congress in 1936.\n  According to the VFW, which is headquartered in Kansas City, \nMissouri, eligibility requirements for membership include ``military \nservice on foreign soil or in hostile waters in a campaign for which \nthe U.S. government has authorized a medal.'' This has been a \nparticularly war-torn century, and America has provided leadership in \nmany of our century's conflicts, so a great many Americans meet these \nrequirements. And a great many Americans have taken advantage of the \nbenefits of membership: at this time, almost 2 million men and women \nbelong to the VFW, including over 72,000 in my home state of Minnesota. \nThe VFW pursues a number of goals through its many programs and \nservices, which are aimed at strengthening comradeship among its \nmembers, perpetuating the memory and history of our fallen soldiers, \nfostering patriotism, defending the Constitution, and promoting service \nto our communities and our country.\n  The VFW also works to advance legislation benefiting veterans, their \ndependents and survivors. One of its main legislative goals, and one \nthat's very near and dear to my own heart, is ensuring that Congress \nmaintains an adequate budget for veterans' health care. The VFW also \nfights to make a full range of employment and educational opportunities \navailable to veterans after they exit the service. And through its \ngoals of an open national cemetery in every state, the VFW is honoring \nour nation's heroes in death no less than in life. Through these and \nother activities, the VFW is working hard to make sure that our nation \nlives up to its sacred commitment to those who have given freedom to \nAmerica and the world by giving so much of themselves.\n  As a nation, we are duty-bound to pass on the experiences of \nAmerica's veterans, and their brothers and sisters who didn't come \nhome, to future generations. Through the sacrifices of our servicemen \nand women, freedom and prosperity flourish. The Veterans of Foreign \nWars does the vitally important work of making sure that these \nsacrifices will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9191-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL KIDS VOTING WEEK\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Kids \nVoting USA and its efforts to educate our children about civic \ndemocracy and the importance of being an informed voter.\n  The program began in 1988 with three Arizona businessmen on a fishing \ntrip to Costa Rica. They learned that voter turnout in that country was \nroutinely about 80 percent. This high turnout was attributed to a \ntradition of children accompanying their parents to the polls. The men \nobserved first-hand the success Costa Rica had achieved by instilling \nin children at an early age the importance of active participation and \nvoting.\n  The three Arizona businessmen took this idea back to the United \nStates and founded Kids Voting USA. Today, this nonprofit, nonpartisan \norganization reaches 5 million students in 39 states, and includes \n200,000 teachers, and 20,000 voter precincts.\n  With voter turnout declining each year, Kids Voting USA recognizes \nthe need to educate our youth and instill in them the responsibility to \nbe active, informed citizens and voters. Kids Voting USA enables \nstudents to visit official polls on election day, accompanied by a \nparent or guardian, to cast a ballot that replicates the official \nballot. Although not part of the official results, the students' votes \nare registered at schools and by the media.\n  This year, National Kids Voting Week is September 25-29. It is a week \nwhen Kids Voting communities across the country celebrate this vibrant \nand important program. I would like to recognize Kids Voting USA and \nall it has done to promote the future of democracy by engaging \nfamilies, schools and communities in the election process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9191-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF DR. ERNEST URBAN\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. \nErnest Urban as he retires from the largest healthcare system in the \nworld, the Veterans Health Administration/Department of Veterans \nAffairs. For 26 years, Dr. Urban's compassionate, caring medical \nservice has made an impact on our nation's heroes, our veterans.\n  Dr. Urban has served the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare \nSystem comprised of University Drive, Aspinwall and Highland Drive \nDivisions for 15 years as Chief of Staff. He has also been a professor \nand Assistant Dean for Veterans Affairs at the University of \nPittsburgh's School of Medicine since 1985. Prior to 1985, he served in \nseveral other capacities in hospitals and universities all over the \ncountry. Dr. Urban has also authored publications dealing with many \naspects of medicine that have proven to benefit the quality of care for \nour veterans. Most importantly, he continues to lecture and teach on a \nwide range of topics that benefit the VA Health Administration \nPersonnel and provides medical leadership to carry into the 21st \ncentury.\n  I have been privileged to personally witness the hard work and \ndedication of doctors like Dr. Urban within the Veterans Administration \nHealthcare System. From 1946 until 1985, my mother served as a VA nurse \nat several hospitals including Aspinwall Veterans Hospital in \nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Butler Veterans Hospital in Butler, \nPennsylvania. As Chief of Nursing for 32 years, my mother can attest to \nthe commitment which is typical of VA doctors and nurses everywhere. \nDuring times of low funding and limited staffing, VA doctors and staff \nworked harder than ever to care for the needs of their patients. While \nmy experience on the Senate Armed Services Committee has served as \naffirmation of the dedication of Veterans Healthcare Administration, it \npales in comparison to the hard work and sacrifice that I personally \nwitnessed as the son of someone who served in the Veterans Healthcare \nAdministration.\n  It is at this time that I would like to recognize Dr. Urban for his \ntremendous dedication to the medical profession. As he prepares for \nretirement, we can only celebrate the faithful service he provided to \nthe needs of all veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9191-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9191-S9192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE HONORABLE PETER J. MACERONI RECEIVES 2000 ALEXANDER MACOMB CITIZEN \n                           OF THE YEAR AWARD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, each year, the Southeast Michigan \nChapter of the March of Dimes recognizes a select group of individuals \nwhose contributions to the Macomb County, Michigan, community have been \ninvaluable I rise today to recognize the\n\n[[Page S9192]]\n\nHonorable Peter J. Maceroni, who will receive an Alexander Macomb \nCitizen of the Year Award at a dinner benefitting the March of Dimes on \nSeptember 27, 2000.\n  Judge Maceroni received his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Hillsdale \nCollege in 1962, and earned his Juris Doctor degree from Wayne State \nUniversity Law School in 1965. He was in private practice for 35 years \nbefore being elected to the ninth Circuit Court Judgeship in 1990. In \n1996, in addition to being reelected to this position, he was appointed \nto the Michigan Trial Court Assessment Commission by Governor John \nEngler.\n  As Chief Judge, he not only presides over civil and criminal cases, \nbut is also responsible for supervising the operation of the Court, \nincluding the Friend of the Court. His duties in these capacities \ninclude developing the annual budget, which he presents to the Macomb \nCounty Board of Commissioners.\n  One of Judge Maceroni's most successful initiatives in the Macomb \nCounty Circuit Court has been a video arraignment program, which has \nreduced the cost of transporting prisoners from the jail for \narraignment hearings and increased security by having fewer prisoners \ntransported over public roads.\n  Judge Maceroni has served as president of the Macomb County Trial \nLawyers Association, president of the Italian American Bar Association, \nas well as Director of the Macomb County Bar Association. In 1997, he \nreceived the Outstanding County Elected Official Award from the \nMichigan Association of Counties.\n  Outside the realm of the law, Judge Maceroni finds time to enjoy the \ncompany of his four children: Patricia, Peter, Jr., Patrick and James.\n  I applaud Judge Maceroni on the dedication he has demonstrated to \nMacomb County, and the many successful efforts he has made to improve \nthe quality of life for its citizens. On behalf of the entire United \nStates Senate, I congratulate the Honorable Peter J. Maceroni on \nreceiving a 2000 Alexander Macomb Citizen of the Year Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9192-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9192-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9192-S9194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO IRAN--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 130\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), and section 505(c) of the \nInternational Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 \nU.S.C. 2349aa-9(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month periodic report on \ndevelopments concerning the national emergency with respect to Iran \nthat was declared in Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, and \nmatters relating to the measures in that order and in Executive Order \n12959 of May 6, 1995, and in Executive Order 13059 of August 19, 1997.\n                                                  William J.

This report is submitted \npursuant to section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c) (``IEEPA''), section 401(c) of the \nNational Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 505(c) of the \nInternational Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 \nU.S.C. 2349aa-9(c). This report discusses only matters concerning the \nnational emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive \nOrder 12957 and does not deal with those relating to the emergency \ndeclared on November 14, 1979, in connection with the hostage crisis.\n  1. On March 15, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12957 (60 Fed. Reg. \n14615, March 17, 1995) to declare a national emergency with respect to \nIran pursuant to IEEPA, and to prohibit the financing, management, or \nsupervision by U.S. persons of the development of Iranian petroleum \nresources. This action was in response to actions and policies of the \nGovernment of Iran, including support for international terrorism, \nefforts to undermine the Middle East process, and the acquisition of \nweapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. A copy of \nthe order was provided to the Congress by message dated March 15, 1995.\n  Following the imposition of these restrictions with regard to the \ndevelopment of Iranian petroleum resources, Iran continued to engage in \nactivities that represent a threat to the peace and security of all \nnations, including Iran's continuing support for international \nterrorism, its support for acts that undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and its intensified efforts to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. On May 6, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12959 (60 Fed. \nReg. 24757, May 9, 1995) to further respond to the Iranian threat to \nthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates. The terms of that order and an earlier order imposing an import \nban on Iranian-origin goods and services (Executive Order 12613 of \nOctober 29, 1987) were consolidated and clarified in Executive Order \n13059 of August 19, 1997.\n  At the time of signing Executive Order 12959, I directed the \nSecretary of the Treasury to authorize through specific licensing \ncertain transactions, including transactions by U.S. persons related to \nthe Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague, established \npursuant to the Algiers Accords, and related to other international \nobligations and United States Government functions, and transactions \nrelated to the export of agricultural commodities pursuant to \npreexisting contracts consistent with section 5712(c) of Title 7, \nUnited States Code. I also directed the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to consider authorizing U.S. \npersons through specific licensing to participate in market-based swaps \nof crude oil from the Caspian Sea area for Iranian crude oil in support \nof energy projects in Zerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan.\n  Executive Order 12959 revoked sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \n12613 of October 29, 1987, and sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \n12957 of March 15, 1995, to the extent they are inconsistent with it. A \ncopy of Executive Order 12959 was transmitted to the Speaker of the \nHouse and the President of the Senate by letter dated May 6, 1995.\n  2. On August 19, 1997, I issued Executive Order 13059 (the ``order'') \nto clarify the steps taken in Executive Order 12957 and Executive Order \n12959, to confirm that the embargo on Iran prohibits all trade and \ninvestment activities by U.S. persons, wherever located, and to \nconsolidate in one order the various prohibitions previously imposed to \ndeal with the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995. A copy of \nthe order was transmitted to the Speaker of the House and the President \nof the Senate by letter dated August 19, 1997.\n  The order prohibits: (1) the importation into the United States of \nany goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the \nGovernment of Iran except information or informational materials; (2) \nthe exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply from the United States \nor by a U.S. person, wherever located, of goods, technology, or \nservices to Iran or the\n\n[[Page S9193]]\n\nGovernment of Iran, including knowing transfers to a third country for \ndirect or indirect supply, transshipment, or reexportation to Iran or \nthe Government of Iran, or specifically for use in the production, \ncommingling with, or incorporation into goods, technology, or services \nto be supplied, transshipped, or reexported exclusively or \npredominately to Iran or the Government to Iran; (3) knowing \nreexportation from a third country to Iran or the Government of Iran of \ncertain controlled U.S.-origin goods, technology, or services by a \nperson other than a U.S. person; (4) the purchase, sale, transport, \nswap, brokerage, approval, financing, facilitation, guarantee, or other \ntransactions or dealings by U.S. persons, wherever located, related to \ngoods, technology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale or \nsupply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran, or \nto goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the \nGovernment of Iran; (5) new investment by U.S. persons in Iran or in \nproperty or entities owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; (6) \napproval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a U.S. person of any \ntransaction by a foreign person that a U.S. person would be prohibited \nfrom performing under the terms of the order; and (7) any transaction \nthat evades, avoids, or attempts to violate a prohibition under the \norder.\n  Executive Order 13059 became effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight \ntime on August 20, 1997. Because the order consolidated and clarified \nthe provisions of prior orders, Executive Order 12613 and paragraphs \n(a), (b), (c), (d), and (f) of section of Executive Order 12959 were \nrevoked by Executive Order 13059. The revocation of corresponding \nprovisions in the prior Executive orders did not affect the \napplicability of those provisions, or of regulations, licenses or other \nadministrative actions taken pursuant to those provisions, with respect \nto any transaction or violation occurring before the effective date of \nExecutive Order 13059. Specific licenses issued pursuant to prior \nExecutive orders continue in effect, unless revoked or amended by the \nSecretary of the Treasury. General licenses, regulations, orders, and \ndirectives issued pursuant to prior orders continue in effect, except \nto the extent inconsistent with Executive Order 13059 or otherwise \nrevoked or modified by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The declaration of national emergency made by Executive Order 12957, \nand renewed each year since, remains in effect and is not affected by \nthe order.\n  3. On March 13, 2000, I renewed for another year the national \nemergency with respect to Iran pursuant to IEEPA. This renewal extended \nthe authority for the current comprehensive trade embargo against Iran \nin effect since May 1995.\n  4. On April 28, 1999, I announced that existing unilateral economic \nsanctions programs would be amended to modify licensing policies to \npermit case-by-case review of specific proposals for the commercial \nsale of agricultural commodities and products, as well as medicine and \nmedical equipment, where the United States Government has the \ndiscretion to do so. I further announced that the Administration was \ndeveloping country-specific licensing criteria to guide the case-by-\ncase review process so that governments subject to sanctions do not \ngain unwarranted benefits from such sales.\n\n  On July 27, 1999, the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR Part \n560 (the ``ITR'' or the ``Regulations'') were amended to add statements \nof licensing policy with respect to commercial sales of agricultural \ncommodities and products, medicine and medical equipment (64 Fed. Reg. \n41784, August 2, 1999). These provisions were amended on October 27, \n1999 (64 Fed. Reg. 58789, November 1, 1999) to improve language that \nhad prohibited the issuance of specific licenses authorizing financing \nby entities of the governments of Sudan, Libya, and Iran. In addition, \ntechnical revisions were made to the Regulations pertaining to \ninformational materials and visas.\n  On March 17, 2000, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced \nthat economic sanctions against Iran would be eased to allow Americans \nto purchase and import carpets and food products such as dried fruits, \nnuts, and caviar from Iran. To implement this policy, the Department of \nthe Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC'') amended the \nRegulations to authorize by general license the importation into the \nUnited States of, and dealings in, certain Iranian-origin foodstuffs \nand carpets and related transactions (65 Fed. Reg. 25642, May 3, 2000).\n  5. During the current six-month period, OFAC made numerous decisions \nwith respect to applications for licenses to engage in transactions \nunder the ITR, and issued 62 licenses. The majority of license denials \nwere in response to requests to authorize commercial exports to Iran--\nparticularly of machinery and equipment for various industries--and the \nimportation of Iranian-origin goods. Twenty-one licenses were issued \nauthorizing commercial sales and exportation to Iran of bulk \nagricultural commodities; in addition, licenses were issued that \nauthorized 20 sales of medicines or medical equipment. Other licenses \nthat were issued authorized certain air and marine safety, diplomatic, \nlegal, financial, and travel transactions, filmmaking, humanitarian, \njournalistic, and research activities, and the importation of arts \nobjects for public exhibition. Pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 of \nExecutive Order 12959, Executive Order 13059, and consistent with \nstatutory restrictions concerning certain goods and technology, \nincluding those involved in air safety cases. Treasury continues to \nconsult with the Departments of State and Commerce prior to issuing \nlicenses.\n\n  For the period March 15 through September 14, 2000, on OFAC's \ninstructions, U.S. banks refused to process more than 1,100 commercial \ntransactions, the majority involving foreign financial institutions, \nthat would have been contrary to U.S. sanctions against Iran. The \ntransactions rejected amounted to nearly $170 million worth of business \ndenied Iran by virtue of U.S. economic sanctions.\n  Since my last report, OFAC has collected nearly $342,000 in civil \nmonetary penalties for violations of IEEPA and the Regulations. The \nviolators included one insurer, seven companies, six U.S. financial \ninstitutions, and six individuals. An additional 102 cases are \nundergoing penalty action for violations of IEEPA and the Regulations.\n  6. On January 14, 2000, the vice president of a Wisconsin corporation \nwas sentenced in the Eastern District of Wisconsin to 41 months in \nprison for his October 1999 jury conviction on charges he violated \nIEEPA and the Arms Export Control Act by illegally exporting U.S.-\norigin military aircraft component parts to Iran. On February 3, 2000, \nthe corporation president was sentenced to six months in prison and \nordered to pay a $5,000 fine for his guilty plea to one count of making \nfalse statements to the Government, and the corporation was ordered to \npay a fine of $15,000. The defendants were charged with violating \nsanctions against Iran in an August 1998 indictment.\n  A California resident is scheduled to be tried in October 2000 in the \nDistrict of Maryland for IEEPA and other charges filed in a superseding \nindictment on March 20, 1997. The indictment charges the defendant with \nthe attempted exportation to Iran of gas chromatographs from the United \nStates.\n  On May 10, 2000, a Georgia corporation pleaded guilty in U.S. \nDistrict Court in Atlanta to one count of violating IEEPA by exporting \nautomobile parts from the United States to Iran through third \ncountries. Two company officials entered guilty pleas for making false \nstatements to the United States Government in connection with the \nshipments. Sentencing is pending. The guilty pleas were the result of a \n24-count indictment returned in December 1998.\n  Various enforcement actions carried over from previous reporting \nperiods are continuing and new reports of violations are being \naggressively pursued.\n  7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the six-month \nperiod from March 15 through September 14, 2000 that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to Iran are reported \nto be approximately $1.5 million, most of which represent wage and \nsalary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\ncentered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office \nof Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the \nUnder Secretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General \nCounsel), the Department of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic \nand Business Affairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of \nIntelligence and Research, and the Office of the Legal Adviser), and \nthe Department of Commerce (the Bureau of Export Administration and the \nChief Counsel's Office).\n  8. The situation reviewed above continues to present an extraordinary \nand unusual threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States. The declaration of the national emergency \nwith respect to Iran contained in Executive Order 12957 and the \ncomprehensive economic sanctions imposed by Executive Order 12959 \nunderscore the United States Government's opposition to the actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, particularly its support of \ninternational terrorism and its efforts to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means to deliver them. The Iranian Transactions \nRegulations issued pursuant to Executive Orders 12957, 12959, and 13059 \ncontinue to advance important objectives in promoting the \nnonproliferation and anti-terrorism policies of the United States. I \nshall exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these problems \nand will report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9194-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9194-S9195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO NATIONAL UNION FOR THE \n TOTAL INDEPENDENCE OF ANGOLA (UNITA)--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM \n                                  131\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report on the national emergency with respect to the National \nUnion for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) that was declared in \nExecutive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n                                   The White House, September 25, 2000.\n\n President's Periodic Report on the National Emergency With Respect to \n      National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)\n\n  I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since my last \nreport of March 27, 2000, concerning the national emergency with \nrespect to UNITA that was declared in Executive Order 12865 of \nSeptember 26, 1993. This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) \nof the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) \nof the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  On September 26, 1993, I declared a national emergency with respect \nto the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (``UNITA''), \ninvolving the authority, inter alia, of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the United Nations \nParticipation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c). Consistent with United \nNations Security Council Resolution (``UNSCR'') 864, dated September \n15, 1993, the order prohibited the sale or supply by U.S. persons or \nfrom the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, \nof arms and related material of all types, including weapons and \nammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and petroleum \nand petroleum products to the territory of Angola other than through \ndesignated points of entry. The order also prohibited such sale or \nsupply to UNITA. U.S. persons are prohibited from activities which \npromote or are calculated to promote such sales or supplies, or from \nattempted violations, or from evasion or avoidance or transactions that \nhave the purpose of evasion or avoidance, of the stated prohibitions. \nThe order authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including the \npromulgation of rules and regulations, as might be necessary to carry \nout the purposes of the order.\n  1. On December 10, 1993, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign \nAssets Control (``OFAC'') issued the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions \nRegulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 590 (the ``Regulations'') (58 Fed. Reg. \n64904), to implement Executive Order 12865.\n  On August 28, 1997, the United Nations Security Council adopted UNSCR \n1127, expressing its grave concern at the serious difficulties in the \npeace process, demanding that the Government of Angola and in \nparticular UNITA comply fully and completely with those obligations, \nand imposing additional sanctions against UNITA. Subsequently, on \nSeptember 29, 1997, the Security Council adopted UNSCR 1130 postponing \nthe effective date of measures specified by UNSCR 1127 until 12:01 a.m. \nEST, October 30, 1997.\n\n  On December 12, 1997, I issued Executive Order 13069 to implement in \nthe United States the provisions of UNSCRs 1127 and 1130 (62 Fed. Reg. \n65989, December 16, 1997), placing additional sanctions on UNITA. \nEffective 12:01 a.m. EST on December 15, 1997, Executive Order 13069 \nclosed all UNITA offices in the United States and prohibited various \naircraft-related transactions. Specifically, section 2(a) of Executive \nOrder 13069 prohibits the sale, supply, or making available in any form \nby U.S. persons, or from the United States or using U.S.-registered \nvessels or aircraft, of aircraft or aircraft components, regardless of \ntheir origin, to the territory of Angola, other than through designated \npoints of entry, or to UNITA. Section 2(b) prohibits the insurance, \nengineering, or servicing of UNITA aircraft by U.S. persons or from the \nUnited States. Section 2(c) prohibits the granting of take-off, \nlanding, or overflight permission to any aircraft on flights or \ncontinuations of flights to or from the territory of Angola other than \nto or from designated places in Angola. Section 2(d) prohibits the \nprovision of engineering and maintenance servicing, the certification \nof airworthiness, the payment of new insurance claims against existing \ninsurance contracts, and the provision, renewal, or making available of \ndirect insurance by U.S. person or from the United States with respect \nto any aircraft registered in Angola, except designated aircraft, and \nwith respect to any aircraft that has entered the territory of Angola \nother than through designated points of entry.\n  On August 18, 1998, I issued Executive Order 13098 (64 Fed. Reg. \n44771, August 20, 1998), placing further sanctions on UNITA, taking \ninto account the provisions of United Nations Security Council \nResolutions 1173 of June 12, 1998, and 1176 of June 24, 1998. These \nadditional sanctions went into effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT on August 19, \n1998. Section 1 of Executive Order 13098 blocks all property and \ninterests in property of UNITA, designated senior UNITA officials, and \ndesignated adult members of their immediate families if the property or \nproperty interests are in the United States, hereafter come within the \nUnited States, or are or hereafter come within the United States, or \nare or hereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons. \nSection 2 of Executive Order 13098 prohibits the importation into the \nUnited States of all diamonds exported from Angola that are not \ncontrolled through the Certificate of Origin regime of the Angolan \nGovernment of Unity and National Reconciliation (the ``GURN''). Section \n2 also prohibits the sale or supply by U.S. persons or from the United \nStates or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft of equipment used \nin mining, and of motorized vehicles, watercraft, or spare parts for \nmotorized vehicles or watercraft, regardless of origin, to the \nterritory of Angola other than through a designated point of entry. \nFinally, section 2 prohibits the sale or supply by U.S. persons or from \nthe United States or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft of \nmining services or ground or waterborne transportation services, \nregardless of their origin, to persons in designated areas of Angola to \nwhich the GURN's State administration has not been extended.\n\n  On June 25, 1999, pursuant to Executive Order 13098, OFAC amended \nAppendix A to 31 CFR chapter V, which contains the names of blocked \npersons, specially designated nationals, specially designated \nterrorists, foreign\n\n[[Page S9195]]\n\nterrorist organizations, and specially designated narcotics traffickers \ndesignated pursuant to the various sanctions programs administered by \nOFAC. The amendment adds to Appendix A the names of 10 individuals who \nhave been determined to be senior officials of UNITA (64 Fed. Reg. \n34991, June 30, 1999). All property and interests in property of these \nindividuals that are in the United States, that come within the United \nStates, or that come within the control of U.S. persons are blocked. \nAll transactions by U.S. persons or within the United States in \nproperty or interests in property of these individuals are prohibited \nunless licensed by OFAC.\n  On August 12, 1999, OFAC amended the Regulations to implement \nExecutive Orders 13069 and 13098 and to make technical and conforming \nchanges (64 Fed. Reg. 43924, August 12, 1999). Since the amendments are \nextensive, part 590 was reissued in its entirety. Additional \nprohibitions, definitions, interpretive sections, general licenses, and \nappendices were added to the Regulations to reflect the new sanctions \nimposed in Executive Orders 13069 and 13098, and certain existing \nprohibitions were renumbered. Five new appendixes were added to the \nRegulations.\n  2. There have been no amendments to the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions \nRegulations since my last report.\n  3. OFAC has worked closely with the U.S. financial and exporting \ncommunities to assure a heightened awareness of the sanctions against \nUNITA--through the dissemination of publications, seminars, and a \nvariety of media, including via the Internet, fax-on-demand, special \nfliers, and computer bulletin board information initiated by OFAC and \nposted through the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Government \nPrinting Office. No UNITA bank accounts have been identified in U.S. \nbanks. There have been two recent attempts to transfer small amounts of \nfunds in which UNITA clearly had an interest; both transfers were \nblocked. In the previous reporting period a U.S. financial institution \nrefused to process a suspect transaction. No licenses have been issued \nunder the program since my last report.\n  4. The expenses incurred by the federal government in the six-month \nperiod from March 26 through September 2, 2000 that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to UNITA are estimated \nat about $100,000, most of which represent wage and salary costs for \nFederal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the \nDepartment of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel) and \nthe Departments of State (particularly the Office of Southern African \nAffairs) and Commerce.\n  I will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9195-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  A message from the House of Representatives, delivered by one of its \nclerks, announced that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled \nbill on September 22, 2000:\n\n       H.R. 940.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nreform the provisions relating to child labor; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               children's act for responsible employment\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation to update and bring America's child labor laws into the \n21st century. This much-needed bill is titled the Children's Act for \nResponsible Employment of 2000 (The CARE Act of 2000).\n  As many of you know, I have been working to eradicate child labor \noverseas since 1992. At that time, I introduced the Child Labor \nDeterrence Act, which prohibits the importation of products made by \nabusive and exploitative child labor. Since then, we have made \nsignificant progress.\n  Let me cite just three examples.\n  In Bangladesh in 1995, a precedent-setting memorandum of \nunderstanding was signed between the garment industry and the \nInternational Labor Organization, which has resulted in 9,000 children \nbeing moved from factories and into schools. In Pakistan two years \nlater, another memorandum of understanding was signed to the benefit of \nhundreds of children sewing soccer balls and to the benefit of their \nfamilies.\n  In May of this year, it was a pleasure to go to the White House to \nwitness President Clinton signing into law new provisions I authored to \nflatly prohibit the importing into the U.S. of any products made by \nforced or indentured child labor and to deny duty-free trade benefits \nto any country that is not meeting its legal obligations to eliminate \nthe worst forms of child labor.\n  It is important to understand that when the growth of a child is \nstopped, so is the growth of a nation. In keeping with our nation's \ncommitment to human rights, democracy, and economic justice, the United \nStates must continue to lead the struggle against the scourge of \nexploitative child labor wherever it occurs. But to have the \ncredibility and moral authority to lead this global effort, we must be \ncertain that we are doing all we can to eradicate exploitative child \nlabor here at home.\n  Sadly, this is not the case as I stand here before you today. This is \nwhy I am sponsoring this new legislation to crack down on exploitative \nchild labor in America. I am also heartened by the fact that the \nClinton administration and the Child Labor Coalition made up of more \nthan 50 organizations all across our country endorse prompt enactment \nof this bill.\n  Consider the plight of child labor in just one sector of the American \neconomy--large-scale commercial agriculture.\n  Just three months ago in June, Mr. President, an alarming report \nentitled ``Fingers to the Bone'' was released by Human Rights Watch. It \nis a deeply troubling indictment of America's failure to protect child \nfarmworkers who pick our fruits and vegetables every day. As many as \n800,000 children in the U.S. work on large-scale commercial farms, \ncorporate farms if you will, often under very hazardous conditions that \nexpose them to pesticide poisoning, heat illness, serious injuries, \nand lifelong disabilities. The sad truth is that despite very difficult \nand dangerous working conditions, current federal law allows children \nas young children to take jobs on corporate farms at a younger age, for \nlonger hours, and under more hazardous conditions than children in \nnonagricultural lines of work.\n\n  We must end this disgraceful double standard.\n  Furthermore, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), first enacted in \n1938, allows children as young as 10 years old to work in the fields of \nAmerica's corporate farms. In nonagricultural lines of work, children \ngenerally must be at least 14 years of age and are limited to three \nhours of work a day while school is in session. Truth be told, even \nthose laws are inadequately enforced by the U.S. Labor Department where \nyoung farmworkers are concerned. The FLSA simply must be revised and \nimproved to protect the health, safety, and education of all children \nin America.\n  I also want to call to the attention of my colleagues a five-part \nAssociated Press series on child labor in the United States that was \npublished in 1997. It dramatically unmasks the shame of exploitative \nchild labor in our midst. For example, it graphically portrays the \nexploitation and desperation of 4-year-olds picking chili peppers in \nNew Mexico and 10-year-olds harvesting cucumbers in Ohio. It documents \nhow 14-year-old Alexis Jaimes was crushed to death, while working on a \nconstruction site in Texas when a 5,000 pound hammer fell on him.\n  This is outrageous and intolerable. Children should be learning, not \nrisking their health and forfeiting their future in sweatshops. \nChildren should be acquiring computer skills so we don't have to keep \nimporting every-increasing numbers of H-1B visa workers from abroad, as \nwe are being pressured to support now, and not slaving in the fields or \nstreet peddling and being short-changed on a solid education. At \nbottom, children should be afforded their childhood, not treated like \nchattel or disposable commodities. Not just here in the United States, \nbut in every country in the world.\n  But we cannot expect to curb exploitative child labor overseas unless \nAmerica leads by example, cracking down on exploitative child labor in \nour own backyard.\n  There is no national database on children working in America or the \ninjuries they incur. But there is mounting evidence to suggest there is \na growing problem with exploitative child labor in America, as \nunderscored by the recently released Human Rights Watch study delivered \nto all of our offices and an excellent series of investigative reports \nfrom the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the National Institute of \nOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\n  At least 800,000 children are working in the fields of large-scale \ncommercial agriculture in the U.S.\n  The FLSA's bias against farmworker children amounts to de facto race-\nbased discrimination because an estimated 85 percent of migrant and \nseasonal farmworkers nationwide are racial minorities.\n  In some regions, including Arizona, approximately 99 percent of \nfarmworkers are Latino.\n  Only 55 percent of the child laborers toiling in the fields will ever \ngraduate from high school.\n  Existing EPA regulations and guidelines offer no more protection from \npesticide poisoning for child laborers than they do for adult \nfarmworkers.\n  Every 5 days, a child dies from a work-related accident.\n  Mr. President, one of the great U.S. Senators of the 20th century, \nHubert Humphrey, used to remind all of us that the greatness of any \nsociety should be measured by how it treats people at the dawn and \ntwilight of life. By that measure, we clearly need to do better by \nAmerica's children.\n\n  There is no good reason why children working in large-scale \ncommercial agriculture are legally permitted to work at younger ages, \nin more hazardous occupations, and for longer periods of time than \ntheir peers in other industries. As GAO investigators have noted, a 13-\nyear-old is not allowed under current law to perform clerical work in \nan air-conditioned office, but the same 13-year-old may be employed to \npick strawberries in a field in the heat of summer.\n  And so I offer this legislation in order that we fight exploitative \nchild labor here at home with the same resolve that we confront it in \nthe global economy. This legislation will toughen civil and criminal \npenalties for willful child labor violators, afford minors working in \nlarge-scale commercial agriculture the same rights and protection as \nthose working in nonagricultural jobs, prohibit children under 16 from \nworking in peddling or door-to-door sales, strengthen the authority of \nthe U.S. Secretary of Labor to deal with ``hot goods'' made by child \nlabor in interstate commerce, and improve enforcement of our nation's \nchild labor laws.\n  But it is not my purpose to prevent children from working under any \ncircumstances in America. My focus is on preventing exploitation. \nAccordingly, this bill also preserves exemptions for children working \non family farms as well as selling door-to-door as volunteers for \nnonprofit organizations like the Girl Scouts of America.\n\n[[Page S9197]]\n\n  In conclusion, I want to remind my colleagues that a child laborer \nhas little chance to get a solid education because he or she spend his \nor her days at work with little regard for that child's safety and \nfuture. But it becomes clearer every day that in order for an \nindividual or a nation to be competitive in the high-tech, globalized \neconomy of the 21st century, a premium must be placed upon educating \nall children. We can't afford to leave any of our children behind.\n  At the bottom, this is why I am sponsoring this legislation to \nstrengthen our child labor laws here at the home and effectively deter \nand punish those who exploit our children in the workplace. It is time \nto bring our nation's child labor laws into modern times, so that we \ncan prepare for the future.\n  It is totally unacceptable to me that upon entering the 21st century, \nthe commercial exploitation of children in the workplace continues in \nour midst--largely out of sight and out of mind to most Americans.\n  It is time to give all of the children in the U.S. and around the \nworld the chance at a real childhood and extend to them the education \nnecessary to competing in tomorrow's high-road workplace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 3101. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nas a deduction in determining adjusted gross income the deduction for \nexpenses in connection with services as a member of a reserve component \nof the Armed Forces of the United States; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   RESERVISTS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, for the past fourteen years, the men and \nwomen serving selflessly in the Reserve components of our Armed Forces, \nwhich includes the National Guard and federal Reserve, have been denied \na sensible, fair, and morally right tax deduction. Today, I am \nintroducing a bill that will correct this tax injustice.\n  The Reservist Tax Relief Act of 2000 will allow Reservist and \nNational Guardsmen and women, who are our nation's purest citizen-\nsoldiers, to deduct travel expenses as a business expense, when they \ntravel in connection with military service. It is my hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in quickly passing this legislation before the \nend of the 106th Congress.\n  With the dramatic downsizing of the U.S. military over the past \ndecade, the Reserve component has become an increasingly valuable \naspect of our national defense. Traditionally geared to provide trained \nunits and individuals to augment the Active components in time of war \nor national emergency, the Reserve component's role and responsibility \nhas rapidly increased throughout the 1990s. During the Cold War, the \nReserve component was rarely mobilized due to the robust nature of the \nActive Duty forces, however, with the 1/3 cut in Active Duty forces \nsince 1990 there have been five presidential mobilizations of the Guard \nand Reserve beginning with the 1990-1991 Gulf War. The Guard and \nReserve are heavily relied upon to provide support for smaller regional \ncontingencies, peace-keeping and peace-making operations, and disaster \nrelief. Although this level of mobilization is unprecedented during a \ntime of peace, the men and women of the Guard and Reserve have \nperformed a tremendous job in bridging the gap in our national \nsecurity. For instance, more than 1,000 Missouri Army National Guard \nsoldiers went to Honduras to help the country recover from the \ndevastation of Hurricane Mitch. Additionally, Missouri Air Force \nReservists have defended the skies over Bosnia-Herzegovina. America's \nReserve component is now essential to our every-day military \noperations.\n  I strongly believe that our Active Duty forces should be provided \nadditional resources to improve the readiness and overall capability of \nour national defense so America will not have to over-use its ``weekend \nwarriors.'' But I also know that Congress should provide the necessary \nresources and support for the Reserve component to complement their new \nposition in our security. Beyond providing the Reserve component with \nthe resources, training, and equipment to be fully integrated into the \nmilitary's ``Total Force'' concept, the Reserve component personnel \nshould be provided targeted support to address their unique concerns.\n  When a member of the Reserve component chooses to serve, these brave \nmen and women give up at least several weeks a year for training. In \nreturn, they are provided only minimal pay. With this training, along \nwith additional out of area deployments each lasting up to 179 days, \nthe 866,000 Reserve troops have put in 12 to 13 million man--days in \neach of the last three years. This type of commitment often puts a \ntremendous strain on these men and women, their families, and their \nemployers. They all deserve our deepest thanks and sense of gratitude, \nand also our full support.\n  Mr. President, the Reservist Tax Relief Act of 2000 is one way we can \nactively support the contribution made by the Reserves to our national \ndefense. This bill, endorsed by the Reserve Officers' Association of \nthe United States, will provide a tax deduction to National Guard and \nReserve members for travel expenses related to their military services, \nso that their travel costs in connection with Guard duty can be treated \nas a business expense. This provision was part of the federal tax code \nuntil it was removed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Estimates show that \napproximately 10 percent of Reserve members, or about 86,000 personnel, \nmust travel over 150 miles each way from home in order to fulfil their \nmilitary commitments. The expenses involved in traveling this distance \nat least ``one weekend a month and two weeks a year'' can become a \ntremendous burden for dedicated citizen-soldiers. It is time, with \ntaxes at record levels in this country, to reinstate this tax deduction \nfor military reservists, who give up more than just their time in \nservice to this country.\n  This tax relief bill is estimated to result in $291 million less tax \ndollars being collected by the Treasury over the next five years; the \nfirst year ``cost'' is $13 million. In the era of multi-billion dollar \nprograms and surpluses this amount may seem small to Washington \nbureaucrats, but to the hard-working Reservists and Guardsmen in \nMissouri, this additional tax deduction will provide real financial \nhelp. Most Reservists and National Guardsmen and women do not enlist as \na means to become a millionaire, but are motivated by a sense of duty \nto country. It is our responsibility to respond to their service with \nthis simple tax correction. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure and to support the men and women of our Reserve and Guard \nforces. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the written consent of a parent of an \nunemancipated minor prior to the referral of such minor for abortion \nservices; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       putting parents first act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will reaffirm the vital role parents play in the lives of their \nchildren. My legislation, the Putting Parents First Act, will guarantee \nthat parents have the opportunity to be involved in one of their \nchildren's most important and life-affecting decisions--whether or not \nto have an abortion.\n  The American people have long understood the unique and essential \nrole the family plays in our culture. It is the institution through \nwhich we best inculcate and pass down our most cherished values. As is \nfrequently the case, President Reagan said it best. Within the American \nfamily, Reagan said, ``the seeds of personal character are planted, the \nroots of public virtue first nourished. Through love and instruction, \ndiscipline, guidance and example, we learn from our mothers and fathers \nthe values that will shape our private lives and public citizenship.''\n  The Putting Parents First Act establishes something that ought to be \nself-evident, but tragically is not: that mothers and fathers should be \nallowed to be involved in a child's decision whether or not to have a \nmajor, life-changing, and sometimes life-threatening, surgical \nprocedure--an abortion. This seems so simple. In many states, school \nofficials cannot give a child an aspirin for a headache without \nparental consent. But doctors can perform abortions on children without \nparental consent or even notification. This defies logic.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would prohibit any individual \nfrom performing an abortion upon a minor under the age of 18 unless \nthat individual has secured the informed written consent of the minor \nand a parent or guardian. In accordance with Supreme Court decisions \nconcerning state-passed parental consent laws, the Putting Parents \nFirst Act allows a minor to forego the parental involvement requirement \nin cases where a court has issued a waiver certifying that the process \nof obtaining the consent of a parent or guardian is not in the best \ninterests of the minor or that the minor is emancipated.\n  For too long, the issue of abortion has polarized the American \npeople. To some extent, this is the inevitable result of vastly \ndifferent views of when life begins and ends, what `choices' are \ninvolved, and who has the ability to determine these answers for \nothers. Many including myself, view abortion as the destruction of \ninnocent human life that should be an option in only the most extreme \nsituations, such as rape, incest, or when the very life of the mother \nis at stake. Others, including a majority of current Supreme Court \nJustices, view abortion as a constitutionally-protected alternative for \npregnant women that should almost always be available. I think that all \nsides would agree that abortion involves a serious decision and a \nmedical procedure that is not risk-free.\n  Thankfully, there are areas of common ground in the abortion debate \non which both sides, and the Supreme Court, can agree. One such area of \nagreement is that, whenever possible, parents should be informed and \ninvolved when their young daughters are faced with a decision as \nserious as abortion. A recent CBS/New York Times survey found that 78 \npercent of Americans support requiring parental consent before an \nabortion is performed on a girl under age 18. Even those who do not \nview an abortion as a taking of human life recognize it as a momentous, \nindeed a life-changing, decision that a minor should not be left to \nmake alone. The fact that nearly 80 percent of the states have passed \nlaws requiring doctors to notify or seek the consent of a minor's \nparents before performing an abortion also demonstrates the consensus \nin favor of parental involvement.\n  The instruction and guidance about which President Reagan spoke are \nneeded most when our children are dealing with important life \ndecisions. It is hard to imagine a decision more important than whether \nor not a child should have a child of her own. We recognize, as \nfundamental to our understanding of freedom, that parents have unique \nrights and responsibilities to control the education and upbringing of \ntheir children--rights that absent a compelling interest, neither \ngovernment nor other individuals should supercede. When a young woman \nfinds herself in a crisis situation, ideally she should be able to turn \nto her parents for assistance and guidance. This may not always happen, \nand may not be reality for some young women, but at the very least, we \nshould make sure that our policies support good parenting, not undercut \nparents. Sadly, another reason to encourage young women to include a \nparent in the decision to undergo an abortion is because of adverse \nhealth consequences that can arise after an abortion. Abortion is a \nsurgical procedure that can and sometimes does result in complications. \nYoung women have died of internal bleeding and infections because their \nparents were unaware of the medical procedures that they had undergone, \nand did not recognize post-abortion complications.\n  Unfortunately, parental involvement laws are only enforced in about \nhalf of the 39 states that have them. Some states have enacted laws \nthat have been struck down in state or federal courts; in other states, \nthe executive branch has chosen not to enforce the legislature's will. \nAs a result, just over 20 states have parental consent laws in effect \ntoday. In the remaining 30 states, parents are often excluded from \ntaking part in their minor children's most fundamental decisions.\n  Moreover, in those states where laws requiring parental consent are \non the books and being enforced, those laws are frequently circumvented \nby pregnant minors who cross state lines to avoid the laws' \nrequirements. Often, a pregnant minor is taken to a bordering state by \nan adult male attempting to ``hide his crime'' of statutory rape and \nevade a state law requiring parental notification or consent. Sadly, \nnowhere is this problem more apparent than in my home state of \nMissouri. I was proud to have successfully defended Missouri's parental \nconsent law before the Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood versus \nAshcroft. Unfortunately, a study a few years ago in the American \nJournal of Public Health found that the odds of a minor traveling out \nof state for an abortion increased by over 50 percent after Missouri's \nparental consent law went into effect. There are ads in the St. Louis, \nMissouri, Yellow Pages luring young women to Illinois clinics with the \nwords ``No Parental Consent Required'' in large type.\n  The limited degree of enforcement and the ease with which state laws \ncan be evaded demand a national solution. The importance of protecting \nthe fundamental rights of parents demands a national solution. And the \nprotection of life--both the life of the unborn child, and the life and \nhealth of the pregnant young woman--demands we take action. Requiring a \nparent's consent before a minor can receive an abortion is one way \nstates have chosen to protect not only the role of parents and the \nhealth and safety of young women, but also, the lives of the unborn. \nThus, enactment of a federal parental consent law will allow Congress \nto protect the guiding role of parents as it protects human life.\n  The Putting Parents First Act is based on state statutes that have \nalready been determined to be constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThe legislation establishes a minimum level of involvement by parents \nthat must be honored throughout this nation. It does not preempt state \nparental involvement laws that provide additional protections to the \nparents of pregnant minors.\n  Mr. President, sound and sensible public policy requires that parents \nbe involved in critical, life-shaping decisions involving their \nchildren. A young person whose life is in crisis may be highly anxious, \nand may want to take a fateful step without their parents' knowledge. \nBut it is at these times of crisis that children need their parents \nmost. They need the wisdom, love and guidance of a mother or a father, \nnot policy statements of government bureaucrats, or uninvolved \nstrangers. This legislation will strengthen the family and protect \nhuman life by keeping parents involved when children are making \ndecisions that could shape the rest of their lives.\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 3103. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \na discriminatory profits tax on pharmaceutical companies which charge \nprices for prescription drugs to domestic wholesale distributors that \nexceed the most favored customer prices charged to foreign wholesale \ndistributors; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE ANTI-DISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, American consumers should have access to \nreasonably priced medicines. That seems like such a simple and \nreasonable statement to make, yet it is a bold one to make in this \nCongress. Drug prices should be a central part of the debate. I firmly \nbelieve we must do two things relative to prescription drugs (1) add a \nprescription drug benefit to the Medicare program and (2) address the \nhigh price of drugs. It is the second issue that the bill I am \nintroducing today with Senator Bryan seeks to address.\n  The Prescription Drug Price Anti-Discrimination Act provides that \nwhen a prescription drug manufacturer has a policy that discriminates \nagainst U.S. wholesalers by charging them more than it charges foreign \nwholesalers, a 10 percent discriminatory profits tax would be imposed \non that manufacturer. This 10 percent discriminatory profits tax will \nbe dedicated to Part A of the Medicare trust fund.\n  This legislation does not attempt to control drug prices. The \nmanufacturer may charge what it chooses to a foreign wholesaler or a \nU.S. wholesaler. But if the manufacturer does not have a non-\ndiscriminatory pricing policy, the discriminatory profits penalty kicks \nin. It is up to the manufacturer. If the manufacturer reports that it \nhas a policy to charge U.S. wholesalers no more than foreign \nwholesalers, there is no penalty. That statement would be attached to \nthe company's tax return, and it would be treated like any other \nrepresentation on a tax return.\n  This bill applies to U.S. manufacturers distributing to foreign \nwholesalers in Canada and any country that is a member of the European \nUnion. By limiting the bill to Canada and the European countries, we \nstill allow for prescription drug manufacturers to sell AIDS drugs at \nlower prices to African countries or other countries ravaged by \ndiseases. The bill refers only to other countries whose resources are \ncomparable to ours.\n  Fortune magazine recently reported that pharmaceuticals ranked as the \nmost profitable industry in the country in three benchmarks-return on \nrevenues, return on assets, and return on equity. Yet, Americans are \nforced to pay extraordinarily high prices for prescription drugs in the \nU.S. when they can cross the border to Canada to buy those same drugs \nat far lower prices. This legislation should help bring Americans the \nprescription drugs that they need at lower prices.\n  I have come to the Senate floor on previous occasions to talk about \nmy own constituents who travel from Michigan to Canada just to purchase \nlower priced prescription drugs. We found that seven of the \nprescription drugs most used by Americans cost an average of 89 percent \nmore in Michigan than in Canada. For example, Premarin, an estrogen \ntablet taken by menopausal women costs $23.24 in Michigan and $10.04 in \nOntario. The Michigan price is 131 percent above the Ontario price. \nAnother example, Synthroid, a drug taken to replace a hormone normally \nproduced by the thyroid gland, costs $13.16 in Michigan and $7.96 in \nOntario. The Michigan price is 65 percent above the Ontario price.\n  To add insult to injury, these drugs received financial support from \nthe taxpayers of the United States through a tax credit for research \nand development and in some cases through direct grants from the NIH to \nthe scientists who developed these drugs. In 1996 (the latest year that \nwe have data) through a variety of tax credits, the industry reduced \nits tax liability by $3.8 billion or 43 percent.\n  Research is very important and we want pharmaceutical companies to \nengage in robust research and development. But American consumers \nshould not pay the share of research and development that consumers in \nother countries should be shouldering.\n  Manufacturers of prescription drugs are spending fortunes for \nadvertising. According to the Wall Street Journal, spending on consumer \nadvertising for drugs rose 40 percent in 1999 compared with 1998. In \n1999 the drug industry spent nearly $14 billion on promotion, public \nrelations and advertising.\n  Mr. President, I have been sent a letter from Families USA, a noted \nhealth care advocacy group, which states that the bill we are \nintroducing today ``will help Medicare beneficiaries buy drugs at lower \nprices.''\n  Our citizens should not have to cross the border for cheaper \nmedicines made in the U.S. U.S. consumers are subsidizing other \ncountries when it comes to prescription drug prices. That is simply \nwrong and this legislation will help to correct this situation.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Prescription \nDrug Price Anti-Discrimination Act and I commend my colleague, Senator \nLevin, for his leadership on this initiative.\n  This bill would require drug manufacturers to treat American patients \nfairly--a manufacturer must have a policy in place that states that it \ndoes not discriminate against U.S. wholesalers by charging them more \nthan it charges foreign wholesalers. If the company does not have this \npolicy in place, then a 10 percent discriminatory profits tax would be \nimposed.\n  The reason for this bill is abundantly clear: American patients are \nbeing charged significantly higher prices than are patients in foreign \ncountries for the exact same drugs. Is there any reason why our \ncitizens--44 million of whom are uninsured and faced with paying these \nhigh prices--should be forced to make the choice between going without \nmuch-needed prescription drugs or paying 50, 100, or even 300 percent \nmore for their drugs than do citizens in Canada, Great Britain, and \nAustralia? Of course there isn't.\n  Today, patients without drug coverage in the United States are not \ntreated fairly by U.S. manufacturers. I was shocked to discover the \nenormous price disparities that exist for some of the most commonly \nused drugs. For example, Prevacid, which is used to treat ulcers, is \n282 percent more expensive in the United States than in Great Britain. \nClaritin is used to treat all allergies--as we all know thanks to \nfrequent television commercials--and is 308 percent more expensive when \npurchased by American patients than when purchased by Australian \npatients. And Prozac, which can help millions of Americans suffering \nfrom depression, is out of reach to many as it is 177 percent more \nexpensive in the United States than in Australia.\n  Our Medicare beneficiaries deserve a prescription drug benefit, and \nall of our citizens deserve the assurance that U.S. manufacturers will \nnot charge them significantly more than they charge foreign patients.\n  This bill will not harm the drug industry. They can choose to accept \nthe tax penalty, or they can lower prices to American consumers to the \nlevels they charge foreign consumers. Either way, they will remain a \nvery profitable industry:\n  Fortune magazine recently again rated the pharmaceutical industry as \nthe most profitable industry in terms of return on revenues, return on \nassets, and return on equity.\n  Drug companies enjoy huge tax benefits relative to other industries: \ntheir effective tax rate was 40 percent lower than that of all other \nU.S. industries between 1993-1996. Compared to certain industries, the \ndrug industry's effective tax rate was even lower--for example, it was \n47 percent lower than that for wholesale and retail trade.\n  Additionally, higher drug prices for American patients simply aren't \njustified in the face of soaring marketing and advertising budgets: the \nindustry spent almost $2 billion in 1999 on direct-to-consumer \nadvertising, and more than $11 billion on marketing and promotion to \nphysicians.\n  I don't have an argument with large profits--but American patients \nshould not be charged more than patients in other countries for the \nsame drugs. Moreover, American taxpayers should not be forced to \nunderwrite highly profitable corporations that exploit American \nconsumers.\n  Although many of us are still hopeful that we can pass a meaningful \nMedicare prescription drug benefit before the close of this Congress, \nat the very least we should require fair pricing for American patients.\n\n[[Page S9200]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 3104.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe allowance of the child credit, the deduction for personal \nexemptions, and the earned income credit in the case of missing \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               MISSING CHILDREN TAX FAIRNESS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Missing \nChildren Tax Fairness Act.\n  As a father and grandfather, I know there is no greater fear than \nhaving a child taken from you. No family should have to go through such \na horrible tragedy, yet in 1999 alone, approximately 750,000 children \nwere reported missing. The parents of these missing children must face \nthe daily reality that they may never find their children or even know \ntheir fate, yet most never lose hope or give up the search for any \nclue. It seems unfathomable that families in such a tragic predicament \nwould be faced with the added burden of higher taxation, but that is \nexactly what is happening under current tax policy.\n  Recently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued an advisory \nopinion which stated that the families of missing children may claim \ntheir child as a dependent only in the year of the kidnapping. However, \nin the following years, no such deduction may be taken, regardless of \nif the child's room is still being maintained and money is still being \nspent on the search. The IRS Chief Counsel admitted that this issue is \n``not free from doubt'' but concluded that, in the absence of legal \nauthority to the contrary, denying the dependency exemption was \nconsistent with the intent of the law. I believe this issue should be \ndecided differently and that Congress must remedy this unjust \nsituation.\n  The Missing Children Tax Fairness Act will clarify the treatment of \nmissing children with respect to certain basic tax benefits and ensure \nthat the families of these children will not be penalized by the tax \ncode. It makes certain that families will not lose the dependency \nexemption, child credit, or earned income credit because their child \nwas taken from them. I believe this a fair and equitable solution to a \ntax situation faced by families who are victims of one of the most \nheinous crimes imaginable--child abduction. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nmy statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3105\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Missing Children Tax \n     Fairness Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF MISSING CHILDREN WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN \n                   TAX BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (c) of section 151 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to additional \n     exemption for dependents) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) Treatment of missing children.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Solely for the purposes referred to in \n     subparagraph (B), a child of the taxpayer--\n       ``(i) who is presumed to have been kidnapped by someone who \n     is not a member of the family of such child or the taxpayer, \n     and\n       ``(ii) who would be (without regard to this paragraph) the \n     dependent of the taxpayer for the taxable year in which the \n     kidnapping occurred if such status were determined by taking \n     into account the 12 month period beginning before the month \n     in which the kidnapping occurred,\n     shall be treated as a dependent of the taxpayer for all \n     taxable years ending during the period that the child is \n     kidnapped.\n       ``(B) Purposes.--Subparagraph (A) shall apply solely for \n     purposes of determining--\n       ``(i) the deduction under this section,\n       ``(ii) the credit under section 24 (relating to child tax \n     credit), and\n       ``(iii) whether an individual is a surviving spouse or a \n     head of a household (as such terms are defined in section 2).\n       ``(C) Termination of treatment.--Subparagraph (A) shall not \n     apply with respect to any child of a taxpayer as of the first \n     taxable year of the taxpayer beginning after the calendar \n     year in which there is a determination that the child is dead \n     (or, if earlier, in which the child would have attained age \n     18).''\n       (b) Comparable Treatment for Earned Income Credit.--Section \n     32(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     qualified child) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subparagraph:\n       ``(F) Treatment of missing children.--\n       ``(i) In general.--For purposes of this paragraph, an \n     individual--\n\n       ``(I) who is presumed to have been kidnapped by someone who \n     is not a member of the family of such individual or the \n     taxpayer, and\n       ``(II) who had, for the taxable year in which the \n     kidnapping occurred, the same principal place of abode as the \n     taxpayer for more than one-half of the portion of such year \n     before the date of the kidnapping,\n\n     shall be treated as meeting the requirement of subparagraph \n     (A)(ii) with respect to a taxpayer for all taxable years \n     ending during the period that the individual is kidnapped.\n\n       ``(ii) Termination of treatment.--Clause (i) shall not \n     apply with respect to any child of a taxpayer as of the first \n     taxable year of the taxpayer beginning after the calendar \n     year in which there is a determination that the child is dead \n     (or, if earlier, in which the child would have attained age \n     18).''\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years ending after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3106. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nclarify the definition of homebound under the Medicare home health \nbenefit; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE HOME HEALTH CARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce the Home \nHealth Care Protection Act of 2000. This legislation has been written \nto make sure that qualification for Medicare home health services does \nnot negatively impact other area's of a patient's recovery process, or \npreclude participation in important personal activities, like religious \nservices.\n  The homebound requirement to qualify for Medicare home health \nservices has been applied restrictively and inconsistently by the \nHealth Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and its various Medicare \ncontractors. In April 1999, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nsent a report to Congress on the homebound definition. The report \nidentifies the wide variety in interpretation of the definition and the \nabsurdity of some coverage determinations that follow. While I do not \nsupport all the conclusions of the report, I do agree with the \nSecretary that a clarification of the definition is needed to improve \nuniformity of application.\n  Of particular concern to me is the disqualification of seniors who,\n\n[[Page S9201]]\n\nthrough significant assistance, are capable of attending adult day care \nprograms for integrated medical treatment that has been empirically \nrecognized as effective for some severe cases of Alzheimer's and \nrelated dementia's. A close reading of current law does not preclude \nhomebound beneficiaries from using adult day services, yet some fiscal \nintermediaries are establishing reimbursement policies that force \nbeneficiaries to forgo needed adult day services in order to remain \neligible for home health benefits.\n  The Home Health Protection Act states that absences for attendance in \nadult day care for health care purposes shall not disqualify a \nbeneficiary. It is inappropriate and counterproductive to force seniors \nto choose between Medicare home health benefits and adult day care \nservices in circumstances where both are needed as part of a \ncomprehensive plan of care.\n  I have also heard from numerous beneficiaries who fear that absences \nfrom the home for family emergencies or religious purposes could \ndisqualify them from the home health benefit. Current law attempts to \naddress this situation by allowing for absences of infrequent or short \nduration. However, one Vermont senior, who suffers from multiple \nsclerosis and numerous complications, cannot leave the home without a \nwheelchair and a van equipped with a lift. She left the home once a \nweek, for three hours at a time, to visit her terminally ill spouse in \na nursing home and attend religious services there together. She was \ndetermined to be ``not homebound.''\n  There are more stories like this. At the same time, visiting nurses \nhave identified individuals who are healthy enough to leave the home \nwithout difficulty, but because they never do, they retain home health \nbenefits at the expense of the Medicare program. Our legislation \nspecifically clarifies that absences from the home are allowed for \nreligious services and visiting infirm and sick relatives. In a time of \ngreat need or family crisis, seniors should feel comforted that the \ngovernment won't stand in their way.\n  Federally funded home health care is an often quiet but invaluable \npart of life for America's seniors. We in Congress have an obligation \nto make sure that the Medicare program lives up to its promise and that \nhome health will be available to those who need it. I would like to \nthank my cosponsors, Senators Reed and Leahy for their dedication to \nthis issue. We look forward to working with the rest of Congress to \nturn this legislation into law.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, the \njunior Senator from Vermont, in introducing legislation that I hope \nwill resolve an issue that has needlessly confined Medicare \nbeneficiaries receiving home health benefits to their residences. \nToday, my colleague and I are introducing a revised version of a bill \nwe introduced earlier this year. I am pleased that this new \nlegislation, the Home Health Care Protection Act, has the support of \nseveral national aging organizations, including the Alzheimer's \nAssociation, the National Council on Aging and the National Association \nfor Home Care.\n  The Home Health Care Protection Act seeks to clarify the conditions \nunder which a beneficiary may leave his or her home while maintaining \neligibility for Medicare home health services. The Health Care \nFinancing Administration (HCFA) requires that a beneficiary be \n``confined to the home'' in order to be eligible for services. The \ncurrent homebound requirement is supposed to allow beneficiaries to \nleave the home to attend adult day care services, receive medical \ntreatment, or make occasional trips for non-medical purposes, such as \ngoing to the barber. However, the definition has been inconsistently \napplied, resulting in great distress for beneficiaries who are fearful \nthat they will lose their benefit if they leave their home to attend \nevents such as church services. Clearly, the intent of the rule is not \nto make our frail elderly prisoners in their own homes. The legislation \nwe are introducing today seeks to bring greater clarity to the \nhomebound definition so that they no longer are.\n  I am proud to have worked with my colleague, Senator Jeffords, on \nthis issue and hope that we can get this legislation passed before the \nend of the session. Mr. President, the Home Health Care Protection Act \nseeks to provide some reasonable parameters that will enable \nbeneficiaries suffering from Alzheimer's, among other chronic and \ndebilitating diseases, to leave their home without worry. This modest \nlegislation would make a real difference to home health beneficiaries \nin my state of Rhode Island as well as Medicare beneficiaries across \nthe country and I would urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9201-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9201-S9202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 178\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inouye, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n(Ms. Landrieu) was added as a cosponsor of S. 178, a bill to amend the \nPublic Health Service Act to provide for the establishment of a \nNational Center for Social Work Research.\n\n\n                                 S. 459\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the name of the Senator from Kansas \n(Mr. Roberts) was added as a cosponsor of S. 459, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the State ceiling on private \nactivity bonds.\n\n\n                                S. 1446\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Tennessee \n(Mr. Frist) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1446, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an additional advance refunding \nof bonds originally issued to finance governmental facilities used for \nessential governmental functions.\n\n\n                                S. 1536\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the names of the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) were added as cosponsors of S. 1536, a bill to amend the Older \nAmericans Act of 1965 to extend authorizations of appropriations for \nprograms under the Act, to modernize programs and services for older \nindividuals, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1726\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Daschle) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1726, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat for unemployment \ncompensation purposes Indian tribal governments the same as State or \nlocal units of government or as nonprofit organizations.\n\n\n                                S. 2271\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n(Mr. Leahy) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2271, a bill to amend the \nSocial Security Act to improve the quality and availability of training \nfor judges, attorneys, and volunteers working in the Nation's abuse and \nneglect courts, and for other purposes consistent with the Adoption and \nSafe Families Act of 1997.\n\n\n                                S. 2272\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n(Mr. Leahy) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2272, a bill to improve the \nadministrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and \nneglect courts and for other purposes consistent with the Adoption and \nSafe Families Act of 1997.\n\n\n                                S. 2290\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Hawaii \n(Mr. Inouye) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2290, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify the definition of contribution \nin aid of construction.\n\n\n                                S. 2434\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm transportation \n     corridor is a major gateway to Alaska and includes a range of \n     transportation routes used first by indigenous people who \n     were followed by pioneers who settled the Nation's last \n     frontier;\n       (2) the natural history and scenic splendor of the region \n     are equally outstanding; vistas of nature's power include \n     evidence of earthquake subsidence, recent avalanches, \n     retreating glaciers, and tidal action along Turnagain Arm, \n     which has the world's second greatest tidal range;\n       (3) the cultural landscape formed by indigenous people and \n     then by settlement, transportation, and modern resource \n     development in this rugged and often treacherous natural \n     setting stands as powerful testimony to the human fortitude, \n     perseverance, and resourcefulness that is America's proudest \n     heritage from the people who settled the frontier;\n       (4) there is a national interest in recognizing, \n     preserving, promoting, and interpreting these resources;\n       (5) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm region is \n     geographically and culturally cohesive because it is defined \n     by a corridor of historical routes--trail, water, railroad, \n     and roadways through a distinct landscape of mountains, \n     lakes, and fjords;\n       (6) national significance of separate elements of the \n     region include, but are not limited to, the Iditarod National \n     Historic Trail, the Seward Highway National Scenic Byway, and \n     the Alaska Railroad National Scenic Railroad;\n       (7) national heritage area designation provides for the \n     interpretation of these routes, as well as the national \n     historic districts and numerous historic routes in the region \n     as part of the whole picture of human history in the wider \n     transportation corridor including early Native trade routes, \n     connections by waterway, mining trail, and other routes;\n       (8) national heritage area designation also provides \n     communities within the region with the motivation and means \n     for ``grassroots'' regional coordination and partnerships \n     with each other and with borough, State, and Federal \n     agencies; and\n       (9) national heritage area designation is supported by the \n     Kenai Peninsula Historical Association, the Seward Historical \n     Commission, the Seward City Council, the Hope and Sunrise \n     Historical Society, the Hope Chamber of Commerce, the Alaska \n     Association for Historic Preservation, the Cooper Landing \n     Community Club, the Alaska Wilderness Recreation and Tourism \n     Association, Anchorage Historic Properties, the Anchorage \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Cook Inlet Historical \n     Society, the Moose Pass Sportsman's Club, the Alaska \n     Historical Commission, the Gridwood Board of Supervisors, the \n     Kenai River Special Management Area Advisory Board, the Bird/\n     Indian Community Council, the Kenai Peninsula Borough Trails \n     Commission, the Alaska Division of Parks and Recreation, the \n     Kenai Peninsula Borough, the Kenai Peninsula Tourism \n     Marketing Council, and the Anchorage Municipal Assembly.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recognize, preserve, and interpret the historic and \n     modern resource development and cultural landscapes of the \n     Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm historic transportation \n     corridor, and to promote and facilitate the public enjoyment \n     of these resources; and\n       (2) to foster, through financial and technical assistance, \n     the development of cooperative planning and partnerships \n     among the communities and borough, State, and Federal \n     Government entities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, we are now dealing with a very important \nissue to the future of our country; and that is the price of energy; \noil and gas, gasoline, and home heating fuel prices. They have been \ngoing up at a dramatic rate.\n  This is not a surprise. This is an event predicted and warned about \nby Members of this Congress for years, including Senator Murkowski, who \nchairs the Energy Committee. I have talked about it for the last 3 or 4 \nyears that I have been in this Senate.\n  This is what the issue is about. By allowing our domestic energy \nproduction to decline steadily, we have less and less ability to \ncontrol prices in the world market, and, in fact, we become more and \nmore vulnerable to price increases and production reductions by the \nOPEC oil cartel--that group of nations centered in the Middle East that \nget together to fix prices by manipulating production levels.\n  We now find ourselves in a very serious predicament. It is not a \npredicament that a simple release of a little oil from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve is going to help. It threatens our economy in the \nlong term.\n  Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the U.N., just wrote an editorial \nthat I saw over the weekend. He has predicted that the poorer nations, \nthe developing nations, will be hurt more by rising energy prices than \nthe wealthy nations, but he does not dispute that wealthy nations will \nalso be damaged.\n  This increase in fuel costs amounts to a tax on the American people. \nIt comes right out of their pocket every time they go to the gas \nstation.\n  Now we have this ``bold'' plan of the Gore-Clinton administration to \nrelease 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \nThis is supposed to be a solution to this problem, it is supposed to \nreally help. But what this recent action really amounts to, is\n\n[[Page S9209]]\n\nclosing the barn door after the horse is out.\n  Releasing 30 million barrels of oil will meet no more than 1\\1/2\\ \ndays demand for energy in America. We consume nearly 20 million barrels \nof oil per day in this country. A 30-million barrel release will not \naffect, in any significant way, the problems we are facing. That is a \nfact.\n  Oil demand is not elastic. That is the crux of this problem. People \nhave to have it. If you are traveling to work in your automobile--and \nthere is no other way to get to work for an overwhelming number of \nAmerican citizens, students, workers, and kids going to school--you \nmust use gasoline and pay the price it costs.\n  So the way this thing has worked is this: The OPEC nations over the \nyears saw economies around the world steadily strengthening. Third \nWorld nations, began using more automobiles and electricity, increasing \ndemand for oil, using more energy. We salute them for that. The life \nspan for people in countries that have readily available electricity \nand energy is almost one-half longer than for those in countries that \ndo not have it. We ought to celebrate poor countries being able to \nimprove their standard of living. But as they improve their standard of \nliving, their demand for energy increases. It is happening more and \nmore around the world, and we should be happy quality of life is \nimproving for third world nations. But as demand increased, oil prices \nremained at a steady rate for a significant period, then OPEC withdrew \nits production.\n\n  You have to understand, it does not take much of a difference in \nproduction to spike the price. That is exactly what happened. They cut \nproduction below the world demand. To get the oil and gasoline that \npeople around the world needed, they were willing to pay a higher \nprice. They had to pay a higher price to fill up their gas tank. People \ncould not stop buying gas when the price went from $1 to $1.50 to \n$1.80. They had to keep buying gas, just as all of us do in this \ncountry today. So the shortfall does not have to be large to give them \nthat kind of manipulative power over the price.\n  This Administration has blamed the oil industry. I have no doubt that \nif the oil industry could make a few cents more per gallon, they would \ntry to do so at any point in time. But let's remember, a little over a \nyear ago, in my State of Alabama, you could buy gasoline for $1 a \ngallon. Of that $1 of gasoline you bought, 40 cents of it was tax. So \nreally you were paying only 60 cents for a gallon of gas, less than a \ngallon of water.\n  That gasoline was probably produced somewhere in Saudi Arabia, \nrefined, and shipped here in ships on which they spend billions to keep \nas safe as they possibly can. It is transported, 24 hours a day, to gas \nstations around the country. You take a gas pump nozzle, put it in the \nreceptacle, and the gas goes into your tank. Nobody ever doubts the \nquality of the gasoline or likely gives much thought to where it came \nfrom. It is a remarkable thing that the oil industry can do that. Does \nanybody think a Government agency could do that? No, sir.\n  So what happened? When OPEC cut their production, it spiked the world \nprice--and they have a world market for oil--a barrel of oil which was \nselling for $13, $12, has now hit $36 a barrel and it may be going \nhigher because of price manipulation.\n  The price has gone up 50, 60, 70 cents a gallon. What does that \nreally mean? It is not like an American tax on gasoline where we take \nthat 40 cents with which to build roads and other things. It is a tax \nby OPEC on us. Foreign countries that are supplying us their oil are in \neffect charging us 40, 50 cents more for a gallon of gas which every \nAmerican is paying. It is a drain on the wealth of this country. It \nthreatens our economic vitality and growth.\n  You may say: ``Jeff, why didn't we do a better job of producing \noil?'' There are some who say this administration has no energy policy. \nI don't agree. It has a policy. It is a no-growth, no-production \npolicy. It has been that policy for the last 7\\1/2\\ years. If Al Gore \nis elected President, it will continue, and you ain't seen nothing yet \nwhen it comes to the price for fuel in this country. That is a plain \nfact.\n  We have tremendous reserves in Alaska for example. We voted on this \nfloor--and the vote was vetoed by the administration--to produce oil \nand gas from the tremendous ANWR reserves. Oh, they said, it is a \npristine area, and America will be polluted. The fact is, there are oil \nwells all around this country. People live right next to them. Oil \nwells do not pollute. But despite this plain fact, the Administration \nrefused to allow production.\n  It has been reported, the ANWR reserves could be safely produced in \nan area less than the size of Dulles Airport serving the Washington, DC \narea. We would not destroy the Alaskan environment as we produce oil \nand gas there. Unfortunately, this administration would rather us pay \nSaudi Arabia, Kuwait and the sheiks for it rather than produce it in \nour own country, keeping the wealth here.\n  They say: ``Some of that Alaskan oil is sold to Japan''. Economically \nthat does not make any difference. When you sell it to Japan, you get \nmoney from Japan. You can buy it from Saudi Arabia, or wherever you buy \nit from--Venezuela. It makes no difference in economic terms.\n  That is a bogus argument, as any person who thinks about it would \nunderstand. The more we produce here, the less wealth of our Nation is \ntransferred outside our Nation.\n  Fundamentally, this increase in prices was not driven so much by \nsupply and demand. It was driven by a cartel. If this administration \nwants to address antitrust crimes, maybe they ought to worry less about \nMicrosoft and worry more about this cartel that has come together to \ndrive up energy prices. They have driven it up through political means.\n  We, as American citizens, need to ask our Government: What political \nmeans are you using, Mr. Clinton, to overcome this threat? What are you \nproposing, Mr. Gore, to overcome that? Windmills? Eliminate the \ninternal combustion engine? Is that your proposal? Are we going to use \nsolar energy production?\n  I support various alternatives. I voted for ethanol. I voted for a \npilot program to determine whether a switch grass could be utilized to \nproduce energy, and it has potential. I supported the advanced vehicle \ntechnology programs and renewable energy research. But these \ntechnologies are a drop in the bucket compared to what we need to deal \nwith our energy demands in this Nation.\n  Think about what we are doing. We are seeing major impacts on \nAmerican consumers. If a family had an average monthly bill for \ngasoline of $60, when that gallon of gasoline went from $1 to $1.50, \nthat means that the bill per month went from $60 to $90, a $30-a-month \nafter tax draw on that family's budget for no other reason than an \nincrease in gasoline prices. If the bill was $100 a month, and many \nfamilies will pay more than that, it has become $150. It is a $50-a-\nmonth draw on their budget.\n  This is a matter of great national importance. It need not happen. \nThe experts are in agreement. There are sufficient energy reserves in \nour country to increase the supply and meet demand. Our government \ncould drive down these prices. But we have to have an administration \nthat believes in producing oil and gas, not an administration that is \nsystematically, repeatedly blocking attempts at more production.\n  For example, there is a procedure used in my home State of Alabama \ncalled hydraulic fracturing. It is used in the production of coalbed \nmethane. In some areas, coal may not be of sufficient quality and \nquantity to mine, but it does have methane in it. What has been \ndiscovered is that you can drill into the coal and produce methane from \nit with almost no disruption of the environment.\n  Methane is one of the cleanest burning fossil fuels we can have. It \nis far better for the environment than many competing fuels. Production \nof coalbed methane is something we ought to encourage. Hydraulic \nfracturing of coalbeds has never caused a single case of underground \ndrinking water contamination. In fact, for years, the EPA did not \nbother to regulate it. Then somebody filed a lawsuit. Because the use \nof this technology for coalbed methane production is relatively new, \nCongress had never addressed it. The lawsuit argued that pumping water \ninto the ground needed to be regulated in the same way as injecting \nhazardous waste\n\n[[Page S9210]]\n\ninto the ground because there was no other statutory framework to \napply. This has caused coalbed methane producers to go through all \nkinds of extensive regulatory procedures and generally depressed \ncoalbed methane production activities. The EPA never really wanted to \nregulate, and in fact, argued that hydraulic fracturing did not need to \nbe regulated at the federal level because it had caused no \nenvironmental problems and the state programs were working well. \nUnfortunately, the court ruled against the EPA because the law which \ngoverns this activity was written at a time this activity barely \nexisted. I have introduced legislation which would allow the states to \ncontinue their successful regulatory programs. Yet we have been unable \nto get the kind of support from the administration and the EPA that \nwould allow us to produce this clean form of gas all across America. It \nwould be good for our country. That is an example of the no growth, no \nproduction policy of the administration.\n\n  We have taken out of the mix, the possibility of drilling in so many \nof our western lands that are Government owned. There are huge areas \nout there with very large reserves of gas and oil. Yet, this \nadministration has systematically blocked production. They have vetoed \nlegislation--which we almost overrode--to keep us from drilling in \nANWR. They have refused to drill off the coast of California. They have \nrefused to drill and are proposing to limit drilling in the Gulf of \nMexico. In fact, Vice President Gore recently, stated he favored no \nmore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and in fact would limit, perhaps, \nleases that had already been let.\n  That is a big deal. Electric energy in America is being produced more \nand more through the use of natural gas. In addition to home heating, \nit is being increasingly used to generate electricity. It is generating \nit far cleaner than most any other source of energy. Almost every new \nelectric-generating plant in this country has been designed to use \nnatural gas. It comes through pipelines. Most of it is coming out of \nthe Gulf of Mexico. There are huge reserves off the gulf coast of my \nhome State of Alabama and throughout the gulf area. That ought to be \nproduced.\n  It is unbelievable that we would not produce that clean natural gas, \nbut instead continue to import our oil from the Middle East and allow a \nhuge tax to be levied on American citizens by the OPEC cartel members. \nIt makes no sense at all. As anybody who has been here knows, they know \nwhat the policy is. The policy of the extreme no-growth people in \nAmerica is to drive up the price of gasoline. They figure if they drive \nit up high enough, you will have to ride your bicycle to work, I \nsuppose. But most people don't live a few blocks or miles from work. A \nlot of people are elderly. A lot of people have children to take to \nschool, and they have to take things with them when they go to work. \nThey have errands to run and family obligations to meet. They cannot \nuse bicycles or rely on windmills to do their work.\n  That is the policy of this administration, to drive up energy costs. \nThat is the only way you can see it. Systematically, they have blocked \neffort after effort after effort to allow this country to increase \nproduction. We have to change that. Our current energy problems will \nonly get worse if we do not.\n  We have tremendous energy reserves in America. If we insist on sound \nenvironmental protection but not excessive regulation, if we make sure \nthat production in areas such as ANWR in Alaska is conducted as \nprevious Alaskan oil and gas production has been conducted we can make \ngreat strides in controlling our energy prices. The Trans-Alaskan \nPipeline, has been delivering oil for two decades now and has had a \nminimal impact on the environment and not destroyed anything. The \ncaribou are still there. The tundra has not melted. America has \nbenefited from the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline and the energy that has been \nproduced there. We certainly cannot stop producing oil and gas in the \nGulf of Mexico, as the Vice President has proposed. That idea is \nstunning. It is a radical proposal. It is a threat to our future. We \ncannot allow it.\n  We cannot assume, we cannot take for granted one moment the belief \nthat this release of a supply equal to 1\\1/2\\ day's demand is going to \ndeal with our long-term problem. We have an administration that is \ncheerfully accepting, increased prices American must pay for energy. \nThose prices are going to continue to increase unless we do something \nabout it. It does not take a huge increase in supply to help better \nbalance demand and supply. So if we can begin to make even modest \nprogress toward increasing our domestic supply, I think we can begin to \nsee the price fall in a relatively short term. However, we cannot do it \nwith the kinds of no-growth policies this administration is talking \nabout.\n  I do believe in improving the environment. I support the policies \nthat do so. I support research in many alternative energy sources and \nhope we will see some break throughs. I hope we will continue to \ndevelop technologies to increase the quality of the energy sources, \nwhich could make the use of energy cleaner and more efficient. I think \nthese are good prudent steps to take.\n  But with the world demand we are facing, these efforts have not yet \nled to a big step--a good step, but not a big step. We are going to see \nincreased demand in the United States and around the world. The experts \ntell us there is energy here in the United States. We need to be able \nto produce it and not continue to allow the wealth of this Nation to be \ntransferred across the ocean to a few nations that were lucky enough to \nbe founded on pools of oil.\n  That must remain our goal. That is what I and others will continue to \nworking for in this Congress.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I join my colleague from Alabama in \nnoting that what the President is doing on SPR, in my view, is a \ndiversion. It is not solving the fundamental problem we have with the \nenergy supply in this country--either the refining capacity that has \nbeen limited, as the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, has spoken of, \nor the supply of the raw resource, about which the Senator from Alaska \nand others have spoken. We need to be able to get access to that, and \nthis administration has stopped that from taking place. They stopped it \nfrom taking place on our shores and stopped an expansion of biomass, \nbiofuels, and ethanol production. They have not been supportive of \nexpansion there as well. They stopped expansion in places such as in \nCentral Asia, in which I have done a fair amount of work. There are \nlarge reserves of hydrocarbons and oil and gas there. They have done \nnothing to bring this on-line. Yet countries in that region of the \nworld--many of which most people haven't heard of--have, I believe, the \nthird largest pool of hydrocarbons in the world. They are seeking ways \nto get it out to the West in an oil and gas pipeline. This \nadministration hasn't done anything to get that started.\n  So here we are today with high fuel prices, with no end in sight. \nDespite the President's diversion by using SPR and the misuse of this \nprogram--the way it was set up at least, the fundamental problem \nremains. We have to deal with the supply issue, and this administration \nhasn't done that. I applaud my colleague from Alabama for addressing \nthat issue.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator has been here, as I have, \nfor nearly 4 years now. I want to just ask him this: Has Senator \nMurkowski, who chairs the Energy Committee, and others in this \nCongress, been warning for years about this, saying that we were denied \nAmerican production, that it was going to come back to haunt us and \nprices would go up and it would drain our wealth? Have they been urging \nthis administration for years to deal with it and support some \nproduction?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Absolutely. He has been stating that for a long period \nof time. The administration, each step along the way, has continued to \nthwart, stall, and say things that were positive but with no action. \nThat is what I have seen taking place in pushing for marginal well tax \ncredits for\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\nsmall oil well production such as we have in Kansas. We need to \nencourage this domestic production. Let's have a tax credit for these \nmarginal oil wells that produce less than 10 barrels a day. You get \npositive comments from the administration, but then nothing happens. On \nbiofuels or Central Asia, there is enormous capacity in that region for \noil and gas. Yes, this takes place, but what are you going to do to \ncause this to happen? What is your strategy? Nothing is put forward.\n  Here we are with high gas prices and high heating oil. My parents \nburn propane to heat their home. They are paying a significant premium \nprice now. All of these things are taking place, and then their answer \nis to tap this 1\\1/2\\ day supply, instead of dealing with fundamentals \nwhich they have failed to do over a period of time. So we have been \nwarned. I hope we can press the administration, and I hope this is \nsomething to which people pay attention.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for those comments, and I do think \nit is important for America. The average citizen doesn't have time to \nwatch debate here and hear what goes on in committees, but this has \nbeen a matter of real contention for a number of years. There have been \nwarnings by people such as Senator Murkowski, who chairs the Energy \nCommittee, and others, that this would occur, and it has now occurred. \nI think it is particularly a condemnation of the policy when you have \nbeen told about the consequences and warned about it publicly and still \nyou have not acted. That, to me, is troubling. I appreciate the \nSenator's comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9211-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE PACKERS AND STOCKYARDS ENFORCEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address something about which \nthe occupant of the chair has a great deal of concern. A bill was \nintroduced recently by Senator Grassley from Iowa. I support his bill, \nthe Packers and Stockyards Enforcement Improvement Act of 2000. I think \nthis is a commonsense approach to a very difficult agricultural \nantitrust concern taking place. I applaud Senator Grassley's approach \nand endorse his Stockyards Enforcement Act of 2000.\n  Concerns about concentration and market monopolization have risen in \nrecent years, with the remaining low prices that farmers have received \nand the struggle that we have had to adopt and adapt to the globalized \ncommerce that we see taking place.\n  I was visiting yesterday with my dad, who farms full time in Kansas, \nand my brother who farms with him, about concerns regarding the \nconcentration and the low prices taking place and what is happening \naround them.\n  What Senator Grassley has done is request a GAO study, and he found \nthat the USDA has not adequately put forward efforts of enforcement in \nthe packers and stockyards field, and that needs to take place. He is \ntaking the GAO study and putting it into legislative language. I \nbelieve it would be prudent and wise for this Congress to pass that \nlanguage.\n  Senator Grassley's bill spells out specific reforms that will make a \ndirect difference in the way antitrust issues and anticompetitive \npractices are dealt with. Specifically, the bill will require USDA to \nformulate and improve investigation and case methods for competition-\nrelated allegations in consultation with the Department of Justice and \nthe Federal Trade Commission; integrate attorney and economist teams, \nwith attorney input from the very beginning of an investigation, rather \nthan merely signing off at the end of the inquiry.\n\n  It turns out that the GAO study reports that the economists are \nlooking at the cases early on but the attorneys are not. The attorneys \nneed to be involved at the very outset. By the nature of these charges, \nthey are legal issues and should be looked at by attorneys at the very \noutset. It would establish specific training programs for attorneys and \ninvestigators involved in antitrust investigations. It would require a \nreport to Congress on the state of the market and concerns about \nanticompetitive practices.\n  Senator Grassley, today, chaired a hearing that further illuminated \nthe problems, needs, and solutions.\n  Senator Grassley's bill comes after a thorough examination of USDA's \nenforcement of the Packer's and Stockyards Act by the GAO. That report, \nreleased last week, found numerous problems in the way the agency \napproaches these investigations. I have to say, as somebody whose \nfamily is directly involved in farming, who has been secretary of \nagriculture for the State of Kansas, it troubles me when the Department \nis having difficulties enforcing this very important area of the law.\n  This bill simply puts into law these GAO recommendations for USDA \nreform. This bill is necessary because USDA has been struggling to \naddress many of these concerns raised by the GAO in terms of antitrust \nenforcement over the past 3 years. This issue has been raised in the \nKansas State Legislature this last session with a great deal of concern \nabout really who is watching. Are they properly prepared and adequately \nstaffed to look into these antitrust investigations and allegations? \nThis bill gets reforms done within a year and ensures that the law is \nbeing enforced.\n  Today's agricultural markets are in tough shape. Prices are too low. \nWe cannot, however, make assumptions about concentration as the cause \nwithout having accurate information and thorough investigations. Under \nSenator Grassley's bill, this process will be greatly improved because \nit requires USDA to retool and devote more resources to the area of \nantitrust enforcement.\n  This bill avoids the pitfalls of lumping the innocent in with the \nguilty and instead sorts out anticompetitive practices where they \noccur. These reforms are necessary to restore producer confidence in \nthe Packers and Stockyards Act and USDA's ability to police this \nincreasingly concentrated industry.\n  Again, I thank Senator Grassley for his wise approach on this tough \nissue and his continued sincere concern for the farmers of this Nation. \nThis has been an excellent effort to move forward by Senator Grassley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9211-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9211-S9213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE VETERANS CLAIMS ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, there is a substitute amendment at the \ndesk submitted by Senators Specter and Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) for Mr. Specter and \n     Mr. Rockefeller proposes an amendment numbered 4189.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain \nbriefly an action that I, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, propose to take today with respect to a House-passed \nbill, H.R. 4864. I take this action with the concurrence and support of \nthe committee's ranking member, Senator Jay rockefeller and Senator \nPatty Murray, the original sponsor of Senate legislation, S. 1810, to \nreinstate VA's duty to assist claimants in the preparation of their \nclaims.\n  In 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans claims \nissued a ruling, Morton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 477 (1999), which had the \neffect of barring the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from offering \nits assistance to\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\nveterans and other claimants in preparing and presenting their claims \nto VA prior to the veteran first accumulating sufficient evidence to \nshow that his or her claim is ``well grounded.'' This decision \noverturned a long history of VA practice under which VA had taken upon \nitself a duty to assist veterans in gathering evidence and otherwise \npreparing their claims for VA adjudication. That practice was grounded \nin a long VA tradition of non-adversarial practice in the \nadministrative litigation of veterans' claims.\n  For over a year, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs has worked \nto craft, and then to develop VA and veterans service organization \nsupport for, a legislative solution that returns VA to the pre-Morton \nstatus quo ante, and reinstates VA's duty to assist veterans and other \nclaimants in the preparation of their claims. The product of the Senate \ncommittee's work is contained in section 101 of S. 1810, a bill which \nwas approved by the Senate on September 21, 2000. Since S. 1810 was \nreported, however, committee staff has worked with the staff of the \nHouse Veterans' Affairs Committee to reconcile the provisions of \nsection 101 of S. 1810 and a similar bill, H.R. 4864, which passed the \nHouse of Representatives on July 25, 2000.\n  The Senate and House committees have now reached such an agreement, \nand have reconciled the differences between the Senate- and House-\npassed provisions. Those differences--which are, principally, matters \nof tone and emphasis, not substance--are contained in the proposed \namendment to H.R. 4864 which I present to the Senate today and which is \nexplained in detail in the staff-prepared joint explanatory statement \nwhich I have filed with the amendment's text. This compromise agreement \nhas been reached after extensive consultation with VA's general counsel \nand the major veterans service organizations.\n  I now ask that the Senate approve this compromise agreement by \napproving the proposed amendments to H.R. 4864. The House will then be \nin a position to approve the Senate-passed amendments to the House bill \nand send this legislation to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, as \namended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4189) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 4864), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the Senate \nhas passed this bill to reestablish the Department of Veterans Affairs' \nduty to assist veterans in developing their claims for benefits from \nthe Department. Senator Murray, who introduced the original Senate \nbill, S. 1810, that led to this compromise bill should be praised for \nher leadership on this issue.\n  The ``duty to assist,'' along with other principles such as giving \nthe veteran the benefit of the doubt in benefits' determinations, are \nparts of what make the relationship between the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) and the claimant unique in the Federal Government. \nCongress has long recognized that this Nation owes a special obligation \nto its veterans. The system to provide benefits to veterans was never \nintended to be adversarial or difficult for the veteran to navigate. \nThat is why Congress codified, in the Veterans Judicial Review Act of \n1988 (Public Law 100-687), these longstanding practices of the VA to \nhelp claimants develop their claims for veterans benefits.\n  Over time, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims attempted to \ngive meaning to loosely defined, but well-ingrained concepts of law. In \nCaluza v. Brown, the Court identified three requirements that would be \nnecessary to establish a well-grounded claim, which the Court viewed as \na prerequisite to VA's duty to assist. These requirements were: (1) a \nmedical diagnosis of a current disability; (2) medical or lay evidence \nof the inservice occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and \n(3) medical evidence of a nexus or link between an inservice injury or \ndisease and the current disability. Through a series of cases, which \nculminated in Morton v. West, the Court ruled that VA has no authority \nto develop claims that are not ``well-grounded.'' This resulted in a \nchange of practice where VA no longer sought records or offered medical \nexaminations and opinions to assist the veteran in ``grounding'' the \nclaim.\n  Veterans advocates, VA, and Congress grew very concerned over this \nsituation and the resulting potential unfairness to veterans. Veterans \nmay be required to submit records that are in the government's \npossession (e.g., VA medical records, military service records, etc.). \nAlso, veterans who could not afford medical treatment and did not live \nnear or did not use a VA medical facility (and thus had no medical \nrecords to submit) would not be provided a medical exam. Many veterans \nclaims were denied as not well-grounded.\n  Therefore, Congress, with significant input from the veterans service \norganizations and VA, developed legislation to correct this problem. \nH.R. 4864, as amended, reflects the compromise language developed \njointly by the staff of the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' \nAffairs. I believe that this bill restores VA to its pre-Morton duty to \nassist, as well as enhances VA's obligation to notify claimants of what \nis necessary to establish a claim and what evidence VA has not been \nable to obtain before it makes its decision on the claim.\n  In developing this compromise, it was very important to me to ensure \nthat veterans will get all the assistance that is necessary and \nrelevant to their claim for benefits. This assistance should include \nobtaining records, providing medical examinations to determine the \nveteran's disability or opinions as to whether the disability is \nrelated to service, or any other assistance that VA needs to decide the \nclaim. On the other hand, it was also important to balance this duty \nagainst the futility of requiring VA to develop claims where there is \nno reasonable possibility that the assistance would substantiate the \nclaim. For example, wartime service is a statutory requirement for VA \nnon-service-connected pension benefits. Therefore, if a veteran with \nonly peacetime service sought pension, no level of assistance would \nhelp the veteran prove the claim; and if VA were to spend time \ndeveloping such a claim, some other veteran's claim where assistance \nwould be helpful would be delayed. However we need to ensure that the \nbar is no longer set so high that veterans with meritorious claims will \nbe turned away without assistance.\n  H.R. 4864, as amended, does specify certain types and levels of \nassistance for compensation claims. The majority of VA's new casework \nis in making these initial disability determinations. If the record \ncould be developed properly the first time the veteran submits an \napplication for benefits, subsequent appeals or claims for rating \nincreases or for service connection for additional conditions would be \nmuch more accurate and efficient.\n  The compromise bill provides that VA shall provide a veteran a \nmedical examination or a medical opinion when such an exam or opinion \nis necessary to make a decision on the claim. The bill specifies one \ninstance when an exam or opinion is necessary--when there is competent \nevidence that the veteran has a disability or symptoms that may be \nrelated to service, but there is not sufficient evidence to make a \ndecision. This determination may be based upon a lay statement by the \nveteran on a subject that he or she is competent to speak about. That \nis, if a veteran comes to VA claiming that she or he has a pain in his \nleg that may be related to service--and there is no evidence that the \nveteran, for example, was awarded a workers compensation claim for a \nleg disability last month--VA must provide an examination or opinion. \nThe veteran can probably not provide evidence that the pain is due to \ntraumatic arthritis; that would requires a doctor's expertise. H.R. \n4864 does recognize that there are many other instances when a medical \nexamination or opinion would be appropriate or necessary.\n  Again, by specifying certain types of assistance for compensation \nclaims,\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\nthe bill does not limit VA's assistance to those types of claims or to \na specific type of assistance. It expressly provides that nothing in \nthe bill prevents the Secretary from rendering whatever assistance is \nnecessary. It also does not undo some of the complementary Court \ndecisions that require the VA to render certain additional types of \nassistance, such as those required in McCormick v. Gober.\n  Although VA is moving its claims adjudication system toward a team-\nbased, case management system that will result in better service and \ncommunication with claimants, I felt that it was critical to include \nrequirements that VA explain to claimants what information and evidence \nwill be needed to prove their claim. VA will also be required to \nexplain what information and evidence it would secure (e.g., medical \nrecords, service medical records, etc.) and what information the \nclaimant should submit (e.g., marriage certificate, Social Security \nnumber, etc.). Currently, many veterans are asked for information in a \npiecemeal fashion and don't know what VA is doing to secure other \nevidence. Better communication will lead to expedited decisionmaking \nand higher satisfaction in the process.\n  H.R. 4864, as amended, provides for retroactive applications of the \nbill's duty to assist provisions, as well as the enhanced notice \nprocedures. Now, claimants that were denied due to the Morton decision \nwill be able to have their claims readjudicated in accordance with the \nprovisions of this bill and receive VA's full duty to assist. This will \nalso ensure an earlier effective date if their claim is successful.\n  It is critical that we honor our commitment to veterans and their \nfamilies. We should not create technicalities and bureaucratic hoops \nfor them to jump through. I am pleased that Congress is able to move \nthis provision and begin the restoration of VA's duty to assist \nclaimants in developing the evidence and information necessary to \nestablish their claims for veterans benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/25/senate-section/article/S9213-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
