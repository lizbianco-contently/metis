Mr. President, like millions of Americans last night, \nI watched the Presidential debate with a great deal of interest. It was \none of the more memorable debates in recent history for a number of \nreasons.\n  First, of course, as a Republican, I was very proud of the job that \nGovernor Bush did. It is probably fair to say that he was matched \nagainst a very experienced debater, Vice President Gore, but I think \nthe Governor held his own in many respects. From the broad issues of \nprescription drugs to Medicare, education to energy, Governor Bush very \nclearly laid out what the choice is for the American people in this \nelection.\n  Governor Bush engaged the issues. They were not dodged. The Governor \nwas clear in laying out the goals and objectives he would propose in \nhis administration, if he were elected President.\n  I was particularly pleased with the debate because it focused on \nenergy, which is one of the crucial issues facing the American people \ntoday and has probably received the least publicity. Obviously, in the \nareas of education, prescription drugs, health, and Social Security, we \nare all trying to build a better structure, a long lasting structure, \nand also address what to do with the surplus.\n  But the issue on energy is quite clear. We have a crisis in this \ncountry. It has developed over a period of the last 7\\1/2\\ years. It \nhas not been addressed by the current administration. I am very pleased \nthat we have, in the energy area, a distinct separation on the issues \nbetween the candidates, and the American public can clearly understand \nand, as a consequence, view the merits of each proposal.\n  The Vice President said, in regard to a question on energy policy, \nand I quote:\n\n       I am for doing something on the supply side and the \n     consumption side.\n\n  I have no doubt that that is the case, but I point out in the past 8 \nyears we haven't had any indication of specifically what the Vice \nPresident would do on these issues. As a consequence, I think he is \nheaded in the wrong direction, and the American public are becoming \nmore and more aware.\n  What we have seen happen is the emergence of an issue that in many \nrespects our friends on the other side of the aisle hope will go away \nor not become a major issue prior to the election. With the increasing \nrise in crude oil--10 days ago it was up to an all-time high in 10 \nyears of $37; it dropped down with the SPR release; now it is coming up \nagain--the American public is becoming aware of how crucial not our \ndependence on imported oil necessarily is but the general concern that \nwe have sacrificed our traditional areas of dependence on energy, \nwhether it be coal, nuclear, or hydro, for a policy that has been \nfostered by this administration that directs everything towards \nutilization of natural gas.\n  As a consequence, we have seen the price of natural gas rise from \n$2.16 per thousand cubic feet 10 months ago to better than $5.00 in the \nlast quotes that have come out within the last couple weeks. We have \nseen a tremendous increase in the dependence on natural gas at the \nexpense of all our other energy sources.\n  This has occurred over an 8-year period of time. During that time, \nClinton-Gore have to stand accountable for what they have done. On the \nsupply side, the Vice President has done something. It is a situation \nthat the supplies have decreased 18 percent and on the consumption \nside, consumption has increased 14 percent. In spite of our efforts for \nconservation, in spite of our efforts in alternative energy, we have a \ndecreased supply and an increased consumption.\n  I was astonished when the Vice President said in his response to a \nquestion on energy policy, and again I quote:\n\n       We need to get serious about this energy crisis in the \n     Congress and in the White House.\n\n  Where has he been for the last 7\\1/2\\ years? While I don't agree with \nhim in terms of Congress not being serious, I was glad to see they \nfinally admitted it was not an issue taken seriously in the White House \nfor the past 7\\1/2\\ years. That was certainly the implication.\n  We have had statements from our Secretary of Energy relative to the \nfact that the administration was caught napping with regard to energy \nprices, as we have seen the price of oil go from $10 a barrel a year \nago to $37 within the last few weeks.\n  Now, I think, while it didn't come up in the debate last night \nspecifically, there was a generalization to blame big oil. Well, who is \nbig oil, Mr. President? Who sets the price of oil? We had a hearing \nbefore the Energy and Natural Resource Committee, which I chair. It was \nrather interesting because the Secretary of Energy did acknowledge that \nit is OPEC, the supplier, setting the price of oil. We are 58-percent \ndependent on OPEC. Who is OPEC? The Mideast countries that have the \nexcess capacity, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and moving down to \nCentral America is Venezuela, and then we also have Mexico. They have \nthe supply; we have the appetite. They set the price. So to blame big \noil for profiteering, or to make the implication of profiteering, is \ntotally unrealistic and a bit irresponsible, in my opinion. There is no \nmention, of course, in general terms of the assumption that perhaps our \noil industry was simply benevolent when they were selling at $10 a \nbarrel a little more than a year ago. They are not so benevolent now \nbecause, obviously, they don't set the price. It is a supply and demand \nissue.\n  When the Vice President said we needed to get serious about the \nenergy crisis, I think it is apparent that there has been a lack of \nattention during this in the administration, because Congress has \nacted. Specifically, Congress passed legislation granting deep water \nroyalty relief. Congress passed legislation to help our domestic oil \nand gas industry through tax incentives, which they vetoed. Congress \npassed legislation that would handle the country's nuclear waste, which \nthey vetoed. Congress passed legislation to open up the Coastal Plain \nof ANWR--that sliver in the Arctic--to responsible development, which \nthey vetoed. That was 6 years ago. Had they passed that legislation, we \nwould know what is there. We could have another strategic petroleum \nreserve, and we don't know that. We would be a long way into the \ndevelopment stages if indeed the oil were there. I venture to say, Mr. \nPresident, if we made a commitment to proceed with the Arctic oil \nreserve, you would see a dramatic drop in the price of oil.\n  One of the other interesting things the Vice President brought up was \nthe implication that we hadn't done anything, or not enough, with \nrenewables. In the last 5 years under the Republican Congress, \nexpenditures for renewables have been $1.5 billion in new spending and \n$4.5 billion in various tax incentives. So Congress anteed up about \n$4.6 billion total for that purpose. The difficulty is that we simply \ndon't have the technology to replace our oil dependence with coal, \nnatural gas, and hydrogen.\n  Let's not be fooled. It is not just around the corner. The Vice \nPresident said last night he is a big clean coal fan. Well, what does \nthat really mean? You would assume he would support the development of \ncoal-fired generating plants in this country. There hasn't been a new \none built in years. The administration's budget over the last 5 years \nhas proposed to rescind or defer more than $1.4 billion in clean coal \ntechnology. Those are the facts.\n  How can you be all things to all people? Well, Vice President Gore \nimplies he is pretty good at that. Let's talk a little bit about the \nfacts because part of the issue that came up on energy was the \ndisposition of the Coastal Plain in Alaska, the State I represent. I \nknow something about it. I have been to the coastal plain many, many \ntimes. I think once again we saw the Vice President in trouble with the \nfacts. This is what he said regarding the Arctic Coastal Plain, and I \nquote:\n\n       I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a \n     few months' worth of oil, and oil would not start flowing for \n     years into the future.\n\n  Well, the facts are, according to the Department of Energy--the \nClinton-\n\n[[Page S9789]]\n\nGore Department of Energy--this area could be the largest field ever \ndiscovered in North America--possibly 16 billion barrels of recoverable \noil. If that high estimate of oil is found, it could produce over 20 \npercent of our current domestic production levels for the next 20 \nyears. If the high estimate is found, it would be larger than Prudhoe \nBay, which has been doing just that--producing 20 to 25 percent of our \noil for almost the last 25 years.\n\n  I am not surprised that Vice President Gore has a problem with the \nfacts on this issue. One need only read his official position on why he \nwants to ``protect the Arctic Coastal Plain'' to see that he is \nterribly misinformed. He says, ``The wildlife refuge's Coastal Plain--\nwhere drilling would occur--is home to polar bears, grizzlies and black \nbear, Dall sheep, wolves and moose.''\n  I know something about this area. I assure you there are no black \nbears and no Dall sheep in the Coastal Plain. Dall sheep are a \nmountainous species, and perhaps some Members in this body would have \nyou believe otherwise, but there are no mountains in the Coastal \nPlains. It is very flat for miles and miles and miles.\n  What did Governor Bush say? Well, Governor Bush said it is better to \nproduce energy here at home, where we can do it in an environmentally \nsound manner than to continue relying on imported sources of energy. I \nparticularly agree that it is better that we explore at home, using our \ntechnology and environmental sensitivity, and do it right, rather than \ngoing over to the rain forests in Colombia, where there are no \nenvironmental constraints and they would ship it into this country on \nforeign tankers, which have the exposure to an accident off our shores \nby companies that don't have the deep pockets associated with the \ntragic accident that occurred in my State. Nevertheless, it seems as if \nthis administration would continue to rely on the likes of Saddam \nHussein for our energy security. That is about where we are.\n  I am going to conclude my presentation this morning on one segment of \nour energy policy that needs clarification. It is an issue that the \nenvironmental community has perpetrated on our American citizens; that \nis, that there is something extraordinarily unique, and there is \nsomething that, by its implication, suggests that we cannot explore \nand, if we find hydrocarbons, develop them safely. That is the argument \nover ANWR--or, as we refer to it, the Coastal Plain--a small portion of \nthe area which is proposed to be opened for exploration and can only be \ndone by the Congress of the United States.\n  Before I go into it, I think the public should be aware of another \nfact that has come up. You will recall the other day the Vice President \nrecommended to the President that we release crude oil from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, about 30 million barrels. That 30 million \nbarrels was estimated to be a supply of heating oil, after it was \nrefined, that would equal about a 3-day supply. I think it was about 3 \nor 4 million barrels of heating oil we would get out of that release.\n  I think it is also interesting to recognize that in the wintertime we \nconsume about 4 million barrels of distillate--including heating oil a \nday. What I can't understand is the reality that we are exporting \nheating oil--heating oil that ordinarily you would assume would be \ngoing into inventories to meet the anticipated winter demand for \nheating oil in the Northeast Corridor. More than 117,000 barrels per \nday of distillate, as I understand it, are being shipped over to Europe \nand other places.\n  If the President has the power--which he certainly and evidently has \ntaken--to remove oil from the SPR, why would he not prohibit the export \nof any heating oil refined from that oil? It is diesel that is going \noverseas currently. It doesn't make sense. I will have more information \nspecifically, but they seem to have overlooked this in their euphoria \nto get the word out that indeed they are doing something positive about \nthe shortage in the Northeast Corridor for heating oil, and the fact we \nare allowing a refined product to go to Europe is unconscionable and \ncertainly goes against the argument that we needed to release oil from \nSPR.\n  Let me get into my presentation this morning because I want to try to \ncommunicate what this issue is about--ANWR, what are the facts and what \nis the fix. Hopefully, we can address that this morning since this \nissue has been brought up in the Presidential debates and clearly is \nattracting the attention of the American people, many of whom simply \ndon't have an appreciation because they have never been there.\n  My State of Alaska is a pretty big piece of real estate. It is one-\nfifth the size of the lower United States. If you overlay Alaska over \nthe entire lower United States, it will range from Canada to Mexico and \nFlorida to California over to the Aleutian Islands 1,000 miles out to \nthe west.\n  This little portion up here of our State is called the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge--perhaps inaccurately named because not all of \nit is a refuge nor all of it a wildlife area. There is an area that was \ncarved out by Congress in 1980. In their wisdom, Congress took this \narea, which is 19 million acres--the size of the State of South \nCarolina--and said let's make a wilderness out of part of it and a \nwildlife refuge out of the other part. They took 8.5 million acres and \nmade a wilderness in perpetuity; it is not going to be changed. They \nmade another 9 million acres into what we call a refuge. But they left \nthis area called the Coastal Plain, or the 1002 area, out of any \npermanent land designation until Congress made its determination as to \nits status.\n  During this time, there were certain activities with regard to oil \nand gas exploration, and it was suggested that there might be a \nsignificant reserve in this general area.\n  As you know, Prudhoe Bay is here--not too far away. That is where we \nhave been producing about 25 percent of the total crude oil produced in \nthis country. We built an 800-mile pipeline down to Valdez where the \noil flows and moves down to the west coast of the United States. This \ninfrastructure is already there. There was a construction project of \nabout $7.5 billion to $8 billion, the largest construction project ever \nbuilt in North America. It was designed to handle a little better than \n2 million barrels of crude oil a day. Currently it is handling a little \nover 1 million barrels a day. So there is an unused capacity in \nexistence there for over 1 million barrels a day. It would require no \nfurther adjustment of any kind.\n  The idea here is, should we allow exploration in this area and put it \nup for Federal leases? If we do, can we do it safely?\n  Of course, the proposal in Governor Bush's energy presentation is to \ntake the revenue of some $3 billion anticipated from Federal leases as \nwell as the federal royalty share and put that back into conservation \nissues, renewable energy technologies, home heating, and weatherization \nprograms; in other words, take the revenue and try to do something \npositive for people to lower costs associated with high energy costs.\n  That is a significant step that suggests we can use the revenue which \nthe private sector will pay and do something very positive with it, and \naddress, if you will, environmental issues that need regeneration in \nother parts of the country with this revenue. The whole question, of \ncourse, is the status of this area and whether Congress is going to see \nfit to open it up.\n  I am going to go through the arguments because I think they really \nmandate an understanding so that there can be an appreciation of the \nmerits of this. The first argument that is used in the fictional sense \nis the assumption that 95 percent of this area is already open to oil \ndevelopment.\n  Here is the area we are talking about. Only a part of the 1,500 mile \nArctic Coastline is left open for possible development. Only 14 percent \nof the whole 1,500-mile Coastal Plain in Alaska is open to oil \nexploration today--not 95 percent but 14 percent.\n  Here is the area. This is closed. This area is open. Some of this \nhappens to be State lands. And, except for a small part of the \ncoastline, the coastline of the national petroleum reserve is closed \nclear over to Point Hope. To suggest that 95 percent of the area is \nalready open is totally inaccurate.\n\n  I will certainly look forward to a spirited debate on this subject if \nsomebody wants to take me up on it, including members of the \nenvironmental groups.\n\n[[Page S9790]]\n\n  We also have 8 million acres of ANWR, as I have indicated, in a \npermanent wilderness. Another 9.5 million acres is classified as \nrefuge; that is, 95 percent of the entire range is closed to \nexploration and oil development. It is closed.\n  Using modern technology--there is the point I want to highlight--the \nindications are that we would need only 2,000 acres out of the 19 \nmillion acres to develop the proposed oil fields that are believed to \nexist in the ANWR Coastal Plain. That is a pretty small footprint when \nyou consider this ANWR area is about the size of the State of South \nCarolina. We are talking about a 2,000-acre footprint, if given the \nopportunity. That is about one-tenth of 1 percent of the 1.5 million \nacres, the 1002 area, and only 1 and one-hundredth percent of the \nentire 19-million acre ANWR area.\n  These are the misconceptions that have been forced on the American \npeople relative to the significance of what development could take \nplace, how small the footprint is, and how large overall the area is, \nand little attention has been given to the infrastructure that is \nalready there.\n  I also remind people that this is not an untouched area. There is a \ndistant early warning radar site there. There is a Native village of \nKaktovik right in the middle of it where nearly 300 Eskimo people make \ntheir living and pursue a subsistence lifestyle. It is interesting to \nnote that about 70 percent of the people in the village support opening \nthe area because they want to have an opportunity for an alternative \nstandard of living and lifestyle: Should they choose to foster just \nsubsistence, or should they pursue opportunities for jobs.\n  Another fiction is that opening up the Coastal Plain would destroy \nthe biological part of the wildlife refuge. That really sounds good. \nBut let's look at it for a minute.\n  The Coastal Plain can be opened to development without harm to the \nwildlife and the environment. Even the Eskimo inhabitants of Kaktovik \nwho depend on subsistence hunting and fishing to eke out their living \nin the far north are convinced that oil development can be done safely, \nbecause of the safeguards, without harm to their land and the wildlife \non which they depend for their heritage.\n  Under legislation I have proposed, No drilling or development \nactivities would be allowed during the caribou calving season. Limits \nwould be placed on exploration, development, and related activities to \navoid impacts on fish and wildlife. Initial exploration efforts would \nbe limited to a time between November and May--the Arctic winter--to \nguarantee that there would be no impact from exploration, pipelines, or \nroads on the caribou.\n  Let's look at some descriptive charts that give you an idea about the \nsuccess of developing this area from what we have learned in Prudhoe \nBay.\n  Here is the Prudhoe Bay area. These are not mannequins, these are \nreal caribou. They are wandering around, and nobody is disturbing them. \nYou cannot take a gun. There is no shooting allowed. There is no taking \nof game in the entire oil fields. These animals are very adjustable as \nlong as they are not harassed. Clearly they are not harassed.\n  There is a picture of the caribou herd that happens to be going \nthrough Prudhoe Bay area.\n  The same thing is true with regard to other wildlife. This is the \npipeline going to Prudhoe Bay. You can see the Arctic tundra over here. \nIt is a pretty time. It is a wintertime picture.\n  There are three bears here. It is kind of comical because the bears \nare walking on the pipeline. Why? Because it is easier to walk on the \npipeline than to walk in the snow. They are as smart as the average \nbears around here. In any case, it is a little warmer too. To suggest \nthat somehow these animals are going to be fenced out because of some \nactivity just isn't supported by any burden of proof.\n  We are trying to give some factual, real-life issues associated with \ndevelopment in the Arctic and what steps we take to protect the \nenvironment and ensure we are not going to have difficulties associated \nwith the wildlife.\n  I also want to show you a little effort by our Canadian friends on \nthis side when they begin to initiate an aggressive oil and gas \nexploration program in the Arctic.\n  This is the boundary between Canada and Alaska. This is the Northwest \nTerritory. We see various villages. The dots represent oil wells that \nhave been drilled for exploration purposes. Here is the village of Old \nCrow, just on the Canadian side of the Alaska-Canadian border.\n  My point is to show the extent of drilling on the Canadian side in \nthe search of oil and gas. Unfortunately, they didn't find any oil and \ngas. This is also the route of the porcupine caribou herd. They move \nthrough the range and traverse the area. Incidentally, they cross a \nhighway, the Dempster Highway. The Canadian Government, when they found \nthere was no oil, decided to make it a park. As a consequence, it is a \npark today; that is fine. But to suggest that somehow this activity \nwould have some effect on the migration pattern certainly proves it \ndidn't have much of an effect, and the highway and the caribou \ntraversing it did not have an effect on the herds. In the proposals we \nhave for development in Alaska, the technology today is very different.\n  This photograph gives an idea of the development of an oil well in \nAlaska today. There are no roads, no gravel. This is an ice road. That \nis the technology used. They build up the ice and use it as a road. \nThis is a well. You can see the Arctic Ocean. It is a pretty tough \narea. It has its own uniqueness, its own beauty, but is a very hostile \nenvironment.\n  When exploration activity is completed, this is the picture we have \nduring the short summer. It is the same area. There is no despoiling of \nthe tundra. This represents the technology that is available today.\n  The Coastal Plain has been declared America's last wilderness. It is \nnot wilderness. However, an awful lot of our State is wilderness. We \nhave 56 million acres of wilderness. The point is we protect the \nwilderness. We can protect these areas.\n  In our State less than 1 percent of the entire State, 365 million \nacres, is in private ownership and available for development. We have \n192 million acres of parks, preserves, conservation system units. As I \nhave said, there are 56 million acres of wilderness, 61 percent of all \nAmerican wilderness. How much is enough? I am not here to debate. \nWilderness in Alaska already covers an area equal to Pennsylvania, New \nJersey, West Virginia, and Maryland.\n  Further in the Coastal Plain lies this village of Eskimo people. This \npicture demonstrates what it is like to take a walk on the North Slope \nin the wintertime. There are a couple of kids in the village walking \ndown the street. It is blowing snow. Aren't these kids entitled to a \ndifferent lifestyle, should they wish? The answer clearly is yes. When \nthey say there has been nothing in this area, they are misleading. It \nis inaccurate. This is the wilderness, this is the refuge, this is what \nCongress is debating, and this is where the oil is likely to occur in \nthe footprint of 2,000 acres.\n  Some suggest it is only a 90-day, or a 200-day supply of oil. Prudhoe \nBay was estimated to produce 9 billion barrels. It has produced over 12 \nbillion barrels today. It is still producing over a million barrels a \nday. When we look at potential production, we are looking at the \npotential of 16 billion barrels. When we talk about a 200-day supply, \nwe assume there will not be any oil produced from any other source. It \nis a fictional argument.\n  I have talked about the caribou, but I want to show again the \nsignificance of this with regard to Prudhoe Bay. This picture is a \ndifferent herd than exists in the ANWR area. This is the central arctic \nherd. There is no indication that an environmentally responsible \nexploration will harm the porcupine caribou which, I might add, is \n129,000 now. As a matter of fact, we have about three times as many \ncaribou in our State as we have people--not that that is anything \nsignificant, but it is a fact. We have had 26 years in Prudhoe Bay of \nprotecting these animals. The central herd has grown from 3,000 animals \nin 1978 to 19,700 today. That is a fact.\n\n  These arguments suggesting somehow we will decimate the wildlife \nsimply is not based on any accurate information. It is an emotional \nargument. This is one of the travesties that has been taking place--\nexploiting the American public to suggest we cannot\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\nopen this area safely. Why has the environmental community pursued \nthis? It generates membership. It generates dollars, gives them a \ncause, and it is so far away people cannot see for themselves. I can't \nsay how many ``experts'' in this body have opinions but have never been \nthere. Their material is written by the Wilderness Society. It is \nwritten by the Sierra Club.\n  Caribou will flourish in ANWR as they have throughout Alaska. In \nthese areas, no hunting will be allowed by anyone other than a Native.\n  We have heard a good deal from the Gwich'in group, the group of \nNatives on the Canadian and the Alaskan side. The suggestion is this \nwill destroy their culture. Nothing will prevent the caribou herd from \npassing close to the Gwich'in villages. That is where they yearly hunt, \nwhen they come through. They will continue to have the availability of \nthe caribou for their subsistence. Strict controls are planned to \nprevent disruption of the caribou herds during the summer calving. The \ncaribou calve in the northern area, but they calve, depending on \nweather schedules, snowfall, bugs, and predators--sometimes they calve \non the Canadian side; sometimes they calve on the Alaskan side. The \npoint is, the Gwich'in group that is dependent will be protected as a \nconsequence of ensuring that there is no activity on the Arctic Slope \nduring the time of the migration. That can be simply asserted by \nregulations, and we have agreed to do that.\n  It is interesting to note that the Gwich'in group, 15 years ago, \nissued a request for a proposal to lease their own land, about 1.7 \nmillion acres for oil development. Maybe the oil companies should have \nbought. Unfortunately, there wasn't any oil. As a consequence, the \nleases were not taken up. Now the Gwich'ins are entitled to change \ntheir mind, and that is what they have done.\n  The truth is, they are funded by the Wilderness Society. They are \nfunded by the Sierra Club. We have tried time and time again to \nencourage some of the Gwich'ins to go from their traditional area and \ngo to Point Barrow and see what the Eskimos think of resource \ndevelopment associated with oil and gas.\n  I recall one of my friends took a group up. He is an Eskimo from \nBarrow. He said he used to go to school to keep warm. But before he \ndid, he had to go to the beach to pick up driftwood that flowed down \nthe river--no trees, but driftwood, to keep warm. He says: We have an \nalternative lifestyle now. We have a choice. We can take a job. We have \neducational opportunities.\n  They are able to provide a full 4-year college scholarship to any \nmember of their community who wants to go. They can do that because \nthey have revenues associated with their Barrow's taxing base on the \noil pipeline. So it has brought about an alternative in lifestyle and a \nchoice that people previously did not have.\n  These people are entitled to the same things to which you and I are \nentitled, if they so choose. So when you look at these kids, look at \nwhether or not they want to continue to rely on the subsistence \neconomy, following game, or whether they want an opportunity to have a \ncollege education and come back, maybe, as a doctor or nurse or \nwhatever. They are given this opportunity through activities associated \nwith creating the tax base of their communities. Should they not be \nheard as well?\n  I was amused at the inconsistencies associated with the environmental \ncommunity. The Audubon Society currently holds leases in the Paul J. \nRainey Wildlife Preserve in Louisiana. They hold oil leases. They \ngenerate revenue. There is nothing wrong with that, but it is an \ninconsistency they do not care to acknowledge or admit. If it is OK for \nthe Audubon Society to have revenues from oil in a preserve, the Paul \nJ. Rainey Wildlife Preserve in Louisiana, why shouldn't the Natives of \nmy State have the same opportunity for their own land? It seems to me \nthere is certainly justification.\n  There is another myth: Canada has protected their wildlife; we should \ndo the same. We went through that. The Canadians finally created a \nnational park, but they did so only after extensive exploration failed. \nThe Canadians drilled 89 exploration wells on their side with no \nsuccess. They also extended the Dempster Highway, cutting across the \ncenter of the Porcupine caribou herds' route.\n  Another fiction we hear all the time: Oil exploration would destroy \npolar bear habitat. Doesn't that sound terrific? The reality is polar \nbears den on the Arctic ice pack, not on land. The administration has \npositively identified only 15 polar bear dens on the entire Coastal \nPlain for an 11-year period; that is one or two dens a year. We have a \nhealthy population of polar bears, estimated at about 2,000. The reason \nis we do not shoot them. You can go to Canada and take a polar bear for \na trophy. You can go to Russia. You can't do it in the United States. \nThe only people who can take polar bear are the Native people for \nsubsistence. The environmentalists don't tell you that.\n  However, they do tell you Prudhoe Bay has been littered with chemical \nand oil spills, the Arctic having been despoiled by three or four--\nwhatever figure they want to use. But the figure that is accurate is \n17,000 spills since 1970. That is the accurate figure. How can you have \nthose spills with such a pristine environment? The fact is, as a \nconsequence of the environmental oversight and requirements, every \nspill of any material--even if it is fresh water--has to be reported; \nany spill that is how you get 17,000 spills.\n  For example, in 1993 there were 160 spills involving 60,000 gallons. \nBefore you jump to conclusions, only 2 spills involved oil. Roughly 9.5 \ngallons of oil were spilled from a leaky valve. Any oil and chemical \nspills have almost always been confined to frozen gravel pads where \nthey are easily cleaned up. Moving more than 1 million barrels of oil a \nday, everyday, from the ground, through the pipe and onto ships--9.5 \ngallons of oil spilled. I think that is a remarkable record. Prudhoe \nBay is the finest oil field in the world bar none. We send kids up from \nAnchorage and Fairbanks to pick up the few papers that happen to blow \naround. It is a summer job.\n  Another fiction: Producing more oil would simply cause Americans to \nbuy more gas-guzzling cars and defeat conservation efforts. America \ndoes need to be more energy efficient. It does need to develop more \nalternative fuels. Even with increased energy efficiency and \nconservation, our energy demands are forecast to increase 30 percent by \nthe year 2010. By then, America will be producing just 5.2 million \nbarrels of oil per day. We will be forced to import 65 percent of our \noil needs. This certainly poses a threat to our national security. We \nwould need 30 giant foreign-flagged supertankers a day, more than \n10,000 a year, coming into our ports to import the oil we need. That \ncreates much more environmental risk than developing our own resources \nwhere we have the tough environmental requirements.\n\n  The vast majority of Americans oppose disturbing the Alaska Arctic \nNational Refuge--that is what the environmentalists would have you \nbelieve. Americans strongly support responsible development when they \nknow the facts about it. That is what I have attempted to do today.\n  I encourage my colleagues to give me an opportunity to debate them if \nthey want to challenge these facts. A poll taken by the Gordon S. Black \nCorp. said 56 percent of Americans support ANWR leasing; 37 percent \noppose; 74 percent of Americans support efforts to produce domestic oil \nand natural gas. That is what Governor Bush proposed last night--\nproducing more oil here at home and not being dependent on imports. \nCertainly, most Alaskans support ANWR. The entire congressional \ndelegation, the Democratic Governor, 78 percent of the residents of \nKaktovik, this little village, support it.\n  Some say what are we doing exporting from Alaska? We don't export oil \nfrom Alaska. There was some exported when we had surplus oil on the \nwest coast of the United States. That has not occurred for several \nmonths.\n  Finally, they suggest we are a wealthy State, we don't need ANWR. \nThat is a ridiculous argument. We have, in Alaska, the highest cost of \nliving in the nation. We have billions of dollars of unmet \ninfrastructure needs like sanitation for our village's health needs. We \nhave no roads across most of Alaska. We have, probably, the most \nfragile economy of any State in the Union. We have always depended on \nresource industries, but our timber industry has been shut down by this \nadministration. We have lost our jobs in\n\n[[Page S9792]]\n\nKetchikan and Sitka, our only two year-round manufacturing plants. Our \noil and gas jobs are down.\n  The worst thing is we have had 32,000 young Alaskans leave Alaska \nsince 1992 as a consequence of not having opportunities for these \npeople within our State because we are dependent on developing \nresources and the Federal Government controls the landmass in our \nState.\n  I hope as we continually debate the issues before us as we enter this \nPresidential campaign, and the issue of energy comes to the forefront, \nas it should, as a distinct issue between the two candidates, we will \nhave a better understanding of the merits of opening up this area of \nthe Arctic for the relief that is needed in this country today. I \npredict if this administration would commit to opening up this area for \noil and gas leasing, you would see a drop in the price of oil \novernight. As a consequence, the belief that America meant business \nwhen it said we were going to relieve our dependence on imported oil \nwould mean we would not be subject to the whims of the individual who \ncontrols, if you will, the difference between the world's capacity to \nproduce and the world's current demand--which is about 1.5 million \nbarrels with supply being a little over the demand. That one person is \nSaddam Hussein, in Iraq, who is currently producing almost 3 million \nbarrels a day. The fear is he will cut production. If he cuts \nproduction, we will see oil prices go from $37 to probably $60 a \nbarrel. That, coupled with the instability associated with the current \nspokesperson from OPEC, from Venezuela, who has made certain \nsuggestions that clearly the object of OPEC in Venezuela is to protect \nthe interests of the small countries of the world at the expense of the \nlarge consumers of hydrocarbons, means we have a very unstable \nsituation.\n  I hope the American people have a better understanding of what has \nhappened in the last 8 years as this current administration has \nabandoned the traditional dependence on many sources of energy--oil, \nnatural gas, hydrocarbons associated with our coal industry, our \nnuclear industry and our hydroelectric industry--and clearly focused \nthe future on our energy supply of natural gas.\n  As a consequence, we have seen what has happened with natural gas. \nDemand has gone up, and we are in a situation now where other countries \nare dictating conditions under which we have to pay the price they \ncharge or go without. It is strictly supply and demand. It has been \ncoming for a long time, and the Clinton-Gore administration bears the \nresponsibility for not having a responsible energy policy. That is why \nI am so pleased to see Governor Bush come forward and acknowledge what \nhas to be done, and among those issues is more domestic production.\n  The fact he has stated the belief that we can open up this area \nsafely I think deserves full examination and explanation to the \nAmerican public. That is what I have attempted to do today.\n  I thank my colleague for the opportunity to speak in morning \nbusiness. I see the floor leader, Senator Gorton, is on the floor. I \nbelieve the pending business is the Interior appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair inform the Senator from Nevada as to how \nmuch time the Senator from Alaska consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that indicates that after the Senator from \nNew York speaks, there will be 25 minutes remaining on this side. Even \nthough it was not part of the order, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntime of the minority be used all at the same time, that there not be \nany interruption. I believe that was the intent of the unanimous \nconsent agreement entered earlier today--that we would have equal time \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, although the minority \nwill control 32 minutes following Senator Schumer's statement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak prior to Senator Schumer and use whatever time I may consume, \nwhich will be about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9792-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9792-S9795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ISSUES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my friend \nfrom Alaska. He has devoted a great amount of his time to this one \nissue; that is, drilling in ANWR. I have been present on the floor on \nmany occasions when he has given basically the same presentation he did \ntoday. I do not mean to take away from the intensity of his belief, his \npassion, that there should be drilling in this pristine area. The fact \nof the matter is that the majority is wrong on this issue.\n  The minority believes we do not have to pump every drop of oil that \nis on U.S. soil, that there are other things we should do. One of the \nthings we need to do is develop alternative energy sources; that is, \nsolar energy. We are not as a government doing nearly enough to develop \nthis great resource.\n  We have heard a lot of discussion on this floor about the Nevada Test \nSite where some thousand nuclear devices were exploded over the years. \nSolar energy facilities could be developed at the Nevada Test Site \nwhich could produce enough electricity to supply all the needs of the \nUnited States. The desert Sun would supply enough energy for the whole \nUnited States. That is what we should develop--alternate energy \nsources.\n  I am very proud of the fact that this administration has decided they \nare going to go all out, and they have already begun to develop \ngeothermal energy. All over the western part of the United States, \nthere is geothermal energy potential. If one drives from the capital of \nNevada, Carson City, to Reno, one sees steam coming out of the ground. \nThat steam represents great potential for geothermal energy.\n  There are powerplants in Nevada and other places in the western part \nof the United States that produce electricity from the heat of the \nEarth. Geothermal energy is available in various parts of the United \nStates. There is tremendous potential there.\n  If one drives in southern California, one sees areas where there are \nmiles and miles of windmills. These windmills produce electricity, and \nwe are getting better every day in developing more efficient windmills. \nThat is where we should be directing our attention, not to producing \noil in a pristine wilderness in Alaska.\n  The fact of the matter is, we could produce millions of barrels of \noil there for a very short period of time. The effect on our energy \npolicy would be minimal. It would produce jobs for the people of \nAlaska--and I understand why the Senators from Alaska are pushing \njobs--but it would be to the detriment of our environment.\n  It was very clear in the debate last night that the Vice President \nsaid we should not be drilling in ANWR, there are other things we can \ndo, and he mentioned, as I have, alternate energy policies. He also \nstated that we can do a lot of things in our country to conserve and \nreduce the need to produce more electricity. I hope we will focus on \nwhat we can do to make sure we are energy efficient and that we are not \nso dependent on importing foreign oil.\n  One of the things I regret we did not do, because the majority would \nnot let us do it, is to put more oil in our reserves. We have a program \nto begin pumping some of our reserves. That is a wise decision. Look at \nthe results. There was a dramatic decline in the cost of oil, and OPEC \nsuddenly decided it was the right thing to do to start producing more \noil because they knew we would start pulling down our reserves and the \ncost of oil would go down anyway.\n\n  The Senator from Alaska criticized the Vice President for his \ninterest in improving energy efficiency and expanding renewable energy \nproduction. His criticism is not well taken. In my view, the Vice \nPresident has a balanced, healthy approach to reducing American \ndependence on foreign oil and big oil generally. He recognizes we can \nproduce oil and gas more efficiently at home, we can expand our \ndomestic production of renewable energy, and our economy can become \nmore efficient.\n  Vice President Gore has also realized, as he stated on a number of \noccasions and as I have already said, that we do not need to develop \nevery drop of oil in the Earth. Unlike Governor\n\n[[Page S9793]]\n\nBush, Vice President Gore believes that in some cases special places, \nnational treasures, should be off limits to big oil.\n  We know there is a massive lobbying effort by big oil companies to \ndrill in ANWR. It is the wrong thing to do. Clearly, the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge is one of those special places about which the \nVice President talked. It is the last pristine Arctic ecosystem in the \nUnited States. It should be out of bounds for oil exploration. I do not \ncare if the caribou can walk on pipelines because it is warm or they \ncannot walk on pipelines because they are cold. The fact of the matter \nis, we do not need to drill in ANWR. It should be out of bounds. Vice \nPresident Gore recognizes we can protect America's national treasures \nand satisfy our energy needs.\n  I am disappointed that Governor Bush lacks, I am sorry to say, a \nnotion about, or maybe even an understanding of, what energy policy is \nall about. His affiliation for so long with big oil seems to have \ntempered his views toward big oil. Of course, his Vice Presidential \ncandidate has the same global view that big oil solves all problems. \nThe only way for America to reduce its debilitating addiction to \nforeign oil is to develop alternative energy sources and to do a better \njob with our consumption. We do not solve our problems by drilling in \nour precious national wildlife refuge.\n  Mr. President, not only do I believe that the Vice President was \nright last night about our energy policy, but I also believe he was \nright about education.\n  I think, when we recognize that over 90 percent of our kids go to \npublic schools, we have to do things to protect and improve our public \nschools. I think the Vice President recognizes the need for school \nconstruction.\n  In Las Vegas, we have to build a new school every month to keep up \nwith growth. We need help. I did not misspeak. We need to build a new \nschool every month to keep up with the growth in Las Vegas. We have the \nsixth largest school district in America. We need help, as other school \ndistricts around the country need help. We need them for different \nreasons. The average school in America is over 40 years old. The Vice \nPresident recognizes that school districts need help in school \nconstruction. We need help in getting more teachers and better \nteachers.\n  That is why the Vice President spoke so eloquently on the need to do \nsomething about prescription drug benefits. That is why he spoke about \nthe need to do something about prescription drugs.\n  It was very clear to all of us that his statements regarding \ninternational policy were certainly well made. The Vice President did a \ngood job because he has a wealth of experience.\n  But I also want to say this to the American people. I am not here \ntoday to diminish Governor Bush. We should be very proud in America \nthat we had the ability last night to watch these two fine men debate. \nThey are debating to become the President of the United States, the \nmost powerful, the most important job in the whole world.\n  I have to say I think the glass is half full, not half empty. I think \nthese two men did a good job. Most of us who serve in the Senate--or \neveryone who serves in the Senate--have been involved in these debates. \nIt is hard. It might look easy watching these men at home on TV, but it \nis hard. There is tremendous pressure on each one of them. Millions of \npeople are watching each one of them.\n  What is the criticism today? The Vice President sighed; and George \nBush, when he was not speaking, his face was red and he snorted a \ncouple times. If that is the worst we say about these two fine men, \nthen we are in pretty good shape as a country. Al Gore is a friend of \nmine, Tipper Gore is a friend of mine. I think his debate was a slam \ndunk, as indicated in all the polls today. Al Gore won the debate. And \nI am very happy that he did.\n  But do not diminish these two men by saying one sighed too much or \none had a red face. They were in a very difficult situation last night. \nI am proud of the work that both of them did. I think we, as a country, \nshould feel good about our country, that people who are running for \nPresident can be seen, their sighs and red faces combined. I think we \nshould recognize that. If you look just across the ocean, you see what \nis going on in Serbia and Yugoslavia. That is what we do not want. We \nshould be very proud of what we have here in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for giving me the \ntime, and my good friend from Nevada, the assistant minority leader, \nfor arranging our ability to speak.\n  First, I say, as well, that I enjoyed the debate last night. I \nthought most Americans got to see, for 90 minutes, the candidates \nunfiltered. It was good for the country, whatever side one came down \non. It is just one more step in the process of all of us educating \nourselves about the very difficult problems this country faces as we \nmove along.\n  I would like to talk about one aspect of the debate which is very \nrelevant to what we are doing here as we end our final 2 weeks on the \nbudget. What we heard from the Vice President and from Governor Bush \nlast night about the budget, about Medicare, and about taxes is exactly \nwhat the Senate is focused on as we move to wrap up the session. So I \nthought it would be a good idea for us to actually look at the numbers \ninstead of the rhetoric.\n  Last night it seemed to me Vice President Gore talked about a lot of \nnumbers. Governor Bush did not answer any of his statements. He did not \nanswer Jim Lehrer's questions. Instead, he resorted to this sort of \ncatchall of ``fuzzy numbers,'' ``fuzzy math,'' ``fuzzy Washington \nnumbers.'' I guess when you do not have the ability to answer or you \nare stuck, you go to rhetoric.\n  I would like to examine those so-called ``fuzzy numbers.'' I do not \nthink anyone who has examined them looks at them as ``fuzzy.'' But it \nis just that Governor Bush's plans for America are so skewed, and the \nnumbers do not add up, that he cannot answer the questions directly and \ninstead starts talking about ``fuzzy numbers.''\n  I will admit, to the average American this is all sort of confusing. \nPeople are so busy with their jobs and their families and their hobbies \nand their avocations, they can't take out a magnifying glass and look \nat all the details. They have to go, as we always have in this \nRepublic, with their instincts. Who is really right?\n  But today I thought I might spend a few minutes of our time on the \nfloor, which I am grateful for, to actually go over those numbers in as \nclear a way as I can.\n  It is clear, once you look at the numbers, that what the Vice \nPresident was saying is true: That if we use Governor Bush's plan, a \nlargely disproportionate share of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest \npeople; that there is no room for Medicare expansion, in fact Medicare \nmust be cut, if we use Governor Bush's plan; that, in fact, you do go \nback to the old days of not only eating up the surplus but of deficit \nspending--if we do all of the things that Governor Bush has proposed.\n  So let's look at the math.\n  Let's start out with the basic foundation of our budget, the surplus \nprojections. We all know they may not be accurate, but they may not be \naccurate on the low side or they may not be accurate on the high side. \nThese are the best numbers we have from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which is generally regarded as fairly nonpartisan.\n  They estimate that the surplus, over the next 10 years, will be huge, \n$4.6 trillion. I think that is because we finally have gotten it here \nin Washington that we can't go spending money we do not have. That is \ngood. There is a consensus--I think both Democrats and Republicans \nagree--about that.\n  There is a second agreement. We all agree right now that the money \nought to go to Social Security first, that we ought to take the Social \nSecurity surplus, the amount of money that is in FICA, that you pay in \nin FICA, that every American worker pays in--their hard-earned dollars; \nand they pay what I guess many would think is a high percentage--my \ndaughter had her first job over the summer. She is 15. She was amazed \nhow much came out in FICA from her little meager paycheck. But we say \nall that FICA money should stay with Social Security; that no one in \nWashington should get their sticky little fingers on it and use it for \nsomething else. You take away the Social\n\n[[Page S9794]]\n\nSecurity surplus and that gives us a total, over the next 10 years, of \n$2.2 trillion to spend.\n\n  Last night, the Vice President said Governor Bush's plan would not \nonly use all that but return us to deficit spending when you added \neverything up. He focused on the tax cut as much too large, if you \nwanted to do the other things.\n  The Governor did not respond in point. He said: These fuzzy \nWashington numbers. This chart shows the numbers are not fuzzy. They \nare as clear as the nose on the Governor's face.\n  You start with the $2.2 trillion, non-Social Security surplus. Both \nparties agree we have to preserve the Medicare trust fund, although \nlast night the Governor did refuse to come out for his lockbox. But as \nyou preserve the trust fund, if you do not cut into Medicare, which he \nsays he will not do, you lose another $360 billion. Then you go $1.8 \ntrillion.\n  Then there is the $1.3 trillion tax cut. We will discuss later to \nwhom it goes. That was the No. 1 contention in the debate. But Governor \nBush, by his own words, takes $1.3 trillion. He says it is a small \nportion of the total Government budget. It is. But it is a very large \nportion of the surplus that we have. Of the $2.2 trillion that is left \nafter you save Social Security and preserve Social Security, he would \ntake $1.3 trillion of that--more than half of it--and put it into tax \ncuts. That brings us down to $500 billion left over the 10 years.\n  Then there are the other tax breaks that the Governor has supported \nwhich have been talked about on this floor. He supports cutting the \nmarriage penalty. He mentioned that last night. He supports the estate \ntax reduction. He has mentioned that at other times. You take that, \nthat is another $940 billion. So now we are already in deficit by $400 \nbillion; no longer having the surplus that we struggled to attain after \nso many years of deficit spending. So then we are in deficit.\n  But he doesn't stop there. Then there is spending. The Governor \nproposes some spending for education and for other things. Every day we \nhear of a new program he is coming out with. I support some of them, as \nI support some of the tax cuts, but not all because together, when you \nadd it up, it is too much.\n  He has proposed $625 billion in spending. That brings our deficit to \n$1 trillion. Then he proposes that we take $1 trillion out of Social \nSecurity and let people invest that in the stock market or whatever \nelse. Of course, he said, it will go up three times; that is, if the \nstock market triples. I don't put my daughter's college money that my \nwife and I save each month in the stock market for fear, even though it \nmight triple, it might go down. And then how are we going to pay for \nher college?\n  He takes the money out, wherever you put it, and that is another $1.1 \ntrillion. Now we are at a $2.1 trillion deficit. Finally, because you \nare not getting interest on all this money; you are spending it, so to \nspeak, in terms of tax breaks and in terms of spending programs, you \nlose another $400 billion of foregone interest. When you add it all up, \nthe deficit, with the Governor's plan, is back to the bad old days of \n$2.5 trillion.\n  This is not fuzzy Washington math. These are not fuzzy numbers. These \nare the numbers the Governor has proposed. No wonder he didn't answer \nVice President Gore's retort about going back and where all the money \nis coming from. No wonder he had to use this rhetoric. The only people \nthese numbers are fuzzy to are the people who don't want to add them up \nbecause they lead to deficit spending: the Governor of Texas and his \nsupporters.\n  The other big issue was where does the tax cut go. Again, Vice \nPresident Gore said seven, eight, nine, ten times--I lost count--that \nthe top 1 percent of the people in America get a huge proportion of the \ntax cut. And Jim Lehrer asked Governor Bush whether that was true, and \nGovernor Bush would not answer the question. Do you know why? Why \ndidn't Governor Bush answer the question as to where the tax cuts go? \nBecause he knew the Vice President was right. He knew it went \ndisproportionately to the wealthiest people in America.\n  Here are the numbers, plain and simple. This is data from Citizens \nfor Tax Justice, not a Democratic or Republican group.\n  The top 1 percent of America, those are people--I wish the Vice \nPresident had said this--the top 1 percent is not you or even me, and I \nmake a good salary as a Senator. You have to make $319,000 to be in the \ntop 1 percent. If you average it out, the income of the top 1 percent \nis $915,000. These people are not just millionaires; they make almost \n$1 million a year on average. They get 42 percent of the tax cut. \nAlmost one of every $2 we are cutting in taxes goes to people whose \naverage income is $1 million or close to $1 million a year. How many \nAmericans want that? If I were confronted with that fact, I would \n``rhetorize,'' as they say, I would give what the Governor himself \nmight call Washington rhetoric and say: That is fuzzy mathematics.\n  It is not fuzzy. Here it is, Governor Bush: The top 1 percent get 42 \npercent of the tax cuts. The people whose average income is $915,000 \nget $46,000 back in tax cuts.\n  Let's take the people in the middle, the middle 20 percent, people \nmaking between $25,000 and $40,000 a year. They get about 8 percent of \nthe tax cuts or $453. Of course, low-income people, the Governor said, \nthey are going to do better--yes, $42 a year better. So it is true, as \nthe Governor said, everyone gets a tax break. He wants to give the \nmoney to everyone. The trouble is, he wants to give most of the money \nto the wealthiest few.\n\n  He is right. The wealthiest people have most of the money, and they \npay a lot of the taxes. That is true. But we have a policy choice, Mr. \nPresident. Do we want the wealthiest of people to get most of the money \nback or do we want to do targeted tax cuts for the middle class and \nspend more of the money than the Governor does on education, on a \nprescription drug plan, on health care?\n  This is not fuzzy Washington math. These are facts. I don't blame \nGovernor Bush for running away from them and hiding behind rhetoric.\n  One final point. Vice President Gore, in the debate, said that he \nwanted targeted tax cuts for the middle class. And George Bush said: \nYou need an accountant to figure this out. Well, tell a family who is \nmaking $50,000 a year, whose oldest child is 17, and the husband and \nwife are up late at night worrying: How in the heck are we going to pay \nfor Johnny's college. How the heck, on an income of $50,000 a year, are \nwe going to come up with $10,000 a year after paying our mortgage and \nbuying the food and payments on the car? How are we going to do that?\n  Well, you don't need an accountant with what Vice President Gore \ntalked about. You simply need to put on your tax return that your child \nis going to college, that you are paying $10,000 a year, and you deduct \nthat from your taxes. It is as simple as deducting your mortgage \ninterest. It is as simple as deducting your health care costs. You \ndon't need an accountant.\n  We all believe in tax cuts; I do. Is it better for all of America to \ngive that wealthiest family $46,000 a year, when their income is \n$915,000, or is it better to say to middle-income families who are \nstruggling with the cost of college that we ought to make college \ntuition tax deductible, a proposal that has had bipartisan support in \nthe Senate? The Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe; myself; the Senator \nfrom Indiana, Mr. Bayh; and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith--two \nDemocrats and two Republicans--have championed that. I learned how much \npeople struggled with that when I ran for the Senate 2 years ago. It is \none of my passions to get it done.\n  You don't need an accountant. Those are not fuzzy Washington numbers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional 2 \nminutes from our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is not fuzzy math. It is plain and simple.\n  The bottom line is, last night Governor Bush could not argue facts. \nHe could not argue the merits. So he ran away from the argument by \nclaiming fuzzy numbers.\n  The debate was a great success for the Vice President because, as \npeople examine what I have talked about--the huge deficit spending the \nGovernor would have us engage in, again, the fact that a \ndisproportionate share of\n\n[[Page S9795]]\n\nthe tax cuts go to the wealthy; the fact that the middle-income tax \ncuts proposed by the Vice President are very simple and easy to use and \ndesperately needed by the American people--the Vice President will \nscore points.\n  More importantly, he will win the election on that basis, and America \nwill finally spend our surplus on the priorities we need and return \ntaxes to the middle class who need them more than anybody else. Our \ncountry will continue the prosperity that, praise God, we have seen in \nthe last 8 years.\n  Mr. President, these are not fuzzy Washington numbers. These are \nfacts. They are facts that show that the Vice President is far more in \ntouch with what the average American wants and needs than is Governor \nBush.\n  I don't believe in class warfare. I respect people who have made a \nlot of money. That is the American dream. I hope my children will.\n  But when you do deep tax cuts, who should get it when you only have a \nlimited amount? When you have a surplus, why should it be squandered? \nGovernor Bush, these are not fuzzy numbers but hard, cold facts that \nhelp the American people.\n  I yield back my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thought it was appropriate that we revisit \nwhat the junior Senator from Alaska said today. He has come to the \nfloor on many occasions and said, as I have stated earlier, the same \nthing. He does it with great passion, and I appreciate how strongly he \nfeels about it. I think the time has come that we don't let his \nstatements go without giving the facts from the other side. What are \nsome of those facts? Let's talk about production of oil in Alaska.\n  In 1999, the Clinton-Gore administration offered tracts on nearly 4 \nmillion acres of land in the national petroleum reserve in Alaska, to \nthe west of Prudhoe Bay, for oil and gas leasing.\n\n       Oil companies with winning bids will pay--\n\n  This is a staggering figure, but it is to show that we in this \nadministration have had an energy policy, as we all know.\n\n       Oil companies with winning bids will pay $104,635,728 for \n     leases in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. A total \n     of 425 tracts on approximately 3.9 million acres were offered \n     by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in today's lease sale, \n     the first such sale for the reserve since 1984.\n\n  It is important we recognize that there is an energy policy and, as \nindicated, this is the first sale for the reserve since 1984.\n\n       Six oil companies submitted 174 bids on 133 tracts.\n\n  The oil industry should explore and develop the Alaskan Petroleum \nReserve before there is any suggestion of opening the sensitive lands \nof the wildlife refuge to development. We acknowledge that, and that is \nwhy they are paying $105 million to do that. They should do that before \nthere is even a suggestion of opening the sensitive lands of the ANWR \nto develop. ANWR doesn't need to be developed. To even suggest doing it \nbefore we fully explore the petroleum reserve in Alaska indicates that \nwe are doing it for reasons other than petroleum production.\n\n       In 1998, the U.S. Geological Survey released a mean \n     estimate of 2.4 billion barrels of economically recoverable \n     oil in the Arctic Refuge at $18 a barrel market price in 1996 \n     dollars. Such a discovery would never meet more than a small \n     part of our oil needs at any given time. The U.S. consumes \n     about 19 million barrels of oil daily or almost 7 billion \n     barrels annually . . .\n\n  So using these numbers for a couple of years, you could drill and it \nwould be gone, and you would damage, to say the least, this beautiful \npart of the world.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey indicates that the mean estimate of \neconomically recoverable reserves assumes an oil price of $18, as I \nhave indicated. We know the price of oil is almost double that today. \nEven at $20 a barrel, the mean estimate increases to 3.2 billion \nbarrels. This information comes from Dr. Thomas Casadevall, the Acting \nDirector of the U.S. Geological Survey.\n  Production of oil in the United States peaked in 1970. You can see \nthat on this chart. That was when the United States produced about 9.6 \nmillion barrels of oil every day. Production in Alaska has also been on \na continual decline since 1988. It is very clear that the production of \noil in Alaska has been going downhill since 1988, when it peaked at 2 \nmillion barrels of oil a day.\n  Domestic gas and oil drilling activity decreased nearly 17 percent \nduring 1992, the last year of the Bush administration, and was at the \nlowest level since 1942. So I think we should understand that the \nSenator from Alaska--if he has to complain about energy policy--should \ngo back to the Bush administration. That is when we bottomed out, so to \nspeak.\n\n  Let's talk about what has gone on since 1992 when this administration \nbegan a concerted effort to increase the production of oil. Under the \nleadership of the Clinton-Gore administration, natural gas production \non Federal lands onshore and oil production offshore is increasing. \nNatural gas production on Federal onshore lands has increased nearly 60 \npercent during this administration. Let me repeat that. Natural gas \nproduction on Federal onshore lands has increased nearly 60 percent \nsince 1992. Oil production on Federal lands is down. But the gas \nstatistics belie the argument that the administration has shut down the \npublic lands to oil and gas development. This source comes from \ntestimony given before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in \nJuly of this year.\n  The Gulf of Mexico has become one of the hottest places in the world \nfor exploration, especially since this administration supported \nincentives for deep-water development going into effect in 1995. \nBetween 1992 and 1999, oil production offshore has increased 62 \npercent.\n  So it hardly seems to me that this is an administration without an \nenergy policy, when we have determined that natural gas production \nduring this administration on Federal onshore lands has increased about \n60 percent and we have also determined that during this administration \noil production offshore has increased 62 percent. Natural gas \nproduction in deep waters has increased 80 percent in just the past 2 \nyears. These increases are in areas of the Gulf of Mexico, where the \nUnited States actively produces oil and gas.\n  So the point I am making is that we have my friend, the Senator from \nAlaska, coming to the floor and continually saying we don't have an \nenergy policy. These figures belie that. We have an increase in Federal \nonshore lands by 60 percent; oil production offshore, 62 percent; and \njust in the last 2 years, gas production in deep waters increased 80 \npercent. Why? Because of actions taken by the Clinton-Gore \nadministration.\n  The deep water in the Gulf of Mexico has emerged as a world-class oil \nand gas province in the last 4 years. That is as a result of work done \nby this administration. This historic change, after 53 years of \nproduction in the Gulf of Mexico, has been driven by several major \nfactors, all coalescing during this administration. Truly, the deep \nwater will drive the new millennium, no question about that.\n  I think it is important to note that we are all concerned about the \nfact that we are importing more oil than we should. Look at this chart. \nOil importation went up in the mid 1970s, and during the gas crunch, \nbecause of policies taken by the Federal Government with tax credits \nand other things for\n\n[[Page S9796]]\n\ndeveloping alternative sources of energy, it went down. But with the \nglut of oil and the price of oil low, the consumption of oil, imported \noil, went up again. Production has gone down. It is certainly indicated \non this chart.\n  Also, I think we have to recognize that one thing has driven \neverything we do in this country, and that is the consumption of oil. \nWe consume far more than we should. I think that is why the Clinton-\nGore administration has stressed the fact that we need to do something \nto lessen the consumption of oil in this country.\n  The Energy Information Agency reports that the total petroleum \nproduct demand in 1999 grew by over 600,000 barrels a day, or 3.2 \npercent. That is the largest year increase since 1988.\n  The transportation-related demand accounted for more than 335,000 \nbarrels per day.\n  According to the Energy Information Agency, the annual energy outlook \nfor transportation sector energy consumption is projected to increase \nalmost 2 percent per year.\n  We need to do better.\n  Of the projected increase in oil demand between now and 2020, 87 \npercent will be in the transportation sector.\n  In 1995, the Republican Congress shut down the administration's \nefforts to study higher fuel efficiency standards for light trucks and \nSUVs. Major automobile manufacturers fought ruthlessly convincing labor \nthat it would cost jobs in the United States.\n  This summer when consumers started screaming about gasoline prices, \nFord and GM realized they could increase the fuel economy of SUVs by as \nmuch as 25 percent. This should have happened many, many years ago. \nBut, of course, the major automobile manufacturers were unwilling to \nsacrifice anything.\n  The good news is that we can have better fuel economy without costing \njobs or eliminating the features that consumers seek in these vehicles. \nThey have already committed to higher fuel emission standards in Europe \nand Japan. Why didn't they do it here? Because we were gullible. We in \nCongress would not allow legislation to go forward to do something \nabout this.\n  Let me repeat. I appreciate very much the desire of the Senators from \nAlaska to want to drill in pristine wilderness to create jobs in \nAlaska, but I think we have to look at the big picture. Jobs in Alaska \nare not as important as maintaining the last remaining Arctic pristine \nwilderness we have in America.\n  I hope we look at what we are already doing in Alaska to increase \nenergy production, and also look to the absolute necessity of doing \nsomething about alternative energy, such as wind, solar, and \ngeothermal--and do something with oil shale--doing things such as that \nso we can become more energy efficient in America and less dependent on \nforeign oil.\n  I reserve whatever time we have. I know the Senator from Illinois has \nbeen here patiently waiting to speak.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Senator Dorgan be allowed to follow the \nSenator from Illinois with the time we have remaining in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington has \nrequested that he be allowed to speak before me beginning at about \n11:10. I would like to go after Senator Gorton because he is only going \nto speak for about 10 minutes. I will speak for an extended period \nfollowing Senator Gorton's remarks.\n  Mr. REID. We have no objection to that. We want to make sure that the \nmanager of the bill on the Democrat side, Senator Byrd from West \nVirginia, is able to follow the statement of Senator Gorton--the two \nmanagers of the bill. I think the Senator from Illinois would not \nobject to that.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4578, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A conference report to accompany H.R. 4578, an act making \n     appropriations for the Department of the Interior and related \n     agencies for fiscal year sending September 30, 2001, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate \nthe conference report on the Interior and Related Appropriations Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2001. The conference report passed the House yesterday \non an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 348-69.\n  The bill provides $18.94 billion in total budget authority, an amount \nsignificantly above both the FY 2000 level of $15 billion and the \nPresident's FY 2001 request of $16.5 billion. This increase is \nprimarily attributable to two items that I know to be of great interest \nto my colleagues.\n  The bulk of the increase over the budget request level is a direct \nresult of the disastrous wildfires that plagued the West this summer. \nThis bill includes the administration's $1.6 billion supplementary fire \npackage, as well as $200 million in additional funds to address \nrehabilitation needs on the national forests, maintenance and upgrades \nto firefighting facilities, and for community and landowner assistance. \nThe bill also includes the $240 million provided in the Domenici floor \namendment for hazardous fuels reduction in the wildland/urban \ninterface.\n  Those areas which public lands abut upon communities, towns and \ncities, as well as language designed to expedite this work that so \ndesperately needs to be done. This language does not, however, overturn \nor bypass the National Environmental Protection Act, the Endangered \nSpecies Act, or any other environmental statute. In total, the bill \nprovides $2.9 billion for fire management.\n  The other element of this legislation that has garnered the most \nattention is title VIII, the land conservation, preservation, and \ninfrastructure improvement title. This title does two things: First, it \nprovides an additional $686 million in fiscal year 2001 for a wide \nvariety of conservation programs, including Federal land acquisition, \nthe stateside grant program, forest legacy, and urban park recreation \nand recovery. These amounts are in addition to the amounts agreed to in \nconference in the base portion of the bill. In total, funding for these \nInterior programs is about $1.2 billion for next year.\n  Second, title VIII establishes a new conservation spending category \nin the Budget Act for an array of conservation programs, for the \nmaintenance of Federal land management facilities, most particularly, \nnational parks, and for payments in lieu of taxes. Using the $1.2 \nbillion provided in the fiscal year 2001 Interior bill as a base \namount, plus a notional $400 million for coastal programs that may or \nmay not be provided in the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations \nbill, this new spending category is established using a base of $1.6 \nbillion.\n  For Interior and CJS programs combined, this new budgetary category \nwill go by $160 billion per year through fiscal year 2006. This \nseparate allocation may only be spent on qualifying programs, and any \namounts not spent will roll over and be added to the following year's \nallocation.\n  Title VIII also establishes several subcategories within the broader \ncategory conservation category. The allocation provided for each \nsubcategory will only be available for programs within that subcategory \nand may not be used for other programs. And, like the structure of the \nbroader category, any amounts not appropriated within a subcategory in \na given year would be rolled over and added to the following year's \nsuballocation.\n\n  The suballocations and associated amounts are shown on the chart. The \nbottom line is ``payments in lieu of taxes'' for $50 million a year--\nover and above the present payment in lieu of taxes. The next amount is \n``Federal\n\n[[Page S9797]]\n\nmaintenance,'' an amount added specifically at my request. This was \noriginally suggested by House conferees. It glaringly omitted the \ndeferred maintenance in our national parks and our forests and our \nwildlife refuges, an amount that I think approaches $16 billion, and a \nmodest start on that over and above the present bill is included in \neach one of these years.\n  Next, the orange is ``urban and historic preservation programs,'' the \npurple is ``State and other conservation programs,'' wildlife grants, \nwetlands conservation, the Geological Survey, and the like. The red is \n``Federal and State Land and Water Conservation Fund programs.'' The \ngreen is ``coastal programs,'' basically under the jurisdiction of \nNOAA, and the ``other'' beginning in fiscal year 2002 is the $160 \nmillion a year add-on which can be at the discretion of the Congress, \ndevoted to any one of these other programs. That will be decided by \nfuture Congresses.\n  As the allocation for the overall category grows in the outyears, \nthat growth is not tied to any particular subcategory. The \nsuballocations are not caps. There is nothing to prevent the \nAppropriations Committee from also using its regular allocation to fund \nany one of these programs that provide additional funding from the \noverall program growth, the blue part, lines I have just described on \nthe graph.\n  While this structure is somewhat confusing at first, its effect is to \nprovide some certainty to several programs within the Interior \nsubcommittee jurisdiction which will be likely to receive and maintain \nsubstantial increases over the current funding levels. At the same \ntime, it preserves the availability of Congress to adjust specific \namounts on a year-to-year basis in response to changing needs \nperformance and other factors.\n  Finally, of course, any money not spent, while it cannot be spent for \nany other spending category, obviously will go to pay down the national \ndebt.\n  The programs that comprise the new spending category are a mix of \nprograms identified as priorities by the administration in its budget \nrequest, by supporters of CARA during their deliberations, and by \nCongress as a whole as represented in the thousands of individual \nrequests that I receive each year as chairman of this subcommittee. I \nwant to emphasize, once again, what I did several months ago when we \ndebated this bill for the first time. I think this year we had 1,100 \nrequests from 100 Senators for programs within Interior--the great \nmajority of which would fall into one of these categories.\n  Vitally important is the fact that the bill does not create any new \nentitlements. At the same time, it is not an empty promise. For the \nsame reasons-- we rarely see an appropriations bill go to the floor \nwithout spending every penny of its allocation--I think it likely that \nallocations provided in title VIII will be fully subscribed in each \nyear's appropriations bill. The exact mix of funding will be up to \nfuture Congresses, but title VIII does prevent these funds from being \ntaken from the target programs and used for other programs, even other \nprograms within the Interior bills, such as Indian education, health \nservices, Forest Service, the cleanup of abandoned mine lands.\n\n  To be perfectly clear, the construct of title VIII is not what I \nwould have dealt had I complete discretion. Nor do I believe it is what \nthe Appropriations Committee would have written with complete \ndiscretion. Congress has always had the ability to provide increases to \nthe programs through the regular appropriations process, but it has not \nnecessarily done so due to the resulting impact on other programs and, \nof course, on the deficit or the surplus. Nevertheless, title VIII \nrepresents a fair compromise that reflects the general views of this \nCongress with respect to these programs, and it has the support of the \nadministration.\n  Now, the focus in recent weeks has been on wildfires and the \nconservation funding issues I have just addressed. There are other \nfeatures of the bill to which I want to draw my colleagues' attention. \nThe conference report provides an increase of $104 million for the \noperation of the National Park Service and the U.S. Park Police, \nincluding $40 million to increase the base-operating budgets of nearly \n100 parks and related sites. The bill also provides an increase of $66 \nmillion for the management of Bureau of Land Management land and \nresources, a badly needed boost for an agency that has sometimes \nreceived less attention than the other land management agencies, but \nwhich has a demanding mission in terms of multiple uses.\n  The operating budgets of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest \nService also receive healthy increases, which I hope will enable these \nagencies to improve performance in areas such as the Endangered Species \nAct consultation and recreation management.\n  In terms of programs designed primarily to benefit American Indians, \nthis bill has a great deal to offer. From the very beginning of this \nprocess, I have made Indian education in school construction one of my \nhighest funding priorities. Many colleagues on the committee--\nparticularly my friend, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, who \nis here on the floor--have for years stressed the need for increased \ninvestment in Indian schools. This year's budget request provided an \nopportunity to provide this investment. I am pleased the conference \nreport provides $142 million for school replacement. This is $75 \nmillion above this year's enacted level and will provide funds for the \nreplacement of the next six schools on the Bureau of Indian Affairs \npriority list. It also provides funding for a cost-share program for \neligible replacement schools, which is designed to provide funding so \nthat construction of replacement schools can be fully completed in \norder to remove the school immediately from the BIA priority list. \nIndian school repairs also increases by $80.5 million above last year's \nlevel.\n  The conference report also provides significant increases for health \nservices for Indian people, including an increase of $167 million for \nhealth services and $47 million for construction and repair of health \ncare facilities.\n  The bill provides continued support for the Department of Interior's \nefforts to reform its trust management practices. This is a massive \nproblem that has developed over decades, if not the entire 20th \ncentury, which will take time and resources to fix. This conference \nreport provides the budget request for the Office of the Special \nTrustee, and also provides an emergency supplemental of $27.6 million \nfor activities directly related to recent developments in the Cobell \nlitigation. In addition, the bill provides an increase of $31.9 million \nabove fiscal year 2000 for trust reform within the regular Bureau of \nIndian Affairs appropriations.\n  Of the many cultural programs within this subcommittee's \njurisdiction, the National Endowment for the Arts was again the focus \nof much discussion in the House-Senate conference. The conference \nagreement maintains the Senate funding level for the NEA--an increase \nof $7.4 million above the current year level. These additional funds \nwill be targeted for arts education and outreach programs, and I think \nare a fitting response to the reforms that the NEA has instituted in \nrecent years. This is the first increase of any significance for the \nNEA in more than a decade. I am also pleased that funding for the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities is also increased by $5 million.\n  For energy programs, this conference report includes funding for \nseveral programs that will help reduce our dependence on foreign energy \nsources, as well as reduce harmful emissions from stationary and mobile \nsources. The energy conservation account is increased by $95 million, \nincluding full funding for the Partnership for a New Generation of \nVehicles--PNGV. This amount also includes increases of $18 million for \nthe Weatherization program and $4 million for the State Energy \nConservation Program. For fossil energy R, the bill provides $433 \nmillion, and establishes a new powerplant improvement program to \nsupport demonstration of advanced coal power technologies. This is an \ninitiative that I am sure Senator Byrd will wish to discuss further, \nbecause it is one of his favorite items.\n  There are many other elements of this conference report that \nrecommend its passage by the Senate, but I will only mention one more. \nFunding for payments in lieu of taxes is increased by $65 million, \nincluding $50 million provided in title VIII, outlined on this chart. \nThis brings appropriations for\n\n[[Page S9798]]\n\nPILT to $200 million. This increase represents a significant step in \nraising appropriations for PILT toward the authorized funding level.\n  I also wish to note two errors in the Statement of Managers. Page 177 \nof the Statement of Managers indicates that an increase of $4 million \nabove the House level is provided for ``Heavy Vehicle Propulsion within \nthe hybrid systems activity.'' This is incorrect, and is a result of an \nerror in the conference notes. The $4 million increase over the House \nlevel is for ``Advanced Power Electronics,'' reflecting the amount \nprovided in the Senate-passed bill. On page 194 of the Statement of \nManagers, the paragraph that begins ``Consistent with paragraph (3) and \naccompanying Senate instruction . . .'' should have been deleted.\n  In closing, I want to again urge my colleagues to support this \nconference report. It does a tremendous amount of good for the \nmanagement of our Federal lands, as well as for the conservation of \nlands and waters whether Federal, state, municipal or private. It is a \ngood bill that has the unanimous support of the conferees of both \nHouses, and I urge its adoption by the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I, first, congratulate Senator Gorton. \nEverything considered--the pressure of the closing, the politics of \nthis season--I think he produced a very good bill and I compliment him. \nI would like to quickly talk with him about three issues because they \nhave been very dear to me and we have finally come around to solving \nall three of them in this bill.\n  First, the American Indian people will thank us because for the first \ntime we are making the case for replacing Indian schools. They are so \nmuch in disrepair that nobody would send their kids to them, but there \nare no other schools to go to; they are out in Indian country, and we, \nthe Government, happen to own them. There has been a dramatic increase \nthis year. Thanks to this committee, we will add six new schools, and \nwe will do a very large amount of maintenance on buildings that \ndesperately need it. If Congress will heed what was discussed, they \nwill do this for 5 or 6 years and get rid of the entire backlog.\n  Senator, you have heard me for years ask the administration to give \nus a multiyear budget proposal to take care of Indian schools because \nif we don't pay for them nobody will. They are ours. This year the \nPresident put such language in his budget after consultation with a \nnumber of us. It is a little late, but nonetheless the Indian people \ncan finally say, ``We see some daylight,'' with reference to adequate \nschools for our kids.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Mexico not only states the case \ncorrectly but understates his own participation. I am rather certain \nthat the President would not have made the request without the constant \nadvocacy on behalf of this program from the Senator from New Mexico. I \nthink he can take great credit for this success.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator, my good friend, very much.\n  Second, we debated on the floor of the Senate an interesting sounding \namendment. We called it ``Happy Forests.'' It was a $240 million \namendment on this bill on the floor. I thought I was going to get a lot \nof guff here on the floor because I asked for $240 million and divided \nit among the two agencies that control our property, the Forest Service \nand the BLM. What I wanted to do with the money was to push, with a \ngreat deal of vigor, for these two Departments to go out and inventory \nwhere the forests were close to our cities, where the forests have \ngrown up, where cities have grown up and where there is a proximity of \nbuildings and people to the forest because that is very risky.\n  We did strike a positive tone with the administration when they \nadmitted that there were many such cases and many examples. We have \ncited examples of a city such as Santa Fe in New Mexico where its water \nresource is right in the forest. If that forest happened to burn, they \nwould lose their water supply. So we thought we ought to pursue this \nand start a list of those and make the Federal Government start to list \nthe risky ones and then start to clean them up.\n  We had to argue for 3 days. We got about 75 percent of what we \nwanted. We gave in to the administration on some in a very valid \ncompromise. But I can say as to number, as many as a few hundred \ncommunities that are right in the forests, they should be seeing the \nFederal Government around coming up with some plans to try to alleviate \nthis underbrush problem and growth that may, indeed, cause these \ncommunities to burn when we could prevent it with some maintenance and \ncleanup.\n\n  We have not reached, to my satisfaction, language that will push this \nexpeditiously because they are fearful in the White House that we are \ngoing to push some of the environmental laws. We made it clear the \nenvironmental laws apply. Nonetheless, there will be some difficulty on \nthe part of the bureaus of the Federal Government because they have to \nmove with some dispatch and they have to advise people a lot more than \nthey ever did about the proximity of fire and the risk to them and \nwhere they are scheduled to do the cleanup--where is that? They are \ngoing to have to start advising communities.\n  So I thank my good friend for that.\n  Mr. GORTON. Again, this was the program of the Senator from New \nMexico. I do not think there was any item in the conference committee \nthat was discussed at more length with the administration and in more \ndetail. I am gratified the Senator was able to make a reasonable \ncompromise and I was delighted to support him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I also say, overall, when we make requests of you and \nyour people, and Senator Byrd and his people, I do not think in any \ncase for me we could have been treated more fairly. Every request was \nlooked at carefully. I thank my colleague so much for the many things \nhe was able to do for my State. I will enumerate them and perhaps come \nto the floor before the Senator is finished and talk with a little more \nspecificity. But I thought before he left his opening statement too far \nbehind, I would like to add my words at the end of it as I have this \nmorning.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate that. As the Senator knows, this is a \nreciprocal relationship. The people of the State of Washington can \nthank the Senator from the State of New Mexico for many vitally \nimportant programs that are in the bill for energy and water that he \nmanages.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. By the way, that is going down to the President soon--I \ndon't know how long it will take--and it will come back here with a \nveto, and we do intend to work as expeditiously as we can to repass it \nwith the many things that are in there for your sake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. I note the presence on the floor of my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Byrd, my good friend, who also has a great deal of \nresponsibility for this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. It goes without saying, Mr. President--I have said it many \ntimes already--that the chairman of this subcommittee is fully \nknowledgeable of the contents of the original bill, fully knowledgeable \nof what is in this conference report, and always--always considerate, \nalways courteous, and is one of the finest chairmen I have ever served \nwith on any subcommittee. And I served with a lot of chairmen of \nsubcommittees. This one is almost without a flaw when it comes to being \nchairman of this subcommittee.\n  It is a pleasure for me to serve with him. I would like to be \nchairman one day, but I am not the chairman, and I fully understand \nthat. If somebody else other than I has to be chairman, I like Senator \nGorton. We accomplish a lot for this Nation together. This is a great \nsubcommittee.\n  I have said many times it really is a western subcommittee, more so \nthan it is eastern, as far as I am concerned. I have said that over the \nyears. But we do our best because somebody has to do the work. I do \nenjoy it. I enjoy the collaboration we always have in connection with \nthis bill. I do it understanding that the appropriations process is \nabsolutely vital to the operation of Government and that we need to \nknow about that process. We need to always understand the rules and the \nprecedents of Government.\n  If I had a larger vocabulary, I could say more about the chairmanship \nthat\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\nis rendered by Mr. Gorton. I will not speak further. I could say the \nsame thing with regard to the chairman of the full committee, Ted \nStevens. There could not be any finer man. He is always a gentleman. \nThat goes a long way with me around the Senate. He is always a \ngentleman. He is always considerate of the needs and the problems of \nthe constituents of other Senators. He listens courteously, and he is \nvery straightforward. If he cannot do it, he will tell you so. He tells \nme that. If he cannot do it, he will tell me so. I like that kind of \ntalk.\n  Mr. President, I fully support the legislation. I urge my colleagues \nto support it as well.\n  I will not reiterate the inventory of programs contained in the \nInterior conference report, nor their respective funding levels. The \nchairman has done an excellent job of providing Members with those \ndetails. I do, however, wish to point out a new program planned for the \nDepartment of Energy because of its significance to this nation's \noverall energy security.\n  Within the Fossil Energy Research and Development account, funds have \nbeen provided to undertake a power plant improvement initiative. This \nnew effort is vital to our Nation if we hope to continue our economic \nexpansion. Upgrading and renewing our out-of-date and undersized \nelectric power system cannot wait. We cannot sit back and wait for the \ndevelopment of new power sources which, to date, have not proved \ncommercially viable.\n  The fact is, more than half of this Nation's electricity is generated \nin coal-fired power plants, a situation that is not likely to change \nfor the foreseeable future.\n  We are working today by virtue of the lights that are in the ceiling \nof this Chamber. It used to be in this country that this Chamber was \nlighted by gas. It was only in this century, the 20th century--and we \nare not into the 21st yet--it was only in this century that we saw air-\nconditioning come to this Chamber.\n  From where does this energy come? What is the source? What is the \nsource of the little light we see at night burning in the top of the \nWashington Monument?\n  I made a trip around the world with a House committee in 1955, 45 \nyears ago. We went around the world in an old Constellation, four \npropellers. We visited many countries. Today it would be called a \njunket. But we were away 68 days. We visited many countries throughout \nthe world. When I was in high school, I read a book by Jules Verne \ntitled ``Around the World in 80 Days.'' We went around the world in 68 \ndays. Of course, John Glenn went around the world in, I believe it was \n81 minutes.\n  The point I am making is I visited many countries, saw many things, \nmet many high people--kings and princes and queens, shahs. We saw \nwonderful edifices, beautiful edifices, great edifices, such as the Taj \nMahal. But the most enjoyable, pleasurable, satisfying, and comforting \nthing I saw on that whole trip was when we flew back into Washington \nand I saw those two or three little red lights in the top of the \nWashington Monument. There we were, home again, where we could go to \nthe water faucet and drink without fear that we might succumb to some \ndisease. Having been in Afghanistan on that trip and Jakarta and India, \nPakistan, Korea, and Malaysia--all of these places where one certainly \nmust not, at that time, drink the water without its being boiled--it \nbrought to me in a very vivid way what a wonderful country we have and \nhow great it is to be home, back in the good old United States of \nAmerica, where we take so many things for granted.\n  There were those lights in the top of the Washington Monument, and \nhere are these lights. Take away coal; take away those lights. The \ngreat eastern cities of New York and Philadelphia and Boston, the great \ncities of the East--take away the coal, and it is going to shut down a \nlot of industries. People will then begin to appreciate that coal miner \nwhose sweat, and sometimes tears, and sometimes blood afford this great \ncountry the leisure and the comfort that come from coal-fired plants.\n  We are working to make this coal more environmentally feasible. We \nhave gone a long way. I have supported appropriations and initiated \nappropriations for clean coal technology, and we have seen the results \nof this research that is being done by these funds that come out of the \ncommittee on which the distinguished minority whip, Mr. Reid, and I \nsit.\n  There are people in this Government who, I imagine, would like to see \nthe mines closed, coal mining done away with; shut them down. We know \nwe are in transition, and we are preparing for that eventuality by the \nfact that we appropriate funds in this committee to produce energy in \nan environmentally feasible manner.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do yield, with great pleasure, to my friend.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend from West Virginia this question. I can't \npass up the opportunity; whenever I hear someone talking about miners, \nmy mind is flooded with thoughts of my father. The Senator and I have \ndiscussed what a hard job a miner has. I can remember, as if it were \nyesterday, my father coming home, muddy and dirty, telling us he had \nanother hard day at the office. The fact of the matter is, he worked \nvery hard. Miners work very hard.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has done such an outstanding job of \nprotecting miners, and not only coal miners. You have helped us with \nour gold miners, people who go under the Earth for other types of \nproduct than coal.\n  I also say this to my friend from West Virginia, my leader. This \nGovernment needs to do more with clean coal technology. We started a \nplant near Reno, NV, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars. But in \nthe second phase of it, the Government did not come through in helping \nwith that energy-efficient use of coal, and therefore they are going to \nhave to switch and do something else.\n  The Federal Government has the means now of clean coal technology. \nBut we have been too cheap as a government. We need to spend more money \non clean coal technology. If we spent more money on clean coal \ntechnology, we would be less dependent on oil. So I want to help the \nSenator from West Virginia any way I can to make sure we do more with \ndeveloping clean coal technology. And with the technology we have, \nlet's make sure the Federal Government helps implement this in places \nsuch as Reno, at the Tracy plant, so we can do a better job of cleaning \nthe air.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I thank my friend for his excellent contribution to \nthe colloquy.\n  Many times, as he has said, we have discussed this matter. He \nunderstands the background from which I came--which is a similar \nbackground to that from which he came--the coal mining; in his case, \ngold mining; in my case, coal mining. Sometimes we refer to it as \n``black gold.''\n  This coal has provided the livelihood for thousands of miners over \nthe years, who have risked their lives to go into those coal mines. So \nresearch, I have believed during the years I have been on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee--42 years--is the answer to many of the \nthings, research. And through research, mining has been made more safe. \nWe have fewer and fewer miners being killed annually than we have had \nin the past.\n  It has been a very bloody--a very bloody--employment and a very \nbloody industry, if you go back over the years. So we have improved the \nsafety. We are helping to clean up the environment. We are \nunderstanding ways in which coal may be mined more cheaply. And that is \nthe result of the moneys that have been appropriated through this \nSubcommittee on Interior.\n  As I have already indicated, I have appropriated, I have been the \nsource of the appropriations of millions of dollars for clean coal \ntechnology. And I have to say that my own administration has several \ntimes, in the budget that has been sent up here to the Congress, \nrecommended deferring--deferring--some of these moneys, using these \nmoneys that are there for clean coal technology, using them for \nsomething else, or even rescinding some of those moneys.\n  Now I have fought--fought--these budget recommendations off several \ntimes. So I think we have reached the point where the Presidential \ncandidates need to talk about this. And I hope they will.\n  Given that reality, it makes good, common sense for the United States \nto\n\n[[Page S9800]]\n\ntry to ease the demand on the existing fleet of electric plants. And, \nso, the conferees have included this new power plant improvement \ninitiative in an effort to bring business and Government together in a \nproductive partnership that will produce more energy, yet cleaner \nenergy. I am pleased that this effort is being made, and I thank the \ndistinguished chairman for his help in ensuring that our Nation's \nenergy needs continue to be a top priority.\n  I thank the other members of the Appropriations Committee. And I \nthank our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol on the \nAppropriations Committee there who have worked with us in this regard.\n  Beyond this particular program, let me also say how much I appreciate \nthe chairman's overall support for projects and programs of importance \nto the minority Members of this body. I have already referred to that, \nbut I think it bears reflecting upon again. As always, his \ngraciousness, his dedication to duty, and his steadfast commitment to \nworking in a bipartisan manner have made this conference far less \narduous than it might otherwise have been. Despite all the tangents \nthat conferees are wont to go off on--if left to their own devices; and \nI understand how that is very easily done--Senator Gorton never lost \nsight of the ultimate task at hand.\n  So in my opinion, based on my experience, he is the consummate \nprofessional. And he and his staff--we must not forget the staff. We \noften hear that the clothes make the man. Well, I must say, based on my \nexperience here, that the staff, in large measure, make the Senator and \nhelp to turn the wheels of the Nation. So our staffs are to be \ncommended for their efforts.\n  I urge all my colleagues, Mr. President, to support this conference \nreport so that we can send it to the White House for the President's \nsignature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I am here to speak on the $120 million \nAbraham Lincoln Library, for which there is authorization language in \nthe Interior Subcommittee appropriations bill.\n  Last night, the Senate passed separate legislation authorizing $50 \nmillion of Federal funds for the construction of the Abraham Lincoln \nLibrary in Springfield, IL. The library is intended to be built with a \nmixture of State and Federal funds. The total cost of the project would \nbe about $120 million.\n  The Senate, in adopting its authorizing language, attached an \namendment, that I put on, that required this library, this monument for \n``Honest Abe'' Lincoln--that all the construction contracts on it be \ncompetitively bid in accordance with the Federal competitive bid \nguidelines.\n  That language cleared the full Senate last night. The Senate went on \nrecord in favor of a requirement that this Abraham Lincoln $120 million \nlibrary carry with it the requirements that all contracts be \ncompetitively bid in accordance with Federal procurement law, the \npurpose of which is to prevent political favoritism in the awarding of \nconstruction contracts and also to get the best value for the taxpayer.\n  I rise to speak on the Subcommittee on Interior appropriations bill \nbecause there is language in the bill that authorizes $50 million in \nFederal funding over several years for construction of the Abraham \nLincoln Library. However, the language requiring competitive bidding of \nthe construction contract has been stripped out of the conference \nreport.\n  The Governor of Illinois is opposed to the attachment of Federal \ncompetitive bidding guidelines and apparently asked for House \nassistance to go around the Senate, which has spoken on this issue and \ngone on record in favor of the Federal competitive bid guidelines.\n  I support construction of the Abraham Lincoln Library in Springfield, \nIL. If it is done properly, it could be a wonderful treasure, not only \nfor the city of Springfield and for the State of Illinois but, indeed, \nfor the entire Nation. Of course, Springfield, IL, is where ``Honest \nAbe Lincoln'' lived. He lived there for many years. He is responsible \nfor making it the State capital of Illinois. When Abe Lincoln served in \nthe State legislature in the early part of the 1800s, he was successful \nin leading a drive to move the State capital from Vandalia to \nSpringfield, IL. For several years, he represented Sangamon County in \nboth the Illinois Legislature and later for a period in the U.S. \nCongress. Of course, his debates for the Senate seat with Stephen \nDouglas of Illinois in 1858 are legendary.\n  I am very proud to hold the seat in the Senate that Abraham Lincoln \nand Stephen Douglas vied for in 1858, before, of course, Abraham \nLincoln went on, in 1860, to be elected the first Republican President \nof the United States and one of our greatest Presidents ever.\n  There are several Lincoln attractions in Springfield, IL. I am sure \nmany of my colleagues and many of the people in the gallery have \nvisited Lincoln's home in Springfield, IL, which is run by the National \nPark Service. It is maintained with a great deal of care. It is a \nwonderful attraction. I went there as a boy, and I have returned there \nmany times since. Senator Durbin and I both have our Springfield \ndistrict offices in the Lincoln home neighborhood, which has been \nrenovated and restored to the way it was when Abraham Lincoln and his \nfamily lived there prior to his becoming President.\n\n  We also have in Springfield the Abraham Lincoln law office. One can \nactually go into the very same building in which Abraham Lincoln \npracticed law for many years in Springfield. He rode the circuit. He \ndid not just practice law in Sangamon County but practiced law all over \ncentral Illinois.\n  In recent years, we have turned up many original legal pleadings and \nfilings drafted by Abraham Lincoln. Many of those documents are now \nscattered all over the State of Illinois. It would be a wonderful \nachievement if we could finally have one great Lincoln Library in \nSpringfield to bring all the Lincoln artifacts in the possession of the \nState of Illinois, as well as whatever members of the public donate for \nthis library, into one tasteful, well thought out monument to the man \nwho is arguably the greatest President of the United States, the one \nwho saved our Union at its hour of maximum peril.\n  I am concerned that if we don't have tight controls over taxpayer \nmoney that is going to build this library, we run the risk of winding \nup not with a $120 million Abraham Lincoln Library but instead a $50 \nmillion building that just happens to cost $120 million. I think there \ncould be no worse or uglier irony than to have a monument for ``Honest \nAbe'' wind up being a gigantic public works project on which a bunch of \npolitical insiders wind up lining their pockets at taxpayer expense.\n  Let me share some background on the Abraham Lincoln Library, where \nthe idea first started, and how it has changed over the years. I think \nmy colleagues will see that I have reason to be concerned about the \ngrowing cost of the project and certainly the magnitude of it within \nthe city of Springfield.\n  This is a time line: ``The Lincoln Library Project Time Line and \nInteresting Facts.''\n  Back in February 1998, then-Governor Jim Edgar proposed construction \nof the Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield and committed $4.9 \nmillion in State funds for initial planning and design. At that time, \nthe projected cost of the project was not $120 million. The projected \ncost was $40 million. They said it was going to come from State, local, \nand private funds.\n  Later on, in May of 1998, the project was no longer a $40 million \nproject. It had grown 50 percent in those few months. It was now a $60 \nmillion project. According to the Copely News Service, on May 13, 1998, \nthe estimated cost of the Lincoln Library was raised to $60 million, an \nincrease of 50 percent. Senator Durbin and my predecessor, Carol \nMoseley-Braun, and Sid Yates, who was at that time the ranking member \non the House Interior Committee, were seeking $30 million in Federal \ncommitment for the project. They wrote that the State and the city of \nSpringfield were willing to commit up to $30 million in funds to match \nFederal support. That was May of 1998. We had gone from $40 million up \nto $60 million.\n  By April 1999, less than a year later, the project price tag had gone \nup again, this time a little bit more significantly. ``Illinois \nHistoric Preservation Association authority spokesman\n\n[[Page S9801]]\n\nsays library may cost as much as $148 million.'' We have gone from $40 \nto $60 million, and now we are at $148 million. I believe, now, today, \nsince April 1999, they are talking about $115 or $120 million. \nGratefully, the cost or the projected cost has gone down from April \n1999. We are talking today about a $115 or $120 million project. That \nis a big building for Springfield, IL.\n  These are Illinois structures and cost comparisons. This is taken \nfrom a State Journal-Register article of May 1, 2000. The State \nJournal-Register is the newspaper in Springfield, IL. They apparently \ndid some figuring and estimated the cost, adjusted for inflation, of \nmany of the other prominent buildings in the city of Springfield, IL.\n  Our State capitol in Illinois was built between 1868 and 1888. The \nestimated cost, adjusted for inflation, of constructing the State \ncapitol in Springfield, IL, is $70 million. The State Historical \nLibrary, constructed from 1965 to 1968, would cost $13 million to build \ntoday. Keep in mind that with this project--the Lincoln Library--we are \ntalking about a $120 million building. The State Library, redone in \n1990, was $6 million; Lincoln's Tomb, done in 1865, $6 million. The \nDana-Thomas House, a Frank Lloyd Wright home, which I believe the State \nowns and manages, built between 1902 and 1904, would cost $9 million.\n  Now, the State has a revenue department. It is one of the largest \ndepartments of the State, and it has a fairly new building that goes \nback to the early eighties, one of the very large State office \nbuildings in Springfield that was built between 1981 and 1984. The \nestimated cost, adjusted for inflation, of building it today is $70 \nmillion. They have a gigantic convention center in Springfield called \nthe Prairie Capitol Convention Center, constructed between 1975 and \n1979. The estimated cost, adjusted for inflation, of building that \ngiant Capitol Convention Center today would be $60 million.\n  There are also some very notable private buildings in Springfield, \nIL, that are quite large and significant. One is the Franklin Life \nInsurance Company building, built between 1911 and 1913. The estimated \ncost, adjusted for inflation, of building it today is $44 million. The \nHorace Mann Insurance Company building, built from 1968 to 1972, would \nbe $34.5 million.\n  So, again, the Abraham Lincoln Library is going to be almost twice as \ncostly as any of these other buildings--almost twice as costly as the \nState capitol, even though the capitol, I believe, is projected to be \nabout two times the size of the projected Abraham Lincoln Library. We \nare talking about a very substantial building. It is interesting to \nnote, as well, that the Ronald Reagan Library--a Presidential library \nwhich opened in 1991--cost $65 million.\n  I have indicated to you the magnitude of this project as being \nsomething that caused me to really focus on the details of the taxpayer \nmoney involved. I noted the size and scope of the construction project, \nhow it had grown from $40 million to $60 million to $120 million in \nprojected costs over a very short period of time. But I also want to \nrefer you to the language in the Interior conference report now on the \nfloor of the Senate, which has come over to us from the House.\n  The language in the conference report does not tell the people of \nthis country to whom the $50 million is going to be paid. The language \nof the conference committee report says the $50 million will go to an \nentity that will be selected later. We are talking about $50 million. \nEverybody is acting under the assumption that this money is going to be \ngiven to the State of Illinois. I think it should be noted that there \nis no requirement in the conference committee report that is before the \nSenate that this money is required to go to a public source, such as \nthe State of Illinois. It is required to go to ``an entity'' that will \nbe selected later. Now, could that be a private entity? It appears to \nme it could because there is nothing in the conference committee report \nthat would prevent it from being paid to a private entity. It says an \nentity that will be selected later by the Secretary of the Department \nof the Interior in consultation with the Governor of Illinois.\n\n  Now, under the language as it is worded, they could possibly give \nthat $50 million to an individual. I hope that will not happen. I hope \nthe Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of Illinois will not \ndecide to take $50 million of taxpayer money and give it to an \nindividual. But they could under the language before the Senate. There \nwould be no violation of the law if they did. They could also give it \nto a private corporation. There would be no violation of this \nconference committee report if the Secretary of the Interior, in \nconsultation with the Governor of Illinois, steered this money to a \nprivate corporation. If that were to happen, this money would just have \ngone out of the public's hands and out of the public control into an \narea where we could no longer really put much in the way of \nrestrictions on what they did with it. Pretty much the only requirement \nin the conference report is that this entity, to be designated or \nselected later, will have to show its plans for the construction of the \nlibrary.\n  There is a private entity out there called the Abraham Lincoln \nPresidential Library Foundation. As far as I can tell, this is a \nprivate, not-for-profit corporation that has filed with the Illinois \nsecretary of state's office on June 20, 1990. It has an address of 10 \nSouth Dearborn Street, Suite 5100, Chicago, IL. The registered agent's \nname is J. Douglas Donafeld. I recall Mr. Donafeld as a lawyer in \nChicago who does lobby work in Springfield. The corporation's name is \nthe Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation. This foundation, \naccording to published reports that I have read, has three directors on \nits board--a Mrs. Julie Cellini, who is head of the Illinois Historic \nPreservation Agency; Lura Lynn Ryan, the First Lady of the State of \nIllinois; and Pam Daniels, the wife of Lee Daniels, the Republican \nleader in the Illinois State House of Representatives. I hope the \nGovernor of Illinois and the Secretary of the Interior will not give \nthese public funds to the private corporation called the Abraham \nLincoln Presidential Library Foundation because, if that were to \nhappen, then no one's competitive bid laws, no one's procurement laws \nwould be attached and the money could really be out of the taxpayers' \ncontrol.\n  Assume, for the sake of argument, that this $50 million in Federal \nmoney would not be given to a private individual or a private \ncorporation and that the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of \nIllinois would want it sent to the State of Illinois. I think it is a \nreasonable assumption that the State of Illinois would turn the money \nover to the State Capitol Development Board, which usually builds State \nbuildings such as this--builds State prisons and has built the State of \nIllinois building in downtown Chicago. It is a reasonable assumption \nthat if the entity selected to receive the $50 million is not a private \nentity, the money would go to the State and the State would turn it \nover to the Capitol Development Board, which is known as the CDB for \nshort.\n  The State contends that if the money is handled by the CDB, the \nState's procurement law for its competitive bidding laws that applies \nto the CDB and to other State agencies, such as Central Management \nServices, and apparently most of the rest of the State government, that \nits code would apply to the construction of this library and that its \ncode would require competitive bidding of the project.\n  The Governor of Illinois contends that there is no need for the \nFederal competitive bidding guidelines to be attached because in his \njudgment the State procurement code is sufficient.\n  He also points out that I, Peter Fitzgerald, Senator from Illinois, \nwhen I was a State senator representing the northwest suburban Chicago \narea district in the Illinois State Senate, voted for that procurement \ncode. Indeed, I did in 1997. I believed that code appeared to represent \nan improvement over the prior procurement code in the State of \nIllinois. But I regret that there was a loophole in that State's \nprocurement code that I missed in 1997. I regret that I missed it, and \nI want to make doubly sure that we don't repeat another loophole in \nthis particular project. I didn't recognize this loophole until I sat \ndown and compared the State code side by side with the Federal code.\n  In my judgment, there are two main problems with the State's \ncompetitive bid code.\n  There are many instances in the State procurement code where there\n\n[[Page S9802]]\n\nare fairly narrow exceptions to the general requirement for purchases \nof goods and equipment, building construction contracts, and leases. \nThere are some narrow exceptions sprinkled throughout the code to the \ngeneral requirement that the project be competitively bid with an \noverall push towards trying to get the lowest cost bid built into the \ncode. But most of the exceptions built into the code to the competitive \nbid requirements are fairly narrow.\n  If the State does not use competitive bidding to buy something, they \ntypically will have to give notice and file written reasons for not \ngoing forward with competitive bidding.\n  But here is a loophole. And here is why this loophole is relevant to \nthis major gigantic project.\n  Within the part of the State procurement code that deals with the \nIllinois Capital Development Board, which, as I have explained, is the \nboard or State agency that would be required to construct the Abraham \nLincoln Library, provided the Governor of Illinois and the Secretary of \nInterior don't channel the $50 million in Federal money to a private \nentity outside the control of anybody but the board of directors of \nthat corporation, the Capital Development Board has a special section \nin the procurement code. They have a special exemption.\n  Let us read the Capital Development Board special exemption. You \ndon't need to be a lawyer to understand that this is a rather broad \nloophole in the portion of the Illinois Capital Development Board's \nprocurement code.\n  This is from an Illinois statute. This is binding law in the State of \nIllinois, passed by the Illinois General Assembly, and signed into law \nby the Governor of Illinois.\n  30 I.L.C.S. 500/30-15: (b) says:\n\n       Other methods. The Capital Development Board shall \n     establish by rule construction purchases that may be made \n     without competitive sealed bidding and the most competitive \n     alternate method of source selection that shall be used.\n\n  The code clearly contemplates that the Capital Development Board \nshall not have to use competitive bidding; that they can opt out of \ncompetitively bidding for this construction contract. That language is \nplain as day.\n  The Capital Development Board, in seeking to oppose my amendment \nwhich requires the application of Federal competitive bid laws, has \ncirculated a letter that says they have to competitively bid the \nproject under State law. However, their letter makes no reference or \nattempts to abut this provision of State law.\n  Here is what their letter says:\n\n       Dear Senator Fitzgerald: Competitive bidding has long been \n     the requirement for State of Illinois construction contracts \n     and was most recently reaffirmed with the passage of the \n     stricter Illinois procurement code of 1998. Only six \n     exemptions to that provision, which are defined by rule and \n     must be approved by the director, exist.\n\n  And then they name the exemptions: No. 1, emergency repairs; No. 2, \nconstruction projects of less than $30,000 total; No. 3, limited \nprojects such as asbestos removal for which CDB may contract with \ncorrectional industries; No. 4, an architecture program which follows a \nseparate procurement process; No. 5, construction management services \nwhich are competitively procured under a separate law; and, No. 6, sole \nsource items.\n  I am not sure what the sole source items are.\n  But, in any case, they don't refer to this section of the law which \nseems to me is plain as day.\n  I am a lawyer, so I didn't find it confusing. I have run it by \nnonlawyers, and none of them have been unable to understand this. It \ndoesn't seem as if there is any ambiguity here.\n  It says, ``The Capital Development Board shall establish by rule \nconstruction purchases that may be made without competitive sealed \nbidding.'' So they can establish a rule that they can do this without \ncompetitive bidding.\n  What does it mean when they establish a rule, when they say ``rule\"?\n  The Capital Development Board can just write its own rule. It has \nthat authority from the Illinois General Assembly to write its own \nrule. And in this authority to them to write its own rule, we have an \nunchecked level of discretion on the part of the State that, in my \njudgment, leaves too much room for abuse by political insiders in the \nState of Illinois.\n  When I saw that was in the bill originally authorizing this \nappropriations, which as I said, the Senate passed last night with my \namendment requiring Federal competitive bid guidelines, and my staff \nshowed it to me, we said this is a giant loophole.\n  As one paper in Illinois has editorialized it, it is a giant loophole \nfor which you could drive a whole convoy of Illinois Department of \nTransportation trucks.\n  I regret that I missed that when I voted for this procurement code of \nwhich I was a part back in 1997.\n  I asked the Congressional Research Service if there was a comparable \nloophole in the Federal law.\n  In a memorandum to me from an attorney in the Congressional Research \nService at the Library of Congress, it says:\n\n       The exception found in 30 I.L.C.S. 500/30-15, which permits \n     the Capital Development Board to establish by rule \n     construction purchases which may be made without competitive \n     sealed bidding, does not have a comparable provision in \n     Federal procurement law. On its face it appears to be a \n     rather broad exception to the requirement for competition in \n     awarding State construction contracts.\n\n  I think it is very clear that is a giant loophole that should not be \nallowed in a project of this magnitude. Mr. President, $50 million of \ntaxpayer money from the Federal Government is a lot of money. How many \nAmericans are working day in and day out, some families with parents \nworking 2, 2\\1/2\\, sometimes 3 jobs just to pay the taxes, just to pay \nthe cut extracted by Uncle Sam. The American people are fundamentally \nvery generous with their money. They will permit reasonable \nexpenditures for their community, for their State, for worthy projects, \nbut we owe it to all Americans--not just those Americans in my State of \nIllinois but Americans all over the country--to take great care with \ntheir money and to treat it no less carefully than we would treat our \nown money.\n  I sometimes wonder whether those who oppose closing this loophole by \nsubstituting them with the Federal competitive bid guidelines--which \nare much more comprehensive, much more thoroughly defined, and which a \nlot of thought has gone into--if they were building a house, wouldn't \nthey competitively bid or insist that their house be competitively bid \nif they had to pay for it out of their own pocket? I think they would. \nI think they would do what they could to secure the best possible value \nfor themselves. And I think we in government ought to try and treat the \ntaxpayers' money with the same respect we treat our own.\n  As to another point on the State of Illinois code with respect to \ncompetitive bidding, this is a very subtle omission. This is a problem \nnot just in the portion of that code which deals with the Illinois \nCapital Development Board; it is a problem that permeates the whole \ncode. This is the one loophole that I didn't fully appreciate until I \nsat down and read the Federal procurement guidelines, side by side, \nwith the State guidelines.\n  The Illinois rules where sealed competitive bids are required--as we \nhave shown, it is not required; the Capital Development Board can opt \nout of competitive sealed bidding, but where the code does require \ncompetitive sealed bidding--and maybe in this project the State would \nnot opt out of competitive sealed bidding, but say it applied its own \ncompetitive sealed bidding guidelines. It is interesting there is a lot \nof language in the procurement code that gives the State the appearance \nof a regulator.\n  On its face, there are a lot of fairly ordinary provisions one would \nexpect in a State procurement code. One thing is interesting. The State \ncode, when it requires the State to go out and solicit bids--say, for a \nconstruction contract--they are required under the State code to tell \nthe bidders in advance what criteria the State is going to evaluate in \nselecting bids. In other words, the State would have to tell \nprospective bidders how they are going to select the contractor and \npresumably they would tell prospective construction contractors that \nthey are going to look at cost, workmanship, experience, quality, \nmanagement. There could be all sorts of factors at which they are going \nto look. And they have to tell the bidders, in advance, what factors \nthey will look for.\n\n  It is interesting; the State code doesn't require the State officials \nto\n\n[[Page S9803]]\n\ntell the bidders the relative weight or importance of each of those \ncriteria. The Federal code does. Federal law requires that sealed bid \nsolicitations disclose in advance all significant bid evaluation \nfactors and the relative importance of each factor and whether nonprice \nfactors when combined, will be accorded more, equal, or less weight \nthan price.\n  The citation for that Federal requirement is at 41 U.S.C. section \n253(a). The State code, by not requiring that the State tell you in \nadvance what weight they are going to assign the different criteria, \nallows a purchasing officer for the State to pick any bid he or she \nwants and explain his decision by saying that the one factor for which \nthat bid was better or the combination of factors for which that bid \nwas better was the most important factor.\n  That subtle omission in the State law allows practically any decision \nthe State makes to be rationalized after the fact. So, conceivably, \nsomebody could come in, and say we have a $1.5 million construction \nproject. Somebody bids $1.4 million; the other bidder bids $1.6 \nmillion. The State can give the award after the fact to the high \nbidder, the $1.6 million, and say they decided the management \nexperience and the quality of the higher bidder was more important than \nthe cost that you, the low bidder, offered. They could move the \ngoalpost after the fact and there would be nothing the losing bidder \ncould do. There would be no challenge. There is no State procurement \nlaw because no State procurement law was violated. In fact, it would be \nvery difficult to violate the State rules.\n  When I reflected on this, it occurred to me that after almost a \nlifetime of living in Illinois and reading about procurement scandals \nand reading investigative report after investigative report by the \nChicago Sun Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Associated Press, on leases \nthat ripped off the State, on construction projects that ripped off the \nState, on contracts of many sorts on which the taxpayers appeared to \nnot have made out well, we rarely, if ever, heard of any legal \nchallenge or of any prosecution. It is very hard to violate the State \ncode. It is that subtle omission. I believe that needs to be tightened \nup.\n  The Federal code is much better at buttoning down the procurement \nofficials, and under the Federal law we hear of challenges to Federal \nofficials awarding bids to somebody. If there is a basis for \nchallenging it because the bidder whose bid was rejected can say, hey, \nthese procurement officers told me that cost was 75 percent of it and \nworkmanship was the other portion, but they violated those guidelines. \nThe Federal law does a better job of pinnning down the State officials \nso they cannot keep moving the goalposts and award the projects to \ntheir political friends.\n  In my judgment, the Federal code does a much better job of lowering \nthe potential for political favoritism in the award of contracts using \ntaxpayer money.\n  If I may, for a moment, I would like to now turn to the context, the \noverall general context in which I come to the Senate floor to argue \nagainst language in this conference committee report that comes to us \nfrom the House with the requirement of competitive Federal bidding of \nthe $120 million Abraham Lincoln Federal Library in Springfield, IL--\nthe requirement of competitive bidding according to Federal laws--\nstripped out of it.\n  I reviewed early on in my discussion how the cost of this project had \ngone from $40 million to $60 million to $120 million; that we are \ntalking about a lot of money. This would be a monstrous building within \nthe city of Springfield, one of the biggest buildings, in fact, save \nfor the Springfield Memorial Hospital. But I also want to give the rest \nof the picture, the other parts of the puzzle that cause me to have \ngreat concern and to feel as strongly as I do that there ought to be \ntighter controls on the spending.\n  Illinois has a long history of having had problems in State \nprocurement. There have been questions before about capital \nconstruction projects involving the Capital Development Board. In fact, \nI would like to read an editorial from the Peoria Journal Star, dated \nWednesday, March 16, 1994:\n\n       To the Illinois Capital Development Board for giving River \n     City's construction companies an unfair advantage--thumbs up.\n       Giving an unfair advantage in bidding to manage \n     construction of a southern Illinois prison, River City \n     submitted the low bid and the board's staff recommended its \n     acceptance. But the board rebid the project and awarded it to \n     a Chicago firm, knowing what River City had bid, which, \n     knowing what River City had bid, lowered its own offer. The \n     process is doubly tainted because the Chicago firm, together \n     with its subcontractor, had donated $10,000 to a previous \n     Governor's campaign. The perception, rightly or wrongly, is \n     that River City lost the contract because it didn't ante up.\n\n  There is another article about a more recent capital construction \nproject. This is an article from the Chicago Tribune, dated January 6, \n2000. The headline is:\n\n       New Prison Benefits Ryan Pal: $33,000 payday seen in land \n     deal.\n\n  The article is by Ray Gibson, a Tribune staff writer. I would like to \nread this article because I think it shows the problems that can occur. \nI would like to set forth the context, why one could, on a large \nconstruction project in Illinois, reasonably be concerned about whether \nthe money is all channeled into the project and that none of it is \nfrittered away in rewarding political pals.\n\n       When Gov. George Ryan announced last month that his home \n     county of Kankakee was the winner in the latest Illinois \n     prison derby, he talked about how the new $80 million women's \n     facility would create jobs and other opportunities for \n     economic development.\n       What he didn't say was that one of the first to benefit \n     would be one of his top supporters and fundraisers, real \n     estate developer Tony Perry, who was among the dignitaries on \n     the date for Ryan's announcement.\n       Perry, acting at Ryan's behest as the point man for Hopkins \n     Park and Pembroke Township's bid for the new prison, \n     personally acquired options on the 120 acres the state will \n     buy to construct the new women's facility.\n       By Perry's own account, the current owners will pay him \n     about a 5 percent real estate commission, which would amount \n     to about $33,000, when he exercises his options to acquire \n     the land. Then he will sell the land to the state. Right now, \n     he says, he plans to sell the acreage for the same price he \n     will pay--about $5,500 an acre.\n       But state officials say that price is still open to \n     negotiation and his profit could be higher. And Perry also \n     acquired options on two other tracts of land near the prison \n     site that are almost certain to be developed.\n       A Tribune examination of how Perry, the governor's longtime \n     friend, came to act as the middleman for the proposed prison \n     construction illustrates anew the financial advantages \n     political insiders reap under Ryan, already under fire for \n     questionable leases of state facilities during his tenure as \n     secretary of state.\n       Perry's role in the selection of Hopkins Park and Pembroke \n     Township for the prison site began last summer, as the \n     sweepstakes among Illinois communities vying for the new \n     penal facility got under way.\n       At a luncheon, Perry said--he doesn't recall where--the \n     governor asked him to help the impoverished Kankakee County \n     communities complete the required paperwork to finalize their \n     bid for the new facility.\n       Perry went to work, first meeting with local officials.\n       ``Tony Perry told us the governor sent him. . . . The \n     governor sent him to make sure the paperwork got done \n     correctly,'' said Hopkins Park Village Clerk Pam Basu, who \n     opposes the prison project.\n       Then Perry set about meeting with landowners to persuade \n     them to sell the farmland, and he personally obtained options \n     to acquire 480 acres, representing three proposed sites in \n     the area. Although the state now needs only 120 acres for the \n     site, Perry originally obtained options for three 160-acre \n     parcels of land.\n       He researched the cost of supplying utilities to the site \n     and rounded up vital statistics about one of the state's \n     poorest communities.\n       For all that work, Perry was not paid, according to local \n     officials.\n       But now that the state is set to acquire 120 acres of land \n     where the new women's prison will be constructed, Perry says \n     he stands to make a 5 percent commission--or about $33,000--\n     from the sale of the land to the state.\n       Perry's role in the development now has touched off a local \n     controversy. According to Basu, the decision to allow Perry \n     to act as the communities' representative was never discussed \n     at any township or municipal board meeting. Nor was his \n     agreement with the sellers to act as a real estate agent and \n     collect a fee ever disclosed, she said.\n       Nonetheless, other local officials said Perry's help was \n     vital to the communities securing the prison.\n       ``He was the key component. He was very instrumental in \n     helping,'' said Hopkins Park Mayor David Legett.\n       But others say Perry's commission, and Ryan's decision to \n     tap him for the job, is just another example of insider \n     politics.\n       ``To me, it sounds like more ways to take care of his close \n     friends,'' said Jim Howard, executive director of Common \n     Cause, a taxpayers lobbying group. ``It just reinforces the \n     public attitude how bad and dirty politics is in Illinois.''\n\n[[Page S9804]]\n\n       Perry's role in the Hopkins Park prison is unusual on \n     several counts. This will be the first time in two decades \n     that the state will pay the entire cost to buy private \n     property to construct a new prison. During 26 previous \n     construction projects, the local communities vying for the \n     prison sites have either supplied the land free or paid a \n     portion of the state's purchase price. If the state only \n     reimburses Perry for his cost per acre, it stands to pay \n     $660,000 to acquire the land, the first time the state has \n     paid so much to acquire a prison site in at least 20 years.\n       A spokesman for the governor would not comment on why Ryan \n     asked Perry to step in and help with the application other \n     than to say that Perry was a real estate professional who has \n     a long history in economic development in Kankakee County.\n       While many of the communities participating in the prison \n     derby hired lobbyists, Perry's role was unique in that he, \n     and not local public officials, acted as the point man for \n     the project.\n       ``He was pretty much spearheading the communities effort,'' \n     said Nic Howell, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of \n     Corrections. ``He was the contact.''\n       Howell said the agency did not know if Perry was being \n     paid.\n       ``I have no idea. None whatsoever. I don't know that he's \n     not doing this out of the goodness of his heart,'' said \n     Howell, adding that he was unaware that Perry would receive a \n     commission on the sale from the seller.\n       Howell said the state wouldn't make any offer to buy the \n     property from Perry until after it does appraisals.\n       Perry said that he is now trying to spur development around \n     the new prison, but he insisted he is not going to act as a \n     developer. He has been meeting with builders and developers \n     and trying to woo them to bring everything from housing to \n     industrial development to the area.\n       ``I am not the developer. I am the orchestrator,'' he said.\n       State officials will spend millions of dollars to bring \n     utilities such as sewers, gas, and water to the prison site \n     from as far as two miles away, improvements that will \n     increase the value of nearby properties as well.\n       If the prison's construction fulfills the communities' \n     dream of development, the land near the prison could be \n     filled with gas stations, restaurants, housing and other \n     development.\n       Perry also has options to purchase two adjoining 160-acre \n     parcels of land that were also proposed for the prison site. \n     He said in a recent interview that he will not execute the \n     options to buy those 320 acres, saying it would be improper \n     to benefit as a developer.\n       ``I can't work on somebody's behalf'' and turn around and \n     develop the property, he said.\n       Perry is a longtime friend of Ryan's and a fundraiser. Just \n     four weeks after Ryan announced in September 1997 his \n     intention to run for the governor's office, Perry chaired one \n     of the first major fundraisers for Ryan's campaign in \n     Chicago.\n       Since 1994, Perry and the firms that he operates have \n     donated nearly $19,000 to Ryan's campaign fund. One of \n     Perry's ventures, a nonprofit corporation that was formed to \n     help economic development in Kankake County, donated $2,250 \n     to Ryan's campaign, despite federal tax laws that prohibit it \n     from making political donations.\n       State officials and Ryan have contended that there were \n     plenty of good reasons why the site was selected over bids \n     from the two other finalists, Freeport and Wenona.\n       Pembroke Township is statistically one of the poorest areas \n     in the state and nation. Fifty-two percent of its 3,657 \n     residents live below the poverty level, and its \n     unemployment rate is four times higher than the state's \n     rate. The site also is close to the Chicago area, where \n     many of the prisoners' families reside.\n       Even Ryan joked at the Dec. 9 press conference when the \n     site selection was announced that his roots in the county may \n     have influenced the decision.\n       ``This is one of the advantages in supporting a local guy \n     for public office,'' he said. ``I can't imagine this would've \n     happened if I hadn't been elected governor.''\n       Despite the potential for enormous economic assistance from \n     the project, not all Pembroke Township residents are throwing \n     out the welcome mat for the prison.\n       A group of about 200 residents called Pembroke Advocates \n     for Truth sprang up in the last several months to try to stop \n     construction, saying they don't believe the economic benefits \n     will trickle down to the community. They point to Perry, who \n     lives in nearby Bourbonnais, as an example of how outsiders \n     are more likely than locals to reap the benefits.\n       ``There are a lot of angry people out here,'' said Beau, \n     who is a member of the group.\n       Perry said Ryan approached him and asked him to help \n     because the two communities needed assistance with the \n     paperwork. Perry said he contacted local officials and \n     offered his services.\n       A Ryan spokesman said the governor ``doesn't recall the \n     conversation quite that way,'' but he declined to elaborate.\n       Records show that Perry paid little, if anything, for the \n     options on the property. Because no cash was needed for the \n     transactions, either Pembroke Township or Hopkins Park could \n     have entered into the option agreements with the local \n     landowners, as did another finalist, the City of Freeport, \n     records show.\n       Perry told the state in September that it could expect to \n     pay $6,100 an acre for the 160 acres it would purchase. The \n     state recently has said it will purchase only about 120 \n     acres.\n       Now, Perry said he will sell the land to the state at \n     $5,500 an acre, the price he is paying the owners.\n  (Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, there have also been a number of \nproblems involving Illinois leases that go back a number of years. I \nturn my attention to an examination of State leasing practices. We \nhave, thus far, been dealing with the State procurement code, how it \nbids out projects for construction, but also part of that code governs \nhow the State handles its leases and whether it competitively bids \nleases for office space or other space that the State of Illinois may \ngive.\n  In an examination of this overall context of insider deals that have \nhappened and swirled around and been going on in Springfield for a very \nlong time, I want to focus on a couple of articles that go back a \nlittle bit further to December 29, 1992.\n  There was at that time a series that was run in the Chicago Tribune \nthat was called ``Between Friends. In the new era of patronage, the \npolitically connected get something better than jobs--lucrative \ngovernment leases.''\n  This article I am going to read is the third in a series. The \nheadline is ``Helping Their Cronies Is The Lease Politicians Can Do.'' \nThe byline is by Ray Gibson and Hanke Gratteau:\n\n       Before Paul Butera decided to shut down and sell his \n     grocery at 3518 W. Division St., his telephone started \n     ringing.\n       The interest in his property, an enormous parking lot \n     backstopped by a single-story brick structure of 30,000 \n     square feet, astonished him.\n       Located in a working-class area, the grocery had served \n     Butera's family well for four years. But business had waned \n     since a large grocery complex opened nearby. Although he had \n     yet to list the property with a real estate broker, Butera \n     began getting calls about whether the Humboldt Park property \n     was for sale.\n       ``The property got very hot very fast,'' he recalled.\n       Several weeks before Butera closed the deal in July 1991, \n     he learned the buyer planned to convert the grocery into \n     office space and rent it to the state for the Illinois \n     Department of Children and Family Services.\n       Unbeknownst to Butera, the state and the buyer, Victor J. \n     Cacciatore, Sr., had hammered out the details of the lease \n     four months before Butera sold the property.\n       The lease was signed in apparent violation of state \n     purchasing laws that require disclosure of building and land \n     owners. State officials signed the lease relying on \n     Cacciatori's representation that he was the owner of the \n     building, said Helen Adorjan, a spokeswoman for the state \n     Department of Central Management Service, or CMS.\n       The state has done business with Cacciatore for decades, \n     and, for just as long, Cacciatore had been a faithful \n     campaign contributor.\n       Patronage, the process of rewarding political cronies at \n     taxpayers' expense, has been big business in Illinois. Even \n     though court decisions and taxpayers' outrage largely have \n     stopped the practice of putting supporters on the public \n     payroll, elected officials still find ways to divide the \n     spoils.\n       Contracts are the mother lode for a new age of patronage. \n     Deals to lease properties, perform services and produce goods \n     for the state are now a $4.6 billion-a-year industry, a \n     business that has more than doubled in the last decade.\n       The state's need to house its burgeoning bureaucracy has \n     been a gold mine for those seeking to lease land and offices \n     to the state. From 1981 to 1991, the state's rental costs \n     climbed to $104 million annually, a 177 percent increase. \n     Those with connections, such as Cacciatore, are cashing in.\n       The state's landlords include major donors to the \n     gubernatorial campaigns of James Thompson and Jim Edgar. In \n     the last four years, Edgar's campaign fund has received more \n     than $178,000 from people who lease offices to the state, \n     disclosure forms show.\n       Those people include Cacciatore, who has contributed at \n     least $9,000 to Edgar's campaign fund and has received two \n     state leases since Edgar took office. During the final seven \n     years of the Thompson administration, Cacciatore donated more \n     than $27,000 to Thompson's campaign. During that time, he was \n     awarded five state leases.\n       The DCFS deal marked the second time Cacciatore had offered \n     to rent to the state the building he did not own. Records \n     show he first proposed the Division Street grocery as an \n     office building in March 1990, more than 15 months before he \n     bought it.\n       Other large states have specific procedures to secure \n     property, but Illinois' methods are much more fluid, said \n     Michael Bartletti, manager of the Bureau of Property \n     Management for CMS, the leasing agent for most state \n     departments. Requirements vary according to geographic and \n     agency needs, he said.\n\n[[Page S9805]]\n\n       For example, sometimes the state publishes an advertisement \n     seeking potential sites. Sometimes it does not. Sometimes \n     state leasing agents search specific communities for \n     appropriate buildings, Bartletti said. Sometimes they do not.\n       Bartletti said CMS rules ``encourage'' the obtaining of \n     price quotes on ``two or three sites'' that would meet state \n     needs. The rule, he said, ``encourages competition. It \n     doesn't require it.''\n       In the Cacciatore deal, the state did not advertise its \n     need for DCFS office space, records show.\n       Instead, CMS officials relied on responses to a year-old \n     advertisement published when the Illinois Department of \n     Public Aid sought similar office space, Adorjan said.\n       Cacciatore had proposed the Division Street grocery as a \n     potential public aid office, Adorjan said, so the site was \n     suggested to DCFS.\n       CMS records on the DCFS office hunt reflect that the agency \n     obtained price quotes on two other locations. But an owner of \n     a building the state said it surveyed told the Tribune that \n     he never was contacted.\n       Records state that officials with CMS contacted an \n     individual named ``Boris Amen,'' who was trying to sell a \n     28,000-square-foot building at 2950 N. Western Ave.\n       But officials at Advanced Transformer, the owner of the \n     130,000-square-foot factory at that address, said that they \n     never offered their property to the state and that they did \n     not know Boris Amen.\n       ``I have never had any discussions with the state,'' said \n     Sol Hassom, a vice president for the company.\n       Records also state that CMS obtained a price quote on a \n     lease from owners of a building at 3011 N. Western Ave. No \n     such address or building exists. An owner of a nearby 9,000-\n     square-foot building said he never has offered it for rent.\n       Adorjan acknowledged the records were filled with \n     inaccuracies, but she maintained that the agency obtained \n     other competing prices that are not reflected in the records.\n       ``It is obvious that they are just sloppy records,'' she \n     said. ``They obviously did a sloppy job.''\n       Records show the state will pay $2.3 million over the next \n     five years to rent the grocery, which Cacciatore bought for \n     $775,000. With his partners, Cacciatore holds seven state \n     leases worth more than $1 million a year.\n       The state is paying $17.05 a square foot for space, \n     utilities and janitorial service for the Humboldt Park \n     building. That rate, according to Realtors, is comparable \n     with rates in fancy Loop high-rise buildings.\n       ``You can do better than that in the Loop,'' said George \n     Martin, a real estate broker. ``You can get $13 (a square \n     foot). What you are talking about out there doesn't even make \n     sense.''\n       Adorjan said the rent the state is paying was fair and \n     comparable with others in the area.\n       Cacciatore, in a written response to questions, argued that \n     the high rental rate partly reflects remodeling costs needed \n     to meet the state's requirements.\n       Cook County records show Cacciatore's company spent \n     $450,000 on remodeling. According to the lease, Cacciatore \n     will recoup his initial investment and renovation costs \n     within the first three years.\n       Cacciatore's company and appraisers successfully argued \n     earlier this year to lower the property's tax assessment. \n     Their plea was based partly on data showing that the state \n     was paying rent that was $5 a square foot to $6 a square foot \n     above market rates and that, therefore, the rent did not \n     accurately reflect the building's value, county records show.\n       ``Confronted with the pressing need to service the area \n     with a field office and the lack of such appropriate office \n     space, (the state) was willing to pay a rental premium,'' the \n     company's written appeal stated.\n       Cacciatore also has sold property to the state. The state's \n     1990 purchase of $1.9 million of Cacciatore's property in \n     Lake County for a proposed state highway provoked public \n     outcry there. At his request, the property was rezoned for \n     development, forcing the state to pay 20 times the price it \n     normally pays for vacant land.\n       One south suburban landlord who leases property to the \n     state said renting office space to the state is an insider's \n     game fraught with politics.\n       The landlord, who asked not to be identified, told the \n     Tribune that when he was notified that a state agency was \n     leaving his building in the midst of a long-term contract, \n     state officials told him to see William Cellini, a top \n     Republican fundraiser.\n       ``I was told, `If you want to get a state lease, go see Mr. \n     Cellini,' '' he said. He did not, and the state canceled his \n     lease.\n       Cellini headed the state Transportation Department under \n     Republican Gov. Richard Ogilvie. He has not been a state \n     official in nearly two decades but remains one of \n     Springfield's most influential insiders. His sister Janis is \n     Edgar's patronage chief, and the transportation agency still \n     seeks his counsel, according to former and current officials.\n       ``I chuckle sometimes when I hear some of the stories in \n     Springfield about what all (Cellini) controls. That's not \n     true,'' Edgar said in an interview.\n       Cellini and Cacciatore, along with another former state \n     official, Gayle Franzen, were business partners in 1991 on \n     the purchase of a 140-acre parcel in south suburban Hazel \n     Crest, records show.\n       Franzen said Cacciatore invited him to become a partner on \n     the Division Street grocery, even though Cacciatore told the \n     state he was the sole owner. Franzen said that he declined. \n     Cellini, through an aide, said he had no current interests in \n     any state leases.\n       In addition to holding leases with the state, Cacciatore is \n     a director of Elgin Sweeping Services Inc., which has reaped \n     nearly $40 million in contracts with the state's highway \n     department since 1970, when Cellini headed the department. \n     The contract is based on competitive bidding, but no company \n     has submitted a competing bid in 10 years, state records \n     show.\n  Let me read that sentence again. The State, of course, on this $120 \nmillion library, is assuring us that there will be the application of \nwhat they call their competitive bid rules. But in this article, it \nsays:\n\n       The contract is based on competitive bidding, but no \n     company has submitted a competing bid in 10 years, state \n     records show.\n       Some state landlords scoff at the notion that political \n     favoritism influences the way the state shops for land and \n     space.\n       Anthony Antoniou, a Du Page County real estate developer, \n     is among them. His firm holds a lease that is among the \n     state's most expensive, with $5.2 million in annual payments \n     for an unemployment office on Chicago's State Street.\n       Antoniou, a contributor to Thompson and Edgar, said his \n     firm found that politics played virtually no role in the \n     decision to lease his building.\n       Nevertheless, when Antoniou began discussions with the \n     state about possible purchase of the State Street building, \n     he turned to state Sen. Howard Carroll for help. Carroll, a \n     Chicago Democrat, heads the appropriations committee that \n     approves the budget for CMS, the agency trying to buy the \n     building.\n       ``Harold Carroll is a friend,'' Antoniou said. ``He may \n     have given some peripheral help. I met with him through my \n     wife who lobbies (in Springfield).''\n       Carroll said that Antoniou asked him to find out the status \n     of possible state funds to buy the building.\n       ``We did some checking and we didn't see any funds in the \n     budget,'' Carroll said.\n       Illinois' lease costs are comparable to what officials in \n     New York, Florida and Texas spend on land rights and office \n     space. California, which has nearly twice as many state \n     employees as Illinois and whose real estate costs are \n     notoriously exorbitant, spends more than $270 million a year \n     on leases.\n       But the manner in which leases are let in Illinois differs \n     greatly from methods used in Florida, Texas and California. \n     In those states, landlords must submit sealed bids to state \n     officials who are required by law to award leases to the \n     lowest and best competitive bidder.\n       Illinois officials reject the notion of competitive bidding \n     on leases.\n\n  Let me read that line again:\n\n       Illinois officials reject the notion of competitive bidding \n     on leases.\n\n  Competitive bidding has never been popular in Illinois with public \nofficials, and that is what is at stake here on this $120 million \nLincoln Library, where objections were made to the U.S. Senate's \nrequirement that Federal competitive bid guidelines be attached to this \n$50 million authorization for a $120 million building in Springfield, \nIL.\n  Quoting again:\n\n       The Tribune found that state rental procedures are so \n     casual that state files on negotiations for some properties \n     are little more than handwritten scrawls of price quotes from \n     building owners.\n       Officials have maintained for more than a decade that state \n     law does not require competitive bidding on leases, despite \n     admonishments from the state auditor general. The absence of \n     competitive bidding, the auditor general has warned, has \n     deprived taxpayers of the ``assurance that its best interests \n     were served.''\n\n  Let me interject at this point, since this article was written, the \nState's procurement law has been updated and presumably improved to \nsome extent. But in our discussion and our examination today, we are \ntrying to emphasize that not all loopholes have been closed and that \nthe State rules still allow a high degree of discretion and leave a \nhigh amount of decisionmaking authority up to subjective preferences of \nState officials and that leaving that kind of unchecked discretion in \nState officials' hands opens the potential for insider abuse of \nIllinois procurement, whether it is leasing a building, building a \nbuilding, or buying goods and services from the State.\n  Continuing from the article:\n\n       The Tribune investigation of state purchasing found that \n     CMS sometimes has disregarded its own internal rules \n     established to ensure fair pricing and competition.\n       In some cases, state agencies seeking to lease space \n     compose written requirements that virtually rule out \n     competition. Specifications also have been tailored to steer \n     state agencies to sites owned by the connected, as in the \n     case of a $9.3 million deal in Peoria.\n\n  Let's back up on that. In some cases, you have the State claiming it \nhas\n\n[[Page S9806]]\n\ncompetitive bidding, but what they do is, State agencies seeking to \nlease space compose written requirements that virtually rule out \ncompetition. They put restrictions on who is eligible to apply. The \nState did that with how they awarded river boat licenses in Illinois, \nand we are going to get to that later this afternoon when we examine \nhow the State awarded the phenomenally lucrative 10 river boat licenses \nthat somehow just happened to--I guess it was coincidence--all wind up \nin the hands of long-time contributors, in many cases, for many of \nthose river boat licenses.\n  Continuing from the article:\n\n       Twelve days after the Illinois Department of Transportation \n     informed CMS that it had outgrown its district headquarters \n     in Peoria, officials with CMS asked the governor's office if \n     G. Raymond Becker, a multimillionaire real estate developer, \n     was eligible to become a state landlord.\n       The written query, dated March 19, 1990, was necessary \n     because Becker was a Thompson-appointed member of the \n     Illinois Capital Development Board, whose executive director \n     is required by state law to review all state leases.\n       CMS officials wanted to know if Thompson would waive a \n     state conflict-of-interest law prohibiting state officials \n     such as Becker from doing business with the state.\n       Such waivers are somewhat routine in Illinois, but the \n     request was unusual because CMS officials had not yet \n     advertised the state's desire to rent office space in Peoria, \n     records show.\n       But Becker, a member of Thompson's Governor's Club, a \n     circle of campaign contributors whose donations totaled at \n     least $1,000, already was being considered for a state \n     contract for space in the 16-story office building he was \n     constructing in downtown Peoria.\n       Months later, the state published an advertisement from new \n     Peoria space, specifying narrow geographic boundaries that \n     essentially reduced the competition to Becker's building. \n     Another developer, Dianne Cullinan, who had a downtown site \n     under construction next to the state's targeted area, \n     expressed interest but later halted talks after much of her \n     building was leased.\n       Negotiations with Becker, the lone landlord under \n     consideration, lagged for several months. But in January \n     1991, the deal was completed within a week--the final one of \n     Thompson's tenure.\n       Thompson waived the conflict of interest law for Becker, \n     noting that his proposal--the only one that had been on the \n     table for four months--was the best of two submitted. Yet, \n     records show that neither Cullinan nor anyone other than \n     Becker had submitted a formal proposal.\n       The Becker deal stands to be worth more than $9.3 million \n     over the next 10 years if the state renews the lease after \n     the first five years. IDOT offices fill about one-third of \n     the building, which Becker built with a $3.2 million Peoria \n     city bond and private loans of $8 million.\n       ``It was a very good deal because I am doing much better \n     with the rest of the leases,'' Becker said. The IDOT lease, \n     he said, helped him charge higher rates for the lower floors. \n     By August, shortly before IDOT moved in, two-thirds of the \n     complex had been rented, Becker said.\n       The lease also carried the promise of revitalizing Becker's \n     adjacent properties: a twin-story condominium and a small \n     office complex that have been suffering from high vacancy \n     rates.\n       Whether the deal was as good for taxpayers as it was for \n     Becker is another question.\n\n  Of course, that line in this article--``Whether the deal was as good \nfor taxpayers as it was for Becker is another question''--kind of goes \nto the heart of our debate today because we want construction of the \nPresidential library for Abraham Lincoln in Springfield, IL, to be as \ngreat a treasure for and as good a deal for the taxpayers of Illinois \nand this Nation as it is for everybody who winds up actually building \nthe building or owning other buildings right next to it, which will \nbenefit from the tourism that comes in.\n\n       State officials maintain the Becker lease is less costly \n     than building a Peoria headquarters.\n       They point to a January 1991 study conducted by an outside \n     consulting firm that concluded that over a 10-year period, \n     the state would pay about $11.4 million for construction, \n     operating costs and debt service on a new building, compared \n     with slightly less than $10 million in lease costs in the \n     same period.\n       But the study was based in part on the consultants' \n     assumption that the state would have to acquire land for the \n     project, records indicate.\n       ``We are not aware of other state-owned space in the Peoria \n     area that would be suitable for the (IDOT) space needs,'' the \n     study stated. ``Also, we did not examine the cost of buying \n     and renovating an existing facility. . . . Additionally, we \n     did not address the availability of bond funds to finance the \n     construction of a potential facility.''\n       Three years earlier, IDOT had proposed building a Peoria \n     regional headquarters and materials-testing labs on a 34-acre \n     site owned by the state on the city's west side.\n       The price tag at the time was $7.16 million, said Richard \n     Adorjan, an IDOT spokesman.\n       The General Assembly refused to appropriate funds for the \n     project, so the state decided to lease. Adorjan said IDOT was \n     never told about the 1991 study comparing the costs of \n     leasing with the costs of a new building.\n       CMS officials say they never considered the 34-acre site \n     for building because it was ``too rural,'' Bartletti said.\n       The site is 9.3 miles from Peoria's downtown, said a CMS \n     spokesman. IDOT's main headquarters in Springfield is about \n     four miles from downtown.\n       IDOT's former Peoria headquarters, a sprawling brick \n     structure with 36,000 square feet on the city's north end, \n     will continue to house materials-testing labs, but the site \n     soon will be largely abandoned.\n       The IDOT lease was not Becker's only deal with the state.\n       Soon after signing the IDOT lease in Peoria, Thompson aides \n     signed a $1.1 million lease for the Illinois Department of \n     Employment Security to move into a building owned by Becker's \n     business partner, Russell Waldschmidt. Less than a year \n     later, Waldschmidt sold the building to Becker's son, George \n     Raymond Becker, Jr.\n       Later in 1991, the General Assembly restored funding for \n     leased office space for the Illinois Industrial Commission in \n     another Becker-owned building. The five-year lease is worth \n     about $41,000 annually.\n       Becker's construction company also has been a successful \n     competitor for state road building jobs. In 1987 and 1989, \n     his company was the low bidder on two contracts worth nearly \n     $2 million for paving and resurfacing state highways near \n     Peoria, an IDOT spokesman said.\n       Becker and his partner, Waldschmidt, said Becker's status \n     as a confidant to the Thompson administration played no role \n     in landing the leases.\n       But administration sources said Thompson's aides demanded \n     that the transportation agency lease be signed before \n     Thompson left office. Some top administrators had favored \n     putting the lease on hold, a common practice during \n     transitions, since it would bind Edgar's administration to \n     the pact. Their concerns, however, were overruled by \n     Thompson's key aides, according to interviews.\n       Even after Thompson left office, he continued to turn to \n     his old friend for favors. Several months after Thompson left \n     the Executive Mansion, the developer lent his private \n     airplane to the former Governor to fly to Jackson, Miss., for \n     a Republican Party function, according to a Thompson \n     spokeswoman.\n       CMS officials have been at loggerheads with the state \n     Auditor General's office for more than a decade because of \n     their insistence that state law does not require leases to be \n     competitively bid.\n\n  Again, what we are talking about here is competitively bidding a \nconstruction contract. The House has taken a position in opposition to \nthe Senate's requirement on an appropriation of $50 million to the \nState of Illinois that that money be competitively bid, that the \nconstruction contracts be competitively bid in accordance with the \nFederal law. The House position on this, to date, is that the project \nnot carry that restriction and that States' so-called competitive bid \nguidelines are adequate.\n\n  We are here examining some of the problems that have occurred in \nrecent memory in the State of Illinois regarding leases, construction \nprojects, and the like, which really weren't what we would think should \nbe a proper competitive bidding and where there has been some slippage.\n\n       State purchasing laws, a hodgepodge of more than 100 \n     provisions adopted over the years, make no mention of leases. \n     And a 1981 report by state auditors found that 96 percent of \n     the state's leases were awarded without bid.\n\n  That is why there are so many articles inches thick and investigative \nreports, over many different administrations and many Governors in the \nState of Illinois, of deals that appeared to involve, or may have \ninvolved, or the writers thought involved, political favoritism.\n\n       CMS has argued that because leases are not specifically \n     included among the goods and services required to be \n     competitively bid, they are exempt from bidding. State \n     auditors have argued that because leases are not listed among \n     the exemptions, they must be bid.\n       There is no way to competitively bid real estate, said the \n     CMS' Bartletti.\n       Simply put, there are no two real estate parcels in the \n     world that are alike. Real estate is exclusive by definition. \n     There is only one parcel at a certain intersection. Location \n     is everything in real estate, he said.\n       Among the State purchasing reforms to be proposed in the \n     general assembly's spring session will be a requirement to \n     bid leases competitively, said State Senator Judy Barr \n     Topinka (R-Riverside).\n       The proposed reform, Topinka said, is prompted largely by \n     ``the scandal'' created\n\n[[Page S9807]]\n\n     by a lease state officials signed in 1989 to rent the \n     shuttered St. Anne's Hospital on Chicago's West Side.\n       State officials needed the building to house patients from \n     the Illinois State Psychiatric Hospital, which had to be \n     closed for extensive renovations.\n       Taxpayers will end up paying $16.1 million for a four-year \n     lease of the hospital, including costs of transferring \n     patients, mainly because the lease failed to shield the state \n     from huge repair bills.\n       The state could have bought the building for $3 million.\n\n  Let's review that again.\n\n       State officials needed the building to house patients from \n     the Illinois State Psychiatric Hospital, which had to be \n     closed for extensive renovations.\n       Taxpayers will end up paying $16.1 million for a four-year \n     lease of the hospital, including costs of transferring \n     patients, mainly because the lease failed to shield the state \n     from huge repair bills.\n\n  The State could have bought the building for $3 million.\n  The State could have bought it for $3 million. But they will end up \npaying $16 million for a 4-year lease of the hospital.\n  In that difference between $16.1 million and $3 million, look at the \nmoney that was lost for the taxpayers. How many taxpayers had to work \nhow many hours? How many couples had to struggle working 2, or 2\\1/2\\, \nor 3 jobs to pay their taxes to the State of Illinois and to the \nFederal Government just to see that money go to State officials?\n  Some might conclude from such articles that in many cases when there \nare not proper controls, what the State officials wind up doing with \nthat taxpayer money is really tantamount to lighting a match to it.\n  I now move on to another issue that has been talked about in Illinois \nfor a very long time. It actually goes back to the early 1980s, and it \nis still a problem for the taxpayers in the State of Illinois. That is \nthe subject of hotel loans given out by the State that were never fully \nrepaid.\n  There are some of these issues that we could highlight on which I am \nseeking to narrow the focus and ultimately tie all of this back into \nwhat is going on down in Springfield.\n  I am going to turn to a discussion of State loans that were made back \nin the early 1980s for the construction of several buildings around the \nState, including two hotels: One in Springfield, IL, and the other, as \nI recall, at Collinsville, IL, which is down in the southern part of \nthe State in the metro East St. Louis area. I am very familiar with \nboth of these hotels. Of course, I see them often on my trips to \nSpringfield and Collinsville. These hotels are actually pretty famous \nin the minds of many taxpayers because the taxpayers gave loans for the \nprominent people to develop these hotels and the loans were never fully \npaid.\n  This article, which comes from the Chicago Sun Times, dated April 26, \n1995, is by Tim Novak, who at that time was in Springfield. He wrote \nthis article. The headline is, ``Taxpayers Stuck With $30 Million Hotel \nTab.''\n\n       Illinois taxpayers will lose $30 million today when state \n     Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka closes the books on two hotel \n     loans that former Gov. Jim Thompson and former Treasurer \n     Jerry Cosentino made to political cronies.\n       The hotels owe the state $40.3 million under low-interest \n     loans they got in 1982, but Topinka has agreed to settle \n     their debts for $10 million, the Sun-Times has learned. She \n     plans to announce the deal today.\n       Under the deal, the Springfield Renaissance Hotel headed by \n     Republican power broker William F. Cellini will pay the state \n     $3.75 million of the $19.8 million it owes.\n       The state will also collect $6.3 million from the \n     Collinsville Holiday Inn, partly owned by Gary Fears, who \n     raised money for Democrats and Republicans. The Collinsville \n     hotel owes the state $20.6 million.\n       Topinka said it's the ``best deal'' she could get from the \n     hotels, which have often skipped loan payments while their \n     value has fallen. The deal will save the state at least \n     $6,000 a month it spends to manage the loans.\n       ``The taxpayers are going to take a bath, no question,'' \n     Topinka said. ``But the property is so depressed, we will \n     never get back what we spent. Our little escapade into the \n     hotel business has not been remarkably fruitful.\n       ``I may open myself up to criticism on one hand, but on the \n     other hand, I have got to settle this because the longer this \n     goes on, the more we lose because the property value (of the \n     hotels) keeps going down.''\n       Former Treasurer Patrick Quinn, a Democrat, said Topinka is \n     giving another sweetheart deal to political insiders.\n       ``These particular individuals . . . are getting off very \n     lightly,'' Quinn said of Cellini and Fears. ``The taxpayers \n     are being fleeced again. They were fleeced when the loans \n     were made. They were fleeced when the loans were refinanced.\n       ``If you foreclosed, you would have assets that you can \n     sell for a greater price than they're getting now,'' Quinn \n     said. He claimed that the hotels are worth far more than the \n     $10 million the owners will pay under Topinka's deal.\n       Local assessors say the hotels are worth a total of $13.2 \n     million--$7.9 million for the Springfield hotel and $5.3 \n     million for the one in Collinsville.\n       Topinka said the hotels are worth only a total of $6.5 \n     million, much less than the $10 million the state will \n     receive. Topinka said the Springfield hotel is worth $3 \n     million and the one in Collinsville is worth $3.5 million.\n       ``I didn't make the (original) deal,'' she said. ``I'm the \n     garbage man trying to clean up.''\n       The loans were to expire in 2010. The state cannot \n     foreclose on the hotels until 1999, and then only if the \n     debts exceed $18 million on the Springfield hotel and $19.9 \n     million on the Collinsville one.\n       Quinn spent four years trying to get money out of the hotel \n     owners, particularly Cellini, who made millions as the lead \n     investor of the state's first riverboat casino, the Alton \n     Belle.\n       Quinn urged the Illinois Gaming Board to revoke the casino \n     license last year unless Cellini pays off the hotel loan. The \n     board refused, saying the hotel and casino were separate, \n     state-sanctioned deals.\n       Cellini is among 80 investors in the Springfield hotel. He \n     could not be reached for comment. B.C. Gitcho, managing \n     partner of the Collinsville hotel, referred questions to \n     attorney Dan K. Webb, a law partner of Thompson's.\n       Webb, who represents both hotels, could not be reached for \n     comment.\n       Thompson, a Republican, and Cosentino, a Democrat, made the \n     hotel loans in 1982 under the governor's Build Illinois \n     program, designed to create economic development and jobs.\n       Cellini's group, President Lincoln Hotel Ventures, used the \n     money to build a luxurious hotel about six blocks from the \n     state Capitol. Fears' group, Collinsville Hotel. Venture, \n     built a hotel about 20 miles east of St. Louis.\n       The loans originally had a 12.25 percent interest rate. The \n     owners were required to make mortgage payments only in those \n     quarters in which the hotels made profits. The owners often \n     skipped payments, claiming they made no money in those \n     quarters.\n       Before Thompson and Cosentino left office in 1991, the \n     loans were restructured with a new interest rate of 6 \n     percent. The interest was deferred until the principal was \n     paid off.\n       Since 1982, the state has collected $1.3 million from the \n     Springfield hotel and $1.4 million from the Collinsville \n     hotel.\n\n  Mr. President, there is another article on that hotel loan. I point \nout at this time the hotel for which that loan was given, that was \nbuilt in Springfield, IL--one of them was for a hotel in Springfield, \nthe other for a hotel in Collinsville, IL.\n  This is a map of downtown Springfield. This is the State capitol \nwhere I used to go when I was a State senator in Springfield for 6 \nyears. This is the Abraham Lincoln neighborhood. Mr. Lincoln's \nneighborhood is run by the National Park Service. Abraham Lincoln's \nhome is here. Senator Durbin and I have our Springfield district \noffices in that neighborhood. It is beautifully maintained to look as \nit did in Mr. Lincoln's era.\n  Here is the Springfield Convention Center, and next to the \nSpringfield Convention Center we see the Renaissance Springfield Hotel.\n  As we saw that investor deal, headed by Mr. William Cellini from \nSpringfield, they got that $15 million--I believe was the loan--back in \nthe early 1980s. There was an attempt to settle the loan after not much \nof that money had been paid back. In fact, that settlement that was \njust described, to my knowledge, never went through.\n  I will continue reading some articles and examining this hotel issue \nbecause since it is so close to where the proposed Lincoln Library site \nis, I think this will give a picture of how this connects together and \nwhy in my mind--being familiar with this whole history--red flags were \nraised. I believed we were on notice that we needed to do everything we \ncould to protect taxpayers' money in the construction of that proposed \nLincoln Library, which is a $120 million project.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I believe I will be recognized following the Senator's \npresentation, but for purposes of timing, how long does the Senator \nexpect to continue speaking?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I will speak as long as I need to make the point on \nthis project. I imagine it will be for quite some time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might, the Senator certainly has a right to speak \nfor as\n\n[[Page S9808]]\n\nlong as he chooses once he is recognized in the Senate, but for the \npurpose of others who desire to speak on the conference report, I am \ncurious if we could get some time frame.\n  I am willing to come back to the Chamber if the Senator will give me \nan idea of when he might complete his remarks.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. All I can say at this time--I hope the Senator will \nappreciate this--I will need an extended period of time, and I cannot \ngive a good timeframe. You may want to go back to your office.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that is a fair answer.\n  I ask if, perhaps 10 minutes before the Senator finishes, he would \nsay ``in conclusion,'' which would trigger me to come back to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I will do that.\n  Turning to a June 5, 1995, Chicago Tribune article, by Rick Pearson, \na Tribune staff writer, the headline is: ``Taxpayers Face a Big Loss on \nHotel Loans; GOP Insider Denies Political Deal.''\n       He has achieved a unique and almost mystical aura as a \n     clout-heavy Republican power broker, fundraiser and riverboat \n     gambling captain.\n       But William Cellini says he doubts he will ever be a hotel \n     developer again.\n       Cellini is at the center of a controversy involving a \n     proposal by state Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka to settle $40 \n     million owed to taxpayers on two hotel loans for $10 million. \n     He said he and other investors in the Springfield Renaissance \n     never made a dime and will never see any return.\n       Cellini also maintained that the state has probably \n     recouped the original $120 million lent to developers of the \n     Renaissance, the Collinsville Holiday Inn and 16 other \n     projects because the developers paid 17 percent interest \n     during the construction in the high-interest period of the \n     early 1980s.\n       ``Would I do it again? Never,'' Cellini said in his first \n     public comments on the hotel deal. ``Well, never is a long \n     time. Let's put it this way: I'll never do another one with \n     the government. You're too high-profile, and then everybody \n     comes to these (political) conclusions.'\n       Not that anyone is suggesting any tag days for the 60-year-\n     old Cellini.\n       He has parlayed his position during the 1960s as state \n     transportation secretary under Gov. Richard Ogilvie into \n     influential leases and contracts, a role as head of the road-\n     building Illinois Asphalt Pavement Association, and \n     chairmanship of Argosy Gaming Co., which operates the Alton \n     Belle riverboat casino. Cellini's stake in the riverboat is \n     worth more than $20 million.\n       Yet Cellini disputed the perception that the hotel \n     settlement reached in April with Topinka is a sweetheart deal \n     for himself, the Renaissance's 84 other investors, bipartisan \n     fundraiser Gary Fears and investors in the Collinsville \n     Holiday Inn.\n       Instead, he said, taxpayers will get about $2 million more \n     than the highest bid offered to former state Treasurer \n     Patrick Quinn when he attempted to shop the two hotel loans \n     last year to other investors.\n       In addition, Cellini said, investors in the Springfield \n     hotel put $10.1 million of their money into launching the \n     project, along with the state's $15.5 million loan and a $3.1 \n     million federal urban-development grant.\n\n  Boy, that is interesting. On that loan for that Springfield \nRenaissance Hotel, the investors put in $10 billion of their money, the \nState loaned $15 million of State taxpayers' money, and the Federal \nGovernment gave $3.1 million in an urban development grant for that \nhotel.\n\n       ``People are saying, `This hotel was built with all state \n     money. Cellini didn't put in anything, and now he's walking \n     away with the marbles.' That isn't true. We put in almost as \n     much as the state, for sure $10 million in cash. And we will \n     never get it back,'' Cellini said.\n       The proposed settlement with Topinka has been put on hold \n     pending review by Atty. Gen. Jim Ryan, another Republican. \n     But under the agreement, Cellini and Renaissance investors \n     would pay the state $3.75 million of the $19.8 million they \n     owe.\n       Meanwhile, the Collinsville Holiday Inn would pay $6.3 \n     million of $20.6 million owed to the state.\n       Topinka, a Republican who took office in January, has said \n     the loans were a ``bad investment'' for the state. She also \n     said the settlement is the ``best deal'' she could get for \n     taxpayers because the properties' values are depressed.\n       The loans, first made in 1982 by then-Gov. James Thompson, \n     a Republican, and then-Treasurer Jerome Cosentino, a \n     Democrat, originally carried a 12.25 percent interest rate. \n     But Thompson and Cosentino revised the loans in 1988 to \n     require mortgage payments only when the hotels were \n     profitable. Few payments were made.\n\n  That is interesting. The loan was not being fully repaid. Yet in 1998 \nthey revised the loan documents so that mortgage payments only had to \nbe made when the hotel was profitable. And then few payments were made.\n\n       Shortly before Thompson and Cosentino left officein 1991, \n     the loans again were restructured to call for 6 percent \n     interest, with all payments first applied to principal on the \n     debt.\n       Cellini, who is a general partner of the Renaissance and \n     owns 1.01 percent of the stock, said the original loan, the \n     subsequent restructuring and the settlement plan were normal \n     business deals and didn't involve politics.\n       The projects initially were meant to improve economic \n     development, but they were written down because of market \n     conditions, he said.\n       The lavish Renaissance, five blocks from the Capitol, pays \n     $100,000 a year to help retire bonds used to build an \n     adjacent city convention center. The hotel has a payroll of \n     $2.8 million and pays $1.3 million a year in taxes, he said.\n       ``It isn't that this was different or it was something that \n     just because of political contact there was this \n     discounting,'' Cellini said. ``There isn't a first-class, \n     full-service hotel that was built in Chicago from '85 to \n     today that is not only not paying their mortgage loans but I \n     bet you some of them aren't paying for their operations.''\n       Cellini also disputed reports from Topinka's office that \n     personal guarantees he signed on the loan were waived by \n     Thompson and Cosentino. Such a waiver would have helpted \n     Cellini when Argosy appeared before the Illinois Gaming Board \n     seeking a license for the Alton Belle casino.\n       But aides to Topinka confirmed Friday that when the hotel \n     was opened, Cellini satisfied the terms of a construction \n     loan and was released from his personal guarantee.\n       Cellini also said that while the hotel had an assessed \n     value of $7 million two years ago, the value of the real \n     estate now is only slightly more than the $3.7 million value \n     of the loan that investors have agreed to pay.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nLouisiana be recognized at this time, and that I be rerecognized upon \nthe completion of her remarks and that my rerecognition count as a \ncontinuation of my current speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Illinois has \nbeen on the floor for quite some time speaking on an issue about which \nhe obviously feels very strongly and about which he is quite \nknowledgeable and on which he has been going into some detail. \nHopefully, it can be worked out, or some accommodations can be made.\n  I am here, actually, to speak about an issue that is related to this \nbill but is completely different from what my colleague from Illinois \nhas been speaking about. This is about the underlying bill, the \nInterior appropriations bill, and about the CARA Coalition, the \nConservation Reinvestment Act--which you yourself have been familiar \nwith and were actually very helpful, Mr. President, and were supportive \nalong the way. I thank you for that. I want to say a few words about \nthe Interior appropriations bill and how it falls so short of what many \nof us were hoping.\n  I realize this is a process; it is a democratic process. I realize we \ncannot always get what we want. But I do believe we should always try \nour very best to get what we believe is not only best for our State but \nbest for our Nation. That is what the CARA Coalition represents, a \ngroup of Governors, almost every Governor in the Nation, mayors--almost \nall of the mayors in the Nation, Democrats and Republicans--over 5,000 \nenvironmental and business organizations and recreational organizations \nthroughout this Nation that have been trying to communicate to the \nWhite House and to the appropriators, both Democrats and Republicans, \nand to the President himself, how important it is to try to take this \ntime, this year--not next year but this year--to lay down a real legacy \nfor the environment, something that recognizes the importance of \npurchasing Federal lands when appropriate but also a legacy that \nrealizes how important it is to give some money, not to Federal \nagencies but to State governments and to local officials, so Governors \nand mayors can make plans based on their local and State needs.\n  I know that you agree with me, Mr. President--actually, many do in \nthis Chamber--that Washington doesn't always know best. The CARA \nCoalition thinks sometimes Washington has good ideas, but we think \nsometimes States and Governors and mayors and county commissioners have \ngood ideas. Sometimes parents who run Little League\n\n[[Page S9809]]\n\nBaseball leagues in their communities have good ideas. We think \nvolunteers in communities have good ideas. But there are a handful of \npeople who think--it is just disturbing to me, and I do not understand \nit--there are some people here, unfortunately on both sides of the \naisle, who think the only decisions that are good come from Washington. \nSo the CARA Coalition wants to say the Interior bill fails--fails to \ntake advantage of the partnerships that are available at the State and \nat the local level.\n  In addition, I have to say the Interior bill also fails to take into \naccount the important contributions that are made by the coastal States \nto this endeavor.\n  While the amount of money that the Interior bill has come up with is \nover $1 billion in the first year, a good portion of that money, about \nhalf of it, $500 million, actually does not come from the general fund. \nIt comes from offshore oil and gas revenues. The moneys we use in this \nbill that were outlined earlier to fund the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, which was authorized and established over 30 years ago but never \nfunded to its levels, either at the Federal or the State side--that \nmoney comes from offshore oil and gas revenues.\n  Those revenues primarily come from the Gulf of Mexico and from \nLouisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and to some degree Alabama. The drilling \nfor natural gas, which is an environmentally friendly fuel that helps \nus reduce the harmful elements in the air, takes place in the Gulf of \nMexico, and the revenues generated from those oil and gas wells fund \nthe land and water conservation bill.\n  Another shortcoming of the Interior bill is that it fails to \nrecognize the contributions that are made by Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand Texas. It does not provide a fair share of those revenues back to \nour States. It does not include coastal impact assistance. There is a \npossibility under the agreement with the chairmen of the committees \nthat some of that can possibly be taken care of in the Commerce-\nJustice-State bill. We are very hopeful some of that money might become \navailable.\n  This plan for an environmental legacy, despite the fact that this may \nbe taken care of to a small degree in another bill, in the Interior \nbill, fails to recognize the contribution made by States that allow \noffshore oil and gas drilling.\n  I have held up this plan many times on the floor. This is the ``Coast \n2050'' plan from Louisiana. This is a plan that says: ``Without bold \naction now, a national treasure will be lost forever.'' That treasure \nis the largest expanse of coastal wetlands in North America. The \nlargest expanse of coastal wetlands in North America is at risk. The \nCARA Coalition came to Washington to say: We do not want all of the \nmoney for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. We do not even want 50 \npercent of the money. We do not even expect 25 percent of the money. \nBut we think we are in our right to ask for at least 10 percent of the \nmoney that is generated from offshore oil and gas revenues to come back \nto the coastal States, the great coastal areas of our Nation, for \nrestoration.\n  The coast of Louisiana is home to 2 million Americans, and the other \nstatistics are awesome. The ecosystem contributes nearly 30 percent by \nweight of the total commercial fisheries harvested in the entire \nNation. It provides wintering habitat for over 70 percent of migratory \nwaterfowl for the whole Nation. And 18 percent of U.S. oil production, \nand 24 percent of gas production come from Louisiana primarily and the \nGulf of Mexico. Our port system ranks first in the Nation, and we \nprovide commercial outlets for the transportation of goods into this \nNation and out of this Nation.\n  As a Senator from Louisiana--and I know Senator Breaux joins me--I \nthought we could expect some recognition of what the coastal States \nmean to this Nation and some recognition of a coastal impact assistance \npiece or coastal stewardship piece, which CARA had in mind and which \nthis Interior bill--although it is recognized, it has moved some of the \nmoney over to Commerce--does not recognize in its legacy.\n  I say for the CARA Coalition that we have always believed the legacy \nthat we are trying to leave is not just about interior States; it is \nabout coastal States. It is not just about Federal spending and \ndecisions made at the Federal level; it is about decisions made at the \nlocal level and at the State level.\n  The underlying bill, while I know it took some work and it took some \neffort and there have been lots of negotiations at every level, fails \nin many aspects in terms of what we had hoped for this year. We will \ncontinue to hope for it if it is not done in this Congress.\n  There is still time. It is unlikely that what we are asking for can \nbe done in this bill. The conference is closed. We do not, under the \nrules, have an opportunity to amend this particular bill, but there are \nmany other bills moving through. There is still action that can be \ntaken on the part of the Democratic and Republican leadership. The \nPresident himself could weigh in more strongly and say: Yes, let's take \nwhat we can on lands legacy, but let's add in addition to it the CARA \nlegislation.\n  I will try to explain a few other things about the underlying bill \nand how it falls very short of where we want to be.\n  Supporters of the underlying bill claim there is money in this bill \nfor conservation programs, and they are correct. There is even more \nmoney than was originally budgeted for conservation programs. The \nproblem is that each of the programs have to compete against each other \nfor limited dollars. Unlike CARA, which had the programs pretty much \nclearly defined and moneys attached to each program so that Governors, \nmayors, and program administrators could count on that money, the \nunderlying bill does not allow for that. It allows for competition, for \nan annual grab-bag approach every year. Let me give an example.\n  In the first category, which is under the land conservation, \npreservation, infrastructure improvement trust fund, which is what this \nbill now calls it--it is not lands legacy, it is not CARA, it is called \nthe land conservation, preservation, infrastructure improvement trust \nfund. There is $539 million in that fund, but out of that fund, the \nFederal side of land and water and the State side of land and water \nhave to compete for that $539 million.\n  We heard the distinguished chairman from Washington say he had over \n$1 billion in requests. He said he had over 1,000 requests totaling \nover $1 billion. That is just requests from the Federal side. If there \nare $1 billion in requests every year for the Federal side of land and \nwater, and we only have in this bill $539 million to fund it, I argue \nthere is not going to be anything left for the State side of land and \nwater. They have been underfunded for 30 years. The Governors have been \nleft holding an empty bag. When the mayors look in the bag, there is no \nmoney--promises, promises, but no money. While this trust fund attempts \nin a way to put this in categories, it fails to deliver the money \nnecessary for the State side and the Federal side.\n  Let me go into the next category which talks about State and other \nconservation programs. It talks about the cooperative endangered \nspecies fund, which is important; State wildlife grants, which \nbasically, according to the Wildlife Coalition, will never get to the \nStates because it will take 3 years to come up with a plan, and then \nwhen the States come up with a plan, it will take so much longer for it \nto be approved, so this $50 million is not really worth much at this \npoint.\n  The State wildlife grants, the North American wetlands conservation, \nscience programs, forest legacy, and additional planning inventory and \nmonitoring, all of those funds have to compete in this ``trust fund'' \nfor limited resources.\n  Instead of being able to count on money every year for the endangered \nspecies fund, instead of being able to count on a real State wildlife \nfund on which local officials can count and on which preservationists \nand conservationists can count, it is not there. Forest legacy cannot \ncount on it. The chances of funding it are minimal.\n  I will go to something Members can appreciate because they heard so \nmuch from their mayors. The next category is urban and historic \npreservation.\n  It includes the program we know as UPARR. It includes a very popular \nand effective program called Historic Preservation. It includes Urban \nand Community Forestry and the Youth Conservation Corps.\n\n[[Page S9810]]\n\n  They are good programs. The problem is, they have to compete for the \nsame pot of money, fighting among themselves. We had hoped, and we \nthought, it was time--and we still believe it is time, the CARA \nCoalition--to get the environmental community and the business \ncommunity and the recreational activists and enthusiasts in this Nation \nworking together. That is what the CARA Coalition represents. Instead \nof fighting over crumbs, instead of fighting over very limited amounts \nof money, we were hoping to build, first, on a relatively small amount \nof money but build together. And as the budget provided, as political \nopportunities provided, we were willing to come back and wait and be \npatient and get additional moneys for these programs.\n  But to force these groups, which have had to live on so little for so \nlong, to have to compete amongst each other every year, year in and \nyear out, I think is far less than what we could have done and what we \nshould have done.\n  We do not probably have the support to defeat this Interior \nappropriations bill. I would have to say, there are some very good \nthings in this bill. The appropriators worked very hard. I know it is \nvery tough to try to put together a bill that can meet the approval of \nover 500 Members--both in the House and in the Senate--representing \ndifferent parties and different interests.\n  (Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire assumed the chair.)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I want to just say how much I respect our leader, \nSenator Byrd, and the work that he and his staff have put in. But I \nbelieve it is important--and I feel compelled as the leader of the CARA \nCoalition in the Senate--to point out that there are real differences. \nAnd those differences really matter to environmental groups, to \nwildlife groups, to coastal impact assistance organizations that are \nfighting for coastal impact assistance and more acknowledgment of the \nneeds of our coasts. And it matters to parents, to volunteers, and to \ncommunity organizations.\n  So I think that we should be truthful and honest--and I am not saying \nthat people have not been truthful and honest, but I do think we have \nto be very clear that while this trust fund could potentially be a \nbeginning, it is not nearly where we need to be in terms of delivering \na real legacy for this Nation, a legacy of which Republicans can be \nproud, a legacy of which Democrats can be proud, a legacy of which this \nPresident can be proud.\n  So I want to take a few minutes, if I could--and I know we have quite \na bit of time and no time limit--so I would like to take a moment to go \nthrough this large binder here to talk about our coalition because \nthere is still time remaining in this session. We do not know whether \nwe are going to be in for this week, whether we may be here for another \n2 weeks, or another 3 weeks. There are still many serious negotiations \ngoing on between the House and the Senate, between congressional \nappropriators and the White House, on a variety of issues that are \nimportant to our Nation.\n  Some of those issues have to do with health care; some of them have \nto do with education; some of them have to do with transportation. So \nwe have time.\n  I have come to the floor to try to explain, in my remarks, the \ndifferences between what the Interior bill has laid down and for what \nthe CARA Coalition was hopeful.\n  I also want to point out and add to the Record this extraordinary \ncoalition that has been supporting this legislation, and to ask them to \nuse the time remaining to call the leadership, Senator Lott, Senator \nDaschle, and the President himself, and say thank you for the work that \nwe have done. But let's not miss this opportunity to do better. Let's \nnot miss this opportunity to do better this year, and to hopefully \nbuild in the years to come on what the Conservation and Reinvestment \nAct really envisions for our Nation.\n  Since I am a Senator from Louisiana, I want to thank this \nextraordinary list of supporters from Louisiana who are registered here \nin this book. This book is actually a book of all the States. There are \n5,000 organizations--an unprecedented coalition, of, as I said, \nGovernors, mayors, county officials, conservation and wildlife \norganizations, sportsmen's groups, parks and recreation advocates, \nbusiness and industry groups, historic preservationists, and soccer and \nyouth sports organizations that have called on us to act.\n  I want them to know that I have heard their message. I want them to \nknow that 63 Senators have heard their message. I want them to know \nthat Chairman Murkowski and the ranking member, Senator Bingaman, have \nheard their message. We want to work with them in the remaining weeks \nof this session, and for as long into the future as it takes to \nactually get an environmental legacy for this country of which we can \nall be proud.\n  Let me just say, in this book is a letter to each of the Senators, \nsigned by anywhere from 50 to literally hundreds of organizations in \ntheir States, urging them to adopt CARA, the Conservation and \nReinvestment Act, the principles outlined in CARA.\n  I thank, particularly, from my State of Louisiana, for his \nextraordinary leadership, our Secretary of Natural Resources, Jack \nCaldwell, who works for a Republican Governor, Gov. Mike Foster. In our \nState this has truly been a bipartisan effort.\n  I thank our Louisiana Wildlife Federation; the Coalition to Restore \nCoastal Louisiana, which produced this extraordinary document, for \ntheir work and help and advice through this process.\n  I thank our Lieutenant Governor, who is a colleague of mine, and a \ngood friend, Kathleen Blanco, and her Office of State Parks.\n  I particularly thank the Louisiana Chapter of the Sierra Club that \nspoke out early in support of this effort.\n  I thank the Louisiana Legislature that was the first legislative body \nin the Nation to adopt a resolution in favor of the Conservation \nReinvestment Act. And many State legislatures around our Nation have \nfollowed that show of support.\n  Almost every elected official in our State--particularly, I want to \nsingle out Mayor Marc Morial, the mayor of New Orleans, who will be \nleading the U.S. Conference of Mayors next year as chairman and a \nleading member of that organization, for his outstanding advocacy for \nUPARR and for other portions of the CARA legislation.\n  I thank Jefferson Parish President Tim Coulon, who is a Republican. \nAgain, our partnership has been quite bipartisan in Louisiana. I thank \nhim.\n  We have led this effort, but we have been joined by many States in \nthe Union, by many officials from all parts of this Nation.\n  Just for the record, I want to read a few of the groups from the \nState of Mississippi that have been extraordinary and helpful in this--\nand to thank Senator Trent Lott for his support--and to continue to \nencourage him and our leader, Senator Daschle, to find whatever avenues \nare necessary to build on the good work that has been done this year in \nthis regard. There are actually pages and pages of supporters from \nMississippi.\n  I will only read out the very top few, but there are literally--it \nlooks to be over 200 supporters from Mississippi, the first being \nMississippi Heritage Trust, Mississippi Department of Wildlife \nFisheries and Parks, Mississippi Wildlife Federation, the Chapter of \nWildlife Society, the Chapter of American Planning Association, the \nSchool of Architecture for Mississippi State--and I could go on through \nthis--the city of Hattiesburg, the city of Laurel, the Keep Jackson \nBeautiful Coalition, literally hundreds of organizations in \nMississippi.\n\n  For the Record, I will recite some of the organizations from South \nDakota because the leader has been on our side. Both Senator Daschle \nand Senator Tim Johnson were so helpful in this effort. We also have \npages and pages of organizations: Governor Bill Janklow, the South \nDakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks, the South Dakota Parks and \nRecreation Association, the South Dakota Conservation Officers \nAssociation, Beadle County Master Gardeners, the Beadle County \nSportsmen's Club, the Optimist Club of Huron. Throughout their entire \nState, from mayors to elected officials to conservation organizations, \nthey have let their voice be heard. I want the South Dakota supporters \nto know that their leader has heard them, has\n\n[[Page S9811]]\n\nbeen supportive, and has been very helpful.\n  I also thank our House colleagues: Chairman Young from Alaska; the \nranking member, George Miller of California; John Dingell of Michigan, \nwho has been an outstanding advocate for CARA; from my State \nparticularly, Billy Tauzin, who represents south Louisiana and is an \nexcellent supporter of CARA; and Chris John, who has been very helpful, \na member of the committee in the House. We have had a coalition of \nSenators and House Members, of elected officials around the Nation.\n  Since the session is not over yet, our fight is not over. We \nrecognize that we can't have everything we have asked for, but we \nrecognize that we would never get anywhere if we didn't ask. If we had \nnot put this effort forward, we might never get to a real trust fund \nfor the environment for our Nation. I think the effort has been worth \npursuing and the effort is still worth pursuing.\n  I am not going to ask my colleagues to vote against this bill. Some \nof them may do that for their own reasons. Senator Fitzgerald and \nothers who don't think there are enough property rights protections \nmay, for their own purposes, want to do that. I probably will cast a \nvote against the Interior bill because it falls short of what we want.\n  But this is a democratic process. We believe what we are fighting for \nis in the right direction. We believe the CARA Coalition represents \ntruly a bipartisan effort that can gather the support of not only \nFederal officials but State officials. And we believe that this is, in \nfact, a beginning. There is still time left to build on it. I am hoping \nleaders from other committees of the Senate can potentially give some \nsupport, as they have been from the beginning, and help as we try to \nput our best foot forward and move ahead on this legislation.\n  I will go over some of the other numbers in which some of my \ncolleagues may be interested on this particular bill. As I said \nearlier, the basis of CARA was to give guaranteed funding in certain \ncategories for environmental programs. Although this trust fund lays \ndown broad categories, they are not specific enough so that people can \nactually depend on them and States can depend on them.\n  For instance, under the land acquisition part of this bill, let's say \nfor Arizona, in this conference committee report there are about $15 \nmillion for land acquisition. Under the CARA proposal, as compromised \nbetween the House and Senate, Arizona would have received and could \nhave counted on approximately $47 million each year.\n  Arkansas--and Senator Lincoln has been an outstanding supporter of \nCARA--under the land portion of this bill actually gets zero money. \nThis is legislation for billions of dollars that are earmarked for \nother places, but under this trust fund concept, Arkansas gets actually \nzero. Under CARA, they would have a guarantee of $14.9 million.\n\n  Colorado in this bill has $5.3 million. Under CARA, they would have \n$46 million each year for the State PILT, for payment in lieu of taxes, \nfor land acquisition at the State level, not directed by Federal \nagencies but at the State level. They would have had money for historic \npreservation and for urban parks for cities such as Denver and others \nin Colorado.\n  Connecticut has $1.6 million approximately. They would have had $17 \nmillion of guaranteed funding.\n  Delaware has $1.3 million; under CARA, $14 million.\n  Georgia, which, according to our records, has about $650,000 for land \nacquisition projects, would have had $32 million under the Conservation \nand Reinvestment Act.\n  Hawaii, which has $2 million in this bill, would have counted on \nabout $29 million a year.\n  Idaho, which has about $7.5 million, would have gotten $39 million a \nyear, primarily in PILT payments, some on the State side of land and \nwater, and some in other areas.\n  Illinois, which is a large State, a very important State in our \nNation, and one of the most populated States, under this trust fund has \nzero money allocated for this year but would have had $38 million every \nyear under CARA.\n  Indiana has $3.8 million, as opposed to our proposal for $25 million.\n  As I read through some of these numbers--I would like to read through \nthem all for all the States--let me say that the underlying bill on the \ntrust fund has approximately the same amount of money the CARA \nCoalition desired.\n  Our coalition wants to be respectful and appreciative of budget \nconstraints. We recognize there are a great many needs in this Nation, \nfrom support for teachers and schools to support for health care, to \nthe lockbox for Social Security and Medicare. We have examined the \nstate of the budget. But we believe we could have spent and still \nbelieve that half of 1 percent of the surplus for an environmental \ntrust fund that we could count on year in and year out was not too much \nto ask for. In fact, the appropriators have basically agreed with that \nconcept because that is the amount of money they have actually put in \nthis bill.\n  The problem is, the framework they put in forces organizations to \ncompete year in and year out, not being able to depend on money. It \nwell underfunds PILT, payment in lieu of taxes, which is so important \nto our Western States. The underlying bill gives all of the money, or \n85 percent of it or more, to Federal agencies and shortchanges our \nGovernors and our mayors and our local elected officials. And it does \nnot fund, as clearly as it should, some of the other important programs \nwe have outlined as authorizers in our compromise between the House and \nthe Senate.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, if I may retain the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend, we have Senator Dorgan, Senator Craig, and \nothers wishing to speak. No one wants to take away the time the Senator \ndeserves on this issue. Can she give us an idea of how much time she is \ngoing to take?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will take probably another 10 minutes, and then I \nwill yield back my time, if I am able to, to Senator Fitzgerald, who \ncontinues to want time on the floor. We can check with Senator \nFitzgerald.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to read some of this into the Record.\n  Iowa, for instance, is the only State of the Union to date that has \nnot received any money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund in 30 \nyears, as the records will reflect. This year, Iowa has $600,000. Under \nCARA, we could have made a commitment of approximately $11 million per \nyear.\n  Kansas--and Senator Roberts has been a terrific supporter of CARA, \nand I am appreciative of his support, particularly for the wildlife \nportion of our bill--gets zero in the trust fund for this year. Kansas \nwould have gotten about $11.9 million under CARA.\n  Kentucky, $2.5 million; $15 million under CARA.\n  Maine, $1 million under this bill for this year; $31.9 million would \nhave been directed to Maine under the CARA proposal.\n  Maryland, which sits on the shores of the great Chesapeake Bay--an \narea that deserves, in my opinion, a great deal more attention, and the \nlocal officials in the various States around the Chesapeake have done a \nwonderful job, and there has been much help from the Federal level, but \nwe can still do more to protect that important ecosystem in our \nNation--Maryland gets $1.2 million. Under CARA, they would have gotten \n$28 million a year.\n  Massachusetts, about $1.5 million; under CARA, $35 million.\n  Michigan, $1.1 million; under CARA, $42 million.\n  Minnesota, $2.8 million; under CARA, $29 million.\n  Missouri, $3.5 million; under CARA, $26.2 million.\n  Montana, $6.5 million; under CARA, $47.8 million.\n  Nebraska--and Senator Kerrey has been a wonderful supporter and very \nhelpful in terms of arguing that States and local governments should \nhave a say as we divide this money annually and should be able to count \non something and not have to wait until October, which costs the \ntaxpayers more and which is difficult at the State level. Nebraska has \na grand total of $400,000 for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nUnder CARA, they would have gotten about $14.5 million.\n\n[[Page S9812]]\n\n  Nevada, which is the State of my good colleague, Senator Reid, got $2 \nmillion. CARA would have brought them $37 million. A lot of that money \nwould have been for PILT payments because the Senator represents a \nState where the Federal Government owns 92 percent of the land.\n  So it is our obligation to provide money for those local units in \nNevada which lose revenues when the Federal Government takes over land \nfrom the private sector. They would have benefited from the formula \nthat would have acknowledged that and tried to, in some ways, make them \nwhole by improving their PILT payments. They would get $38 million \nunder CARA; instead, they get $2 million.\n  New Hampshire, a small State but a very important State, under this \nbill gets $3.6 million; under CARA, the total it would have received is \n$17 million.\n  New Jersey, the Garden State, with a Republican Governor whom I \nadmire a good deal, Governor Whitman, just passed--and I am sure with \nDemocratic help--a bond issue to provide over a billion dollars for \nSaving Open Spaces in New Jersey. They are one of the most populated \nStates and are trying to preserve the farmland they have left and the \ngreen spaces. That is very important to many people along the east \ncoast, the west coast, the interior, and the coastal communities. They \npassed a billion dollar, multiyear effort. I believe, and the CARA \ncoalition believes, we should try to match that effort. Instead, under \nthis bill, we have given New Jersey $2 million. CARA would have \nprovided them a $40 million partnership every year.\n\n  New Mexico--and Senator Bingaman has been an outspoken advocate and a \nranking member on our side--gets $4.7 million. It would be $44.9 \nmillion under CARA.\n  I know my time is going to be running short. In a moment, I will be \nprepared to yield my time back to Senator Fitzgerald, who had the \nfloor. I was taking some time from him. I say to our floor leader, I \nwill yield back some time to Senator Fitzgerald.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for that purpose?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes, for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I just have a parliamentary inquiry. The Senator would not \nlose the floor. I have a question to ask the Chair.\n  Is the parliamentary situation that the Senator from Illinois has the \nfloor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I am going to continue speaking about \nthis $120 million proposed Abraham Lincoln Library in Illinois. I \nrealize my colleague from Idaho wishes to be recognized. What I am \ngoing to ask is unanimous consent that the Senator from Idaho be \nrecognized for 10 minutes at this time and that I then be re-\nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the reason I \nsay that is, there is a unanimous consent agreement already in effect, \nand the Senator from North Dakota wishes to speak as well. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Continuing on, Mr. President, to bring the Senate \nback up to date, we are talking about a proposed Abraham Lincoln \nLibrary in downtown Springfield, IL, that would cost approximately $120 \nmillion.\n  The library would be one of the most expensive buildings in the city \nof Springfield. The estimated value of the State capitol in Springfield \nis, I believe, $78 million, in inflation-adjusted dollars. This library \nwould be approximately half the size of the State capitol, but it is a \nsubstantial building. It is also going to be very close to the \nRenaissance Springfield Hotel, which we have been examining in detail \nthis afternoon.\n  The reason I am concerned or have an objection to the conference \ncommittee report now before the Senate is that the conference committee \nreport authorizes $50 million in Federal funding for the Abraham \nLincoln site but does not carry the requirement that passed out of the \nSenate that the project be competitively bid in accordance with Federal \nlaw. Instead, it would appear the money that is authorized in the \nconference committee report--instead of having a competitive bid \nrequirement, it says that the $50 million is authorized to go to an \nentity that will be selected later which would design and construct the \nlibrary.\n  The language does not make clear that the entity would be a \ngovernmental entity. It is possible, based on reading the conference \nreport, that the $50 million could be channeled to private sources. \nPresumably, that would not happen however. Presumably, the money would \nbe given to the State of Illinois.\n  We have reviewed what would happen if the money were given to the \nState of Illinois, how the State of Illinois would award construction \ncontracts. Presumably, the State of Illinois would turn the project \nover to its Capital Development Board. We reviewed and examined earlier \ntoday a giant loophole in the Capital Development Board--the statute on \nprocurement that governs the Capital Development Board. They have a \nright to opt out of competitive bidding. Apparently, in the statute, \nthey can just decide they are not going to have competitive sealed bids \non the project.\n  That loophole gives me pause for the reason that I thought we ought \nto have a tighter set of restrictions. I proposed an amendment that \nwould require that the Federal competitive bid guidelines be attached \nto the project. I think that would take care of the problem. We are \nexamining in detail the concerns I have and some of the red flags that \nhave occurred to me with this project.\n  I spent 6 years in the Illinois State Senate in Springfield. I have a \npretty good idea of how State government operates. I am familiar with \nmany of the people who are involved with this project. After taking a \nvery close look at the project, it originally started out as a $40 \nmillion project, then went to a $60 million project. At one time they \nwere talking about a $140-something million project; now it is back \ndown to a $115 million or a $120 million project. They are seeking $50 \nmillion from the State of Illinois, $50 million from the Federal \nGovernment, and $10 million in essentially tax breaks from the city of \nSpringfield, and possibly the contribution of some land.\n  They are, in addition, creating a not-for-profit corporation that was \nfiled with the office of the Illinois secretary of state in June of \nthis year. They have recently made, are making, or have made--it is not \nclear which--a request to become registered as an official charity. \nThey could solicit and retain contributions for the Lincoln Library \nFoundation. They have set an ambitious goal for the foundation of \nraising somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 or $55 million.\n  I received from published reports that the foundation's board of \ndirectors appear to be Mrs. Julie Cellini, who is the head of the \nIllinois Historic Preservation Agency, and Mrs. Laura Ryan, the first \nlady of the State of Illinois.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend from Illinois yield for a \nquestion without losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Illinois has the floor. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota, under a unanimous consent agreement, has a right to speak \nwhen the Senator finishes. The Senator from Idaho wishes to speak for \n10 minutes. I am wondering if the Senator from Illinois would agree \nthat Senator Craig could speak now for 10 minutes, with the Senator \nfrom Illinois retaining his right to the floor, and at such time as \nSenator Dorgan comes to the floor we allow him to speak for up to 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I would go along with that as long as I could be \nrecognized upon the completion of the remarks of the Senator from Idaho \nand upon the completion of the remarks of Senator Dorgan, and that my \nrecognition would count as a continuation of the speech I am now \ndelivering on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. REID. That was the intent of the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9813]]\n\n  Mr. REID. As I understand it, the Senator from Idaho is now going to \nbe recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank both Senators and the Senator from \nIllinois for yielding. It certainly was his prerogative not to yield \nbecause he controls the time, and I appreciate that, and the Senator \nfrom Nevada for accommodating me and working out the differences.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I had hoped that I would be able to respond \nin part while the Senator from Louisiana was on the floor speaking \nabout her concerns about the CARA legislation. She certainly has made \nevery effort to move that legislation, which is important to her State.\n  Both the Senator from Louisiana and I serve on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee on which that legislation was formed. She has \nalways been courteous. We have worked closely together on the issue.\n  I could not and do not support CARA as it is currently crafted and as \nit was voted out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I said \nvery early on to the citizens of my State and to my colleagues on that \ncommittee that I would strongly oppose any bill that created a Federal \nentitlement that allowed the Federal Government to own more of the \nState of Idaho. The Federal Government already owns nearly 64 percent \nof my State. And this year you watched Federal forests in my State \nburn, with tremendous fire and heat, causing the destruction of the \nenvironment and resources. My State forests did not burn. The private \nforests in Idaho did not burn because they were managed. They were \nthinned. They are healthy, growing, dynamic forests that provide \nmarvelous habitat and quality water to our streams, to our fisheries, \nand to the life-style of my beautiful State.\n  Two weeks ago, I was in a helicopter flying over the nearly 1.2 \nmillion acres of charred national forests in my State--charred almost \nto a point of nonrecognition. It will take a decade or more for the \nnatural environment to begin to return. That could have been avoided to \nsome degree, if the Forest Service and its management had not become an \nagency of benign neglect, which had simply turned its back on these \nliving environments, and had helped Mother Nature to improve them in a \nway that they would not have burned in such a catastrophic fashion.\n  The reason I say that is because many want the Federal Government to \nown more land. Somehow the Federal Government's ownership has in some \npeople's minds become synonymous with quality environment. That is \nsimply not true today.\n  Nearly 40 million acres of national forest land are in a dead or \ndying condition--bug-infested, overpopulated with trees, and as a \nresult drought stricken, with the health of the trees declining and the \nhealth of the forests faltering.\n  Is that a way to manage lands? No, it isn't. The Senator from \nLouisiana knows that. She knows my strong opposition to additional \nownership of Federal property in my State. She worked with me. She \nworked with me very closely to try to change that equation, and we \nsimply could not get that done.\n  That is why we did something different in this Interior \nappropriations bill. It is not CARA and it is not land legacy, but it \ndoes recognize the importance of spending money for certain resource \nvalues, for certain wildlife habitat values, for certain coastal needs \nof the kind the Senator from Louisiana has for the general well-being \nof the environment with moneys coming from offshore oil royalties, many \nof them generated in the gulf south of her State and out into the ocean \nbeyond Louisiana. On that, she and I do not disagree. But I will \ncontinue to be a strong opponent of an attitude or a philosophy and an \neffort to fund an attitude and a philosophy that somehow if the Federal \nGovernment owns the land, it is going to be better protected. In my \nState of Idaho, because nearly 64 percent is owned by the Federal \nGovernment, they also dictate the economy of my State.\n  Today we had a hearing in the Small Business Committee about the \nimpact of forest policies on all of the small communities of my State. \nI chair the Forestry Subcommittee of this Senate. We have held over 100 \nhearings since 1996 examining the character of decision-making in the \nU.S. Forest Service and that they ignore small business today, and they \nturn their back on small communities that adjoin those forests.\n  Is it any wonder why nearly all of those small communities in Idaho \nand across the Nation today associated with public forests have 14 and \n15 percent unemployment while the rest of our country flourishes \nbecause of the high-tech economy? No. It is quite obvious that is what \nis happening because this Government and this administration have \nlocked the door on the U.S. forested land and turned their back and \nwalked away. With that, thousands of jobs and 45,000 schoolchildren in \nrural schools across the Nation are deprived of the money that would \nhave come to them by an active management plan of the U.S. Forest \nService because of long-term policies that allowed counties and school \ndistricts to share in those revenues.\n  I can't stand here as someone representing the State of Idaho and \nsay: Give the Federal Government more money to buy more land in the \nState of Idaho to make it Federal. I can't do that in good conscience, \nand I won't.\n  I am joined with my western colleagues to tell the Senator from \nLouisiana, somehow it has to be done differently. I am not going to \nsuggest what we do in this bill is answer the problems or concerns of \nthe Senator from Louisiana. I think it probably isn't.\n  But I will say it is no longer an entitlement. It is not automatic \nfor 15 years. We do not give this administration or any future \nadministration half a billion worth of cash a year to go out and buy \nmore and more land to turn into forest fires or dying habitat for \nwildlife because they won't actively manage it and care for it.\n  There is a lot of money in here to help our national parks. There is \nmoney for urban parks. There is money for coastal acquisitions. There \nis a great deal of money--$1.8 billion, nearly $2 billion worth. A \nchart shows it ratchets it up over the next number of years to nearly \n$2.4 billion. It is not as originally envisioned by the CARA Coalition, \nbut it is a great deal of what they asked for.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for clarification?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have very limited time. I apologize.\n  I am not in any way--how do I say this--taking offense at what the \nSenator from Louisiana has said. We have worked very closely on this \nissue. She and I held fundamental disagreement on one portion of the \nbill. I made an effort to change that. I made an effort to have no net \ngain of Federal lands in the States. Willing seller, willing buyer--all \nof those kinds of things we worked to get. We couldn't get them.\n  So I have fought, as other colleagues have fought, not to allow CARA \nto come to the floor this year for a vote.\n  Let me talk more about something else before my time is up. I \nmentioned that nearly 1.2 million acres of Federal land burned in my \nState this year, beautiful forested land that was in trouble \nenvironmentally, and when Mother Nature came along and struck with her \nviolence, it all went up in smoke.\n  There is a lot of money in this bill to begin to deal with those \nproblems, a great deal of money in this bill to pay off the fire \nexpenditures that are natural to do so. A lot of this money is to pay \nback the expenses that were incurred this year, the millions and \nmillions of dollars spent each day for nearly 60 days across this \ncountry during the peak of the fire season when the skies of Idaho were \ngray to black, as it was true in other States across this Nation. There \nis a lot of money in this bill for that purpose.\n  There is also additional money in this bill, new language, and new \npolicy, on which Senator Domenici of New Mexico and I worked with a lot \nof others, to try to create an active management scheme that will allow \nin areas where there are now urban dwellers--we call it the urban \nwildland interface--which I will come back to.\n  I thank my colleague from Illinois for yielding. This is an important \nbill. We have addressed a lot of the problems. I hope my colleagues \nwill join in supporting the passage of the Interior appropriations \nconference report.\n\n[[Page S9814]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, reviewing again the proposed Abraham \nLincoln Library in Springfield, IL, I emphasize the magnitude of the \nproject. It is a proposed $120 million project. It started as a $40 \nmillion project, went up to $60 million, and now it is at $120 million. \nAt one time, it was up to $140 million.\n  Reviewing the cost of other important buildings in the city of \nSpringfield, the estimated cost, adjusted for inflation:\n  The State capitol building built in 1868 to 1888, $70 million.\n  The Willard Ice Building, I believe for the State Department of \nRevenue, a very large State office building built in 1981 to 1984, took \n3 years to construct, $70 million;\n  The Prairie Capitol Convention Center, a large convention center, \nbuilt in 1975 to 1979, $60 million.\n  This Abraham Lincoln Library will be one of the largest, most \nimportant buildings in the city of Springfield. I am supporting the \nproject. However, I want the city of Springfield to get a $120 million \nlibrary out of the project, not a $50 million library that just happens \nto cost $120 million.\n  It is for that reason I have tried, and the Senate has tried, to \ninsist that the project be competitively bid. The Senate has gone on \nrecord with the legislation that cleared the full Senate last night, \nunanimously requiring, with our authorization of $50 million for this \nproject, that the Federal rules of competitive bidding, which are set \nforth in this volume and are very extensive, very well thought out, \nwere worked on by then-Senator Bill Cohen from Maine, now the Secretary \nof Defense--a lot of thought has gone into these rules. A lot of \nrefinements have been made over many years. They have had to correct \nproblems, and they have gone back to them repeatedly.\n  It has been a great focus of many Senators and Congresspeople in \nWashington. The intent of the Federal rules is to try to eliminate \npolitical favoritism in the awarding of construction contracts. The \nHouse has now in the conference committee, with provisions they have \ninserted into the conference committee, the same authorization that the \nSenate has backed. However, they struck the language requiring that \nFederal competitive bidding guidelines be followed.\n  The money is supposed to go to an entity that will be selected later. \nIt is not clear exactly to whom the $50 million taxpayer money will go. \nIt is interesting that Washington passes legislation sending out the \nmoney without saying to whom it is going; that is what this provision \ndoes. One would think we would be more careful with the taxpayer money \nand we would know--at least for sure it would be nailed down in law--\nwho was getting the money. Presumably the money would wind up in the \nhands of the State of Illinois, and if it wound up in the State of \nIllinois, they would probably give it to their Illinois Capital \nDevelopment Board for the Illinois Capital Development Board to \nconstruct the project in accordance with the Illinois procurement code.\n  Reviewing for the Senators who have just arrived, the Illinois \nprocurement code was at one time one of the weakest, perhaps, in the \ncountry. It was strengthened a few years ago, in late 1997. I think \nchanges were made for the better. I supported legislation--I believe it \nwas H.R. 1633--that strengthened those guidelines. When we started to \nlook and study in a more detailed manner how the Federal money would \ngo, and considered what would happen if it went to the State Capital \nDevelopment Board, we looked carefully at the State's procurement code \nand a couple of glitches popped out at us.\n  I want to review those glitches. The State's position on this is that \nif the money goes to the Capital Development Board and they build the \nlibrary, they have to, under their law, use competitive bidding. It \nturns out, however, that contrary to the Capital Development Board's \nassertions, in fact, a contradiction appears in the statute governing \nthe Capital Development Board. The portion of the procurement code that \ngoverns the Capital Board is 30.I.L.C.S.5500/30-a. It says:\n\n       Other methods. The Capital Development Board shall \n     establish by rule construction purchases that may be made \n     without competitive sealed bidding and the most competitive \n     alternate method of source selection that shall be used.\n\n  That is a great big loophole in the Capital Development Board \nprocurement code. Thus, there is the possibility that if we give this \nmoney to the State and do not attach the Federal competitive bidding \nguidelines, the State could simply opt out of competitively bidding the \nproject.\n  That troubled me greatly, given the magnitude of the project and \ngiven a long history in Illinois of what I would say is a fairly acute \nproblem with procurement contracts--in construction and in leasing, \nparticularly. It occurred to me that we needed tighter safeguards.\n  There is another general problem I addressed earlier with the State \nprocurement code, and that is in advance of bidding, even when they do \nopt to competitively bid, they don't have to tell the bidders what \nweight and relative importance they are going to attach to the various \ncriteria they must set forth. The State must tell the bidders by what \ncriteria they are going to judge the bids and make awards, but they are \nnot going to tell you what weight they assign to the various criteria.\n  The problem with that is that it is like trying to pin keylime pie to \nthe wall. You can come in with the low bid and the State can say we \ngave more weight, actually, to the experience of this other bid. It \ncosts a little bit more, but we give more weight to their experience, \nor vice versa; they could almost always rationalize the acceptance of \nany bid after the fact and make it very hard to challenge a decision by \nthe State to not accept your bid. Of course, in contrast, the Federal \ncode in that regard is markedly superior. It does a much better job at \nlimiting the discretion of the procurement officers and it does that by \nrequiring that sealed bid solicitations disclose in advance all \nsignificant bid evaluation factors and the relative importance of each \nfactor and whether nonprice factors, when combined, will be accorded \nmore, equal, or less weight than price.\n  Of course, the State rules, which do not require the relative \nimportance for weight of the factors to be disclosed, would allow a \npurchasing officer to pick any bid he wants and explain his decision by \nsaying the one factor for which that bid was better was the most \nimportant factor, and any decision could be rationalized after the \nfact. It would be very hard to challenge any award the State made.\n  Perhaps that could be why, after there have been so many articles and \ninvestigative reports written about seemingly, on their face, \nexorbitant rents or prices on projects, that you don't actually have \nmuch of a challenge or any history of prosecutions on that. So I feel \nthe State code really is deficient in those two key respects. I feel \nthe Senate did the right thing by attaching a requirement that the \nFederal competitive bidding guidelines attach to the project. There is \ngreater protection for the taxpayers if we do that.\n\n  We have reviewed the history of projects in Springfield. We talked \nabout a State loan given to a partnership that constructed the \nSpringfield Renaissance Hotel. That hotel is located close to where the \nAbraham Lincoln Library is proposed to be. We talked about some of the \nproblems that have arisen from time to time in the State of Illinois. \nMy goal here is to try to tighten the law so we are not setting the \ntable for another problem to occur with this project, which is, after \nall, being built as a monument to ``Honest Abe'' Lincoln, perhaps the \ngreatest President in history. We want to make sure the taxpayers get \nthe value of all the resources they are contributing.\n  We have reviewed how the State previously gave out loans to build the \nhotels. Those loans were never fully repaid. I believe there is still a \nsubstantial outstanding balance. We have, thus, in that manner, begun \nlaying before the Senate the context in which my deep concern arises by \nthe lose authorizing language in the conference committee report before \nthe Senate.\n  Now, we read the article ``Taxpayers Stuck With $30 Million Hotel \nTab.'' I want to turn to an article that appeared in the Chicago Sun \nTimes on October 6, 1996. It is an article by Tim Novak, Chuck \nNeubauer, and Dave\n\n[[Page S9815]]\n\nMcKinney. If I may read this article, the headline is:\n\n       Cellini State Capitol's Quiet Captain of Clout; Dealmaker \n     Built Empire Working in Background.\n       Outside the state Capitol, William Cellini is just another \n     businessman.\n       Inside, Cellini is one of the most powerful people in state \n     government, a man who has built a personal empire worth at \n     least $50 million through his ties to the governor's office \n     dating back to 1968.\n       This 62-year-old son of a Springfield policeman is perhaps \n     the most feared, respected and invisible man in those halls \n     of power.\n       He's played the system brilliantly--and legally.\n       Cellini has never run for state office, but he's helped run \n     state offices--reviewing choices for the governor's Cabinet, \n     getting scores of people state jobs and at one time even \n     approving all federal appointments in Illinois.\n       His unique access has put him in position for a staggering \n     succession of state-financed deals.\n       He is an owner of the state's first riverboat casino. He \n     got state money to build a money-losing luxury hotel where he \n     throws fund-raisers for Gov. Edgar. He got state funds to \n     build 1,791 apartments in Chicago, the suburbs and Downstate. \n     He manages offices that he developed for state agencies. He \n     invests pension funds for state teachers. And that is just \n     part of his empire.\n       But most of all Cellini has had clout with Illinois \n     governors starting with Richard Ogilvie through James \n     Thompson and now Edgar.\n\n  Keep in mind, this is an article from 1996. George Ryan is the \ncurrent Governor of Illinois. Reading again from the article:\n\n       And those relationships have been mutually profitable: the \n     Governors got cash for their campaigns and Cellini became a \n     multimillionaire.\n       ``I can't recall someone similar to Bill Cellini having \n     that access. And for that long as well,'' said Donald Totten, \n     the Schaumburg Township Republican committeeman who was \n     President Reagan's Midwest coordinator.\n       ``He seems to always have the ears of governors, which are \n     always the most powerful people in government,'' Totten said. \n     ``Thompson-Cellini, Ogilvie-Cellini. Edgar's got his sister \n     on in a major job, so he has influence there.''\n       Cellini's sister Janis is Edgar's patronage director, in \n     charge of hiring people for the highest level jobs. Both \n     Cellinis accompanied Edgar on a two-week trade mission to \n     Asia last month.\n       Cellini has clout. But money is the foundation of his far-\n     reaching empire. Specifically, his ability to raise cash--\n     primarily from road builders--while rarely giving any of his \n     own money. Cellini raises hundreds of thousands of dollars, \n     mainly for those Republicans, primarily candidates for \n     governor, but also for those seeking the White House like \n     Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bob Dole.\n       Throughout it all, Cellini has been granted extraordinary \n     powers, clout that elected officials usually reserve for \n     themselves.\n       When Edgar took office, Cellini interviewed candidates for \n     the Cabinet and made recommendations--particularly for state \n     departments that do business with Cellini's companies.\n       ``The reason he's involved in Cabinet selections is Bill \n     Cellini has seen more Cabinet members come and go. He has \n     good instincts about what it takes to be a good Cabinet \n     member,'' said state Sen. Kirk Dillard (R-Hinsdale), who \n     spent three years as Edgar's first chief of staff.\n       Cellini has also spent nearly 30 years helping scores of \n     people get jobs in state agencies, creating what some call a \n     patronage army more loyal to Cellini than any governor.\n       ``He probably knows more people in state government that I \n     do,'' Thompson told the Sun-Times in 1990 as he was winding \n     down his 14 years as governor.\n       Cellini's clout has gone all the way to the White House \n     based on letters and memos from the Gerald R. Ford Library. \n     Under President Ford, Cellini was in charge of all federal \n     appointments in Illinois, according to a letter from Don \n     ``Doc'' Adams, a longtime Cellini friend who was chairman of \n     the Illinois Republican Party when Ford was president.\n       ``As you know Bill Cellini is the man we've designated to \n     coordinate Federal and State appointments for the state of \n     Illinois,'' Adams wrote in 1976 to Ford's personnel director, \n     Douglas Bennett.\n       ``If Doc Adams is telling the White House that Bill Cellini \n     is the guy to go to in Illinois . . . Bill is operating as a \n     political boss without having to be an elected official,'' \n     said a longtime Republican who requested anonymity.\n       It's hard to find people, Republican or Democrat, willing \n     to talk about Cellini and Cellini adds to the intrigue by \n     shunning the spotlight.\n       Cellini ignored numerous requests from the Chicago Sun-\n     Times to discuss his empire and power. Over the past few \n     years, Cellini has placed many of his financial holdings in \n     trusts to benefit his son, William Jr., 27, and daughter, \n     Claudia, 22.\n\n  Keep in mind this article is from 1996.\n\n       Often referred to as a Downstate Republican powerbroker, \n     Cellini has numerous business deals in Chicago and the \n     suburbs, often working with businessmen allied with Democrats \n     such as Mayor Daley.\n       Cellini spends so much time in Chicago that he bought a \n     $594,000 condo on Michigan Avenue in 1993 without a mortgage. \n     He also has a $325,000 home without a mortgage in an elite \n     Springfield neighborhood. It's a long way from the \n     Springfield duplex he and his wife, Julie, shared when he \n     went to work for Ogilvie in 1969.\n       ``There's no doubt he's probably done pretty well,'' Edgar \n     said. ``But there are a lot of people who have made money off \n     state government who have never been involved in politics . . \n     . who have never worked a precinct or helped a candidate.\n       ``I think there's a lot of folks who are envious of Bill \n     Cellini.''\n\n\n                           The Ogilvie Years\n\n       ``When I met Bill Cellini he was a local politician. That \n     was it,'' said John Henry Altorfer, a Peoria businessman who \n     hired Cellini to manage his campaign for governor in 1968.\n       Cellini (pronounced, Suh-LEE-nee), a former high school \n     physics teacher, was in his early 30s and building a \n     reputation as a Downstate power while serving his second term \n     on Springfield's City Council. Altorfer said he thought \n     Cellini could deliver Downstate votes and help him win the \n     Republican nomination for governor in a four-way race that \n     included Cook County Board President Richard Ogilvie.\n       Cellini ``was very energetic and had a lot of ideas,'' said \n     Altorfer, who now lives in Arizona. ``He worked very hard for \n     me until I lost.''\n       Altorfer beat Ogilvie in the Downstate counties, but \n     Ogilvie carried Cook County and won the primary. Ogilvie \n     brought Cellini along to garner Downstate support, a move \n     that has left Altorfer with lingering suspicions.\n       ``Some of my friends came to me and said, `Do you think \n     Bill was secretly working for Ogilvie?' '' Altorfer said. \n     ``Ogilvie had inside information about my campaign and I \n     wasn't sure where it came from.\n       ``The only person who worked for me who received anything \n     was Bill Cellini,'' Altorfer said. ``I have to believe he was \n     being repaid. I thought he had loyalties to two people, me \n     and Ogilvie.''\n       Altorfer ``didn't lose because of Cellini,'' said Thomas \n     Drennan, a political advisor to Ogilvie. ``Cellini beat our \n     brains out'' in the primary.\n       ``He was just an excellent organizer,'' Drennan said. ``He \n     was like a good precinct captain, but countywide.''\n       Ogilvie was elected governor and he picked Cellini to \n     become the state's public works director, overseeing \n     construction of the interstate highway system that had \n     started in the 1950s.\n       Cellini, who was 34, had experience with road construction, \n     having served as Springfield's streets commissioner while on \n     the City Council and as a member of the Roads and Bridges \n     Committee when he was on the Sangamon County Board.\n       Cellini rose quickly under Ogilvie. Cellini headed a task \n     force that created the Illinois Department of Transportation \n     and he became the first director, overseeing a $1.6 billion \n     budget and 10,000 employees. His $40,000 salary was second \n     only to Ogilvie's.\n       Cellini was also chosen to head other committees. One \n     pushed for extending the rapid transit line to O'Hare \n     Airport. Another pushed for building the Deep Tunnel, the \n     ongoing public works project to relieve flooding in Cook \n     County.\n       ``He expanded his influence when he was secretary of \n     transportation,'' said Totten, who was a transportation \n     deputy under Cellini. ``He was a very powerful, behind-the-\n     scenes politician in Springfield. And he still is.''\n       Road construction boomed under Cellini and Ogilvie, but so \n     did allegations of collusion among road builders seeking to \n     cash in on the work. A handful of road builders were \n     convicted in the federal probe and temporarily suspended from \n     getting any more federally funded highway projects.\n       The probe included accusations that Cellini's top deputies \n     used IDOT helicopters to swoop down on construction sites to \n     pick up campaign donations for Ogilvie. No state officials \n     were ever charged in the probe that continued after Ogilvie \n     lost his re-election bid in 1972 to Dan Walker, the Democrat \n     who defied Mayor Daley's machine to become governor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Illinois will \nyield at this point.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding from the colloquy with \nthe Senator from Nevada is that the Senator from Illinois indicated he \nwould yield to me for 20 minutes without him losing the continuity of \nhis presentation and with the stipulation he be recognized upon the \ncompletion of my remarks.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from North Dakota now be recognized for 20 minutes and that I \nbe rerecognized upon the completion of his remarks and that my \nrerecognition\n\n[[Page S9816]]\n\ncount as a further continuation of the speech I began earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the \nInterior conference report which is before the Senate, but first I want \nto make some brief comments on a bill called CARA, the Conversation and \nReinvestment Act.\n  My colleague from the State of Louisiana and other colleagues from \nthe State of Florida and many other areas of the country feel, as I do, \nthat it is very important for us to try to finish this important bill \nbefore we finish our work this year.\n  CARA is a bill dealing with conservation, preservation, and \nreinvestment in our natural resources, wildlife, parks, and public \nlands. We struggled to bring that out of the Energy Committee under the \nleadership of Senator Murkowski. My hope is, before this Congress \nadjourns, we will have the opportunity to pass it through the Senate \nand find a way to have the House of Representatives work with us to \naccept it so it can become law. It is a very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, let me say a kind word about my colleague from the \nState of Washington, Senator Gorton, and also my colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd.\n  I come to the floor to talk about this conference report. I am on the \nInterior Subcommittee. I have told my two colleagues before--the \nchairman and the ranking member--that I think they have done an awfully \ngood job. This is not easy work. It is hard work, trying to fit \nunlimited wants into limited resources. How do you do all of that? You \nhave to make choices. Sometimes the choices are hard and painful, but \nyou have to make choices.\n  While I would like to see more investment and more spending in some \nareas that I think are critical, I must say that this year, once again, \nSenator Gorton and Senator Byrd have taken another step--a significant \nstep--in addressing some of these critical needs. And it has not always \nbeen done in the past. So I say to them, thank you. And good for you. I \nappreciate the work you have done.\n  I especially wanted to come to the floor today to speak for a few \nminutes about the issues of Indian education. I have been such a strong \nadvocate of Indian schools. These schools on Indian reservations--both \nthe BIA schools and the public schools on or near reservations--that do \nnot have much of a tax base to help them are in desperate need of \nrepair. The legislation that was brought to the floor of the Senate \ndoes, this time, make some significant strides in providing investments \nfor those areas.\n  Let me use some charts that I have shown before to demonstrate why \nthis is an important issue.\n  This is the Marty Indian School in Marty, SD. This picture shows what \nhappens to be some of their plumbing. Take a look at that and ask if \nthat is where you would be proud to send your kids to school--to an old \n70- and 80-year-old building that is in desperate condition with, \neffectively, rubber Band-Aids around their water pipes and sewer pipes.\n  This is another picture of the Marty Indian School; an old rusty \nradiator with crumbling walls. Would we be proud to send our children \ninto those classrooms?\n  I have been to the Ojibwa Indian School many times. This is a picture \nshowing the plywood that separates this building from a caved in \nfoundation, which separates children from danger. Of course, many of \nthe children in Ojibwa go to a series of structures, modular \nstructures, that are kind of like the double-wide mobile homes.\n  This picture shows the fire escape. Note the fire escape is a wooden \nset of stairs. These little children at the Ojibwa school move back and \nforth between all these modular structures, in the middle of the \nwinter, with wind and snow blowing. I have been there. I have seen the \nwiring and other things that lead you to question whether those \nchildren are safe in those schools. We have report after report after \nreport saying this school needs to be rebuilt.\n  Here is a fire escape made of wooden stairs in these modular \nclassrooms. These modular classrooms go inside. Again, they are in \ndesperate need of repair. My point is that we need to do better than \nthis.\n  My two colleagues, who have put this bill together, have made a step \nforward this year in construction money and repair and renovation money \nfor these schools. I say to them, thank you. I hope we can do even more \nin the coming years. But I appreciate the effort we have made this \nyear.\n  I will make another point about Indian education. I want to read \nsomething to my colleagues. The other issue that is so important to me \nis the issue of the Indian tribal colleges around this country. They \nhave been such a blessing to so many people who have been left behind.\n  There are so many people in this country who have been left behind, \nespecially on the Indian reservations, living in poverty, living in \ncommunities with substantial substance abuse, violence that is the kind \nof unspeakable violence that breaks your heart.\n\n  I have talked about a young woman on the floor of the Senate before \nnamed Tamara Demarais. I met her one day. Young little Tamara was 3 \nyears old when she was put in foster care. One person was handling 150 \ncases of these children. So that person, working these cases, put \nlittle Tamara, at age 3, in foster care and did not check closely \nenough the family she was putting this little 3-year-old with.\n  This is what happened to Tamara. At a drunken party, this little 3-\nyear-old girl had her hair torn out by the roots, had her arm broken, \nand her nose broken in a severe beating.\n  How did that happen? Why did that happen to this little girl? Because \nsomebody did not care enough or did not have the time to check to see \nwhether they were putting this little girl in a family who was going to \nbe harmful to her. She went to a foster home and was beaten severely at \nage 3.\n  I met that little girl about 2 years later. I wonder how long it will \ntake her to get over the scars of what happened to her. But it happens \ntoo often--the struggle, the violence, amidst the poverty. How do we \nbreak out from that in these circumstances?\n  I want to tell you a story about tribal colleges. As the Senator from \nWashington will remember, in the full Appropriations committee in the \nSenate, I offered an amendment to add a couple million dollars. I am \npleased to say that this funding stayed in this legislation. These \ntribal colleges are the colleges where those who have kind of been left \nbehind in many cases go back to school. Often the only way they can do \nthat is to have an extended family right on the reservation for child \ncare and for other assistance; and then they can go to school.\n  I have talked before about the woman I met who was the oldest \ngraduate at a tribal college when I gave the graduation speech one day. \nThis is a woman who had been cleaning the toilets in the hallways of \nthe college, a single mother with four children, and no hope and no \nopportunity.\n  She said to herself: I would like to graduate from this college \nsomehow. So as she toiled, cleaning the school at nights, she put \ntogether a plan to try to figure out a way to go to that college and \ngraduate. The day I showed up, she had a cap and gown and a smile on, \nbecause this mother of four, with the help of Pell grants and student \naid and other things, was a college graduate. Imagine, that is what it \ndoes to the lives of these people.\n\n  I will read from a letter of someone who says it better than I could.\n\n       I grew up poor and I was considered backward by non-\n     Indians.\n       My home was a two-room log house in a place called the \n     ``bush'' on North Dakota's Turtle Mountain Indian \n     Reservation.\n       I stuttered. I was painfully shy. My clothes were hand-me-\n     downs. I was like thousands of other Indian kids growing up \n     on reservations across America.\n       When I went to elementary school I felt so alone and so \n     different. I couldn't speak up for myself. My teachers had no \n     appreciation for Indian culture.\n       I'll never forget that it was the lighter-skinned children \n     who were treated better. They were usually from families that \n     were better off than mine.\n       My teachers called me savage.\n       Even as a young child I wondered . . . What does it take to \n     be noticed and looked upon the way these other children are?\n       By the time I reached 7th grade, I realized that if my life \n     was going to change for the better, I was going to have to do \n     it. Nobody else could do it for me.\n       That's when the dream began. I thought of ways to change \n     things for the better--not only for myself but for my people.\n\n[[Page S9817]]\n\n       I dreamed of growing up to be a teacher in a school where \n     every child was treated as sacred and viewed positively, even \n     if they were poor and dirty.\n       I didn't want any child to be made to feel like I did. But \n     I didn't know how hard it would be to reach the realization \n     of my dream. I almost didn't make it.\n       By the time I was 17, I had dropped out of school, moved to \n     California, and had a child.\n       I thought my life was over.\n       But when I moved back to the reservation I made a discovery \n     that literally put my life back together.\n       My sisters were attending Turtle Mountain College, which \n     had just been started on my reservation. I thought that is \n     something I could do, too, so I enrolled.\n       In those days, we didn't even have a campus. There was no \n     building. Some classes met at a local alcohol rehabilitation \n     center in an old hospital building that had been condemned.\n       But to me, it didn't matter much. I was just amazed I could \n     go to college. It was life-changing.\n       My college friends and professors were like family. For the \n     first time in my life I learned about the language, history \n     and culture of my people in a formal education setting. I \n     felt honor and pride begin to well up inside of me.\n       This was so unlike my other school experience where I was \n     told my language and culture were shameful and that Indians \n     weren't equal to others.\n       Attending a tribal college caused me to reach into my inner \n     self to become what I was meant to be--to fight for my rights \n     and not remain a victim of circumstances or of anybody.\n       In fact, I loved college so much that I couldn't stop. I \n     had a dream to fulfill . . . or perhaps some would call it an \n     obsession.\n       This pushed me on to complete my studies at Turtle Mountain \n     College and earn a Doctorate in Education Administration from \n     the University of North Dakota.\n       I've worked in education ever since, from Head Start \n     teacher's aide to college professor.\n       Now I'm realizing my dream of helping Indian children \n     succeed. I am the Office of Indian Education Programs' \n     superintendent working with nine schools, three reservations, \n     and I oversee two educational contracts for two tribal \n     colleges.\n       My life would not have turned out this way were it not for \n     the tribal college on my reservation.\n\n  This is Loretta De Long. Loretta is a good friend of mine, a \nremarkable woman, a remarkable educator. She writes a letter--I have \nnot read all of it, there is another page--but she writes a letter that \ndescribes in such wonderful, vivid detail the struggle and the \ndifficulty to overcome the obstacles early in her life and the role the \ntribal college played in her life.\n  The Turtle Mountain Community College is a wonderful place. I have \nbeen there many times. I have spoken at their commencement. They now \nhave a new campus. They have people going to college there who never \nwould have had a chance to get a college education, but being able to \naccess the extended family on the reservation for child care and a \nrange of other things, there are people getting education at this \ntribal college who would not have had the opportunity before.\n  It is not just this college. It is the Sitting Bull College at Fort \nYates. I was down there recently and helped them dedicate a new \ncultural center. There are so many good tribal colleges that are \nproviding opportunity for people such as Loretta.\n  There are people like Loretta who are going to schools of the type I \ndescribed earlier. They are going to schools with heating registers \nthat look like this. They are going to schools with plumbing that looks \nlike this. That ought not happen. We know better than that. We can do \nbetter than that for these kids. It doesn't matter where you are in \nthis country, when you send a kid through a schoolroom door, you ought \nto believe, as an American, that we want that child to go through the \nbest classroom door in the world; we want that classroom to be one we \nare proud of.\n  I have mentioned before--and if it is repetitive, tough luck--I have \nmentioned before Rosie Two Bears, who, in the third grade at \nCannonball, looked up at me and said: Mr. Senator, are you going to \nbuild us a new school? Boy, do they need it. Rosie Two Bears deserves, \nas every other young child in this country, the opportunity to go to a \nschool we are proud of--we, as Americans, are proud of. She goes to a \nschool right near an Indian reservation, just off the site of the \nreservation, with no tax base at all. It is a public school. We need to \nfix that.\n  The point is, that is sort of a long way of describing almost an \nobsession of mine--that we can't leave people behind in this country. \nThis country is doing well. I am proud of that. But we can't leave \npeople behind. There are some young kids, especially in this country, \nwho are being left behind, going to schools that are not adequate. \nThere are others who will be left behind if we don't continue to \nstrengthen these tribal colleges.\n  A final comment: The amount of money we provide for tribal colleges \nwith this legislation will provide $3,477 per pupil, and that is an \nimprovement.\n  Let me finish by saying I commend the Senator from Washington and the \nSenator from West Virginia and others with whom I have worked. But the \nauthorization is at the $6,000 level. And, frankly, in community \ncolleges around the country--community colleges, not tribal colleges--\nthe average support for students is over $6,000 per student. So we are \nstill well short in tribal colleges of doing what we can to make these \nthe kind of institutions we all know they can be.\n  I conclude by asking unanimous consent that the entire letter of Dr. \nLoretta De Long, from which I quoted, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Turtle Mountain Agency,\n\n\n                                 Turtle Mountain, North Dakota\n\n       Dear Friend of the College Fund, I grew up poor and \n     considered backward by non-Indians.\n       My home was a two-room log house in a place called the \n     ``bush'' on North Dakota's Turtle Mountain Indian \n     Reservation.\n       I stuttered. I was painfully shy. My clothes were hand-me-\n     downs. I was like thousands of other Indian kids growing up \n     on reservations across America.\n       When I want to elementary school I felt so alone and \n     different. I couldn't speak up for myself. My teachers had no \n     appreciation for Indian culture.\n       I'll never forget that it was the lighter-skinned children \n     who were treated better. They were usually from families that \n     were better off than mine.\n       My teachers called me savage.\n       Even as a young child I wondered . . . What does it take to \n     be noticed and looked upon the way these other children are?\n       By the time I reached 7th grade I realized that if my life \n     was going to change for the better, I was going to have to do \n     it. Nobody else could do it for me.\n       That's when the dream began. I thought of ways to change \n     things for the better--not only for myself but for my people.\n       I dreamed of growing up to be a teacher in a school where \n     every child was treated as sacred and viewed positively, \n     even if they were poor and dirty.\n       I didn't want any child to be made to feel like I did. But \n     I didn't know how hard it would be to reach the realization \n     of my dream. I almost didn't make it.\n       By the time I was 17 I had dropped out of school, moved to \n     California, and had a child.\n       I thought my life was over.\n       But when I moved back to the reservation I made a discovery \n     that literally put my life back together.\n       My sisters were attending Turtle Mountain College, which \n     had just been started on my reservation. I thought that was \n     something I could do, too, so I enrolled.\n       In those days, we didn't even have a campus. There was no \n     building. Some classes met at a local alcohol rehabilitation \n     center in an old hospital building that had been condemned.\n       But to me, it didn't matter. I was just amazed I could go \n     to college. It was life-changing.\n       My college friends and professors were like family. For the \n     first time in my life I learned about the language, history \n     and culture of my people in a formal education setting. I \n     felt honor and pride begin to well up inside me.\n       This was so unlike my prior school experience where I was \n     told my language and culture were shameful and that Indians \n     weren't equal to others.\n       Attending a tribal college caused me to reach into my inner \n     self to become what I was meant to be--to fight for my rights \n     and not remain a victim of circumstance or of anybody.\n       In fact, I loved college so much that I couldn't stop! I \n     had a dream to fulfill . . . or perhaps some would call it \n     an obsession.\n       This pushed me on to complete my studies at Turtle Mountain \n     College and to ultimately earn a Doctorate in Education \n     Administration from the University of North Dakota.\n       I've worked in education ever since, from Head Start \n     teacher's aide to college professor.\n       Now I'm realizing my dream of helping Indian children \n     succeed. I am the Office of Indian Education Programs' \n     superintendent working with nine schools, three reservations, \n     and I oversee two educational contracts with two tribal \n     colleges.\n       My life would not have turned out this way were it not for \n     the tribal college on my reservation.\n       My situation is not unique and others feel this way as \n     well. Since 1974, when Turtle Mountain College was chartered \n     by the Turtle Mountain tribe, around 300 students have\n\n[[Page S9818]]\n\n     gone on to earn higher degrees. We now have educators, \n     attorneys, doctors and others who have returned to the \n     reservation. They--I should say, we--are giving back to the \n     community.\n       Instead of asking people to have pity on us because of what \n     happened in our past, we are taking our future into our own \n     hands.\n       Instead of looking for someone else to solve our problems, \n     we are doing it.\n       There's only one thing tribal colleges need.\n       With more funding, the colleges can do even more than \n     they've already achieved. We will take people off the welfare \n     rolls and end the economic depression on reservations. Tribal \n     colleges have already been successful with much less than any \n     other institutions of higher education have received.\n       That is why I hope you will continue to support the \n     American Indian College Fund.\n       I'm an old timer. The College Fund didn't exist when I was \n     a student. I remember seeing ads for the United Negro College \n     Fund and wishing that such a fund existed for Indian people.\n       We now have our own Fund that is spreading the message \n     about tribal colleges and providing scholarships. I'm so \n     pleased. I believe the Creator meant for this to be.\n       But so much more must be done. There still isn't enough \n     scholarship money available to carry students full time.\n       That is my new dream *-*-* to see the day when Indian \n     students can receive four-year scholarships so they don't \n     have to go through the extremely difficult struggle many now \n     experience to get their education.\n       I hope you'll keep giving, keep supporting the College \n     Fund, so that some day this dream becomes reality.\n       I know it can happen because if my dream for my future came \n     true, anything is possible.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                       Loretta De Long, Ed.D.,\n\n                                         Turtle Mountain Chippewa,\n                                     Superintendent for Education.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have a number of other letters from people whose \nstories are just as inspiring, about their lives and the changes in \ntheir lives as a result of being able to access the education \nopportunities at tribal colleges.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield for a question. The Senator from \nIllinois will retain the floor following my presentation.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct.\n  I want to thank the Senator for his compliments and to say what is \nobvious--that his dedication and commitment to his constituents in this \nconnection is both praiseworthy and effective.\n  Earlier in the course of this debate, the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Domenici, was here to speak to the same subject. He and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota made a very good team. Together they persuaded the \nPresident to include this very significant amount of money, both for \nthe construction of new Indian schools and for the repair of those that \ncan appropriately be repaired or remodeled. But as the Senator from New \nMexico pointed out, this is the first major contribution to that. I can \nsay that as long as I am in this position and as long as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota is in his, I know we will keep this in the forefront \nof our consideration. And I tell him that we are going to try to get to \nthe bottom of that priority list as well as to the top of the priority \nlist.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has done a good job in a good cause, \nand this bill takes a major step forward in meeting those priorities.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, may I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might just conclude, I thank the Senator from \nWashington. I should certainly have, at the start of my presentation--\nand I did not--given credit to President Clinton. In his budget \nrequest, the Senator from Washington mentioned he did start a process \nthis year to say we must do better.\n  So also, it seems to me, this administration deserves significant \ncredit for the first steps in what I am sure will be a long journey, \nbut one that we must complete. I thank the Senator from Washington and \nalso the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from North \nDakota and Washington. I appreciate this opportunity to continue \nreading an article from the Chicago Sun-Times dated October 6, 1996. \nThe article is by Tim Novak, Chuck Neubauer, and Dave McKinney, \nheadlined ``Cellini: State Capitol's Quiet Captain of Clout; Dealmaker \nBuilt Empire Working in Background.''\n  As you will understand, if you listen to the articles I am reading, \nwe are ultimately leading up to a tie-in back to the Abraham Lincoln \n$120 million Presidential library in Springfield, IL. The article \nearlier discussed the Ogilvie years--Governor Ogilvie's administration \nin Illinois. And where we last left off was at the beginning of the \nWalker years. Walker was the Governor of Illinois who succeeded Ogilvie \nin the early 1970s.\n  Continuing with the article:\n       With Walker in the governor's office, Cellini was out of a \n     job, never to return to the state payroll. But his ties to \n     state government grew under the Democratic governor.\n       ``He still had all his contacts with IDOT,'' said Joe \n     Falls, a former Downstate GOP leader who ran IDOT's safety \n     programs under Cellini.\n       ``Walker and all his people still needed his help and Bill \n     cooperated,'' Falls said. ``He had friends on both sides, but \n     when it came down to an election, he was always a \n     Republican.''\n       Cellini became executive director of the Illinois Asphalt \n     Pavement Association, representing virtually all state road \n     builders, many engineering firms and other companies that \n     build and repair state roads. And he still runs the \n     association, serving as executive vice president.\n       It's an association that has been quite beneficial for the \n     road builders and Cellini, although his salary was a modest \n     $49,140, according to the group's 1990 income tax returns.\n       Under Cellini's leadership, the association members have \n     donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to governors and \n     other state officials over the years. Edgar has received at \n     least $375,000 from the association's members over the past \n     30 months. And the association's political action committee, \n     the Good Government Council, has given more than $100,000 to \n     other state officials.\n       ``He and the asphalt pavers continued to play the same \n     games as always but with a Democratic administration,'' a \n     longtime Republican official said.\n       ``The key to the asphalt pavers is that they get contracts \n     for their work on a predictable basis,'' the official said. \n     ``The business continued to flow and the campaign \n     contributions flowed to the Democratic governor, just like \n     the Republican governor.''\n       While heading the asphalt association, Cellini developed \n     his reputation as a national transportation authority while \n     expanding his political power.\n       Soon after Cellini left the state payroll, President \n     Richard M. Nixon appointed him to the National Highway \n     Advisory Committee.\n       Cellini found the federal post was advantageous, personally \n     and politically. When his four-year term was set to expire in \n     March, 1976, Cellini lobbied President Gerald Ford for an \n     appoint to the National Transportation Policy Study \n     Commission.\n       ``The commission has been perfect for my simultaneously \n     covering political meetings in D.C. and around the country, \n     while keeping up with my profession in transportation and \n     public works,'' Cellini wrote in a letter to Ford's personnel \n     director Douglas Bennett on March 11, 1976.\n       ``Of course, I'm counting that my serving as President Ford \n     Committee's Downstate Coordinator for Illinois won't be a \n     disadvantage,'' he added in the letter obtained from the Ford \n     Library.\n       Cellini got the appointment. He also was chosen to give a \n     speech seconding Ford's renomination at the 1976 Republican \n     convention.\n       ``They were looking for somebody with an ethnic connection, \n     and (Ogilvie) probably recommended him,'' said Falls, who ran \n     Ford's Illinois campaign.\n       Cellini was widely hailed for helping Ford win Illinois, \n     although he lost the election to Jimmy Carter, one of the few \n     times a presidential candidate won Illinois, but lost the \n     White House.\n       As Cellini was expanding his power, he got into real estate \n     development and management using the name New Frontier. The \n     company specialized in building and managing apartments, \n     usually with state financing, for senior citizens. The firm \n     later branched into office buildings that were leased to the \n     state.\n       In the waning days of the Walker administration, New \n     Frontier got its first state deal when Cellini secured $5.4 \n     million in state funds to build a 212-unit building near the \n     state Capitol. The building includes offices for the asphalt \n     pavement association and Cellini's companies, including New \n     Frontier.\n       It was the first of several real estate deals New Frontier \n     would get from state government.\n\n\n                           the thompson years\n\n       Cellini turned state government into a cottage industry \n     after the Republicans regained the governor's office with the \n     election of James R. Thompson in 1976.\n       Cellini averaged more than a deal a year with the state \n     before Thompson stepped down after 14 years in office. And \n     state officials say they were probably others that no one was \n     aware of.\n       Cellini's personal income soared in the early Thompson \n     years. Cellini's taxable income was $185,558 in 1978, and it \n     nearly doubled to $368,100 in 1979, according to records\n\n[[Page S9819]]\n\n     he filed in federal tax court. He had no taxable income in \n     1980, $27,539 in 1981 and $252,349 in 1982.\n       Cellini's use of tax shelters created problems with the \n     IRS, which ordered him to pay $78,120 in back taxes for some \n     of those years, according to tax court records filed in 1992.\n       New Frontier--the company Cellini started shortly before \n     Thompson took office--and its owners were worth $30 million \n     when Thompson left office, according to a biography New \n     Frontier used to attract clients in 1990.\n       Under Thompson, Cellini and New Frontier built nine \n     apartment buildings in Chicago, the suburbs and Downstate \n     with an additional $84.1 million in loans from the state \n     housing authority, whose chairman A.D. Van Meter is a close \n     friend of Cellini.\n       New Frontier also became one of the state's biggest \n     landlords in Springfield, providing offices for several \n     agencies such as Corrections, Public Aid and IDOT, the agency \n     Cellini started.\n       Sometimes the state agreed to move into the buildings \n     before New Frontier bought them. Sometimes the State hired \n     New Frontier to erect buildings and lease them to the state, \n     all without competitive bids, which Illinois does not require \n     for its real estate transactions.\n       When New Frontier was chosen to build and lease a building \n     for IDOT, Cellini already had an option to purchase the land.\n       Cellini has sold all of those buildings, but New Frontier \n     still manages them.\n       And Cellini created new companies to get other deals under \n     Thompson.\n       The President Lincoln Hotel Corp. got a $15 million loan \n     from Thompson and state treasurer Jerry Consentino, a \n     Democrat, so Cellini could build a luxury hotel in \n     Springfield, a long-time dream that no one else would \n     finance.\n       Cellini's dream has turned into a nightmare. Before \n     Thompson and Cosentino left office, they renegotiated the \n     loan twice lowering the interest rate to 6 percent from 12.5 \n     percent to keep Cellini from defaulting. The current \n     agreement prevents the state from foreclosing on the hotel \n     until 1999, while Cellini can skip quarterly mortgage \n     payments when the hotel operates at a loss.\n       The deal has caused a political backlash for Cellini.\n       State Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka cut a deal last year to \n     let Cellini's hotel and another state-financed hotel in \n     Downstate Collinsville pay $10 million to settle their debts \n     which totaled $40.3 million. Attorney General Jim Ryan \n     squashed the deal, arguing the hotels were worth more than \n     $10 million.\n       Cellini and the Collinsville hotel owners, who include \n     politically connected developer Gary Fears, sued, arguing \n     that Ryan had no authority to cancel their deal with Topinka. \n     The pending suit was brought by Winston & Strawn, the \n     powerful law firm where Thompson now works.\n       Cellini's hotel plays a prominent role in his empire. When \n     road builders come to bid for state contracts, many of them \n     stay in the hotel resplendent with Italian marble, cherry \n     wood and special shower rods that were invented and patented \n     by Cellini--designed to keep the shower curtain from sticking \n     to the backside of his guests.\n       The hotel is also the place where Cellini throws fund-\n     raisers, like the bash he threw for Edgar the day after \n     Topinka agreed to settle the hotel loan.\n       Cellini had made a lot of deals, but he hit the jackpot \n     when he and a new group of partners got a riverboat casino \n     license from the state two months before Thompson left \n     office. Cellini's Alton Belle was the state's first floating \n     casino when it opened a few months after Edgar took office in \n     1991.\n       Within two years, Cellini's group issued public stock in \n     their casino company, Argosy Gaming, a deal that immediately \n     netted Cellini $4.9 million and left him as one of the \n     largest stockholders whose stock was worth $50 million. Since \n     then, the stock's value has fallen and Cellini has sold off \n     some shares. His family's remaining stock was worth $12 \n     million last Wednesday.\n       ``Right now the way Bill makes his money is by ownership of \n     that boat,'' said a former state official, who asked not to \n     be identified. ``It's questionable if . . . he needs to do \n     any of these other deals. It's thought that he's hooked on \n     deals. He just can't resist making deals.''\n       And while most of those deals came under Thompson, the \n     former governor told the Sun-Times in 1990 that he had \n     nothing to do with Cellini's influence.\n       ``He was on the political scene when I became governor,'' \n     Thompson said. ``He'll be on the political scene when I \n     leave.''\n\n\n                            the edgar years\n\n       Cellini has remained close to the governor's office, \n     although his deals have slowed since Edgar replaced Thompson \n     in 1991.\n       Cellini has been an important source of campaign \n     contributions for Edgar, who spent $10.8 million to win re-\n     election in 1994.\n       Two of Cellini's family members have positions in the Edgar \n     administration: sister Janis as patronage director, and wife \n     Julie, who has continued as chairman of the Illinois Historic \n     Preservation Agency, an unpaid position she got from \n     Thompson.\n\n  As we will recall, the Illinois historic preservation agency, which I \nbelieve Mrs. Cellini still runs or is in charge of, will probably be in \ncharge of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield.\n\n       New Frontier is constructing an addition to a building \n     occupied by the state Environmental Protection Agency. New \n     Frontier was hired to build the addition by the three \n     businessmen who own the Springfield building. New Frontier \n     has managed the building for the past 10 years. The state \n     will pay $75 million to rent the complex that it will own at \n     the end of the 20-year deal.\n       Cellini lobbies for several major clients, including \n     Chicago HMO. The state paid Chicago HMO $155 million last \n     year to provide health care for 75 percent of the 180,000 \n     welfare recipients who are in managed care programs. Those \n     numbers are likely to grow as Edgar pushes more welfare \n     recipients into managed care.\n       With these vast business deals, Cellini's wealth has \n     soared. In addition to his Argosy Gaming stock, his family \n     has a stock portfolio worth at least $2.26 million. They own \n     108 stocks that are each worth at least $20,000 and 20 other \n     stocks each worth at least $5,000, according to an ethics \n     statement his wife filed earlier this year.\n       And the family earned at least $165,000 in capital gains \n     last year from the sale of stocks they owned in 33 companies, \n     according to the ethics statement.\n       Cellini remains in regular contact with Edgar's chiefs of \n     staff, said Dillard, who had the job for three years.\n       ``When I was the governor's chief of staff, Bill and I \n     talked but it wasn't nearly as often as people imagined . . . \n     a couple times a month,'' Dillard said. ``It could be (about) \n     upcoming political races or just rumors he would pick up.\n       ``One of the things that makes Bill Cellini a trusted \n     adviser is the longevity and breadth of his experience in \n     state government,'' Dillard said.\n       ``Bill Cellini personally cares in a friendship type of \n     fashion . . . about governors Thompson and Edgar,'' Dillard \n     said. ``He's very different . . . from many of the other \n     individuals who tangentially profit from government.''\n       Edgar's staff has consistently tried to downplay Cellini's \n     clout, but the governor admits he has a close relationship \n     with Cellini.\n       ``Bill Cellini has been a friend of mine,'' Edgar said. \n     ``We were both here in the '60s. I was starting out in the \n     Legislature and he was in the Ogilvie administration. I've \n     known him a long time.\n       ``We don't socialize much, but we have over the years done \n     things. . . . Our daughters were about the same age,'' Edgar \n     said. ``If there's some issue he's got or some political \n     thing coming up, we might talk about it. But we don't see \n     each other that much.''\n       Cellini's clout is greatly exaggerated, Edgar insisted, the \n     product of stories such as this.\n       ``It's something you in the media have kind of continued to \n     perpetuate that aura about Bill Cellini.''\n  There is another article on this same issue that came out a few years \nearlier. I would like to share that with the Senators who are here and \nthe people in the galleries.\n  Continuing along on the history of what has transpired in State \ngovernment in Springfield over the years, all leading up to why I am \nconcerned that we have to make sure this $120 million building project \nin Springfield is competitively bid according to the strict guidelines \nso that no taxpayer money goes off on insider dealing in Springfield, \nthis article appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times of Thursday October 11, \n1990. It is written by Mark Brown and Chuck Neubauer. The title of the \narticle is ``Influence Peddler Turns Clout To Cash.''\n\n       As lobbyist, landlord developer, hotel operator and all-\n     purpose influence peddler, William F. Cellini has become a \n     legend in Springfield for his prolific ability to cash in on \n     State government. A budding political and business force when \n     Governor Thompson was elected in 1976, this son of a police \n     officer is now regarded by many as the State's most \n     influential Republican not holding elective office. Much of \n     that reputation is based on the goodies he has culled from \n     the Thompson administration--six major State office leases, \n     plus State financing for eight apartment projects, one office \n     building, and a luxury hotel.\n       Like all legends, it often is difficult to sort fact from \n     fiction where Cellini is concerned. For every business deal \n     that can be traced to him, there are always two more in which \n     he was rumored to be involved but left no fingerprints.\n       Cellini, 55, tends to add to the mystery, rarely talking to \n     reporters. He did not answer Chicago Sun-Times requests for \n     an interview for this story.\n       Although he served as the state's first transportation \n     secretary, under Gov. Richard B. Ogilvie, his only official \n     positions these days are with the Sangamon County Republican \n     organization.\n       While acknowledging Cellini's influence, Thompson denied \n     that it stems from him.\n       ``He probably know more people in state government than I \n     do,'' Thompson said.'' . . . He was on the political scene \n     when I became governor. He'll be on the political scene when \n     I leave. He doesn't need me to front for him.\n       Thompson said he speaks to Cellini no more than once a \n     year. But they have communicated in other ways.\n       In one 12-month period encompassing his 1986 re-election \n     campaign, Thompson reported using $765 in campaign funds to \n     buy\n\n[[Page S9820]]\n\n     five antiques as gifts for Cellini and his wife. Thompson \n     sent gifts for Christmas and as thank-yous for fund-raisers \n     hosted by the Cellinis. The governor even remembered their \n     anniversary.\n       Although Cellini's personal political donations to Thompson \n     are not especially large, he is known for his ability to \n     raise money from others.\n       ``He's been very helpful,'' Thompson said.\n       One source of Cellini's clout is his role as executive vice \n     president of the Illinois Asphalt Pavement Association, a \n     trade group of road builders who have fared well under \n     Thompson's policies. Their combined fund-raising prowess is \n     considerable.\n       Cellini also gets paid to protect the interests of three \n     other groups, the Illinois Association of Sanitary Districts, \n     Illinois Concrete pipe Association and Prestressed Precast \n     Producers of Illinois.\n       His primary business, however, is the New Frontier Group, a \n     diversified, Chicago-based real estate organization that was \n     less than two years old when Thompson was elected. It now \n     boasts that it has developed more than 1.3 million square \n     feet of office space and 2,550 housing units.\n       Much of that growth is attributable to Cellini's adept use \n     of government programs.\n       With $55 million in low-interest financing from the \n     Illinois Housing Development Authority, a quasi-state agency \n     under Thompson's control, New Frontier Developments Co. has \n     built eight government-subsidized apartment projects since \n     1976.\n       Cellini's New Frontier Management Co. serves as the \n     management agent not only for his own properties but for many \n     other Chicago-area apartment buildings.\n       Cellini and New Frontier also emerged under Thompson as the \n     state's favorite Springfield landlord.\n       His first major office deal was in 1979, when Cellini \n     bought an abandoned seminary and leased it to the state for a \n     Corrections Department headquarters and training school.\n       The controversial arrangement was typical of many of the \n     Cellini deals that followed because state officials strayed \n     from normal procedures to his apparent benefit.\n       Corrections officials were in such a hurry to get the \n     seminary property that they passed up an opportunity to buy \n     it outright and instead entered into a lease-purchase \n     agreement with Cellini. They said it enabled them to move in \n     more quickly than if they had to go through the usual \n     purchase process.\n       The lease-purchase would have allowed the state to buy the \n     facility any time over the term of the lease--at a generally \n     escalating price. Eleven years later, though, the state still \n     is renting.\n       Cellini, who had paid $3.6 million for the property and \n     spent at least $4.2 million remodeling it, collected $9.5 \n     million in rent from the state before selling to a Virginia \n     company in 1987 for $9.1 million.\n       Cellini proved to be in the right place at the right time \n     for many similar opportunities, renting space to the Public \n     Aid, Transportation and Commerce and Community Affairs \n     departments.\n       In the cases of Public Aid and Transportation, Cellini's \n     company was hired to construct buildings and lease them back \n     to the state, bypassing the state Capital Development Board, \n     which usually constructs state buildings on a competitively \n     bid basis.\n       When Transportation Department officials got around to \n     announcing the site that they insisted on having for their \n     new building, it turned out that Cellini already had an \n     option on the land.\n       Even when Cellini began selling his buildings, at a tidy \n     profit, his company was kept on by the new owner to manage \n     them. The 20-year management agreements have a special \n     termination clause that calls for a $1.1 million fee to be \n     paid to Cellini's company if the new owner replaces it.\n       The most prominent symbol of Cellini's political influence \n     is the Springfield Ramada Renaissance, a luxury hotel that he \n     long had sought to build but couldn't get financed until \n     Thompson and state Treasurer Jerry Cosentino approved a $15 \n     million state loan in 1982.\n       The hotel has been a financial embarrassment for the state, \n     which has twice renegotiated the loan to avoid a default.\n  That article ended by discussing a Renaissance Springfield Hotel \nwhich, and we have heard, Mr. Cellini was instrumental in getting a \nState loan to construct a hotel. We also reviewed earlier that Federal \nfunds were involved in building that hotel, and we went through and \nrealized that hotel has not paid back that $15 million loan--at least \nnot as far as we know.\n  The proposed Lincoln Library site is going to be right near that \nhotel.\n  I turn from the hotel issue to discussing how the State awarded \nriverboat gaming licenses. The State, back in the beginning and the \nlate 1980s, and I think finally in 1990, created 10 riverboat licenses. \nThe State statute was fairly specific with respect to where many of \nthese riverboat licenses had to be. It later turned out that in most \ncases, only a couple of people applied for the riverboat licenses and \nthese licenses wound up being very lucrative. In fact, they ended up \nbeing phenomenally lucrative licenses. Again, on the riverboat \nlicensing, as was mentioned in that article, Mr. Cellini was involved \nin the Alton Riverboat, the gaming company boat we have talked about.\n  I will proceed to discuss how those licenses were handed out.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I yield only for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I noticed the Senator earlier had yielded to Senators \nwith an understanding, a unanimous consent agreement that he would not \nsurrender the floor. I ask for the same opportunity to speak, with the \nunanimous consent request that the floor will be returned to my \ncolleague from Illinois after the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I would be happy to accommodate my colleague. I am \ntold that similar requests are pending from Senator Graham of Florida, \nSenator John McCain, and then you? If we could work out an agreement, I \nwould not like to bypass those who have shown up earlier. Are either of \nthose Senators on the floor or the Cloakroom?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not believe either of those Senators are on the \nfloor. I believe my statement will take no more than 10 minutes. With \nthe forbearance of the Senator, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for 10 minutes, and that at the conclusion of my remarks the \nfloor be returned to my colleague from the State of Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I am going to object to that. I am told the leader is \non his way and he is going to be making a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Illinois \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has the floor, but I would like to propound a \nunanimous consent request that we go into a quorum call for the purpose \nof the leader coming to the floor, and when the majority leader \ncompletes his statement, the floor return to the Senator from Illinois \nand that he not be charged with a second speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes, I agree to that. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Interior appropriations conference \nreport obviously is a very important bill. There has been an awful lot \nof work that has gone into it. It does have bipartisan support. As I \nunderstand it, it is positioned to be signed into law. It passed the \nHouse 349-69, something of that nature.\n  The Senator from Illinois has some difficulties with a provision in \nthis legislation. Certainly, as any Senator, he is entitled to make his \npoint, and to make his point at length within the provisions of our \nrules. It is important we move forward now. We are prepared to move \nforward on this legislation.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk to the \npending Interior appropriations conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provision of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 4578, the Department of Interior \n     appropriations bill:\n         Trent Lott; Ted Stevens; Larry Craig; Pat Roberts; Jim \n           Inhofe; Mike DeWine; John Warner; Pete Domenici; R.F. \n           Bennett; Richard Shelby; Kit Bond; Slade Gorton; Phil \n           Gramm; Conrad Burns; Chuck Hagel; and Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will continue to work with Senator \nFitzgerald and others to try to resolve this issue as best we can and \nany other problems that may exist. I do believe it is necessary to \nprepare the Senate for a cloture vote if it should be necessary.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII \nbe waived.\n\n[[Page S9821]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9821-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9821-S9823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 641, S. 662.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4386), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. LOTT. I note, Mr. President, that this is the breast and cervical \ncancer legislation. It has broad bipartisan support. I am very pleased \nwe were able to\n\n[[Page S9822]]\n\ncome to an agreement to bring it this far. It came up this morning in \nthe Finance Committee. I asked the Senator from New York if he would \nhelp us get it cleared through to this point. Senator Moynihan \nindicated he would, and he has done so, as always. I do not think we \nwould have this clearance without his help.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I have one moment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield the floor to Senator \nMoynihan.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we all thank the majority leader for \nthis action. I know it will be particularly pleasing to the chairman of \nour committee, Senator Roth, who took up this measure, introduced in \nthe first instance by Senator Chafee. It came out of our committee \nunanimously. It is good legislation. It should be pursued. We thank the \nleader for his effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that S. 662 be placed back on the \ncalendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to commend the \nSenate's passage of S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment \nAct. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important legislation, \nwhich provides low-income, uninsured women with access to the treatment \nthey need to battle these two potentially devastating diseases.\n  In 1990, Congress created a program, administered by the Centers for \nDisease Control, CDC, to provide breast and cervical cancer screening \nfor low-income, uninsured women. While this program's goal was to \nreduce mortality rates from these two diseases, the fact many women \ndiagnosed under the program had no funds for treatment left our goal \nlargely unfulfilled.\n  The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act moves this Federal \ncommitment forward to the next logical step, by providing Medicaid \nfunds to treat these women who are diagnosed with breast or cervical \ncancer through the CDC screening program. Under this important \nlegislation, American women will be able to receive the treatment they \nneed to win the fight against breast cancer or cervical cancer.\n  As we are in the waning days of this legislative session, I am glad \nto join my Senate colleagues in passing the Breast and Cervical Cancer \nTreatment Act, which will provide new resources and hope to low-income \nwomen with breast or cervical cancer. As the House has already passed a \nsimilar bill, it is my hope that Congress will present final \nlegislation to the President for enactment this year.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my unwavering \nsupport for passage of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act (S. \n662). This bill addresses an issue that is vital to the health and \nlives of so many low-income women--coverage of breast and cervical \ncancer treatment under the Medicaid program.\n  This legislation was originally introduced by our late colleague, \nSenator John Chafee of Rhode Island. Senator Chafee was always one of \nthe Senate's leaders on health care issues, and like all of my \ncolleagues, I am sad that he is not with us today to see his bill pass \nthe Senate. I know that he would be pleased to know that his bill now \nhas the support of 75 Senators.\n  I also want to take a moment to note the dedication of my colleagues \nSenators Mikulski, Linc Chafee, Grassley, and Hatch--we have put many \nhours into ensuring that today's legislation gets through the Senate \nand can be reconciled quickly with the House version. Finally, this \nbill would not be before us today if not for the help of the Chairman \nof the Senate Finance Committee--it was Senator Roth who made a \ncommitment to get this bill through the Finance Committee.\n  In 1990, while serving in the House, I was a proud cosponsor of the \nlegislation that established the Center for Disease Control's National \nBreast and Cervical Early Detection Program. This groundbreaking \nprogram--sponsored in the Senate by Senator Mikulski--ensures that \nwomen who are medically underserved in this country receive regular \nscreening for breast and cervical cancer. Since the program did its \nvery first screening in 1991, over 1.4 million women have had either a \nmammogram or a test for cervical cancer. And more are screened every \nsingle day.\n  It is unquestionable that early detection is our best weapon against \ncancer. The success of the CDC program is proven. As a result of this \nprogram over 6,800 uninsured, low-income women across the country now \nknow they have breast cancer and can take action to fight this disease. \nAnd over 34,000 uninsured, low-income women across the country now know \nthey have either invasive cervical cancer or pre-cancerous cervical \nlesions.\n  In my home state of Maine, nearly 16,000 women have gone through the \nscreening program since it began in 1995. And as a result of this \nscreening 46 women with breast cancer and 23 women with cervical cancer \nhave vital information that they might not have had otherwise. I don't \nlike to think of what could have happened if they had found out about \ntheir cancer when it was too late.\n  Unfortunately, screening alone--and the life-or-death knowledge about \none's health that comes as a result--cannot save a woman's life. It is \nestimated that breast and cervical cancer will kill more than half a \nmillion women this decade alone. In fact, breast cancer is the number \none killer of American women between the ages of 35 and 54. While \nscreening is the first line of defense in fighting cancer, and is so \nvery, very important, it is really only the first part of the battle.\n  When the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program \npassed in 1990, we wanted to ensure that women would receive treatment. \nThe law was written to require states to seek out services for the \nwomen they screen in order to receive timely and appropriate treatment. \nBut the state programs are overwhelmed. Program administrators are \nscrambling to find treatment services--and even then these uninsured, \nlow-income women must somehow come up the money for costly procedures.\n  This legislation will give women who have been screened through the \nCDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program the \nchance to receive needed treatment that is truly life-and-death. This \nAct will allow states the option of providing Medicaid services to \nwomen who have breast or cervical cancer.\n  I would like to explain to my colleagues why this legislation is so \nimportant in a very personal way. One of my constituents went through \nthe Maine Breast and Cervical Health Program and had an abnormal \nmammogram, followed by an abnormal ultrasound. She was advised to have \na sterotactic biopsy but delayed for three months because she could not \nafford it. Three months in which her cancer could grow and spread. And \nwhile she eventually had the biopsy and was not diagnosed with cancer, \nthese three months could have truly meant the difference between \nwinning or losing her battle against cancer.\n  The women who go through this program have undergone enough solely by \nbeing diagnosed with cancer. And the stress of diagnosis is almost \ndebilitating. But to compound this stress, to leave a woman with the \nknowledge that she has cancer, that she must--absolutely must-- receive \ntreatment or her cancer will spread, but to not help her find the means \nto fight for her life is unconscionable.\n  We cannot sit back and claim that a screening program is enough to \nsave a woman's life. We know that the uninsured are 49 percent more \nlikely to die than are insured women during the four to seven years \nfollowing an initial breast cancer diagnosis. This is unconscionable--\nwe must provide an option for uninsured women who are not able to pay \nfor treatment on their own. We cannot sit back and watch women die from \na disease that they discovered through our program but not help them \nfight this disease.\n  I am extremely pleased that the Senate is bringing the bill up for \npassage today; the House overwhelmingly passed its version on May 9th \nand I hope that the two bills will be reconciled quickly in conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senate \npassage of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act S. 662. I am \nproud to be the lead Democratic sponsor of this\n\n[[Page S9823]]\n\nbill. This is legislation that will help save lives, and it has the \nstrong bipartisan support of 76 cosponsors. It gives states the option \nof providing Medicaid coverage to low-income women diagnosed with \nbreast and cervical cancer through the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection Program under the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, CDC.\n  Senate passage of this legislation was a true bipartisan team effort, \nand I want to recognize the other members of this team. I want to \ncommend the late Senator John Chafee, who sponsored this legislation, \nfor his leadership and genuine commitment to the women this bill would \nhelp. I want to thank Senators Lincoln Chafee, Moynihan, Snowe, \nGrassley, and Hatch for their strong support and leadership as we have \nall worked together to move this legislation through the Senate. I \nthank the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader for their \ncommitment to getting this bill through the Senate.\n  I also want to commend Senator Roth for his leadership in the Finance \nCommittee to ensure committee consideration and passage of this bill. \nThank you also to President Clinton and Vice President Gore who have \nbeen supportive of providing treatment to women diagnosed with breast \nand cervical cancer through the CDC screening program, especially by \nincluding a provision similar to S. 662 in the Administration's Fiscal \nYear 2001 budget.\n  Finally, none of us would be here today to celebrate Senate passage \nof this bill without the hard work, tenacity, persistence, and \nperseverance of Fran Visco and the National Breast Cancer Coalition. \nThey have done an outstanding job of making sure that women's voices \nfrom across the country were heard, listened to, and well represented.\n  However, our work is not yet finished. The House of Representatives \nmust now take up and pass the bill we passed today. The House should \nmove swiftly to enact this legislation that has such overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  The CDC screening program celebrated its 10th anniversary on August \n10, 2000. The CDC screening program has provided over one million \nmammograms and over one million Pap tests. Among the women screened, \nover 7,000 cases of breast cancer and over 600 cases of cervical cancer \nhave been diagnosed. I am proud to be the Senate architect of the \nlegislation that created the breast and cervical cancer screening \nprogram at the CDC, and now I'm fighting to complete the program by \nadding a treatment component. There are three reasons why we must \nswiftly enact the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act.\n  First, times have changed since the creation of the CDC screening \nprogram ten years ago. In 1990, when I wanted to include a treatment \ncomponent in the screening program, I was told we didn't have the \nmoney. Well, now we are running annual surpluses, instead of annual \ndeficits. The screening program was just a down payment, not the only \npayment. We have the resources to provide treatment to these women. I \nthink we ought to put our money into saving lives.\n  Second, prevention, screening, and early detection are very \nimportant, but alone they do not stop deaths. Screening must be \ncombined with treatment to reduce cancer mortality. Finally, it is only \nright to provide federal resources to treat breast and cervical cancer \nfor those screened and diagnosed with these cancers through a federal \nscreening program.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure swift enactment of the Breast and Cervical Cancer \nTreatment Act in the final days of this session. Women diagnosed with \nbreast and cervical cancer shouldn't have to wait another year for \ntreatment. I can't think of any better way to mark the 10th anniversary \nof the CDC screening program than by finally adding a federal treatment \ncomponent to ensure that we make a true difference in the lives of \nwomen across this country.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed \nlegislation that will dramatically improve the lives of lower-income \nwomen faced with a terrifying diagnosis of breast or cervical cancer.\n  Ten years ago, Congress created the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection Program, through the Centers for Disease \nControl, to help lower-income women receive the early detection \nservices that are the best protection against breast and cervical \ncancer. This important program has served more than a million women in \nsubsequent years. However, the screening program does not include a \ntreatment component. Instead, women who receive a cancer diagnosis must \nrely on informal networks of donated care.\n  Last year, Senator John Chafee introduced S. 662, the Breast and \nCervical Cancer Treatment Act, to make it easier for women facing \nbreast and cervical cancer to receive necessary treatment--and I think \neach and every one of us shares that important goal.\n  S. 662 makes treatment available through the Medicaid program. Now, \nmaybe some of us would have approached the problem differently. I think \nthere are very valid concerns about creating disease-specific \neligibility categories within the Medicaid program.\n  However, despite those concerns, I am pleased that the Senate passed \nS. 662 because we are dealing with a thoroughly unique set of \ncircumstances. The new Medicaid eligibility category created in S. 662 \nis specifically linked to a unique and existing federal screening \nprogram and must not, and will not, be viewed as a precedent for \nextending Medicaid eligibility body-part by body-part.\n  Instead, today the Senate fulfills a promise made nearly 10 years \nago. We are saying to lower-income, uninsured women that we will \ncontinue to help you access the preventive health care services you \nneed. But now, through S. 662, our commitment to you will not stop with \nscreening. If problems are found, the federal government stands ready \nto work with the states to make sure you receive the treatment you need \nto get well.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues in the Senate for joining me in \nsupporting this important legislation, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in the House to quickly reconcile the differences \nbetween our bills so we can see this necessary legislation signed into \nlaw this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9823-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9823-S9824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 4986\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding \nrule XXII, that the Senate turn to the consideration of Calendar No. \n817, H.R. 4986, relating to foreign sales corporations, and that \nfollowing the reporting of the bill by the clerk, the committee \namendments be agreed to, with no other amendments or motions in order, \nand the bill be immediately advanced to third reading and passage \noccur, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, who would be \nSenators Roth, Lott, and Moynihan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have been doing \neverything we can to move along the appropriations process. We did that \non the energy and water appropriations bill. We are doing that on the \nInterior appropriations bill. I want the Record to be clear, as the \nleader knows, we are not holding up the Interior bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely. We had some reservations on both sides of the \naisle last night. The reservations on Senator Reid's side of the aisle \nwere worked out. The problem now is, as I stated, that Senator \nFitzgerald has a problem. The Senator from Nevada has worked on his \npart of the problem on which, by the way, I agreed with him. I believe \nwe have gotten the language we need, so it is not necessary for that \nobjection to be filed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I further say under my reservation, we are \nalso standing by ready to work on Transportation and hopefully \nAgriculture. It would be very nice if we could complete this work which \nis, as the leader knows, overdue.\n  The point is, I want the Record spread with the simple fact that I am \ngoing to object to Calendar No. 817. It is an unusual thing we have to \nobject.\n\n[[Page S9824]]\n\n We want to move things along as quickly as possible, as indicated by \nthe statement I just made. But as to H.R. 4986, I object. I say to the \nleader, there are people who are looking at this, and we hope it can be \ncleared at an early date.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may comment, as Senator Reid mentioned, \nwe hope to move to the Transportation and Agriculture appropriations \nconference reports. I had hoped one or both of those would be ready \ntoday. I believe they are both close to completion. In fact, I am sure \nthe Transportation appropriations conference report is completed, and \nwe should have it, hopefully, early in the morning. Agriculture has \nbeen more difficult for obvious reasons: Getting an exact reliable \nnumber on what is needed for disasters, but also dealing with issues \nsuch as the drug reimportation question and the sanctions issue. They \nare going to attempt to close that conference this afternoon. We hope \nto have a vote and be ready for action on tomorrow.\n  With regard to this particular bill, the foreign sales corporation, I \nunderstand there are some reservations, but hopefully we can find a way \nto consider it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not believe I have the floor, I say to the Senator, \nbut I am sure that Senator Reid would yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend from New York who is so \ninterested in this legislation, and who has talked to me about it so \nmany times.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. You say ``reservations.'' Sir, if there are any \nreservations about the legislation as such, I would hope they would \nbring them to the attention of Senator Roth, myself, and others, and \nthe administration.\n  This is absolutely must do legislation. If we do not do it, we put \nourselves at risk of a probable certain outcome--a trade war with \nEurope. In fact, it would astonish us and injure us, and we will wonder \nwhat happened. And nothing need have happened.\n  It was found that our tax arrangements for foreign sales corporations \nwere in violation of WTO rules. Fine. We said we will produce a \ndifferent measure that is compliant. The American industry is very \nhappy. We have the bill. All we need to do is pass it. The deadline was \nOctober 1. It has been extended to November 1. If we do not do this, we \nwill be remembered as a Congress that did not, and not favorably, sir.\n  I thank you for bringing it up. I regret there are reservations, but \nthey have nothing to do, that I know of, with the essence of this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, I think the statement that the \nSenator has made should be within earshot of everyone. If there is a \nproblem--and somewhat technical in the minds of some--they should come \nforward.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I will stay here all afternoon and evening.\n  Mr. REID. I am sure the Senator can explain it well. So I invite \nSenators to do that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to make clear, if there is a technical \namendment, or if there is a germane amendment, we could certainly get \nan agreement to make that in order.\n  What bothers me is that earlier on there had been indications that \nthere were unrelated amendments that would ball the Senate up and this \nbill into protracted debate. What bothers me even more is, as we get \ncloser, hopefully, to the end of the session, the thinking, I guess, \nwould be, well, we will just drop this into something. The opportunity \nfor mischief at that point is endless because if one Senator shows up \nand objects, we could lose it.\n  So I know Senator Reid will be working on this. But this is something \nthat is important to our country. I assume that the White House also \nwould like to get this done. We need to continue to focus very closely \non this piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9824-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 4868\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would hope that my colleagues who \nhave raised an objection to the Senate taking up this legislation would \nreconsider. This is a very important piece of legislation. It is the \nreauthorization of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.\n  Senator Bingaman, who is the ranking member of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and myself, as chairman, have worked closely to \ncome together with this compromise legislation. We have worked with the \nadministration.\n  It is my understanding that the administration supports this \nlegislation, and for good reason: Because the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act, initially passed in 1975, deals with issues at hand, \nissues that are affecting the energy supply in this country, issues \nthat are affecting the price of energy in this country; and issues that \nthe administration has mandated pass the Congress of the United States, \nspecifically, this body because these issues deal with the domestic oil \nsupply and conservation and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the \nInternational Energy Program, or IEP, as the agreement stands.\n  Certain authorities for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, and \nU.S. participation in the International Energy Program expired in March \nof this year. The legislation before us would extend these \nauthorizations through September 30, 2003.\n  I think it is rather ironic that we are out of compliance in the \nsense of having both these significant issues expire at a time when we \nhave an energy crisis and we have not acted upon them.\n  I would like to point out several facts about the legislation before \nus and the need for that legislation.\n  We have seen a lot of publicity given to the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve and the emphasis put on the significance of that as kind of a \nsavings account for oil in case we have an interruption from our supply \nfrom overseas, a supply which currently is about 58 percent of our \ntotal consumption.\n  Title I of EPCA provided for the creation of SPR, the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, and set forth the method and circumstances for its \ndrawdown and distribution in the event of a severe energy supply \ninterruption or to fulfill U.S. obligations under the IEP agreement.\n  The SPR currently contains approximately 570 million barrels of oil \nand has a total capacity of about 700 million barrels, with a daily \ndrawdown capacity of about 4.1 million barrels per day. At its peak, \nthe SPR contained 592 million barrels of oil. Currently, the SPR \ncontains about 570 million barrels of oil, so there has been a \ndrawdown.\n  We have seen the action by the President in transferring 30 million \nbarrels out of the SPR to be turned into heating oil. It is rather \ninteresting to note that the formula doesn't necessarily relate to 30 \nmillion barrels of heating oil. We will actually get somewhere between \n4 and 5 million barrels of heating oil out of 30 million barrels of \ncrude oil, about a 2- to 3-day supply.\n  As a consequence of the President's action, there is a legitimate \nquestion of whether the President had the authority to transfer that \noil out of the SPR since the authorization for the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve expired March 30 of this year. In any event, there is \nabsolutely no reason why it shouldn't be authorized, regardless of \nindividual attitudes on the appropriateness of drawing the SPR down.\n  It was created in response to the difficulties faced in 1973, when we \nexperienced the Arab oil embargo. Many of us remember that time. We \nwere outraged. We had gasoline lines around the block and the public \nwas indignant. They blamed everybody--the Government. How could it \nhappen in the United States that we had run out of gasoline? The \nconcept was simple. At that time, most of us believed America should \nnot be held hostage again to Mideast oil cartels and that this would \nact as our protection against cutting off our supplies. Unfortunately, \nwe find ourselves in a situation today where our domestic policies have \nled us to being held hostage by another tyrant. That tyrant in the \nMideast is one Saddam Hussein.\n  Clearly, we are becoming more and more dependent on Saddam Hussein. \nCurrently, 750,000 barrels a day of Saddam Hussein's oil come to the \nUnited States. It is even more significant that Saddam Hussein has \ntaken a pivotal role in the oil issue worldwide, because the difference \nbetween production capacity and consumption is a little over 1 million \nbarrels a day. In other words, we are producing a little over 1 million \nbarrels more than we can consume, but that is the maximum production. \nOut of that, Saddam Hussein is contributing almost 3 million barrels a \nday. So you can see the leverage that Saddam Hussein has. He has \nalready threatened to cut production. He went to the U.N., when they \nasked for specific programs for repayment of damages associated with \nhis invasion of Kuwait. He said: If you make me do this now, what I am \ngoing to do is simply put off any further plans to increase production, \nand I very well may reduce production.\n  You can see the leverage he has if he reduces production. What is the \nworld going to do? The price is going to go up, and they are going to \npay the price.\n\n  So what we have seen today is the reality that the world is consuming \njust slightly less oil than we are producing. Because of this, we have \nnot been able to build up our supply of inventory against any \nunexpected supply interruption, which very well could occur. The \nMideast is still an area of crisis and controversy.\n  Here we are, as we approach the fourth quarter of the year, and we \nhave the difference between supply and demand, the knowledge that it is \ngoing to tighten even further, and this leads, as I have indicated, to \na volatile worldwide oil market.\n  It is troubling in the United States because we have allowed \nourselves to become 58-percent dependent on imported oil, and this has \ngrown dramatically in the past few years. What disturbs me most is the \nfact that we have become even more dependent on Iraq. As a consequence, \nit is fair to recognize that with Saddam Hussein now calling the shots \nin the world energy markets and the United States allowing him to do \nso, we have basically put in danger the security of Israel.\n  Make no mistake about it. Every speech he concludes, he concludes \nwith: Death to Israel. It is kind of ironic. Maybe I am oversimplifying \nour foreign policy, but it seems as though we buy his oil, put it in \nour airplanes and go over and bomb him. We have had\n\n[[Page S9826]]\n\nflown over 200,000 sorties since the Persian Gulf war, where we go over \nand enforce what amounts to an air blockade. As a consequence, we are \nin a situation where we are supplying the cash-flow for his Republican \nGuard as well as the development of his missile and delivery capability \nand his biological capability. This is a mistake.\n  Because of this, it is imperative that we continue to place the focus \nof the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on a defensive weapon against severe \nsupply interruptions and that we do not use it as an offensive weapon \nto manipulate market forces. We have debated that issue on the floor \nbefore. I think this bill achieves a balance.\n  What we have in this bill is very important because many Members are \nfrom the Northeast, and this bill covers heating oil reserves. The \nlegislation contains language authorizing the Secretary of Energy to \ncreate a home heating oil reserve in the Northeast.\n  Several points about this: First, I have personal concerns about the \nestablishment of such a reserve. A reserve could actually act as a \ndisincentive to marketers to keep adequate supplies of oil on hand for \nfear that the price could drop out of their market at any time. That is \na possibility, with the Government going into competition.\n  A government-operated reserve of 2 million barrels could actually tie \nup storage capacity that private marketers would fill and deplete \nusually four or five times a season. The reserve could create an \nunworkable, rather elaborate regulatory program used to implement it.\n  Second, I was most concerned about the trigger mechanism included in \nthe House language that seemingly gave the Secretary total \ndiscretionary authority to release oil from the reserve. I believe we \nhave addressed the majority of the problems associated with the \ncreation of such a reserve by clarifying the trigger mechanism.\n  The mechanism we have in this bill allows the Secretary to make a \nrecommendation for release if there is a severe supply interruption. \nThis is deemed to occur if, one, the price differential between crude \noil, as reflected in an industry daily publication such as Platt's \nOilgram Price Report or Oil Daily, and No. 2 heating oil, as reported \nin the Energy Information Administration's retail price data for the \nNortheast, increases by more than 60 percent over its 5-year rolling \naverage; and second, the price differential continues to increase \nduring the most recent week for which price information is available. \nWe have this mechanism in this legislation, and it has been agreed to \nby virtually every Member of this body.\n\n  As to EPCA reauthorization, the bill extends the general authority \nfor EPCA through September 30, 2003.\n  On the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the authorities for SPR are \nextended through September 30, 2003. It strengthens the defense aspects \nof SPR by requiring the Secretary of Defense to affirm that a drawdown \nwould not have a negative impact on national security. That was an \nimportant provision Senator Bingaman and I negotiated.\n  We also have stripper well relief, the small stripper wells that we \nare so dependent on that were threatened the last time we had a price \ndownturn. The amendment retains the provision contained in the House \nbill that would give the Secretary of Energy discretion to purchase oil \nfrom marginal--that is 15 barrels of production daily or less--wells \nwhen the market price drops below $15. Otherwise, these wells will be \nlost. The cost of production to get them back up is such that they \nwould never go on line again. This would give some certainty to these \nproducers that we really value, the strippers, as the true strategic \npetroleum reserve, and an operational one, in this country.\n  This provision would hopefully offset the loss of some 600,000 b/d of \nlost production that occurred because of the dramatic price decrease in \n1999.\n  This amendment also allows the Secretary to fill the SPR with oil \nbought at below average prices.\n  We have weatherization. It strengthens the DOE Weatherization program \nby expanding the eligibility for the program and increases the per-\ndwelling assistance level.\n  The Summer Fill and Fuel Program authorizes a summer fill and fuel \nbudgeting program.\n  The program will be a state-led education and outreach effort to \nencourage consumers to take actions to avoid seasonal price increases \nand minimize heating fuel shortages--such as filling tanks in the \nsummer.\n  The Federal Lands Survey directs the Secretary of Interior, in \nconjunction with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, to \nundertake a national inventory of the onshore oil and gas reserves in \nthis country and the impediments to developing these resources.\n  This will enable us to get a better handle on our domestic resources \nand the reasons why they are not being developed.\n  The DOE Arctic Energy Office establishes within the Department of \nEnergy an Office of Arctic Energy.\n  Most of the energy in North America is coming from above the Arctic \nCircle.\n  The office will promote research, development, and deployment of \nenergy technologies in the Arctic.\n  This provision is critical as the Arctic areas of this country have \nprovided for as much as 20% of our domestic petroleum resources--have \nmore than 36 TCF of proven reserves of gas, and an abundance of coal, \nas we look at future energy needs of this country.\n  It might surprise members to know that the Department of Energy \nemploys no personnel in Alaska!\n  There is a 5 megawatt exemption that allows the State of Alaska to \nassume the licensing and regulatory authority over hydro projects less \nthan 5 megawatts.\n  This will expedite the process and cost of getting this clean source \nof energy in wider use in Alaska.\n  The Senate has already passed this provision.\n  The justification is that there is no way a small community, a small \nvillage, can put in a small hydrobelt wheel on a stream that has no \nanadromous fish and generate power to replace dependence on high-cost \ndiesel, much of which is flown in, and still meet the requirement of \nthe FERC, which licenses these small operations. And, as a consequence, \nwe have not been able to utilize them in many of the areas to replace \nthe high cost of diesel.\n  We have royalty-in-kind.\n  This provision allows the Secretary of the Interior more \nadministrative flexibility to increase revenues from the government's \noil and gas royalty-in-kind program.\n  Under current law, the government has the option of taking its \nroyalty share either as a portion of production, usually one-eighth or \none-sixth, or its equivalent in cash.\n  Recent experience with MMS's royalty-in-kind pilot program has shown \nthat the government can increase the value of its royalty oil and gas \nby consolidation and bulk sales.\n  Under royalty-in-kind, the government controls and markets its oil \nwithout relying on its lessees to act as its agent. This eliminates a \nnumber of issues that have resulted in litigation in recent years and \nallows the government to focus more directly on adding value to its oil \nand gas.\n  Finally, the FERC relicensing study requires FERC to immediately \nundertake a review of policies, procedures, and regulations for the \nlicensing of hydroelectric projects to determine how to reduce the cost \nand time of obtaining a license.\n  I remind colleagues that this is a bipartisan piece of legislation \nthat has been developed between Senator Bingaman and myself on the \nEnergy Committee. It has been cleared, as I understand it, by our side \nunanimously. It is my understanding that there still remains objection \non the other side, although we have had assurances that we are willing \nto work and try to address the concerns of those on the other side who \nhave chosen to place a hold on this legislation.\n  In view of the heightened emotions associated with our energy crisis \nin this country, this is very responsible legislation that is needed \nand is supported by the administration. It is timely, and it is \ncertainly overdue in view of the fact that we are down to the last few \ndays of this session. I hope we can come to grips with meeting the \nobligation we have to pass the Energy Policy and Conservation Act out \nof this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Alaska leaves the floor, I of \ncourse recognize the expert on our side of the\n\n[[Page S9827]]\n\naisle dealing with this legislation is the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer. I want to say this because I am the one who objected to \nthis. Following what the Senator from Alaska has said--and I have the \ngreatest respect for him, and we work together on many issues--it seems \nto me we can resolve this very quickly. There is a companion bill, H.R. \n2884, which already passed the House. We can bring it up here as it \npassed the House. It would go through very quickly. We believe that \nwould take care of the immediate problems facing us--the home heating \noil reserves and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  The problem we have, and the reason for the objection, is that to \nH.R. 2884 my friend from Alaska added some very--from our perspective--\nvery controversial oil royalties, among other things. So we believe if \nthe home heating oil reserve is as important as we think it is--and we \nbelieve it is extremely important--and if the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve is as important as we think it is, we should go with the House \nbill. We can do that in a matter of 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that under the time reserved \nto the minority on the continuing resolution, Senator Durbin, who has \nbeen waiting patiently all afternoon, be recognized for 10 minutes, \nSenator Boxer be recognized for 30 minutes, Senator Graham for 30 \nminutes, Senator Harkin for 15 minutes, Senator Feingold for 10 \nminutes, and Senator Wellstone for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Senator Bingaman and I have worked in a bipartisan \nmanner on this legislation. I am sure Senator Bingaman would want to \nexpress his views. I encourage him to avail himself of that \nopportunity. It is my understanding that the administration supports \nthe triggering mechanism in our bill as opposed to the one in the House \nbill specifically, and, as a consequence, we have worked toward an \neffort to try to reach an accord.\n\n  We are certainly under the impression on this side that we worked \nthis out satisfactorily to the administration. But objections may be \nraised. Senators are entitled to make objections, but I hope they are \ndirected at issues that clearly address environmental improvements.\n  I have nothing more to say other than this legislation is needed. We \nhave a crisis in energy, and we had best get on with it. Otherwise, I \nthink the problem is going to suffer the exposures, particularly since \nwe won't have authorization.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  I see the Senator from California, who may be able to shed some light \non this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the time agreement as \nproposed by the Senator from Nevada?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't think we need unanimous consent. The \ntime is under our control. We can allocate it any way we desire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9827-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9827-S9835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MAKING CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 110) making further \n     continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 2001, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that pursuant to \nthe request of the minority whip, I will be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 31 years ago, when I graduated from law \nschool here in Washington, DC, my wife and I picked up our little girl, \ntook all of our earthly possessions, and moved to the State capital of \nSpringfield, IL. It was our first time to visit that town. We went \nthere and made a home and had two children born to us there and raised \nour family.\n  So for 31 years Springfield, IL, has been our home. It has been a \ngood home for us. We made a conscious decision several times in our \nlives to stay in Springfield. It was the type of home we wanted to make \nfor our children, and our kids turned out pretty well. We think it was \nthe right decision. Springfield has been kind to me. It gave me a \nchance, in 1982, and elected me to the House of Representatives, and \nthen it was kind enough to be part of the electorate in Illinois that \nallowed me to serve here in the Senate.\n  I have come to know and love the city of Springfield, particularly \nits Lincoln history. I was honored as a Democrat to be elected to a \ncongressional seat of which part was once represented in the U.S. House \nof Representatives by Abraham Lincoln. Of course, he was not a \nDemocrat. He was a Whig turned Republican--first as a Whig as a \nCongressman and then Republican as President. But we still take great \npride in Lincoln, whether we are Democrats or Republicans.\n  When I was elected to the Senate, their came a time when someone \nasked me to debate my opponent. They said it was the anniversary of the \nDouglas-Lincoln debate of 1858 which drew the attention of the people \nacross the United States. Douglas won the senatorial contest that year. \nTwo years later, Lincoln was elected President.\n  It seems that every step in my political career has been in the \nshadow of this great Abraham Lincoln.\n  In about 1991, I reflected on the fact that in Springfield, IL--\ndespite all of the things that are dedicated to Abraham Lincoln, the \nState capital where he made some of his most famous speeches and \npronouncements, and his old law office where he once practiced law, the \nonly home he ever owned across the street from my senatorial office, \njust a few blocks away the Lincoln tomb, and only a few miles away \nLincoln's boyhood home in New Salem--of all of these different Lincoln \nsites in that area, for some reason this great President was never \ngiven a center, a library in one place where we could really tell the \nstory of Abraham Lincoln's life to the millions of people across the \nworld who are fascinated by this wonderful man.\n  We had at one point over 400,000 tourists a year coming to the \nLincoln home. I know they are from all over the world because I see \nthem every day when I am at home in Springfield.\n  I thought: we need to have a center, one place that really tells the \nLincoln story and draws together all of the threads of his life and all \nof the evidence of his life so everyone can come to appreciate him.\n  In 1991, that idea was just the idea of a Congressman, and I tried my \nbest to convince a lot of people back in Illinois of the wisdom of this \nnotion. I worked on it here in Washington over the years. Once in \nCongress, people came along and said: Maybe it is a good idea. There \nshould be a Lincoln Presidential center. We really ought to focus the \nnational attention on this possibility.\n  We passed several appropriations bills in the House. Some of them \ndidn't go very far in the Senate. But the interest was piquing. All of \na sudden, more and more people started discussing this option and \npossibility.\n  I recall that in the last year of the Governorship of Jim Edgar in \nhis last State of the State Address he raised this as a project that he \nwould like to put on the table for his last year as Governor. He told \nme later that he was amazed at the reaction. People from all over \nIllinois were excited about this opportunity. He weighed in and said \nthe State will be part of this process. His successor, Gov. George \nRyan, and his wife Laura Ryan, also said they wanted to be part of it. \nThe mayor of Springfield, Karen Hasara, asked that the State accept \nfrom the city of Springfield a parcel of real estate so they could \nbuild the center.\n  All of a sudden, there came together at the local and State level \nthis new momentum and interest in the idea of a Lincoln Presidential \nlibrary and a Lincoln center. I was energized by that.\n\n  Then, of course, the Illinois Congressional Delegation weighed in in \nsupport of it, and we have tried now to make a contribution from the \nFederal level toward this national project, which brings together \nlocal, State, and Federal sources in the name of Abraham Lincoln.\n  This Interior appropriations bill, of course, includes $10 million of \na $50 million authorization for that purpose.\n\n[[Page S9828]]\n\n I think that is a good investment and a very worthy project for which \nI fought for 10 years.\n  I am happy to have joined with my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, who \noffered a bill which authorized this center. He offered this bill as a \nfreestanding piece of legislation. I coauthored it with him. He added \nan amendment relative to the bidding process, and that amendment was \nadopted in committee. It was agreed to on the floor. It is my \nunderstanding that it is now going to be sent over to the House for \nconference. I was happy to stand with him in that effort.\n  But I think I would like to reflect for a moment on this project and \nto say a few words about the debate that has gone on today on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  The debate seems to focus on several different aspects of this \nLincoln center. I cannot tell that it is in the best location in the \ncity of Springfield. I didn't choose that location. I believed it \nwasn't my place to get involved. The minute this Lincoln center was \nsuggested, people from all over Springfield who owned real estate came \nflocking to my door and reminded me of what good friends they were and \nasked me to pick their location for the Lincoln center. I said I wasn't \ngoing to do it. It shouldn't be a political decision. It should be a \ndecision made in the best interests of the hundreds of thousands of \npeople who will come and visit this location.\n  The location which they have chosen is in a good spot when you \nconsider the restoration of the old railroad station from which Abraham \nLincoln left for his Presidency, and the old State capital which was \nimportant in his life and to this new center. They create a campus that \nI think will be visited and enjoyed by a lot of people.\n  There was also a question about the design of the center. I am no \narchitect or planner. I really defer to others. I know what I would \nlike. I would like to put in my two cents worth. But I am not going to \nact as an architect, a planner, or an engineer. That is really a \ndecision to be made by others. It should not be a political decision.\n  I think what Senator Fitzgerald said during the course of this debate \nis that the bidding process for this center should not be political \neither. I agree with him completely. I think he is on the right track.\n  As he and I have said in various ways, a center that honors ``Honest \nAbe'' should be built in an honest fashion. That is what we are going \nto try to do in Springfield, IL. Senator Fitzgerald and I have been in \nagreement to this point. I believe, though, that we may have some \ndifference of opinion in how we are going to progress from here.\n  I, frankly, believe that trying to create a new bidding process for \nthis center involving Federal rules may be difficult and may be \nimpossible. What agency is going to do it? Who is going to implement \nthese rules and regulations? How will this law apply? But I agree with \nhim that whatever process we use--whether it is Federal, State, or some \nother means--that it should be one where competitive bidding is the \nabsolute bottom line so that it is open and honest.\n  That is why I asked of the Capital Development Board in Springfield, \nwhich I believe will be the agency supervising this bidding, for a \nletter that expressly states that this process will be done by open \ncompetition and open bidding. I received that letter yesterday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Illinois,\n\n\n                                    Capital Development Board,\n\n                                 Springfield, IL, October 3, 2000.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: This letter is an additional attempt \n     to allay concerns that have been raised about our state's \n     commitment to competitive bidding and the efficacy of our \n     state purchasing laws. Let me assure you that all \n     construction contracts for this library and museum are being \n     and will continue to be competitively bid pursuant to state \n     law that is at least as stringent, if not more so, than \n     federal bidding requirements.\n       Competitive bidding has long been the requirement for State \n     of Illinois construction contracts and was most recently \n     reaffirmed with the passage of the stricter Illinois \n     Procurement Code of 1998. Only six exemptions to that \n     provision, which are defined by rule and must be approved by \n     the Executive Director, exist:\n       (1) emergency repairs when there exists a threat to public \n     health or safety, or where immediate action is needed to \n     repair or prevent damage to State property;\n       (2) construction projects of less than $30,000 total;\n       (3) limited projects, such as asbestos removal, for which \n     CDB may contract with Correctional Industries;\n       (4) the Art-in-Architecture program which follows a \n     separate procurement process;\n       (5) construction management services which are \n     competitively procured under a separate law; and,\n       (6) sole source items.\n       None of these exceptions have ever or will apply to the \n     library project, as they do not apply to the overwhelming \n     majority of CDB's projects.\n       With regard to the federal practice of ``weighting'' \n     construction bid criteria, there is no similar provision in \n     state law, because there is only one criteria allowed--our \n     bids must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder--\n     period. While it appears to me that the federal government \n     has taken the approach that it will determine the \n     responsiveness of the individual bidders after bids are \n     received, Illinois law actually requires that process to \n     occur before bidding takes place. Construction companies are \n     required to become prequalified with CDB before they can bid \n     on construction projects. It is during the prequalification \n     process that we determine a company's bonding capacity and \n     assess their work history and level of experience through \n     reference checks--in short, their ability to perform \n     construction work.\n       All bids for a construction project are opened during \n     publicly held and advertised ``bid opening'' meetings. All \n     interested constructors are informed at that time of the bid \n     amounts. There is no provision that allows CDB not to award \n     to the low bidder.\n       I hope that this clarifies some of the issues that have \n     been raised. Please do not hesitate to call on me if I may be \n     of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Kim Robinson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this letter was sent to me by the \nexecutive director of the Illinois Capital Development Board, Kim \nRobinson. I don't know Kim Robinson personally. But she writes to me in \nthis letter of October 3 that there are certain exceptions to \ncompetitive bidding under the Illinois State law. She lists all six of \nthem, and then concludes:\n\n       None of these exceptions have ever or will apply to the \n     library project, as they do not apply to the overwhelming \n     majority of CDB's projects.\n\n  By that statement it is clear to me that there is going to be open \ncompetitive bidding on this project.\n  The point that was raised by Senator Fitzgerald earlier in the debate \nabout qualified bidders is a valid one. Who will be bidding on this \nproject? I do not know. Frankly, no one has come forward to me and \nsuggested that they want to be bidding on this project. It wouldn't do \nthem any good anyway. I am not going to make that decision. I haven't \ninvolved myself in the location or design. I leave that to others.\n  But I hope when this happens and bidders are solicited that it is an \nentirely open process as well. I will guarantee that there will be more \nattention paid to this bid for this project in Springfield, IL, than \nprobably anything in its history.\n  I credit Senator Fitzgerald for bringing that attention forward. But \nlet us proceed with the premise that it is going to be a transparent \nprocess. And let us make certain that as it progresses we will have at \nleast an opportunity to assess it every single step of the way.\n  I also add that during the course of his statement today my colleague \nhas raised questions about previous bidding processes by Governors in \nthe State of Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, questions have been raised by Senator \nFitzgerald about the bidding processes under Governors in the State of \nIllinois. For the record, there has not been a Democratic Governor in \nthe State of Illinois for 24 years. So if he is suggesting that there \nhave been irregularities under Governors, it is likely that they have \nnot been of my political party. I can tell you without exception that I \nhave never involved myself in any bidding process in Springfield by the \nState government. I have considered my responsibilities to be here in\n\n[[Page S9829]]\n\nWashington and not in the State capital. Frankly, the people who bid on \ncontracts and whether they are successful is another part of the world \nin which I have not engaged myself. I am not standing here in defense \nof any of these bidding processes, or making excuses for any of these \nprocesses. If there was any wrongdoing, then let those in appropriate \npositions investigate that and come to conclusions. Whether there was \nany reason for any kind of prosecution or investigation, that is not in \nmy province nor my responsibility.\n\n  I hope at the end of this debate we can remove any cloud on this \nproject. This project should go forward. The Illinois congressional \ndelegation supports this project. Let us demand it be open and honest, \nand then let us support it enthusiastically. Frankly, I think we all \nhave an obligation to taxpayers--Federal, State, and local alike--to \nmeet that goal.\n  I close with one comment because I want to be completely open and \nhonest on the record. My colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, during the \ncourse of the debate has mentioned the Cellini family of Springfield. \nThe Cellini family is well known. My wife and I have known Bill and \nJulie Cellini for over 30 years. We are on opposite sides of the \npolitical fence. He is a loyal Republican; I am a loyal Democrat. \nSeldom have we ever come together, except to stand on the sidelines \nwhile our kids played soccer together or joined in community projects. \nThey are friends of ours. I have taken the floor of the Senate to note \nthat Julie Cellini is an author in our town who has done some wonderful \nprofiles of people who live in Springfield.\n  I make it part of this record today, when I came up with the original \nconcept of this Lincoln center, there were three people who came \nforward and said they were excited about it and wanted to work with me \non it. This goes back 10 years now. They included Susan Mogerman, who \nworks with the Illinois State Historical Library, as well as Nikki \nStratton, a woman involved in Springfield tourism, and Julie Cellini. \nThese three women have worked tirelessly for 10 years on this project. \nI never once believed that any of them would be involved in this \nbecause they thought there was money at the end of the rainbow. I think \nthey genuinely believe in this idea and they believe it is good for \nSpringfield and good for the State of Illinois.\n  I can't speak to any other dealings by that family or any other \nfamily, but I can say every contact I have had with those three women \nand their families about this project has been entirely honorable, \nentirely above board, and in the best interests of civic involvement \nfor an extremely important project, not only to our city of Springfield \nbut to the State of Illinois and to the Nation.\n  I hope when this is all said and done, this delegation can come \ntogether, closely monitor the bidding process, do everything in our \npower to help make this center a reality, and at the end of the day I \nhope we will be alive and be there at the opening of this great center.\n  I was honored a few months ago by our Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, \nto secure a spot as a member of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial \nCommission. I can think of few higher honors than to work and celebrate \nthe life and accomplishments of one of the world's greatest leaders. \nThe actual bicentennial will not be fully celebrated until 2009. This \nlegislation is a great first step in a celebration of the life and \naccomplishments of a great President.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I compliment my colleague, my friend from Illinois. \nExtending my time line further, I started in 1998. There are a lot of \narticles going back to the early 1980s when Senator Durbin--then \nCongressman Durbin--was working hard to get this project off the \nground. I compliment him for his hard work over a number of years on \nbehalf of this project.\n  I appreciate his love for Springfield. Senator Durbin has talked many \ntimes at our weekly Thursday morning breakfast about his love for \nSpringfield. I know that he and his wife Loretta have lived in \nSpringfield for many years. I am hopeful that we can work together and \nbuild a wonderful Abraham Lincoln Library that will truly be a credit \nnot just to Springfield but to the whole State of Illinois and the \nentire country.\n  I also thank Senator Durbin for his support and the amendment he \noffered in the Senate requiring the Federal competitive bid rules. \nSenator Durbin has been very supportive and the whole Illinois \ndelegation supports the project. There has simply been a difference of \nopinion as to which bidding rules should be attached.\n  I did want to point out that the State code does contemplate, where \nFederal strings are attached, Federal appropriations, that State \nagencies receiving Federal aid, grant funds, or loans, shall have the \nauthority to adapt their procedures, rules, projects, drawings, maps, \nsurveys, and so forth, to comply with the regulation, policy, and \nprocedures of the designated authority of the U.S. Government in order \nto remain eligible for such Federal aid funds.\n  I think that provision would be helpful in the case of this grant or \nany other grant where the Federal Government seeks to ensure the proper \naccountability of the Federal funds.\n  I compliment my colleague and thank him for his working and allowing \nme to make my views known. I look forward to continuing to work with \nthe Senator this year and in following years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank Senator Fitzgerald.\n  In closing, you know your senatorial lineage is traced to Steven \nDouglas, and I checked the history of the Senate. I am afraid he is on \nour side of the aisle, and he traced himself to my seat. You have some \ndistinguished senatorial colleagues who proceeded you, and I am certain \nyou are very proud of them as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is my understanding I now have 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                            ROYALTY PAYMENTS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am pleased to come to the floor today to try to shed a \nlittle light, if not a little heat, on an issue that was raised by the \nSenator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, when he asked unanimous consent \nthat we take up H.R. 2884, but substitute his amendment to that bill, \nand pass it. The unanimous consent request was made by the majority \nleader on behalf of Senator Murkowski. He came to the floor with a very \neloquent discussion of why he believed it was important.\n  I am one of the Senators--there is more than one--who objects to this \nbill. I think it is very important to state clearly on the record why. \nFirst, H.R. 2884 as it came over from the House does exactly the right \nthing. It reauthorizes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it sets up \na home heating oil reserve. That is very important for the people of \nthis country, particularly the people in the Northeast. We could pass \nthat in 1 minute flat by unanimous consent request. No one has any \nproblem.\n  What is the problem, my friends? Senator Murkowski has essentially \nadded to that bill a whole new body of law concerning royalty payments \nby the oil companies, which they owe the taxpayers of the United States \nof America. It deals with the ability of the oil companies to pay, not \nin cash--which is essentially the way they pay now--but in kind. It \nwould encourage, by many of the provisions in it, the payment of these \nroyalty payments in kind. In other words, Uncle Sam would become the \nproud owner of natural gas, Uncle Sam would become the proud owner of \noil. And, by the way, Uncle Sam would then have to in some cases market \nthat product.\n  I don't think we are good at becoming a new Price Club. I really \ndon't. My friend from Alaska says: But the Government wants to do it, \nthey want to do it. They came to us; they asked us; they want to do it. \nShow me one bureaucrat in Government who doesn't want more power, more \nauthority, more jobs, and I will show you a rare bureaucrat.\n  The royalty payments that come into this Federal Government go to the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. Let me be clear what a royalty \npayment is. When you find oil on Federal\n\n[[Page S9830]]\n\nland offshore and onshore, you must pay a percentage of that to the \ntaxpayers. It is like rent. You are using the taxpayers' land, the \noffshore areas, and you have to pay a certain amount of rent based on \nthe value of the oil or gas you recover.\n  This is an area that has been fraught with complication and \ndifficulty. I frankly have found myself on the side of the consumers \nwho have said they have been shortchanged by the oil companies. I \nbelieve that those of us who fought for 3 long years for a fair royalty \npayment did the right thing. Why do I say that? Because under the old \nsystem there have been lawsuits and almost in every case--I do not even \nknow of any case where we did not prevail on behalf of the taxpayers.\n\n  I hear today that the Federal Government has collected, because there \nhave been some recent settlements, almost a half a billion dollars of \npayment from the oil companies. Do you know why? Because they have been \ncheating the taxpayers out of the royalty payments that they were \nsupposed to make based on the fair market value. One of the ways they \nhave cheated the taxpayers is to undervalue the oil. If you are in \nbeginners math, you know a percentage of a smaller number will yield \nyet a smaller number. So they did not do the proper math. They didn't \nshow what the oil was worth. They undervalued the oil and then they \ntook a percentage of the undervalued oil and gave it to the taxpayers \nand we were shorted a half billion dollars--maybe more. That is just \nthe recent settlement.\n  So after 3 years of fighting--and, believe me, I had to stand on my \nfeet and fight long and hard, and so did a lot of my colleagues, and I \nthank them--we were able to make sure that a fair way of determining \nthe fair market value of that oil was put in place.\n  In the middle of all this comes the payment-in-kind program. In other \nwords, instead of paying cash, we say to the oil and gas companies we \nare going to try an experiment. We are going to try a pilot program. We \nare going to allow you to pay your royalties in kind. That is like if \nyou owed the Government your income taxes and said: Uncle Sam, I'm \nshort. Will you take the payment in, say, my mother's antique chest? \nThat's worth about $1,000 and that's what I owe.\n  By the way, we do this with no other commodity. We have checked the \nrecords. We say to them something we say to no one else who owes the \nFederal Government: You can pay your dues, your royalty payments, in \nkind.\n  I have a lot of problems with that. A lot of my colleagues think it \nis just great. But, again, it is my experience that we do not do too \nwell in the business world in government. We are better off doing our \nwork here, getting that straight. Now we are going to expand. It is \ngoing to be Uncle Sam's Oil Company; Uncle Sam's Gas Company: Drive in \nand fill her up.\n  Of course I am exaggerating; it will not be exactly that. What we \nwill do is market the product and sell it and probably pay the oil \ncompanies to do all that marketing for us so they will get back plenty \nof money. We will wind up paying them to market their product. This is \na very confusing matter.\n  So what happens? Without one hearing in the Energy Committee, we have \nbefore us a substitute bill that I have objected to and others have \nobjected to that would essentially say, regardless of all the work, \nSenator Boxer, that you and many of your colleagues went through to get \na fair royalty payment, we are going to come around in the backdoor \nwhen nobody is looking and we are going to put in a new way to figure \nout how to pay royalties. We are going to expand this payment-in-kind \nprogram even before we have held one hearing on whether it even works. \nThe pilot programs are going to be completed very soon, in about 3 or 4 \nmonths, at least one of them. Another one will be done next year. What \nis the rush to pass a 5-year authorization on royalty payments in kind? \nWhat is the rush? Is that the way to govern? Is that the way to \nlegislate?\n\n  No other industry in America gets this chance. I say, if you read the \nsubstitute offered by my good friend, Senator Murkowski, you are going \nto find a few things in there that are going to raise your eyebrows.\n  In the very first draft, they set up another definition of ``fair \nmarket value.'' I protested. They dropped it. Now it just says the \nroyalty in kind has to be paid in a fair market value, but it doesn't \ndefine it. It doesn't do what the rule does for the in-cash payments. \nSo now you have two conflicting ways, one way that is clearly defined \nif you pay in cash and one way that is open to interpretation, fair \nmarket value--whatever that means--for the payment in kind.\n  Do you know what I see? Again, you don't have to be an expert in \neconomics. I was an economics major, but that was so many years ago I \ndon't pretend to be an expert. But if I say to you, ``fair market \nvalue,'' you are going to say, ``I think that is a willing buyer and a \nwilling seller.''\n  If I ask Sarah here, who has worked so hard on this, she is going to \nsay: I think that is a little risky because the seller might be a \nsubsidiary of the buyer. That is not arm's length. It has to be an \narm's length agreement.\n  Somebody else might say: Forget that. Let's just go to the published \nnewspaper in terms of what the oil is selling for on that date.\n  Frankly, that is the one I like. That is the one we use in the \ndefinition when you pay royalty in cash.\n  The first problem is you are setting up a whole conflict here. I will \ntell you, those guys with those sharp pencils who are in the oil \ncompany, they are going to go for payment in kind because there is not \nany real definition. They are going to give us less oil and less value \nthan we would get.\n  So then you say to my friend, Senator Murkowski, let's at least put \nin this legislation a statement that says: Under no circumstances \nshould we get less than we would get if it was payment in cash because, \nagain, this money goes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which \nis our conservation fund. We buy lands with it. We fix up parks with \nit. And the State share--because States get a share of the royalty \npayment--that goes to the California classrooms.\n  Are they going to send oil to the California classrooms? Are they \ngoing to send natural gas?\n  So we said: Look, we have to work out these problems with the States. \nIn any case, we can't have less of a payment than we would have if you \npaid in cash. So we said: Will you put that in the language? ``Under no \ncase will we get less than we would get if we got payment in cash.''\n  Oh, no, they use the word ``benefits,'' not revenues. The benefits \nhave to be equal or greater.\n  I said: Wait a minute. What does that mean?\n  Well, the Secretary will decide if there is a benefit.\n  Let me tell you I have seen Secretaries of the Interior come and go. \nI saw one who said: Don't worry about the ozone layer leaving us. Don't \nworry about a hole in the ozone layer; just wear a hat and put on \nsunscreen. Don't worry about cancer. That was one Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  So in this 5-year authorization that never had a hearing, before the \npilot programs are through, we are leaving all this up to the Secretary \nof the Interior, whoever he or she may be.\n  We have seen Secretaries of the Interior who fought on behalf of the \nenvironment. We have seen Secretaries of the Interior who fought on \nbehalf of big oil. I am not here to give authority to the Secretary of \nthe Interior to decide when it is in the benefit of the United States \nto take less than what you would get if you received a payment in cash.\n  I understand from Senator Murkowski's staff that he feels strongly \nabout this and he is not going to back off. He is going to file a \ncloture motion and all the rest of it. That is fine. We will stay here \npast the election because I am going to stand on my feet because I \ndon't think the taxpayers ought to be ripped off again. They have been \nripped off for years. We finally resolved the situation, and we are now \nback to square one.\n  Again, I reiterate, the underlying bill that came over from the House \nis a beautiful bill.\n  It deals with two things which we need to do: We need to fill up the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and reauthorize it, and we need a home \nheating oil reserve. I will say we are told by the administration that \nthey actually can act on this without this legislation, but it \ncertainly would be better to have it.\n\n[[Page S9831]]\n\n  I say to my friend, Senator Murkowski--and I will not do it now in \ndeference to the fact he is not here--I would like to move the \nunderlying H.R. 2884 as it came over here and pass it 5 minutes a side. \nWe can do it if we did not add all this royalty in-kind section to it.\n  The last point I wish to make on this subject is, in the Interior \nbill that is now before the Senate, we have already taken care of this \nproblem. The Minerals Management Service came to us and said: We need a \nlittle help with the pilot program because we really want to make sure \nwe are giving payment in kind every chance. The Minerals Management \nService wants to go into the oil business. That is great. They want to \nbe the Price Club of the United States of America. So they want help. \nOK.\n  We took care of them in this Interior bill. We gave them what they \nwanted. We allowed them to calculate this royalty in a way that they \ncan subtract the cost of transportation, even subtract the cost of \nmarketing oil. The oil companies get a good deal. Senator Murkowski \nwants a 5-year authorization without one hearing. He wanted to pass it \nby unanimous consent, no amendments, nothing.\n  I may sound upset, and it is true, I am upset because I think the \nconsumers get a raw deal. Every time we have a little problem with an \nenergy supply, what do we hear around this place? Drill in ANWR; let \nthe oil companies pay lower royalties, and meanwhile the oil companies \nare earning the biggest profits they have ever earned, causing Senator \nPat Leahy of Vermont to come down here and propose a windfall profits \ntax on the oil companies. But it is not good enough for them to earn $1 \nbillion and $2 billion in a quarter--in a quarter--to have 100-percent \nprofits and 200-percent profits and 300-percent profits. They have to \npay us less in royalties. If you knew what this amount was--it is so \nminuscule compared to their profits--it would shock you.\n  It is not minuscule to the child who sits in a California classroom. \nIt is not minuscule to the Land and Water Conservation Fund or the \nHistoric Preservation Fund, but yet here we are when we should be doing \nenergy conservation, when we should be having a long-term energy plan, \nthe first thing we do, because the Senator from Alaska attaches it to \nan important bill, is give a break to the oil companies again with \nthese royalties in kind.\n  Boy, I tell you. Maybe the Senator from Florida will be interested to \nknow this. There is not any other business in America that pays in \nkind. It would be interesting if you had to pay your IRS bill and you \nsaid: I have a few extra things around the house I am going to send in.\n  It is hard to believe we would have an authorization to really expand \nthe payment-in-kind program without one hearing. I am stunned. It is \ntaken care of in the Interior bill. We gave them a narrow bill. We did \nnot mess with the definition of how you are supposed to pay, what you \nare supposed to pay. We did what the Interior Department wanted.\n  If this is going to a cloture vote, I tell my friends, so be it. I \nhave other friends on this side of the aisle who agree very strongly, \nand we are going to stand on our feet and it is not going to be \npleasant, it is not going to be happy, but we are going to have to do \nit, and let us shine the light of truth on the whole oil royalty \nquestion.\n\n  They are going to get up and say: Oh, it's the mom and pop little \nguys. Fine, let's do this for the mom and pop little guys. I will talk \nto you about that. But do not give the biggest companies--these are \nmultinational corporations making excess profits--another break, and \nsuddenly Uncle Sam goes into the oil business and the gas business.\n  This whole issue of an energy policy is important. It came up in the \ndebates, and what we heard from the two candidates was very different. \nGeorge W. Bush had one energy policy and one energy policy alone, and \nthat is more development at home. By the way, we have had a lot more \noil development here--and I am going to put that information in the \nRecord--since Clinton-Gore came in. But they want to go to a wildlife \nrefuge and drill in a wildlife refuge.\n  The No. 1 goal of environmentalists in this country is to protect \nthat wildlife refuge. They want to drill in it, and you say: Senator \nBoxer, how much oil is in there? The estimate is about 6 months of oil. \nPeriod. End of quote. Forever. Some say if you got every drop out of \nit, it could go for 2 years, but that is the outside; most people think \nit is 6 months.\n  To me that is a contradiction in terms. We have to figure out a \nbetter way. I will give you a better way. We can save a million barrels \nof oil a day--a million barrels of oil a day--if we just say the SUVs \nshould get the same mileage as a car. A million barrels of oil a day, \nand yet when that comes up, people duck for cover around here.\n  How have the President and the Vice President tried to have an energy \npolicy? First of all, since they came in, oil and gas production on \nonshore Federal lands has increased 60 percent, and offshore oil \nproduction is up 65 percent since they came in, while they are \nprotecting the most vulnerable offshore tracts, off California, off \nFlorida, and other pristine places. We have seen a huge increase there.\n  They worked to bring an additional 3.5 million more barrels per day \ninto the world oil market. They have taken measures to swap 30 million \nbarrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and this will help \nthe Northeast not have a repeat of last year's home heating oil \nshortage. We know it was Vice President Gore who pushed for this, \nfrankly, along with a couple of Republicans and Democrats in the \nCongress, and it seems to be working. We hope it will.\n  They supported alternatives to oil and gas, such as ethanol, a \nrenewable resource made from feedstock such as corn, and increasing \nethanol use would help reduce dependence on foreign oil. It would help \nour farmers by boosting corn prices, and since ethanol can be made from \nwaste, such as rice straw, waste straw, trimmings and trash, the \ngreater use of ethanol can turn an environmental problem into an \nenvironmental benefit. In other words, it would take trash and turn it \ninto energy. That is a plus.\n  The other half of the administration's energy policy is to improve \nenergy efficiency. I think it is very important to look at the record \nhere. Having told you that if we go to the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, we will only get 6-month's worth of oil, what is the answer? \nLet's see what the facts show.\n  The administration supported a tax credit to promote alternative \nsources of energy--solar, biomass, wind, and other sources. The \nRepublican Congress said no.\n  The administration recommended tax credits for electric fuel cell and \nqualified hybrid vehicles. It was a 5-year package of tax credits. The \nRepublican Congress said no.\n  The administration advocated a tax credit for efficient homes and \nbuildings. The Republican Congress said no.\n  The administration recommended tax incentives for domestic oil and \ngas industries. The Republican Congress said no.\n  The administration requested $1.7 billion for Federal research and \ndevelopment efforts to promote energy efficiency in buildings, \nindustry, and transportation, and expanded use of renewable energy and \ndistributed power generation systems. And the Republican Congress \npartially funded that program.\n  The administration requested $1.5 billion for investments in energy \nR for oil, gas, coal, efficiency, renewables, and nuclear energy. \nWhat was the answer of the Republican Congress? No. And they introduced \nlegislation to abolish the Department of Energy. That is a great \nanswer.\n  George Bush is saying we have no energy policy, and most of his party \nsaid: Do away with the Department of Energy. That was at a time when \noil prices were low. They said: We don't need it. That is some policy.\n  It goes on.\n  The administration requested $851 million for energy conservation for \nthe Department of Energy. The request was cut by $35 million.\n  They requested money to continue the Partnership for a New Generation \nof Vehicles. That was cut in half by the Republican Congress.\n  They requested $225 million for building technology assistance \nfunding. That was cut.\n  They asked for $85 million to create a new Clean Air Partnership Fund \nto\n\n[[Page S9832]]\n\nhelp States and localities reduce pollution and become more energy \nefficient. The Republican Congress said no.\n  It goes on.\n  The administration recommended studying increases in the fuel economy \nof automobiles. We know that 50 percent of the cause of our energy \ndependence is automobiles. What did this Republican Congress do? It \nprohibited the administration from even studying the increases in fuel \neconomy standards in a rider to the appropriations bill.\n  So now we have the Republican standard bearer standing up in a debate \nsaying: Where is your energy policy? There were 20 initiatives. I have \nonly mentioned part of those. And they said no to the vast majority of \nthem, and they said, OK, we will give you a little bit for a few.\n  It seems, to me, disingenuous--and that is the nicest way I can say \nit--to be critical of Vice President Gore, saying he has no energy \npolicy, when every single proposal, except maybe a couple, was turned \ndown with a vengeance.\n  Then, when we have a problem, our friends on the other side come down \nand say: You see the other side, they care about the environment too \nmuch. They will not drill in a wildlife refuge.\n  I say, thank you for mentioning that because if there is anything I \nwant to accomplish here in the short time that any of us has in the \nscheme of things, it is to protect this magnificent area.\n  I wish we could join hands across party lines on energy. I say to the \nPresiding Officer, we have worked together in the Committee on Public \nWorks. We have worked, for example, on ways to replace MTBE in a good \nway. We have worked on ways to make sure that we do not rob the States \nof their transit funds. I think we can do this. I do not think it is \nfair, however, for the candidate of the Republican Party to accuse the \nVice President, who has proposed numerous ways, both on the production \nside and on the demand side, to resolve the problem, and say, there is \nno energy policy, when time after time after time it has been thwarted \nin this very body and in the House.\n\n  I remember when I first went into politics--a very long time ago--we \nhad an energy crisis. At that time, we realized our automobiles were \nsimply gas guzzlers. I remember. They used to get 10 miles to the \ngallon, 12 miles to the gallon. I am definitely showing my age when I \nadmit that. I remember that. And now we are doing better, but we can do \nbetter still.\n  I say to you that rather than go into a pristine and beautiful \nwildlife refuge--which we really owe to our children and our \ngrandchildren and their kids; we owe them the preservation of that \narea--rather than do that, we could take a few steps here that can \nreally make us so much more energy efficient, that we will be proud to \nsay to our children and our grandchildren that we took a few steps. We \ndid not inconvenience anybody.\n  Our refrigerators do a little bit better on energy use, our \ndishwashers, and our cars. I say to my own kids, who are at that age \nwhen they love those cars--I have a prejudice against those big SUVs \nbecause it is hard for me to climb into them. The bottom line is, they \nare very nice, but we can do better for our Nation and not be dependent \non OPEC.\n  Fifty percent of our problem has to do with transportation. So we do \nnot have to say: Oh, my gosh, we have a problem. Drill in a wildlife \npreserve. Oh, my gosh, we have a problem. Destroy the coast of \nCalifornia; ruin the tourism industry; ruin the fishing industry; risk \noil spills. We do not have to go there.\n  We were sent here to find better ways of solving problems. Having an \nenergy policy is important, but it takes two to tango. The Congress \ncannot do without the President, and the President cannot do without \nthe Congress. The President proposes and Congress disposes. \nUnfortunately, they disposed of almost every single idea this \nadministration had. We are suffering the consequences. So the issue is \nbrought up at a Presidential debate, when people are pointing at each \nother, and we right here had a chance to do much better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 30 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Presiding Officer. This was a chance for me \nto explain my vociferous opposition to the substitute offered by \nSenator Murkowski and to talk about an energy policy. I appreciate your \npatience, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to take 6 minutes of the leader's time to speak as in morning \nbusiness on the continuing resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to briefly describe my own \nthoughts on this royalty-in-kind issue.\n  First, let me say, the Senator from California, and, before her, the \nSenator from Alaska, talked about a great many issues related to our \nenergy situation. I do not have the time and I have not come to the \nfloor prepared to address all of those. I generally agree with the \nSenator from California that we need a balanced energy policy. We need \nto not only do things to increase supply, but we also need to reduce \ndemand in this country. We have fallen short in that regard.\n  I have proposed legislation, which the administration strongly \nsupports, much of which the Senator from California referred to, that I \nbelieve would help us to reduce demand and also help us to increase \nproduction. I am sorry that we have not been able, as a Congress, and \nas a Senate, to bring that up for consideration this year. I hope we \nstill can before we adjourn, but the days are growing short.\n  Let me speak for a minute about the particular bill and the royalty-\nin-kind issue.\n  As I understand it, the action which started this discussion was an \neffort to move to H.R. 2884. This is the House version of EPCA. EPCA \nstands for Energy Policy and Conservation Act.\n  That is an important piece of legislation. It reauthorizes the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. It sets up a heating oil reserve in the \nNortheast, about which many feel very strongly. It does a variety of \nthings. It gives the Department of Energy authority to pay above-market \nprices for production from stripper wells in order to fill the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve when the price of oil falls below $15 a \nbarrel. It does other things on the weatherization grant program. It \nhas some useful provisions and contains a variety of other things.\n  It also contains a provision that the Senator from Alaska has \nstrongly supported, and is intent upon keeping in the bill, on the \nsubject of royalty in kind.\n  Let me explain my thoughts on that.\n  The Congress--for several Congresses now--has spent a lot of time \narguing about, How do you determine what the royalty ought to be when \nthe Federal Government allows for production of oil and gas on Federal \nlands? What amount of money is owed to the Federal Government?\n  We all know it is 12.5 percent; it is one-eighth. But how much is \nthat in dollars? There is a lot of litigation on that subject. There \nhas been, for a substantial period of time, a lot of debate on the \nsubject.\n  The Federal agencies which manage our Federal oil and gas resources \nindicate that in certain circumstances they believe the United States \nhas the opportunity to realize more money by actually taking its one-\neighth in royalty in kind; that is, actually taking that royalty in the \nform of oil or gas instead of receiving it in cash.\n  The thought is that there is more of a benefit to the Government in \nsome circumstances. Existing law authorized the Department of Interior \nto do that very thing. But under this authority, the Mineral Management \nService, MMS, which is part of the Department of Interior, has \nconducted several very promising pilot programs on this subject of \nroyalty in kind. Two of the latest of these involve Federal onshore \noil, conducted in cooperation with the State of Wyoming and offshore \ngas in the Gulf of Mexico. Those are two examples.\n  Early indications from both of these are that these pilot programs \nwill result in greater revenue for the United States and for the \ntaxpayer than would have been received had the oil and gas been taken \nin value, had the Government been paid dollars instead.\n  As an example, the thought of the Senator from California, as I \nunderstood it, was that there is something unfair to the Government by \nhaving\n\n[[Page S9833]]\n\nthe Government take its oil or its gas in kind. An analogy which we \nmight think about is if the Government were owed one beer out of a six-\npack, would it make more sense for the Government to take that beer or \nwould it be better for the Government to go through a lengthy process \nof trying to establish the value of that one beer once it considered \nthe cost of transporting the six-pack and the cost of storing it and \nall the other things. And in some circumstances, as I understand it, \nthe Department of Interior, through this Minerals Management Service, \nhas determined that it is in their interest to go ahead and take the \nroyalty in kind instead of trying to calculate and argue about the \nprice of it.\n  Based on these programs that have been in place, MMS, the Minerals \nManagement Service, has determined that it could conduct a more \nefficient program, one that would be more likely to result in increased \nrevenues, if it were able to pay for contracts for transporting and \nprocessing and selling the oil and gas it takes from Federal leases. \nExisting authorities allow the MMS to enter into contracts for these \nservices but do not provide a way for them to pay except under general \nagency appropriations.\n  The amendment the Senator from Alaska has offered and I have \ncosponsored grants to the Department of Interior authority to use the \nmoney it makes when it sells oil and gas it takes in kind to pay for \nthe expenses incurred in preparing it for sale, including its \ntransportation, processing, aggregating, storing, and marketing. There \nis a 5-year sunset on this.\n  The amendment adds to existing law some very substantial protections \nfor the Government and for the taxpayer.\n  It requires the Department to stop taking royalties in kind if the \nSecretary of Interior determines that it is not beneficial to the \nUnited States to take royalty in that form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes \nfrom the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. It also requires that the Department report extensively \nto Congress on how the program is going. None of these requirements \nexist in current law. The royalty-in-kind provision in the Interior \nappropriations bill does not have these protections. This very bill we \nare getting ready to vote on in the next few days, the Interior \nappropriations bill, does grant authority to the Department to take the \nFederal Government's royalty in kind, but it does not have the \nprotections that are in the amendment the Senator from Alaska and I are \ncosponsoring.\n\n  While 1 year is better than nothing, which is the Interior \nappropriations language--the Department clearly supports that provision \nin the Interior appropriations bill--a 5-year authorization gives the \nagency enough time to actually enter into contracts it would need to \nseriously test the workability of this program.\n  I wanted to clarify my own views at least as to what this provision \nwould do. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is important \nlegislation. I hope we can resolve this dispute and get the legislation \nup for consideration in this Congress.\n  I do support the royalty-in-kind provision the Senator from Alaska \nand I have cosponsored. It will be beneficial to the Government--not to \nthe oil industry but to the Government. It would be a win/win \nsituation, and I do not see it as in any way breaking faith with the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  It would be good public policy for us to go ahead with this. I hope \nwe can do so before the Congress adjourns.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe by previous order, I have 30 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am here today in support of my colleague \nfrom Louisiana and to express my dismay at the content of the Interior \nappropriations conference report which we are considering. Senator \nLandrieu knows better than each of us the amount of work, dedication, \nand focus it took to produce the widely and wildly supported \nlegislation, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, or CARA, which has \npassed the House, passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and now awaits Senate floor action.\n  We have a unique opportunity before us in this session of the \nCongress: the ability to enact conservation legislation that will have \na positive impact not just for ourselves but for our children and \ngrandchildren, long after we have left this Chamber.\n  This opportunity is in the historical mainstream of the United States \nof America. We are starting a new century, the 21st century. It is the \nthird full new century that has been started since the United States of \nAmerica became a sovereign nation.\n  The first of those full centuries was the 19th century. We were led \ninto the 19th century by one of our greatest Presidents, whose bust is \nabove the Presiding Officer, Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson had a \ngoal, a goal to acquire the city of New Orleans, which ironically is \nthe home of Senator Landrieu. The purpose was to secure water transit \non the Mississippi for American commerce, as it was developing in the \nMississippi Valley, the Ohio Valley of the Presiding Officer, and later \nin the Missouri River Valley.\n  President Jefferson suddenly had a unique opportunity before him. \nWhile his negotiators were discussing with the French, the then-owners \nof New Orleans, the purchase of that city, they were met with a counter \noffer. Don't just buy New Orleans; buy the entire Louisiana territory.\n  President Jefferson seized this opportunity and fundamentally \ntransformed the United States of America. No longer were we an Atlantic \nnation. We were a continental nation. No longer were we a nation in \nwhich Americans were quickly using up their original land; we were a \nnation that had an enormous new area to develop.\n  America suddenly had also been saved from the prospect of North \nAmerica becoming a battleground for European rivalries because, with \nLouisiana in hand, the United States would be the dominant force in \nNorth America and would not have to contend with the prospect of the \nEnglish, the French, the Spanish, and other Europeans attempting to \nsettle their long animosities on our territory.\n  That was a truly bold idea, an idea that led us into the 19th century \nand has forever transformed our Nation.\n  We began the 20th century with another similarly bold leader, \nTheodore Roosevelt, whose bust is just outside the main entrance to the \nSenate Chamber.\n  Theodore Roosevelt had an idea that America should become a place \nwhich respected its natural heritage. So in his almost 8 years as \nPresident, he added to the national inventory of public lands an area \nthat is the size of all the States which touch the Atlantic Ocean from \nMaine to Florida--an enormous contribution to our patrimony which, \nagain, has served to transform both our idea of America and our access \nto America.\n  We had an opportunity to start the 21st century with an idea which, \nif not of the scale of either the Louisiana Purchase or Theodore \nRoosevelt's commitments to public lands, would have been a statement \nthat our generation still recognized its obligation to prepare for the \nfuture, as those two great leaders had done.\n  That was what the Conservation and Reinvestment Act was about--to \ntake a portion of the Anglo revenue, which the United States receives \nfrom Outer Continental Shelf drilling, and invest those funds in a \nbetter America for our future generations.\n  I submit that this opportunity for a bold, grand idea in the \ntradition of Jefferson and Roosevelt--an idea that could have come \nclose to being a legacy--is now, in fact, sadly a travesty, a mere \nshadow of what could have been. I suggest that there is no more \ninappropriate time for us to turn timid and retreat from what could \nhave been. When Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United \nStates in the early part of the 20th century, the United States had a \npopulation of approximately 125 million people. By the end of the 20th \ncentury, the United States has a population of 275 million people.\n  The U.S. Bureau of the Census projects that by the year 2100--100\n\n[[Page S9834]]\n\nyears from today--the population of the United States will be 571 \nmillion Americans. It is our obligation--as it was Thomas Jefferson's \nand Theodore Roosevelt's and those who supported their vision of the \nfuture--to begin the process of preparing for that next America that is \ngoing to arrive in the next 100 years. That next America has to be our \ngrandchildren. They are the people who are going to make up the 571 \nmillion Americans in the year 2100. It is possible that some of the \nyoung people who are here with us today may live through this full \ncentury and experience what that new America is going to be like. How \nwell we are preparing for that new America is being tested by what we \nare doing today. I am sad to say that in the retreat from providing for \nan ongoing, significant source of funding to provide for the variety of \nneeds of that new America, we are failing the next America.\n  Like the occupant of the chair, I have served as Governor of a State. \nI believe one of the most lamentable aspects of this failure is the way \nin which we have treated States. States are our partners in this great \nFederal system. Probably of all the contributions the United States has \nmade to the theory of government, none has been as significant as the \nconcept of federalism: That we could have within 1 sovereign nation 50 \nStates that were sovereign over areas of their specific responsibility, \nand that in many areas those sovereignties would merge in respectful \npartnerships in order to accomplish goals that were important to the \ncitizens of an individual State but also important to all Americans.\n  Many of the programs that were the objective of the CARA legislation \nwere in that category of respectful partnerships between the Federal \nGovernment and the State. For those respectful partnerships to be \neffective, in my judgment, there are some prerequisites. One of those \nprerequisites is that on both sides of the partnership there must be \nsustainability, predictability; both partners must bring to the table \nthe capacity to carry out their mutually arrived at plans and visions.\n\n  The CARA legislation, as it was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives--I might say by an overwhelming vote--and voted out of \nthe Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, had such a vision \nbecause it would have provided through this source of funds of the \nOuter Continental Shelf a guaranteed source of revenue to meet the \nFederal side of that respectful partnership with the States in \neverything from urban parks to historic district redevelopment, to the \ndevelopment of urban forests--a whole array of needs which our growing \npopulation requires.\n  With that assured source of financing, there could have been some \nother things accomplished. One would have been good, intelligent \nplanning as to how to go about using public funds to the greatest \nbenefit. Part of that planning would have been to have set priorities \nin which people would have had some confidence. When you say \npriorities, by definition, you are telling some people they are at the \nabsolute front of the line, other people are a few spaces back, and \nsome are toward the end of the line.\n  But if those who stand in line believe their turn in fact will come \nif they are patient and, if they do the planning that is asked of them, \nthey will finally receive their reward through Federal participation in \nfunding, I am afraid that what we have just done is lost that \nopportunity because of what we have in the conference report of the \nDepartment of the Interior. Under title VII, the land conservation, \npreservation, and infrastructure improvement title, which is offered to \nus as the substitute for CARA, we have this language:\n\n       This program is not mandatory and does not guarantee annual \n     appropriations. The House and the Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations have discretion in the amounts to be \n     appropriated each year, subject to certain maximum amounts as \n     described herein.\n\n  So we have no respectful partnership, and therefore we have no \nreasonable expectation that the kind of goals that were at the heart of \nthe CARA program will in fact be realized. I suggest that our partners \nin the States who, from virtually every organization that represents \nState interests, had advocated passage of the CARA legislation will \nfind this to be a particularly disappointing and sad day.\n  In addition to the fact that we are squandering the opportunity that \ncomes with the enthusiasm of the new century, in addition to the fact \nthat we are failing to meet the challenge for the new America, which \nwill occupy this great Nation in the next hundred years, and in spite \nof the fact that we have acted in an arrogant and disrespectful way to \nour partners, the States, there is yet another tragedy in what is being \nproposed. That tragedy is our national parks.\n  On July 25, 2000, the Senate Energy Committee passed its version of \nthe CARA bill, containing what I consider to be one of its most \nimportant aspects--the national park protection fund. This fund would \nprovide $100 million in assured, guaranteed funding for the parks for \n15 years, $100 million a year, for the purpose of natural, cultural, \nand historic resource preservation and restoration. This was a critical \nsection of the bill. It was mirrored after a bill which I introduced in \nApril of 1999. During our markup in the Energy Committee, I supported \nthis section. I did believe that it should have included even more \nmoney to adequately address the needs of our national parks.\n  I might say in that view that I was joined by a number of members of \nthe Energy Committee who advocated a more significant commitment to the \nprotection of our national parks. I am blessed to say that since this \nbill was reported by committee, we have had even another ally join in \nthis effort. We have had the Republican candidate for President of the \nUnited States, Gov. George W. Bush. Governor Bush, on September 13 of \nthis year, stated that he would commit to spend $5 billion on \nmaintenance of the national parks over the next 5 years ``to renew \nthese national treasures and reverse the neglect.''\n  We are rejecting the advice and recommendation of the Governor of \nTexas, the Republican nominee for President of the United States, with \nthis legislation because what it provides for national parks \nmaintenance is only $50 million for 1 year. Fifty million dollars for 1 \nyear is all we are going to be voting for if we accept this conference \nreport--not the $5 billion over 5 years that Governor Bush has wisely \nrecommended we invest in the restoration and revitalization of the \ngreat national treasure of our national parks.\n  The conference report today takes a tremendous step in the opposite \ndirection in terms of a commitment for the rejuvenation of our national \nparks. It is wholly inadequate. I rise today to plead for our national \nparks.\n  As Senator Lott said at a press conference in support of the CARA \nlegislation earlier this year, even Kermit the Frog supports this bill. \nTo borrow a phrase from America's favorite frog, ``It's not easy being \ngreen.'' It is also no simple matter maintaining the beautiful pinks \nand rich browns of Utah's canyons, the bright reds and oranges of \nVirginia's leaves in the fall, and, of course, the myriad colors that \ncomprise America's Everglades. It is not easy. But it is critically \nimportant. It is our responsibility.\n  The parks tell the story of what and who we are and how we came to \nbe. They contain the spirit of America. Maintaining these national \ntreasures takes commitment to conservation and environmental \npreservation. That commitment takes money--reliable, sustainable, \npredictable money--in order to be able to undertake the kinds of \nprojects which are necessary to preserve our great natural and cultural \nheritage.\n  There are many examples I might use to demonstrate this necessity for \na sustained, reliable source of money to protect our heritage. Let me \njust use one that I have had the occasion to visit twice in the last \nfew months; that is, Ellis Island.\n  Ellis Island, as we all know, is the place through which some 15 \nmillion persons seeking the freedom and liberty and opportunity of the \nUnited States first entered our country. It is a site which is seeping \nwith the history of America. It is a site which is composed of about \n40-some buildings, including the first public health hospital in the \nhistory of the United States; it is on Ellis Island.\n  You may have seen some television programs which were broadcast from\n\n[[Page S9835]]\n\nEllis Island that show a series of buildings which have been renovated \nto their 19th century style with brilliance and beauty. Unfortunately, \nwhat you do not see are the other 35 buildings in back of those that \nhave been rehabilitated. When you walk through those buildings, what \nyou see is some of the history of America crumbling literally before \nyour eyes and feet.\n  The reason for this crumbling is that there has not been an adequate, \nreliable source of funds to maintain this and many others of our \nnational heritage. The superintendent of the park told me that if she \nhad a reliable source of funds, she could organize a rational plan for \nthe rehabilitation of these historic buildings and, at considerable \nsavings to the taxpayers, commence the process of saving these \nbuildings.\n\n  What we have before us is not a bill that gives us the opportunity of \nsalvation. Rather, it is a program that virtually assures the \ndisintegration of Ellis Island and other invaluable parts of our \nNation's history and culture. Today, protection of our natural \nresources and our historic and cultural resources has fallen further \nand further behind.\n  Suffering takes many forms. Wildlife is suffering. In the park I know \nthe best, America's Everglades and the great Everglades National Park, \nthe number of nesting wading birds has declined 93 percent since the \n1930s. One study of 14 national parks found that 29 carnivores and \nlarge herbivores had disappeared since these parks were established and \nplaced under our trusteeship and protection. Only half the islands in \nthe Park Service's historic collections are cataloged.\n  Often it takes an act of individual intervention in order to save an \nimportant national treasure. I have had the good fortune to have my \ndaughter marry the son of a great American historian, David McCullough. \nDavid McCullough has sounded the national alarm at the disintegration \nof much of our historical and cultural treasures. One of those for \nwhich he sounded the alarm was the Longfellow house in Cambridge, MA. \nNot only was it the home of a great American family, it happened to be \nthe home where George Washington lived when he was establishing the \nfirst components of the American Colonial Army that would eventually be \nvictorious in the American Revolution--an extremely important site in \nAmerican history, a site which, lamentably, was collapsing.\n  David McCullough, a sophisticated person with considerable ability to \nenergize action on behalf of a worthy project, went to one of our \ncolleagues, Senator Kennedy, and brought to Senator Kennedy's attention \nwhat was happening at the Longfellow house in his State of \nMassachusetts. Senator Kennedy came to the Congress not too many years \nago and got specific funding for the Longfellow house. Now it is on the \nroad back to recovery.\n  But do we have to depend upon the convergence of a historian and an \ninfluential Senator to save our national heritage? Are we going to say \nit is important enough that we do this on a predictable, sustained, \nprofessional basis? We have that opportunity with the CARA Act. We are \nabout to lose that opportunity with this conference report.\n\n  Only 62 percent of conditions needed to preserve and protect the \nmuseum collections within our National Park System meet professional \nstandards for their protection. Considering only the park's portion of \nthe CARA compromise--words which I find objectionable--but of only the \npark's portion of this alleged CARA compromise, we have nearly 290 \nmillion reasons to oppose it. Those 290 million reasons are the 290 \nmillion persons who last year visited our Nation's parks. That number \ngrows each year as our children and our grandchildren take our place \namong the mountains, the forests, and the historic sites which comprise \nAmerica's National Park System. The parks are more than just popular \ndestinations. They are havens for more than 120 threatened and \nendangered species.\n  The National Park Service also oversees a trove of historic artifacts \nthat represent the story of human experience in North America, some 75 \nmillion items of our history.\n  We owe to future generations, we owe to our children and our \ngrandchildren, and their grandchildren, the chance to learn this story. \nWe owe them the same opportunity to appreciate the majestic beauty of \nthis land as we ourselves have been lucky enough to experience.\n  In the words of President Lyndon Johnson:\n\n       If future generations are to remember us with gratitude \n     rather than contempt, we must leave them more than the \n     miracles of technology. We must leave them a glimpse of the \n     world as it was in the beginning, not just after we got \n     through with it.\n\n  We are seeing that opportunity to leave to those future generations a \nglimpse of the world as it was in the beginning, we are seeing that \nopportunity unnecessarily and tragically slipping away.\n  A steady diet of green will keep our natural treasures healthy well \ninto the next century. We have the opportunity to do this. When the \nlegislation establishing our Outer Continental Shelf drilling program \nand the royalties that would be derived was established, the theory was \nwe would take the resources that we gathered as we depleted one natural \nresource, the petroleum and natural gas under our Outer Continental \nShelf, and we would use it precisely as a means of investment in the \nfuture of our country by investing it in the protection of our most \nvaluable natural historic and cultural resources.\n  That is the opportunity that the legislation which was introduced, \npassed overwhelmingly in the House, passed by the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources--and I am proud to say with the support of \nour Presiding Officer--gave us. It is an opportunity we are about to \nfritter away.\n  The CARA compromise does not achieve any of these significant goals. \nThis Senate will diminish itself in terms of its appreciation of our \nAmerican experience. We will diminish ourselves in terms of our \npolitical will. We will diminish ourselves as viewed by the history of \nour own grandchildren if we are to accept this compromise as being an \nadequate statement, the beginning of the 21st century of what we think \nour responsibilities to the future are.\n  I urge we defeat this conference report, that we defeat this feeble \ncompromise, and that we start again by bringing to the Senate floor the \nlegislation which has passed out of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources and give us an opportunity to debate it. Those who have some \nobjections should offer amendments. That is the democratic way. I am \nconfident it will pass and that it will be accepted by the House of \nRepresentatives, and signed with enthusiasm by the President, and then \nwe will be worthy of the offices we hold and worthy of our \nresponsibility to the American past and to the American future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to talk \nabout an issue which has commanded a lot of attention lately in this \nbody, an issue which has been a major concern of mine for a long time. \nThat is, prescription drug coverage under our Medicare program.\n  Prescription drugs, as we all know, are becoming an increasingly \nimportant, in fact, an essential component of our health care delivery \nsystem in the United States. Because of their increasing role in the \nimprovement of health outcomes, I believe a newly designed Medicare \nwould unquestionably include a prescription drug benefit. \nUnfortunately, Medicare is still operating under a 1965 model. Our \nseniors continue to lack this very essential coverage.\n  Over a year ago I introduced the Medical Ensuring Prescription Drugs \nfor Seniors Act, or MEDS, and this role would provide a prescription \ndrug benefit for all Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, and on a \nvolunteer basis. My plan would ensure that our neediest\n\n[[Page S9836]]\n\nseniors would get the assistance they need, when they need it, for as \nlong as they need it. And MEDS, as most other plans that have been \nintroduced in the Senate, is a comprehensive, Medicare-based approach \nand will take a few years to fully implement.\n  Though I fully support MEDS and will fight for its passage, I believe \nour seniors need some relief now. To that end, I am supporting Senator \nRoth's bill, which would send Federal funds back to the States today in \norder to establish or improve our prescription drug coverage \nimmediately for our seniors and those seniors who need that help and \ncoverage now.\n  I want to be clear, the only way that Congress will be able to \naddress the prescription drug needs of our seniors this year is to pass \nthe Roth proposal. We need to do it. Unfortunately, our friends on the \nother side of the aisle disagree with that view. They would rather work \nto push a massive Medicare-based plan which only seems to increase the \nburden on the majority of seniors through increased premiums, reduced \nbenefits, and more bureaucracy; in other words, create a bigger and \nbigger government bureaucracy to handle this.\n  I believe it is a backdoor tax increase on our seniors, which is both \nirresponsible, and it would be totally unacceptable, especially to \nthose who really need the help in the coverage to afford prescriptions.\n  The Democratic proposal, which Vice President Al Gore and others \nadvocate, is frought with a lot of problems. First, his plan would take \n8 years to be fully implemented--8 years. The Roth bill would go into \neffect today. The Vice President's plan would take 8 years to phase in.\n  You don't hear that when they talk about it, do you? But we all know \nthat our seniors cannot afford to wait 8 years, especially the neediest \nof our seniors' population, to start realizing a prescription drug \nbenefit under our Medicare program.\n  This is a part of the plan that often goes unmentioned and one that \nneeds to be highlighted. Either have a plan now that is immediate and \nprovides help to our seniors today, or pass a plan that costs more, \nreduces benefits, and asks our seniors to wait 8 years to have it fully \nimplemented under Medicare.\n  The second problem with the proposal is that when it is fully phased \nin, it will put a new tax on our seniors because it asks for premiums \nof $600 a year in new additional premiums over and above what they are \npaying. Above and beyond the fact that many seniors would find that \n$600 to be cost prohibitive, statistics suggest that the average senior \nuses only about $675 in prescription drugs in a year. I am not a \nmathematician by profession, but I can tell you when the proposal only \ncovers 50 percent of the costs of the prescription drugs to begin \nwith--so, in other words, after paying your $600-a-year premium, you \nhave to pay a 50-percent copay on all the drugs you consume, and I \nbelieve there is also a cap with it--it means that for the additional \n$600 premium, again a new tax on our seniors, the average senior would \nreceive at best $37.50 in benefits.\n\n  Considering the enormous financial burden this is going to place on \nan already ailing Medicare system, I am not sure the American people \nare going to want to assume what will inevitably be a new tax liability \nand at the same time risk the collapse of Medicare in order to prop up \na plan that delivers only pennies a year in prescription drug benefits.\n  Because it is a bit politically distasteful, supporters of this plan \nand similar measures fail to mention the cost of these proposals. They \nmake it sound as if this is going to provide Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage to all seniors at no cost. That is the way they always like to \npresent a lot of these plans, that somehow it is free. I don't know of \nmany seniors out there who believe they are going to get something for \nnothing. When was the last time they had a free lunch? They know that. \nOur seniors are smarter than that, but yet they are being told these \nare things we can provide free.\n  The bill supported by the Vice President and a number of my \ncolleagues will cost nearly $250 billion over the next 10 years. Aside \nfrom having to raid either the Social Security or Medicare trust funds \nto pay for it--and that is how they pay for it. They are going to take \nmoney from an ailing trust fund and try to shift it into expanding new \nbenefits and saying nobody has to pay for it but they are basically \nrobbing from Peter to pay Paul and weakening an already weak system.\n  An equally troubling fact is that it does nothing to modernize the \nMedicare program at all. It is basically just putting a Band-Aid over \nan old system that has problems; again, trying to bring in a 1965 model \nand adapt it to the year 2000. When the Medicare Commission actually \nmade these proposals, President Clinton pulled the plug. He did not \neven consider what this panel was recommending. But thanks to Senators \nFrist and Breaux, they are introducing this plan which makes sense, and \nthat is to overhaul, to reform Medicare, and to make sure prescription \ndrugs are an important part of that. But the Roth bill would be that \nstopgap in order to provide coverage today for our seniors until we can \nhave a real Medicare reform package.\n  In the absence of these important reforms, this plan offered by the \nVice President is nothing more than a prescription for disaster. The \nfunding comes out of the Social Security surplus, which, by the way, \nthe Vice President claims to wall off for only Social Security and only \nMedicare, but while they are doing that they are trying to expand these \nservices and say it is going to cost nothing. It is a free lunch, a \nfree ride. Nobody believes that can happen. Especially our seniors know \nthat there is no free lunch. Adding new demands on Medicare through the \nSocial Security surplus without reforming the program, again, will only \nput Medicare further at risk than what it is today.\n  Finally, their proposal provides no flexibility in terms of being \nable to opt in or opt out of their program. Again, our proposal is \nvoluntary. If it benefits you, you can get into it. If it doesn't \nbenefit you, don't; keep your own coverage as you have it today. But \nyou have a choice.\n\n  Again, these big government programs, the first thing they want to \neliminate is choice for the consumer, and in this case for our seniors. \nYou only have one shot under the Vice President's plan to get in and \nthat is it. Seniors, as they age into Medicare, need to make a \ndetermination whether they want to get in and save a few dollars a year \nat best, into a system that is going to cost them at least $600 a year \nin more taxes. If they take it and change their mind, it is simply too \nlate; they are stuck. They are either in or they are out.\n  I am happy and proud to have been one of the first to introduce a \nprescription drug plan in the Senate, and I am hopeful that by having \ndone so, my commitment to this issue and our Nation's seniors is \nunderscored. But, most importantly, I want to ensure that any effort we \nundertake in Congress will actually help to provide assistance to those \nwho truly need it and provide it sooner rather than later; not with a \nplan where we are going to try to solve the problems for 6 or 10 \npercent of the population, but the way they try to solve it is to \nmandate 100 percent of Americans get involved in their big new \nbureaucracy for prescription drugs. Importantly, too, my plan does not \nuse the Social Security surplus which I have also secured in a lockbox.\n  I reiterate, I believe our seniors deserve a prescription drug plan \nthat is truly voluntary, one that will not jeopardize the future of \nMedicare, and one which will not place on the backs of taxpayers any \nadditional burdens or liabilities. Instead, I am hopeful the Senate can \npass legislation immediately returning the money to the States to \nprovide relief while strengthening Medicare and implementing the long-\nterm comprehensive benefit that does not result in a new tax on our \nseniors. We have an historic opportunity to help our Nation's seniors. \nI believe we should act now, this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to my colleague, I am concerned that several of \nyour criticisms sound to me as if they are really criticisms against \nMedicare, as opposed to the idea of prescription drugs being offered \nthrough Medicare. For instance, did you just say that you\n\n[[Page S9837]]\n\nfelt it was inappropriate that there be a premium charged for the \nprescription medication benefit?\n  Mr. GRAMS. To answer the Senator from Florida, I am not opposed to a \nsurcharge or a prescription charge but a charge that is going to assume \na new $600-per-year additional tax or cost on our seniors while \nproviding very little in benefit that would overcome that cost.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So you are opposed to the principle of a shared cost \nprogram between beneficiaries and the Federal Government in delivering \nMedicare; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is not true. The Senator from Florida is inaccurate \nbecause in my own plan, my MEDS program is a copay and also has \ndeductibles built in depending on wages or income. It is worked through \nMedicare and through the HCFA program.\n  So, no, I do not oppose a shared responsibility or liability but one \nthat is a benefit to seniors, and not one that drains their pocketbooks \nfor little or no benefit.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. 1, you understand, of course, that Part B of Medicare \nrequires, first, a voluntary election to participate and then, second, \na monthly premium which today is approximately $45?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. You also understand the Vice President's plan would \nrequire a second voluntary election to participate in prescription \ndrugs, and the monthly fee would be $25, or $300 a year, not $600 a \nyear? Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAMS. But his plan is not voluntary. You can voluntarily get in, \nbut when you do not get in, you can't reapply. That is my \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. 2, do you understand Part B of Medicare--I am talking \nabout Medicare as it existed for 35 years--requires the exact same \nelection process as the Vice President's plan would require for \nprescription drugs? He is doing nothing beyond what we have done for 35 \nyears in Part B of Medicare; that is, the physicians and outpatient \nservices. Do you agree with that?\n  Mr. GRAMS. My understanding is that in order to be a part of the Vice \nPresident's plan of receiving prescription drug coverage, one must pay \na $50 premium per month, or new tax, in order to be involved in the \nsystem. You have one choice, one chance to get in or you are left out. \nSo you are putting pressure on seniors at whatever age. Then, when you \naverage in what an average senior consumes today in prescription drugs, \nit is very little if any benefit at all.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. 1, it is $25 a month or $300 a year. No. 2, it is a \nvoluntary election, exactly the same way that you had a voluntary \nelection for Part B for 35 years.\n  No. 3, you understand that the plan of the Vice President is a \nuniversal plan like all the rest of Medicare; over 39 million Americans \nwho are eligible for Medicare are eligible to make the voluntary \nelection to participate in the prescription drug benefit?\n  Mr. GRAMS. So you are saying the President's plan, when fully phased \nin, will be only $25 per month or are you talking about the initial \nplan with the coverage available with the caps and coverage?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am talking about the plan that will be in effect in the \nyear 2002 when we adopt this plan. It will be a voluntary plan. It will \nbe a plan which will be affordable. It will not only give you the \nbenefit of access to 50-percent coverage of your immediate prescription \nmedication cost, but it will also give you, after you pay $4,000, a \nstop loss, a catastrophic intercept which says, beyond that point, the \nFederal Government will pay all of your prescription drug bills.\n  That is, in my opinion, the most important part of this plan because \nthe fear of many seniors, and the thing they see as the potential \nthreat to not only their health but their economic security, is that \nthey are going to fall into a serious illness where suddenly their \nprescription drug costs are not $20 or $30 a month but are $800 or \n$1,000 a month.\n  The Vice President's plan assures that after you have paid $4,000, \nthen you will have a stop loss against any further payments. Don't you \nthink that is a pretty significant security for America's seniors?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I disagree with the Vice President--if I may reclaim my \ntime--and I will tell you why. Because, as you said, when it goes into \neffect in 2002, it is not fully implemented for 6 to 8 years. You might \nstart off with a low payment, but it escalates to $50-a-month premiums \nfully implemented, and it does provide you have to pay 50 percent, up \nto $4,000.\n  To compare that with my MEDS plan, we have a $25 copay per month, \n$300 per year. We do not have a cap for people below 135 percent of \npoverty. So they will get any amount of drugs for $300 a year compared \nto the President's $4,000. For some who are on the edge of poverty, \nthey do not have the $4,000, I say to the Senator, to pay for this.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As you understand, all of the plans provide for no \npayment for persons who are above the Medicaid eligibility limit but \ngenerally below 175 percent of poverty, which means approximately \n$14,000 or $15,000. They would pay no premium. They would pay no \ncopayments. They would have no deductibles. For those people, the Vice \nPresident's plan would be fully available without any charges.\n  What we are talking about in both plans is the people who are above \n175 percent of poverty. What percentage subsidization would you provide \nfor persons over 175 percent of poverty?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Not to belabor this debate, and it is good we are talking \nabout it because the American people need to hear it, but over that \namount of money you are talking about, we would still have a $25 copay, \nthe $150 deductible, and then no cap at all on coverage. If you were at \nthat income level, you would probably pay, at most, $175 per month for \nthe whole year or $175 per month per year.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So you pay $175 a month, is your premium.\n  Mr. GRAMS. If you are going to have the $25 copay and $125 a month \ndeductible.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I had been there last night--and I know the rules of \nthe first debate precluded having a chart--I would have loved to have \nhad a chart and asked Governor Bush to fill in the blanks. Since we do \nnot have Governor Bush here but you are advocating the first phase of \nhis plan, let me ask you about a few of the blanks on his chart.\n  What would be your coverage for persons over 175 percent of poverty? \nWhat percentage of their prescription drug costs would you cover?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I am not here to try to defend or put words in----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am trying to get the facts.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I am trying to defend the plan I have offered, and that is \nmy MEDS program.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me ask about your plan. For persons over 175 percent \nof poverty, what percentage of the prescription drug expenses would you \nhave the plan cover as opposed to that for which the individual would \nbe responsible?\n  Mr. GRAMS. It would cover 100 percent of everything over a $25 copay \nand a $150-a-month deductible for those who are in that income level or \nabove.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So it would be a $150 monthly deductible and a $25 copay?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is that copay per prescription filled?\n  Mr. GRAMS. For the month, yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thought $150 a month was the deductible. There is a \ncopay beyond that?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How is that calculated?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Twenty-five dollars of the prescription.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The plan would pay 25 percent----\n  Mr. GRAMS. That is the deductible. The individual would pay 25 \npercent of the cost of the prescription, and then if they were at an \nincome level you are talking about, it would be a $150 deductible with \nno caps or limits for the year; not the $4,000 you are talking about.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What do you estimate to be the cost of that plan that has \na $150 deductible and $25 copay?\n  Mr. GRAMS. We have tried, but we have not had it scored yet and have \nnot been able to get the numbers, but some of the projections we have \nsay it will be under $40 billion a year, not the 258 or 253 the Vice \nPresident is talking about.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How can you offer a more generous plan by having the \nbeneficiary pay only 25 percent as opposed\n\n[[Page S9838]]\n\nto the Vice President's 50 percent and yet have such a lower cost?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Because what we are trying to do is target those who need \nthe help, and that is about 6 or maybe 10 percent of the population. \nWhat the Vice President is doing and what you are talking about is \nbringing 100 percent of Americans under a new national program where \nthe Government is going to be the purchaser and the dispenser of these \nprescriptions. I reject that type of a plan.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will conclude these questions by going \nback to my first assertion. We are not talking about prescription drugs \nthrough Medicare; we are talking about an assault against the basic \nprinciples of Medicare itself. That is a universal program, not a \nprogram limited by class to only the poor and near poor of America: \nThat is a voluntary program. That is a shared cost program between the \nbeneficiary and the Federal Government. That is a comprehensive program \nthat covers all of the necessary health care for older Americans. And, \nas I believe the Senator stated in his introductory comments, nobody \nwould develop Medicare today, in 2000, without having a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  When you attack all those principles that are the foundation of \nMedicare, what you are really doing is attacking one of the programs \nwhich has made the greatest contribution to lifting 39 million \nAmericans into levels of respect and security and well-being of any \nprogram that the Federal Government has ever developed. The American \npeople need to hear that this debate is not just about prescription \ndrugs; it is about a frontal assault against Medicare. If this \nphilosophy prevails, that is where the battleground will be.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Reclaiming my time, not to leave the impression that by \nany means this is an assault on Medicare, because the plan I have \nproposed and outlined is handled and complemented through Medicare. I \nknow they like to always say the Republicans are making an assault \nagainst Medicare and somehow we want to end the program of providing \nthis help and assistance to millions of seniors across the country. \nThat is simply not true.\n  This plan does nothing to make an assault on Medicare or the benefits \nit provides today, but it also does not turn a prescription drug \nprogram into a national prescription drug program run and handled by \nthe Government, and that is basically my belief of what is outlined \nhere.\n  We will work to preserve and strengthen Medicare, and that includes \nadding an affordable prescription drug plan that will take care of the \nneediest of the seniors in our society today.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to get engaged in that discussion. I guess we will \nhave time for that later. But the fact is, I think the Senator from \nFlorida is correct. What we are seeing here, really, is a continuation \nof Newt Gingrich's philosophy that Medicare should wither on the vine. \nWe all remember that. That was this ``Contract on America.'' That was \nNewt Gingrich's philosophy. I think we see it further taking place here \ntoday.\n  The Senator from Minnesota, I think, is basically going down that \nsame path that Governor Bush is. Basically, what they have envisioned \nis a prescription drug program where, basically, if you are poor, you \nare on welfare, and you get it. If you are rich, you don't need it, and \nyou pay for your own or you can belong to your own insurance plan and \npay for it, or maybe you have an employer-sponsored program. But if you \nare the middle class, and you are in that middle group, you are paying \nthe bill for both of them. You are paying for the tax breaks for the \nwealthy, and you are paying for the welfare benefits for the poor so \nthey can get their prescription drugs. But you, in the middle class, \ndon't get anything. If you do, in fact, get in this program, you will \nbe paying and paying and paying and paying.\n  The Republicans have never liked Medicare. They did not like it when \nit came in, and they have never liked it since. So they just keep \ncoming up with these kinds of programs that sound nice, but basically \nit is designed to unravel Medicare and let it wither on the vine.\n  Mr. President, I want to take to the floor today again to speak about \nthe lack of due process in the Senate regarding judgeships, and \nespecially the nomination of Bonnie Campbell for a position on the \nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Her nomination has now been pending for 216 days. Yesterday, the \nSenate voted through four judges. Three of them were nominated and \nacted on in July; one was nominated in May. Bonnie Campbell was \nnominated in March. Yet those got through, but they are holding up \nBonnie Campbell. Why?\n  Maybe it is because she has been the Director of the Violence Against \nWomen Office in the Justice Department for the last 5 years; that \noffice which has implemented the Violence Against Women Act, which, by \nall accounts, has done an outstanding job.\n  Maybe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not want any \nwoman that is qualified to be an appeals court judge. Maybe that is why \nthey are holding it up. Maybe it is because she has done such a good \njob of implementing the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Maybe they are holding her up because they think there are enough \nwomen on the circuit court. Of 148 circuit judges, only 33 are women; \n22 percent. But maybe my colleagues on the Republican side think that \nis enough women to have on the circuit court.\n  I have said time and time again--and I will say it every day that we \nare in session--that Bonnie Campbell is not being treated fairly, not \nbeing accorded, I think, the courtesy the Senate ought to afford \nsomeone who is well qualified.\n  All the paperwork is done. All the background checks are done. She is \nsupported by Senator Grassley, a Republican, and by me, a Democrat from \nher home State. That may rarely happen around here. So Bonnie Campbell \nis not being treated fairly.\n  Senator Hatch, the other day, said, well, the President made some \nrecess appointments in August, and that didn't set too well with some \nSenators. But what has that got to do with Bonnie Campbell? Maybe they \ndon't like the way President Clinton combs his hair, but that has \nnothing to do with Bonnie Campbell being a judge on the circuit court.\n  Is Senator Hatch really making the argument that because President \nClinton made some recess appointments that he didn't like, so that \ngives him an adequate excuse and reason to hold up Bonnie Campbell? I \nfind that an interesting argument and an interesting position to take.\n\n  I have heard that there was a news report that came out today that \nsome of the Senators on the other side had some problems with her \nviews. Now, this is sort of general. I don't know what those problems \nare. But that is why we vote. If some Senator on the other side does \nnot believe Bonnie Campbell is qualified or should not be a Federal \njudge in a circuit court, bring her name out, let's debate it. These \nare debatable positions. Let's talk about it. And then let's have the \nvote.\n  If someone feels they can't vote for her, that is their right and \ntheir obligation. But we did not even have that. We do not even have \nher name on the floor so we can debate it because the Judiciary \nCommittee has bottled it up.\n  Then I was told her name came in too late. It came in just this year. \nI heard that again. That is also in the news reports today, that \nsomehow this vacancy occurred a year ago, but her name did not come \ndown until March.\n  So I did a little research.\n  In 1992, when President Bush--that is the father of Governor Bush--\nwas President in 1992, and the Senate was in Democratic hands, we had \n13, 14 judges nominated; 9 had hearings; 9 were referred; and 9 were \nconfirmed--all in 1992. Every judge who had a hearing got referred, got \nacted on, and got confirmed.\n  Now, that was OK in 1992, I guess, when there was a Republican \nPresident and a Democratic Senate. But I guess it is not OK when we \nhave a Democratic President and a Republican Senate.\n  Here we are. This chart shows this year, we have had seven nominees, \nincluding Bonnie Campbell. We have had two hearings; we have had one \nreferred; one confirmed--one out of seven. So this kind of story I am \nhearing, that her nomination came in too late, is\n\n[[Page S9839]]\n\njust pure malarkey. This is just another smokescreen.\n  Circuit judges. They say: Well, it's a circuit court. There's an \nelection coming up. We might win it, so we want to save that position \nso we can get one of our Republican friends in there.\n  Well, again, in 1992, circuit nominees, we had nine: six were acted \non in July and August, two in September, and one in October. Yet in the \nyear 2000, we had one acted on this summer, and we are in the closing \ndays of October. No action.\n  So, again, it is not fair. It is not right. It is not becoming of the \ndignity and the constitutional role of the Senate to advise and consent \non these judges.\n  Thirty-three women out of 148 circuit judges; 22 percent--I guess my \nfriends on the other side think that is fine. I do not think it is \nfine.\n  Again, everything has been done. All of the paperwork has been in, \nand here she sits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9839-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--NOMINATION OF BONNIE CAMPBELL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I object on behalf of the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wish I knew why people are objecting. Why are they \nobjecting to Bonnie Campbell? Why are they objecting to a debate on the \nSenate floor? Why are they objecting to bringing her name out so that \nwe can have a discussion and a vote on it?\n\n  I want to make clear for the Record, it is not anyone other than the \nRepublican majority holding up this nominee. Every day we are here--I \nknow there will be an objection--I am going to ask unanimous consent \nbecause I want the Record to show clearly what is happening here and \nwho is holding up this nominee who is fully qualified to be on the \ncircuit court for the Eighth Circuit.\n  Now I want to turn my comments to something the Senator from \nMinnesota was talking about; that is, the prescription drug program \nfrom the debate last night. Quite frankly, I was pretty surprised to \nhear Governor Bush talking about his prescription drug program. He \ncalls it an ``immediate helping hand,'' and there is a TV ad being \nwaged across the country to deceive and frighten seniors. He talks \nabout ``Mediscare''; that was Bush's comment last night. He accused the \nVice President of engaging in ``Mediscare,'' scaring the elderly.\n  If the Bush proposal for prescription drugs were to ever go into \neffect, seniors ought to be scared because what it would mean would be \nthe unraveling of Medicare, letting Medicare wither on the vine.\n  Let's take a look at the Bush proposal. We know it is a two-stage \nproposal. First, it would be turned over to the States. It would \nrequire all 50 States to pass enabling or modifying legislation. Only \n16 States have any kind of drug benefit for seniors. Each State would \nhave a different approach.\n  The point is, many State legislatures don't meet but every 2 years. \nEven if we were to enact the program, there are some State legislatures \nthat wouldn't get to it for a couple years.\n  Our most recent experience with something such as this is the CHIP \nprogram, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which Congress \npassed in 1997. It took Governor Bush's home State of Texas over 2 \nyears to implement the CHIP program. It is not immediate.\n  He calls it ``immediate helping hand.'' It won't be immediate because \nStates will have a hard time implementing it. In fact, the National \nGovernors' Association says they don't want to do it. This is the \nNational Governors' Association:\n\n       If Congress decides to expand prescription drug coverage to \n     seniors, it should not shift that responsibility or its costs \n     to the states.\n\n  That is exactly what Bush's 4-year program does. Beyond that, his \nplan only covers low-income seniors. Many of the seniors I have met and \ntalked with wouldn't qualify for Bush's plan.\n  A recent analysis shows that the Bush plan would only cover 625,000 \nseniors, less than 5 percent of those who need help. His plan is not \nMedicare; it is welfare. What the seniors of this country want is \nMedicare, not welfare. Seniors would likely have to apply to a State \nwelfare office. They would have to show what their income is. If they \nmake over $14,600 a year, they are out. They get nothing, zero.\n  After this 4-year State block grant, then what is his plan? Well, it \ngets worse. Then his long-term plan is tied to privatizing Medicare; \nagain, something that would start the unraveling of Medicare. It would \nforce seniors to join HMOs.\n  So under Governor Bush's program, after the 4-year State program, \nthen we would go into a new program. It would be up to insurance \ncompanies to take it. So seniors who need drug coverage would have to \ngo to their HMO. They would not get a guaranteed package. The premium \nwould be chosen by the HMO, the copayment chosen by the HMO, the \ndeductible chosen by the HMO. And the drugs you get? Again, chosen by \nthe HMO.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for at least a \ncouple more minutes to finish up. I didn't realize I was under a time \nschedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Bush's plan would leave rural Americans out in the cold. \nThirty percent of seniors live in areas with no HMOs. And contrary to \nwhat the Senator from Minnesota said, if I heard him correctly, under \nthe Bush program, the Government would pay 25 percent of the premiums \nand Medicare recipients would have to pay 75 percent.\n\n  The Bush program basically is kind of scary. Seniors ought to be \nafraid of it, because if it comes into being, you will need more than \nyour Medicare card. You will need your income tax returns to go down \nand show them how much income you have, how many assets you have. If \nyou qualify, you are in; if you don't, you are out. That would be the \nend of Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \ntime as needed, yielded off the continuing resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9839-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9839-S9842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CHILDREN'S HEALTH ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss and \nshare with my colleagues very good news, some news that is bipartisan, \nthat reflects what is the very best of what the Senate is all about.\n  It has to do with a bill called the Children's Health Act of 2000, a \nbill that is bipartisan, that reflects the input of probably 20 to 30 \nindividual Senators on issues that mean a great deal to them based on \ntheir experience, their legislative history, what they have done in the \npast, their personal experiences, and responding to their constituents. \nThis bill passed the Senate last week and passed the House of \nRepresentatives last week and will be sent to the President of the \nUnited States sometime either later tonight or tomorrow.\n  The Children's Health Act of 2000, is a comprehensive bill, a bill \nthat forms the backbone of efforts to improve the health and safety of \nyoung people today, of America's children today. But equally important, \nit gathers the investments to improve the health, the well-being of \nchildren of future generations.\n  It is fascinating to me because it was about a year or a year and a \nhalf ago that Senator Jeffords and I, after working on this particular \npiece of legislation for a couple of years, reached out directly across \nthe Capitol to Chairman Bliley and Representative Bilirakis to work \ntogether to address a\n\n[[Page S9840]]\n\nwhole variety of children's health issues, including day-care safety, \nmaternal, child, and fetal health, pediatric public health promotion, \npediatric research, efforts to fight drug abuse, and efforts to provide \nmental health services for our young people today.\n  The good news, with all of the other debates that are going on and \nthe partisanship going back and forth, is that we in the Senate, as the \nCongress, we as a government have been successful in accomplishing this \nbipartisan, bicameral effort.\n  The bill that Congress now sends to the President includes two \ndivisions or two parts. The first part, part A, addresses issues \nregarding children's health. The second part, part B, addresses youth \ndrug abuse.\n  I would like to take a few moments to outline not the entire bill, \nbut a number of the provisions in this bill, because I think it \nreflects the care and the thoughtfulness with which this bill was put \ntogether.\n  The first is day care safety. Perhaps the most critical section of \nthe first part of this bill relates to day care health and safety. We \nbased it on the bill which was called, the Children's Day Care Health \nand Safety Improvement Act, a bill that I introduced, again, in a \nbipartisan way, with Senator Dodd on March 9 of this year.\n  Currently, there are more than 13 million children under the age of 6 \nwho, every day, are enrolled in day care. About a quarter of a million \nchildren in Tennessee go to day care. The day care safety bill \nrecognizes that it is our responsibility as a society, as a Government, \nto make sure that these day care facilities are as safe as possible, \nsuch as the health of children in child care is protected, so that when \na parent, or both parents, drop that child off at day care, they can \nrest assured that the child will be in a safe environment throughout \nthe day.\n  The danger in child care settings recently has become evident in my \nown State of Tennessee, again drawing upon how we learn and listen in \nour own States and bring those issues together and discussing them on \nthe floor of the Senate and then fashion them into a bill. Tragically, \nwithin the span of just two years, in one city in Tennessee, four \nchildren died in child care settings. In addition, one in five child \ncare programs in another city in Tennessee were found to have \npotentially put the health and safety of children at risk during the \nyear 1999.\n  But this isn't just a Tennessee concern. It affects parents and day \ncare centers and children nationwide. According to a Consumer Product \nSafety Commission Study in 1997, 31,000 children, ages 4 and younger, \nwere treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries they sustained \nwhile in child care or at school. More than 60 children have died in \nchild care settings since 1990. The statistics are startling. They are \nunacceptable. The thousands of parents dropping their children off and \nleaving them in the hands of child care providers every day deserve the \nreassurance that their children will be safe throughout the day.\n  A recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics reinforced this \nneed further when it reported a disturbing trend among children with \nSIDS, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. They looked at SIDS infants in day \ncare. There were 1,916 SIDS cases from 1995 through 97 in 11 States and \nthey found that about 20 percent, 391 deaths occurred in these day care \nsettings. Most troubling was the fact that in over half of the cases \nthe caretakers placed children on their stomach, where those same \nchildren at home were put to sleep on their backs by their parents. \nParents and advocates who are dedicated to helping to eliminate the \nincidence of SIDS have urged that child care providers be required to \nhave SIDS risk reduction education. When you hear these statistics and \nread these reports, you will agree. That is why I included a provision \nin this bill to carry out several activities, including the use of \nhealth consultants to give health and safety advice to child care \nproviders on important issues, including SIDS prevention.\n  Overall, our bill authorizes $200 million to States to help improve \nthe health and safety of children in child care settings. The grants \ncan be used for all sorts of activities, including child care provider \ntraining and education, inspections in criminal background checks for \nday care providers; enhancements to improve a facility's ability to \nserve children with disabilities; to look at transportation safety \nprocedures; to look and study and provide information for parents on \nchoosing a safe and healthy day care setting.\n  This funding could also be used to help child care facilities meet \nthe health and safety standards, or employ health consultants to give \nhealth and safety advice to child care providers. Many of us in this \nbody have grandchildren or children. Our highest concerns are for the \nsafety of those children and grandchildren. I understand the fears that \nso many parents have. Parents should not be afraid to leave their \nchildren in the care of a licensed child care facility. This bill, very \nsimply, helps ensure that our child care centers will be safer.\n\n  A second portion of the first part of this bill includes provisions \ncalled the Children's Public Health Act of 2000 which, again, had been \nintroduced in a bipartisan way by myself, Senator Jeffords, and Senator \nKennedy on July 13 of this past year. The purpose of this bill is to \naddress a whole variety of children's health issues, including maternal \nand infant health, including pediatric health promotion, including \npediatric research. Senator Orrin Hatch, whose name was mentioned on \nthe floor a few minutes ago, has been a real leader in another area of \ntraumatic brain injury. Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of \ndeath in the age group between 1 and 19 years. It is those \nunintentional injuries that is the number one cause of death. In fact, \nmore than 1.5 million American children suffer a brain injury each \nyear. Therefore, in this bill we strengthen the traumatic brain injury \nfor the CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the Health \nResources and Services Administration.\n  Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and are \nresponsible for about 30 percent of all pediatric admissions. This bill \nalso focuses on maternal and infant health. This legislation \nestablishes for the first time a National Center for Birth Defects and \nDevelopmental Disabilities at the CDC, to collect, analyze and \ndistribute data on birth defects.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes a program called Healthy Start, a \nprogram to reduce the rate of infant mortality and improve those \nperinatal or those outcomes around the time of birth, by providing \ngrants to areas with a high incidence of infant mortality and low \nbirthweight. To address the fact that over 3,000 women experience \nserious complications due to pregnancy and that two out of three will \ndie from complications in their pregnancy, this bill develops a \nnational monitoring and surveillance program to better understand the \nmaternal complications and mortality to decrease the disparities among \nvarious populations at risk of death and complications from pregnancy.\n  Asthma has an increasing incidence in this country and we don't know \nwhy. This bill combats some of the most common ailments. For instance, \nit provides comprehensive asthma services and coordinates the wide \nrange of asthma prevention programs in the Federal Government, to \naddress the most common childhood diseases. Asthma is a disease that \naffects over 5 million children in this country today.\n  Obesity is another problem. Again, we don't fully understand it, but \nit is a problem that is increasing in magnitude. Childhood obesity has \ndoubled in the past 15 years and produced almost 5 million seriously \noverweight children in adolescence. It is an epidemic. This bill \naddresses childhood obesity and supports State and community-based \nprograms promoting good nutrition and increased physical activity among \nAmerican youth.\n  Lead poisoning prevention. As I look at problems across Tennessee, I \nwas concerned to learn that in Memphis over 12 percent of children \nunder the age of 6 may have lead poisoning. Such poisoning, we know, \ncan contribute to learning disabilities, loss of intelligence, to \nhyperactivity, to behavioral problems.\n  In this bill, we include physician identification and training \nprograms on current lead screening policies. We track the percentage of \nchildren in health center programs, and conduct outreach and education \nfor families at risk for lead poisoning.\n\n[[Page S9841]]\n\n  The Surgeon General's report of May 2000 noted that oral health is \ninseparable from overall health, and that while a majority of the \npopulation has experienced great improvements in oral health \ndisparities affecting poor children and those who live in underserved \nareas represent 80 percent of all dental cavities in 20 percent of \nchildren.\n  Our bill encourages pediatric oral health by supporting community-\nbased research and training to improve the understanding of etiology, \npathogenesis diagnoses, or the why of the disease progression, the \ndiagnosis of the disease prevention and treatment of these pediatric \noral, dental, and cranial facial diseases. Behind all of those is \npediatrics research.\n  Our bill strengthens pediatric research. It does it in such a way by \nestablishing a pediatric research initiative within the National \nInstitutes of Health. It will enhance collaborative efforts. It will \nprovide increased support for pediatrics biomedical research and ensure \nthat opportunities for advancement in scientific investigations and \ncare for children are realized.\n  I should also mention childhood research protections, children who \nare involved in research, and how they are protected.\n  Included in this bill are provisions to address safety initiatives in \nchildren's research by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to review the current Federal regulations for the protection \nof children who are participating in investigations. It will address \nissues such as determining acceptable levels of risk and obtaining \nparental permission. They will report to Congress on how to ensure the \nhighest standards of safety.\n  This year the Senate Subcommittee on Public Health, which I chair, \nheld two important hearings relating to gene therapy trials and human \nsubject protections. We discovered a lapse of protection for \nindividuals participating in clinical trial research. In the next \nCongress, we intend to make the further review in updating of human \nsubject protections a major priority of this subcommittee.\n  The second part of this bill, division B of the bill, contains \nprovisions which address very specifically the curse of pediatric or \nyouth drug abuse.\n  The 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse conducted by the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reported that \n10.9 percent of youth ages 12 to 17 currently use illicit drugs. They \nfurther estimated that 11.3 percent of 12- to 17-year-old boys and 10.5 \npercent of 12- to 17-year-old girls used drugs in the past month.\n  Just as discouraging is the growth in youth alcohol abuse. These same \nreports reveal that 10.4 million current drinkers are younger than the \nlegal drinking age of 21 and that more than 6.8 million have engaged in \nbinge drinking.\n  Sadly, all of these numbers detailing youth substance abuse have \nrisen since 1992.\n  We addressed this tragedy again head on by incorporating the Youth \nDrug and Mental Health Services Act, which in a bipartisan way was \nintroduced by myself and Senator Kennedy last spring which was first \npassed in the Senate in November of 1999.\n  This youth drug bill addresses the problem of youth substance abuse \nby authorizing and by reauthorizing and improving and strengthening the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. This bill \nputs a renewed focus on youth and adolescence substance abuse and \nmental health services. At the same time, it gives flexibility, and it \ndemands greater accountability by States for the use of Federal funds.\n  Created in 1992 to assist States in reducing substance abuse and \nmental illness through these prevention and treatment programs, the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration provides \nfunds to States for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment \nprograms and activities, as well as mental health services. Its block \ngrants account for 40 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of all \nsubstance abuse and community mental health services.\n\n  In my own State of Tennessee, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Act provides more than 70 percent of overall funding for the \nTennessee Department of Health, Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse.\n  This bill very quickly accomplishes six critical goals. It promotes \nState flexibility by easing outdated or unneeded requirements and \ngoverning the expenditure of Federal block grants.\n  Second, it ensures State accountability by moving away from the \npresent system inefficiencies to a performance-based system.\n  Third, it provides substance abuse treatment services and early \nintervention substance abuse services for children and adolescence.\n  Fourth, it helps local communities treat violent youth and minimizes \noutbreaks of youth violence through partnerships among schools, among \nlaw enforcement activities, and mental health services. It ensures \nFederal funding for substance abuse or mental health emergencies.\n  And six, it supports and expands programs providing mental health and \nsubstance abuse treatment services to homeless individuals.\n  I will close by basically stating, once again, how excited I am about \nthis particular bill as we send it to the President. Over the next \nseveral days during morning business, I look forward to the opportunity \nof coming back and discussing this bill further with my colleagues who \nhave participated so directly in this particular bill.\n  I wish to respond very briefly to some comments that were made prior \nto me beginning my comments and the discussion on the floor in the hour \npreceding my comments that centered on prescription drug plans, the \nmodernization of Medicare, and who has the best approach. The debate \nwas very much between the Bush proposal and the Gore proposal. Let me \nvery quickly summarize the objections that seniors have to the Gore \nproposal and the prescription drugs. I can do this very quickly. It \nreally boils down to one sentence.\n  Under the Gore proposal, seniors will have only one choice, and they \nwill only have one chance to make that choice. Then there is no turning \nback. No. 1, the Gore prescription drug proposal is centered around a \nWashington-run drug HMO.\n  Why does that bother seniors? Because an HMO ultimately, and often we \nsee it too commonly today, sets prices, determines access, and can deny \nthat access without any choice.\n  No. 2, the Gore proposal has a $600 access fee. That means if you do \nnot use prescription drugs today, you are going to be paying $600 more \ntoday for getting nothing further; $600 access. That is before you buy \nany drugs whatsoever, a $600 access fee.\n  Our seniors are asking: Am I going to be one of the 13 million people \nwho do not even have $600 in prescription drug requirements a year? If \nso, if I join that plan, I automatically am going to be paying more for \nwhat I get today.\n  That is for 13 million seniors. Seniors are asking: Am I going to be \none of those 13 million?\n  Just one example: Under the Gore prescription drug proposal, if you \nhave $500 a year in prescription drugs, and you joined his plan, you \nare going to have to pay $530 for $500 worth of prescription drugs \ntoday.\n  That is why seniors are going to object. That is why the Gore plan \nreally, as I see it, has absolutely no chance for passage.\n  One other thing on the access fee: Let me tell our seniors very \ndirectly, if this bill were to pass today, if the Vice President were \nsuccessful in getting this bill through today, as a senior your \nMedicare premiums, how much you pay every month, is going to double \nfrom what it is today. Your Medicare premium for what you pay today for \nMedicare is going to double. It will go from $45 to $90 within 2 years, \nif you join this plan.\n\n  The third I said is one choice; one chance; no turning back. You have \none chance under the Gore proposal. If you are 64\\1/2\\ you either get \nthis prescription drug benefit or you don't.\n  The problem is that a lot of heart disease doesn't develop until you \nare 65, or 67, or 70, or 75, or 80, or 85 years of age. At 64\\1/2\\, if \nyou didn't go into these prescription drug programs, you have no chance \nto go into it in the future. You have only one chance; that is, when \nyou are 64\\1/2\\.\n  People say you only live 65, or 67, or 77 years of age. If you live \nto be 64\\1/2\\,\n\n[[Page S9842]]\n\nyou are likely to live to 80 or 85 years of age. You have one choice--a \nWashington HMO; one chance when you are 64\\1/2\\ and no turning back.\n  I make it very clear to our seniors what we are talking about when we \ntalk about the prescription drug plan proposed by Vice President Gore.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my \ncolleagues today in celebrating the passage of Children's Health Act, \nwhich Senators Frist, Kennedy, myself, and many others introduced \nearlier this year. The Children's Health Act passed the Senate on \nSeptember 22, the House on September 27, and is now one step closer to \nbecoming law.\n  The Children's Health Act will significantly improve the well-being \nof children in this nation. This bill authorizes prevention and \neducational programs, clinical research, and direct clinical care \nservices for child specific health issues.\n  President Clinton needs to sign this legislation into law now. Our \nnation's medical research and treatment systems must be encouraged to \nrecognize that children have unique needs. Without the initiative of \nthe Children's Health Act, research into many of the diseases and \ndisorders that effect children will be overlooked and neglected.\n  I am also excited that the Children's Health Act includes legislation \nthat the Senate passed last year to reauthorize the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The Youth Drug and \nMental Health Services Act is critically important for strengthening \ncommunity-based mental health and substance-abuse prevention and \ntreatment services.\n  We introduced SAMHSA reauthorization with strong bipartisan \ncosponsorship of many members of the HELP Committee. The service and \ngrant programs administered by SAMHSA have gone far too long without \nbeing reauthorized. We will now be able to improve access and reduce \nbarriers to high quality, effective services for individuals who suffer \nfrom, or are at risk for, substance abuse or mental illness, as well as \nfor their families and communities.\n  This legislation includes the formula compromise for the Substance \nAbuse Treatment Block Grant that was originally included in the 1998 \nomnibus appropriations bill. This is an issue of paramount importance \nto small and rural states, and I am pleased that this legislation \nratifies and continues the agreement reached in 1998.\n  The Children's Health Act and the Youth Drug and Mental Health \nServices Act are both the product of many months of work and \ncollaboration among its many stakeholders. We have come this far \nbecause of the bipartisan dedication of members of HELP Committee and \nespecially the leadership of Senator Frist and Senator Kennedy. I \ncommend them both for their considerable efforts to help so many \nchildren and American families.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues in the House for their strong \ncooperation and support. I am so proud of being involved in this effort \nand I think the entire House of Representatives and Senate should be \nvery proud of approving the Children's Health Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9842-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.J.

Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to discuss the \npossibility that there will be an effort very shortly to override \nOregon's assisted suicide law as part of a package that includes \nlegislation that is extremely important to the country, such as \nlegislation that would protect women from domestic violence, such as \nlegislation that would also deal with sex trafficking--an extraordinary \nscourge that victimizes women and children. I think it would be \nextremely unfortunate to victimize the victims in that way. It is \nclearly not in the public interest.\n  Oregon's assisted suicide law involves a very controversial matter. I \nhappen to be against assisted suicide, against the Oregon law, but the \nbill that cleared the Judiciary Committee on a 10-8 vote, a very narrow \nvote, is strongly opposed by the American Cancer Society. The American \nCancer Society believes that legislation will harm those in pain. I am \nvery hopeful that rather than tie this assisted suicide legislation to \nvitally needed legislation that would protect the victims of domestic \nviolence and women and children from sex trafficking, the Senate would \nadhere to the agreement that was entered into in August.\n  In August, on a bipartisan basis, the Senate made it very clear, and \nI specifically addressed this on the floor of the Senate, that I was \nopen to a fair fight, to an open debate on the assisted suicide \nquestion. In fact, I made it very clear that while I intend to use \nevery opportunity to speak on the floor of the Senate and make sure the \nMembers understand, for example, that the American Cancer Society \nbelieves this legislation will harm those in pain, I was willing to \naccept the will of the Senate on any cloture vote that might be \nscheduled. That was the agreement entered into in August. It provided \nfor a fair fight on this issue.\n\n  Tonight we are told that there may be the possibility, as I have \ntouched on, of an effort to override Oregon's assisted suicide law. By \nthe way, Oregon is the only State in the country that has such \nlegislation. It would be linked to the other desperately needed \nmeasures, such as the legislation to protect women victimized by \ndomestic violence. I hope that will not be the case. I would have to \noppose very strongly that kind of effort. It seems to me it is not in \nthe public interest, and it is particularly regrettable since it runs \ncontrary to the spirit of what was agreed to in August: That there \nwould be an opportunity for both sides on the floor of the Senate to \nhave this debate about assisted suicide; I would have a chance to \naddress the issue in some detail, but if there were an effort to file \ncloture, I would accept the will of the Senate on that measure.\n  In addition, we just learned in the last few minutes there is a \npossibility schoolchildren in 700 rural school districts around the \ncountry could also be held hostage because, again, there may be an \nobjection to the county payments bill legislation authored by Senator \nCraig of Idaho and myself--again, bipartisan. There may be an objection \nto that bill, again, on the grounds that somehow it should be examined \nsome more and possibly linked again to the assisted suicide question.\n  I think, again, these issues ought to be considered on the merits. \nThe county payments legislation passed this body by unanimous consent; \n100 Senators agreed to make sure that these schoolchildren in 700 rural \nschool districts got a fair shake. We have been working with the House. \nWe have now come up with an agreement among the House, the Senate, and \nthe White House. I think we can pass it 100-0 in the Senate. But we are \ntold someone is going to object to the county payments legislation for \nthe unrelated reason that they are not able to work out an arrangement \nthat allows them to throw the Oregon assisted suicide law in the trash \ncan on an arbitrary basis.\n  What the Senate worked out in August was fair to all sides. It \nensured that we have a chance to discuss the matter of assisted \nsuicide. It is a controversial question. I personally am\n\n[[Page S9843]]\n\nagainst assisted suicide. I voted against the Oregon law twice. I voted \nagainst Federal funding for assisted suicide. But I oppose the \nlegislation being advanced here to overturn Oregon's law for the same \nreasons that the American Cancer Society does. It will hurt patients in \npain.\n  I felt compelled to come to the floor of the Senate and express my \nconcern. I think it is not in the public interest to link desperately \nneeded legislation such as the bill to protect the victims of domestic \nviolence to the assisted suicide law. It is not appropriate to hold \nhostage the victims of sex trafficking to the Oregon assisted suicide \nlaw. I hope we will not see what has been raised as a possibility in \nthe last few minutes, and that is to hold up the county payments \nlegislation--which has been agreed to by the House and the Senate \nnegotiators and those at the White House--that would provide a lifeline \nto 700 rural school districts all across the country.\n  I hope that bill and the other vitally needed legislation will not be \nheld up because a Senator decides he or she wants to throw the assisted \nsuicide override into unrelated legislation that this country needs so \ngreatly. I made it clear last August I was open to being fair to both \nsides. That is why we entered into an agreement for a fair fight. I \nsaid I would respect the will of the Senate on a cloture vote if it \ncame to that. I think we ought to adhere to that August agreement and \nnot link this matter of throwing Oregon's law into the trash can by \ntucking it into unrelated legislation.\n  Frankly, those who are trying to tuck this override of Oregon's \nassisted suicide law into other legislation--such as the bill that \nwould protect the victims of domestic violence--are doing a tremendous \ndisservice to the women victimized by domestic violence, to the victims \nof sex trafficking, to the schoolchildren who desperately need that \ncounty payments legislation. These bills ought to be considered on \ntheir merits. That was agreed to back in August with respect to the \nassisted suicide legislation. I will do everything in my power to \ninsist the Senate adhere to what was agreed on last August.\n  I thank my colleague and friend from Illinois for his thoughtfulness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9843-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTERPARLIAMENTARY CONFERENCES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the efforts of \neveryone who worked to pass S. 1198, the Truth in Regulating Act. Last \nevening, the House passed this important legislation, following the \nSenate's passage of the bill on May 9th of this year. I was pleased to \nlearn of the final passage of this bill in the House, as this event \nmarks the culmination of the hard work of many Senators, \nRepresentatives, and members of their staffs in achieving another \nmilestone in our journey towards comprehensive regulatory reform.\n  This legislation establishes a process for Congress to obtain reviews \nof economically significant rules. These reviews, to be performed by \nthe General Accounting Office, will help Congress to better assess the \nimpact of federal agency regulations. I am confident that the \ninformation which will be provided in these reports will enable \nCongress and the public to have a better understanding of the potential \ncosts and benefits of these regulations, and I believe that these \nindependent analyses will help federal agencies to develop the most \nefficient and beneficial regulations for all concerned.\n  Mr. President, passage of this legislation would not have been \npossible without the hard work of several Senators on both sides of the \naisle. Both Senator Shelby and Senator Thompson have been active in \naddressing this issue for quite some time, and the efforts of Senator \nBond and the input of Senator Levin were also helpful to the process. \nSimilarly, I know that Representatives Kelly and McIntosh worked hard \non the House side to get the Truth in Regulating Act passed. The \ndetails of this legislation were worked out by countless hours of work \nby a number of staff members, both former and current, for these Senate \nand House members. In addition to members of my staff, these staff \nmembers include Paul Noe, Mark Oesterle, Suey Howe, Linda Gustitus, \nMeredith Matty, Barry Pineles, Larry McCredy, Barbara Kahlow, and Marlo \nLewis.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the President signing this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that last night the House \npassed on suspension the ``Truth in Regulating Act,'' S. 1198, and that \nthis legislation will now be sent to the President. S. 1198 will \nsupport Congressional oversight to ensure that important regulatory \ndecisions are cost-effective, well-reasoned, and fair.\n  The foundation of the ``Truth in Regulating Act'' is the right of \nCongress and the people we serve to know about important regulatory \ndecisions. Through the General Accounting Office, which serves as \nCongress' eyes and ears, this legislation will help us get access to \nthe cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, federalism assessment, and \nother key information underlying any important regulatory proposal. So, \nin a real sense, this legislation not only gives people the right to \nknow; it gives them the right to see--to see how the government works, \nor doesn't. GAO will be responsible for providing an evaluation of the \nanalysis underlying a proposed regulation, which will enable us to \ncommunicate better with the agency up-front. It will help us to ensure \nthat the proposed regulation is sensible and consistent with Congress' \nintent before the horse gets out of the barn. It will help improve the \nquality of important regulations. This will contribute to the success \nof programs that the public values and improve public confidence in the \nFederal Government, which is a real concern today.\n  Under the 3-year pilot project established by this legislation, a \nchairman or ranking member of a committee with legislative or general \noversight jurisdiction, such as Governmental Affairs, may request the \nGAO to review a proposed economically significant rule and provide an \nindependent evaluation of the agency regulatory analysis underlying the \nrule. The Comptroller General shall submit a report no later than 180 \ndays after a committee request is received. A requester may ask for the \nreport sooner when needed, as may be the case where there is a short \ncomment period or hearing schedule. The Comptroller General's report \nshall include an evaluation of the benefits of the rule, the costs of \nthe rule, alternative regulatory approaches, and any cost-benefit \nanalysis, risk assessment, and federalism assessment, as well as a \nsummary of the results of the evaluation and the implications of those \nresults for the rulemaking.\n  It is my hope that the ``Truth in Regulating Act'' will encourage \nFederal agencies to make better use of modern decisionmaking tools, \nsuch as cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. Currently, these \nimportant tools often are viewed simply as options--options that aren't \nused as much or as well as they should be. Over the years, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has reviewed and developed a voluminous \nrecord showing that our regulatory process is not working as well as \nintended and is missing important opportunities to achieve more cost-\neffective regulation. In April 1999, I chaired a hearing in which we \nheard testimony on the need for this proposal. The General Accounting \nOffice has done important studies for Governmental Affairs and other \ncommittees showing that agency practices--in cost-benefit analysis, \nrisk assessment, federalism assessments, and in meeting transparency \nand disclosure requirements of laws and executive orders--need \nsignificant improvement. Many other authorities support these findings. \nAll of us benefit when government performs well and meets the needs of \nthe people it serves.\n  A lot of effort and collaboration went into this legislation, which I \nthink is why the Senate and now the House could approve it with broad \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page S9844]]\n\nsupport. The Truth in Regulating Act is based on two initiatives--a \nbill originally sponsored by Senator Richard Shelby with Senators Lott \nand Bond, as well as a similar measure that I sponsored with Senators \nLincoln, Voinovich, Kerrey, Breaux, Landrieu, Inhofe, Stevens, Bennett, \nRobb, Hagel, and Roth. I particularly appreciate that my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle worked with me to pass this legislation. \nFrom the beginning, Senator Blanche Lincoln made this a bipartisan \ninitiative by joining me as cosponsor. Later, Senator Joseph Lieberman, \nthe Ranking Member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, worked with \nme to resolve his concerns before the Committee markup. This led the \nway for passage of this legislation through the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee by voice vote and through the Senate by unanimous consent.\n  Congresswoman Sue Kelly first proposed a bill for the congressional \nreview of regulations in the 105th Congress. After the Senate passed S. \n1198 by unanimous consent in May of this year, Chairman Dan Burton of \nthe Government Reform Committee advanced the bill through the House. I \nwant to thank Chairman Burton for his leadership as well as Sue Kelly \nfor her hard work that led to the final passage of the Truth in \nRegulating Act in the House.\n  I congratulate my colleagues in the House and Senate for pulling \ntogether to get the job done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9844-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ON DELAYS IN SENATE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5107\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I also wish to say a word today about NBC \nand Fox, the two television networks that have decided they would not \nbroadcast the Presidential debates live. I think it is deplorable, \nreally, that networks, that use the public airwaves, and have some \nresponsibility here with respect to the public good and public \ninterest, have decided that Presidential debates are not important \nenough to preempt other programming.\n  I notice that NBC said its local affiliates could make their own \njudgment. It is not as if NBC, according to Mr. Kennard, the Chairman \nof the Federal Communications Commission, has not interrupted regular \nprogramming previously. In fact, they have interrupted sports \nprogramming previously. NBC, last evening, said: We have a contract to \nshow a New York Yankees-Oakland Athletics playoff game. So they did not \nreally want to, on a national basis, show the Presidential debate live. \nThey did allow their affiliates to make that decision.\n  Mr. Kennard points out in an op-ed piece in the New York Times that \nin 1994 NBC was showing the NBA finals, the basketball finals, but they \ncut away from the basketball finals to follow that white Bronco that \nwas meandering around the highways of Los Angeles with O.J. Simpson in \nthe backseat. So they were able to cut away from the NBA finals to deal \nwith the O.J. Simpson saga in that white Bronco, we remember so well, \nbut they could not cut away from a playoff game--not the World Series; \na playoff game--in baseball to televise the Presidential debate.\n  Fox News is another story. They did not give their affiliates any \nchoice. From their standpoint, ``Dark Angel'' was important last night, \nentertainment programming. Apparently Fox News' entertainment \nprogramming is more important than televising the Presidential debates \nfor the American people.\n  I agree with Bill Kennard, the Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission. He wrote a piece that says: ``Fox and NBC Renege on a \nDebt.'' It seems to me, in this country we ought to take this system of \nours seriously. Presidential debates are very important. They have a \nwonderful and hallowed tradition in this country. It seems to me that \ntelevision networks have a responsibility to the American people to \nprovide live coverage of those debates.\n  I regret that NBC did not. And I would say to the NBC affiliate in \nWashington, DC, they decided to carry the debate. Thank you for doing \nthat. Good for them. But Fox News did not give any of their affiliates \nthat choice. I think they have made the wrong choice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9844-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9844-S9845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              VISIT BY FORMER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO CUBA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague Senator \nRoberts to draw attention to a most interesting report on our country's \npolicy toward Cuba. Some of my colleagues may know that a bipartisan \ngroup of former Members of Congress traveled to Cuba in September on a \nfact-finding mission for the United States Association of Former \nMembers of Congress. These four former members, John Brademas, Larry \nLaRocco, Fred Grandy, and Jack Buechner, did not travel as a group \nofficially invited by the Cuban Government, but rather traveled on \ntourist visas, a distinction that allowed the delegation more \nflexibility to meet with representatives of a wide cross section of \nCuban society, including religious and cultural leaders, as well as \nordinary Cuban citizens.\n  Upon returning to the United States, the delegation wrote a detailed \nreport concerning their visit to Cuba, and their recommendations on \nU.S.-Cuban policy. Remarkably, the recommendations contained in the \nreport were unanimous, and were markedly similar to the recommendations \nmade by two previous delegations in 1996, and 1999.\n  The report, which was released on September 5, states that ``United \nStates policy toward Cuba should be addressed on the basis first, of \nwhat is best for U.S. national interests, and second, what is best for \nCuba and the Cuban people.'' It goes on to observe that, as a policy \naimed at bringing about political change in Cuba, the regimen of \ncomprehensive sanctions and the embargo have become increasingly \nanachronistic. It calls upon Congress and the Administration to begin a \nphased reduction of sanctions against Cuba, and a first step, \nrecommends that current legislation on Capitol Hill to remove all \nrestrictions on the sales or gifts of food and medicines be enacted. \nThe report concludes with the observation that the delegation found \n``solid support among key independents'' in Cuba for this action.\n  Among other recommendations, the delegation suggested that the United \nStates establish a bank in Havana to authorize the sale of food and \nmedicine, that additional direct flights between the U.S. and Cuba be \nfacilitated, and steps taken to improve Internet communication between \nthe two countries.\n\n[[Page S9845]]\n\n  These recommendations were based on the perception by the traveling \ndelegation that the embargo on food and medicine is hurting common \nCuban citizens while failing to advance U.S. national security \ninterests on the island. The consensus in Cuba is that Fidel Castro is \nnot being affected by this embargo--he has all the food and medicine he \nneeds. The Cuban people recognize that the embargo hurts only \nthemselves, and are actively seeking help from the United States.\n  As we approach the final days of this session, hard-fought progress \ntoward an easing of the embargo may still bear fruit. While the Senate \nconsiders important legislation in this area, I urge my colleagues to \nread both the excerpts of the report at the end of my speech and the \nfull text of the Association report, which is available from the United \nStates Association of Former Members of Congress at 330 A Street, N.W., \nWashington, D.C. 20002. With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that portions of the delegation's report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      The United States Association of Former Members of Congress\n\n       We, the four members of a delegation of the United States \n     Association of Former Members of Congress (AFMC), visited \n     Cuba from May 26 to June 3, 2000, to explore first-hand the \n     current political, social and economic realities in that \n     country and to consider what steps might be taken to improve \n     relations between Cuba and the United States. Before \n     traveling we were briefed by officials in the Department of \n     State, key Members of Congress, leaders of non-governmental \n     organizations (NGOs) and officials of the Cuban Interests \n     Section in Washington, DC. The report you hold in your hands \n     reflects the collective deliberations of the delegation, and \n     lists six specific recommendations that we all endorse. As \n     you will see, we did not attempt to tackle every issue \n     involved in relations between our countries; in order to make \n     concrete and well-founded recommendations, we focused on a \n     core of matters that seemed particularly significant to us.\n       This fact-finding trip was the third and last in a series \n     funded by a grant from the Ford Foundation to the AFMC. The \n     other two trips were made in December 1996 and January 1999. \n     Our recommendations closely parallel those of the previous \n     two bipartisan delegations. To date, 15 former Members of \n     Congress (eight Republicans and seven Democrats) have \n     traveled to Cuba on these Ford Foundation-sponsored missions. \n     The recommendations of all three delegations have been \n     unanimous and are remarkably similar in terms of their \n     implications for U.S. policy.\n       Unlike the two previous delegations, we did not travel as a \n     group officially invited by the Cuban Government. We had the \n     appropriate documentation from the United States Government, \n     including a license from the Department of Treasury's Office \n     of Foreign Assets Control. Although the Cuban government did \n     not extend an official invitation to the delegation, we were \n     issued tourist visas.\n       The unofficial character of the visit allowed us to control \n     our own time, to have a wide variety of meetings and to gain \n     a much better idea of what a cross-section of the Cuban \n     population thinks. Unencumbered by the protocol demands that \n     normally accompany an officially approved trip, we were free \n     to visit a range of independent organizations, art centers, \n     church and church-sponsored groups and research centers. We \n     were also able to attend church services, visit markets, \n     travel into the countryside and talk freely to private \n     citizens. The people we met with ranged from an average woman \n     attending an Elian Gonzalez rally whom we engaged in \n     spontaneous conversation to Cuba's Minister of Foreign \n     Affairs; from the tour guide of the Partagas cigar factory in \n     Old Havana to the Papal Nuncio; from the director of the \n     government-sponsored cultural organization Casa de las \n     Americas to the head of the Roman Catholic relief \n     organization, Caritas; from an urban planner sympathetic to \n     the current regime in Cuba to some of the most controversial \n     figures--including Marta Beatriz Roque, Rene Gomez Manzano, \n     and Felix Bonne--and independent journalists living in that \n     country today.\n       On the ground in Cuba, we heard a remarkably diverse array \n     of voices and observed a highly complex set of political and \n     social circumstances; nonetheless, we submit this report in \n     the conviction that the implementation of our recommendations \n     can only further the interests of both the United States and \n     the people of Cuba.\n     John Brademas,\n       D--Indiana.\n     J. Buechner,\n       R--Missouri.\n     Fred Grandy,\n       R--Iowa.\n     Larry LaRocco,\n       D--Idaho.\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       Our recommendations are based on our extensive discussions \n     during our trip to Cuba. Our recommendations closely parallel \n     those of the two previous bipartisan delegations of the U.S. \n     Association of Former Members of Congress.\n       1. Congress and the administration should begin a phased \n     reduction of sanctions legislation, as defined in the Cuban \n     Democracy Act of 1992 (PL 102-484) and the Cuban Liberty and \n     Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 (Helms-Burton, \n     PL 104-114). As a first step, current legislation on Capitol \n     Hill (H.R. 3140 and S. 2382) to remove all restrictions on \n     the sales (for gifts) of food and medicines should be \n     enacted.\n       2. Serious consideration should be given to the \n     establishment of a U.S. bank in Havana if legislation to \n     authorize the sales of food and medicine is approved by \n     Congress and the Administration.\n       3. Opportunities for people-to-people contact between \n     citizens of the United States and Cuba should be expanded, \n     particularly through two-way exchanges in the fields of \n     education and culture. More links between educational, \n     cultural and non-governmental institutions in our two \n     countries should also be established.\n       4. The current ceilings on annual remittances from the \n     United States to Cuba should be raised significantly, if not \n     eliminated.\n       5. Steps should be taken to facilitate direct fights \n     between the United States and Cuba.\n       6. Steps should be taken to improve Internet communication \n     between the citizens of both countries. Initiatives aimed at \n     enabling Cuban citizens to gain greater access to the \n     Internet should be encouraged, and support should be given to \n     individuals and entities involved in the creation of websites \n     and other electronic platforms aimed at improving mutual \n     understanding between the peoples of the United States and \n     Cuba.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9845-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT FOR FEDERAL-STATE-PARTNERSHIPS RELATIVE TO SCHOOL MODERNIZATION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \ninitiatives to create a federal-state-local partnership relative to \npublic school construction and renovation throughout America. At a time \nwhen unprecedented budget surpluses are being projected by budget \nleaders at both the White House and in Congress, it seems clear to me \nthat some modest portion of these funds ought to be used to assist our \nschool districts. In South Dakota, it has become increasingly difficult \nto pass school bond issues, given the fact that real estate taxes are \nalready too high and our state's agricultural economy has been \nstruggling. The result is an enormous backlog of school construction \nneeds, and the costs of repair and replacement only increase with each \npassing year.\n  To propose a new school construction partnership is not to suggest \nsome sort of ``federalization'' of K-12 public education. The decisions \nas to whether to replace or repair a school would remain with the local \nschool districts where they belong, and by far the largest share of the \nexpense would continue to be met by local taxpayers. Even so, a federal \neffort to reduce interest costs or otherwise participate in reducing \nthe total cost of school construction could often times make the \ndifference between a successful project or none at all. If the federal \ngovernment were to simply block grant these funds, the dollars would \nhave to be disbursed in such a broad manner that no school district \nwould receive a sufficient amount of help to seriously make a real \ndifference.\n  While I appreciate that school construction assistance must be \ntargeted to help needy school districts first, I do want to convey my \nstrong opinion that the eligibility requirements for a federal-local \npartnership should not be so restrictive as to eliminate the \npossibility of many of our school districts from participating. South \nDakota has a great many school districts which are not completely \nimpoverished, but yet find it almost impossible to pass a bond issue \nand otherwise adequately fund their education programs. This program \nshould apply to more than just the extreme poverty situations of inner \nurban areas and remote rural areas. It should apply as well to the many \nsmall and medium size communities all across our country that seriously \nstruggle with school construction and renovation needs.\n  I applaud and support these efforts to invest a small portion of our \nNation's wealth in improved educational opportunities and facilities \nfor all--this investment now, will result in improved academic \nperformance, better citizenship and a stronger economy for generations \nto come.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9846-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9846]]\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I would like to speak on a pending piece \nof legislation that I believe requires our urgent attention. The fact \nthat the leadership has not acted to bring this bill to the floor is of \ngreat concern to me. While I understand that our time is short and our \nlist is long, the Re-authorization of the Violence Against Women's Act \nshould be on the list of priorities for this Congress. I urge the \nleadership not to allow another day to pass and to bring this bill to \nthe floor for our immediate consideration.\n  In 1994, with the President's strong support, Congress passed the \nlandmark Violence Against Women Act, which established new Federal \ncriminal provisions and key grant programs to improve this nation's \ncriminal justice system's response to domestic violence. Since that \ntime, the number of crimes against women has decreased. A recent report \nby the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that the number of women \nexperiencing violence at the hands of an intimate partner declined 21 \npercent from 1993 to 1998. Under this bill, the Federal Government has \nawarded $1.6 billion dollars, $24 million of which went to support \nprograms in the State of Louisiana, to help support the efforts of \nprosecutors, law enforcement officials, the courts, victim advocates, \nhealth care and social service professionals, and intervention and \nprevention programs. The National Domestic Violence Hotline, \nestablished with funds from this Act, has received more than 500,000 \ncalls since it began operating.\n  While I think the success of this Act alone is an important reason to \nsupport its continuation, it is not why I stand here today. Although \nthe number of women murdered by an intimate partner is the lowest it \nhas been since 1976, still, 3 out of 4 victims murdered last year were \nfemale. Tremendous strides have been made, but domestic violence and \ncrimes against women continue to devastate the lives of many women and \nchildren throughout our country.\n  In fact, in May of this year, one week after Mother's Day, a \nLouisiana woman, Jacqulene Gersfeld, was gunned down by her husband \njust outside a Gretna courthouse. The couple had a history of violence \nand friends reported that this was not the first time Jacqulene's \nhusband, Marvin, had threatened to kill her. Far too often, abused \nwomen are afraid, and many times for good reason, to remove themselves \nfrom these abusive relationships, but not Jacqulene, she sought help, \nobtained a protective order and filed for divorce. She left that \ncourtroom believing that her days of living in fear were over and that \nher husband could no longer harm her. But she was wrong.\n  I am sad to say that Jacqulene's story is not unique. In New Orleans \nalone, the Domestic Violence help line receives 16,000 calls for \nassistance a year. Of the total women's homicide rate, 46 percent of \nthose deaths are attributed to domestic violence. And that is just one \ncity in my state. I am certain that every one of my colleagues could \ncome to this floor and tell of a woman in their state whose fate was \nthat of Jacqulene's. As citizens of the greatest democracy in the \nworld, we cannot stand idly by and watch these stories unfold. The need \nfor the services provided for under the Violence Against Women Act are \nneeded now more than ever. Women like Jacqulene must be protected from \nthe wrath of their estranged abusers. They must know that there are \npeople willing to help them and their children escape the abuse and \nstart a new life.\n  While domestic violence may be dismissed by some as an issue that \naffects only women, it is not, it is an issue that affects us all. \nStudies show that a child's exposure to the father abusing the mother \nis the strongest risk factor for transmitting violent behavior from one \ngeneration to the next. A significant number of young males in the \njuvenile justice system were from homes where violence was the order of \nthe day. Family violence costs the nation from $5 to $10 billion \nannually in medical expenses, police and court costs, shelters and \nfoster care, sick leave, absenteeism, and non-productivity. In fact, \nthe majority of welfare recipients have experienced domestic abuse in \ntheir adult lives and a high percentage are currently abused.\n  My Colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, and I have cosponsored \nlegislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. If Congress \nfails to reauthorize VAWA, many critical programs may be jeopardized. \nReauthorization legislation, which has broad bipartisan support will \nhelp to: maintain existing programs, expand investigation and \nprosecution of crimes against women; provide greater numbers of victims \nwith assistance; maintain and expand the domestic violence hotline, \nshelter, rape prevention, and education programs; and support effective \npartnerships between law enforcement, victim advocates and communities.\n  Again, I am disappointed that this Congress is quickly coming to a \nclose and this bill is still waiting for action by the Senate. Several \ntimes during the campaign, the leadership has claimed that the issues \nthat are important to women are of the highest priority. I can hardly \nthink of an issue that more directly affects the lives of women and \ntheir families than their health and safety.\n  Since we returned from the August recess, several members have come \nto the floor and talked about time. The minority leader eloquently \ndetailed the amount of time, or lack thereof, that this body has \ndedicated to actually doing the work of the American people. The \nmajority leader, on the other hand, has cautioned us that time is \nlimited and we, therefore, must use it wisely. I could not agree more--\ntime is running out and so, it is about time that we ask the Majority \nto do more than make empty promises. It is about time we question the \nsincerity of a party when their Presidential candidate needs to be \nbriefed before he can take a stance on legislation to end violence \nagainst women. It is about time we do all we can to make good on a \npromise that we made six years ago to victims like Jacqulene. While it \nis too late for us to help her, we owe to the hundreds and thousands of \nothers like her to act quickly. I implore my colleagues not to let time \nrun out for the millions of women whose lives could be saved by this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9846-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9846-S9848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REQUEST FOR PRINTING OF THE ECSTASY ANTI-PROLIFERATION ACT OF 2000 IN \n                        THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The illegal importation of 3,4-methylenedioxy \n     methamphetamine, commonly referred to as ``MDMA'' or \n     ``Ecstasy'', has increased in recent years, as evidenced by \n     the fact that Ecstasy seizures by the United States Customs \n     Service have risen from less than 500,000 tablets during \n     fiscal year 1997 to more than 4,000,000 tablets during the \n     first 5 months of fiscal year 2000.\n       (2) Use of Ecstasy can cause long-lasting, and perhaps \n     permanent, damage to the serotonin system of the brain, which \n     is fundamental to the integration of information and emotion, \n     and this damage can cause long-term problems with learning \n     and memory.\n       (3) Due to the popularity and marketability of Ecstasy, \n     there are numerous Internet websites with information on its \n     effects, production, and the locations of use, often referred \n     to as ``raves''. The availability of this information targets \n     the primary users of Ecstasy, who are most often college \n     students, young professionals, and other young people from \n     middle- to high-income families.\n       (4) Greater emphasis needs to be placed on--\n       (A) penalties associated with the manufacture, \n     distribution, and use of Ecstasy;\n       (B) the education of young people on the negative health \n     effects of Ecstasy, since the reputation of Ecstasy as a \n     ``safe'' drug is it's most dangerous component;\n       (C) the education of State and local law enforcement \n     agencies regarding the growing problem of Ecstasy trafficking \n     across the United States;\n       (D) reducing the number of deaths caused by Ecstasy use and \n     its combined use with other ``club'' drugs and alcohol; and\n       (E) adequate funding for research by the National Institute \n     on Drug Abuse to--\n       (i) identify those most vulnerable to using Ecstasy and \n     develop science-based prevention approaches tailored to the \n     specific needs of individuals at high risk;\n       (ii) understand how Ecstasy produces its toxic effects and \n     how to reverse neurotoxic damage;\n       (iii) develop treatments, including new medications and \n     behavioral treatment approaches;\n       (iv) better understand the effects that Ecstasy has on the \n     developing children and adolescents; and\n       (v) translate research findings into useful tools and \n     ensure their effective dissemination.\n\n     SEC. 3. ENHANCED PUNISHMENT OF ECSTASY TRAFFICKERS.\n\n       (a) Amendment to Federal Sentencing Guidelines.--Pursuant \n     to its authority under section 994(p) of title 28, United \n     States Code, the United States Sentencing Commission shall \n     amend the Federal sentencing guidelines regarding any offense \n     relating to the manufacture, importation, or exportation of, \n     or trafficking in--\n       (1) 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine;\n       (2) 3,4-methylenedioxy amphetamine;\n       (3) 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine; or\n       (4) any other controlled substance, as determined by the \n     Sentencing Commission in consultation with the Attorney \n     General, that is marketed as Ecstasy and that has either a \n     chemical structure substantially similar to that of 3,4-\n     methylenedioxy methamphetamine or and effect on the central \n     nervous system substantially similar to or greater than that \n     of 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine;\n\n     (including an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense \n     described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4)) in violation of \n     the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the \n     Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et \n     seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. \n     1901 et seq.).\n       (b) General Requirement.--In carrying out this section, the \n     United States Sentencing Commission shall, with respect to \n     each offense described in subsection (a)--\n       (1) review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to \n     provide for increased penalties such that those penalties are \n     comparable to the base offense levels for offenses involving \n     any methamphetamine mixture; and\n       (2) take any other action the Commission considers to be \n     necessary to carry out this subsection.\n       (c) Additional Requirements.--In carrying out this section, \n     the United States Sentencing Commission shall ensure that the \n     Federal sentencing guidelines for offenders convicted of \n     offenses described in subsection (a) reflect--\n       (1) the need for aggressive law enforcement action with \n     respect to offenses involving the controlled substances \n     described in subsection (a); and\n       (2) the dangers associated with unlawful activity involving \n     such substances, including--\n       (A) the rapidly growing incidence of abuse of the \n     controlled substances described in subsection (a) and the \n     threat to public safety that such abuse poses;\n       (B) the recent increase in the illegal importation of the \n     controlled substances described in subsection (a);\n       (C) the young age at which children are beginning to use \n     the controlled substances described in subsection (a); and\n       (D) any other factor that the Sentencing Commission deems \n     appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 4. ENHANCED PUNISHMENT OF GHB TRAFFICKERS.\n\n       (a) Amendment to Federal Sentencing Guidelines.--Pursuant \n     to its authority under section 994(p) of title 28, United \n     States Code, the United States Sentencing Commission shall \n     amend the Federal sentencing guidelines in accordance with \n     this section with respect to any offense relating to the \n     manufacture, importation, or exportation of, or trafficking \n     in--\n       (1) gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and its salts; or\n       (2) the List I Chemical gamma-butyrolactone;\n     (including an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense \n     described in paragraph (1) or (2)) in violation of the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the \n     Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et \n     seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. \n     1901 et seq.).\n       (b) General Requirements.--In carrying out this section, \n     the United States Sentencing Commission shall with respect to \n     each offense described in subsection (a)--\n       (1) review and amend the Federal Sentencing guidelines to \n     provide for increased penalties such that those penalties \n     reflect the seriousness of these offenses and the need to \n     deter them;\n       (2) assure that the guidelines provide that offenses \n     involving a significant quantity of Schedule I and II \n     depressants are subject to greater terms of imprisonment than \n     currently provided by the guidelines and that such terms are \n     consistent with applicable statutory maximum penalties; and\n       (3) take any other action the Commission considers to be \n     necessary to carry out this subsection.\n       (c) Additional Requirements.--In carrying out this section, \n     the United States Sentencing Commission shall consider--\n       (1) the dangers associated with the use of the substances \n     described in subsection (a), and unlawful activity involving \n     such substances;\n       (2) the rapidly growing incidence of abuse of the \n     controlled substances described in subsection (a) and the \n     threat to public safety that such abuse poses, including the \n     dangers posed by overdose; and\n       (3) the recent increase in the illegal manufacture the \n     controlled substances described in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate both New \nYork professional baseball clubs, the Mets and the Yankees, on yet \nanother outstanding season of play. And as any fan will know, the \nseason has only just begun. With the ``Amazin's'' capturing in fine \nform the National League Wild Card and the ``Bronx Bombers'' winning \nthe American League East Division for the fourth time in the last five \nyears, the most exciting time of the year is now upon us. New Yorkers \nlook forward to their first ``subway series'' since 1956, when the \nYankees beat the then-Brooklyn Dodgers in seven games and Don Larson \nthrew the only perfect game in World Series history. We will cheer for \nour revered teams like no time since.\n  First, however, the Mets head west to take on the San Francisco \nGiants, a team they had some trouble with earlier in the season and a \nteam to be reckoned with. But the Mets have picked up a lot of steam in \nrecent weeks and finished the regular season winning five straight. \nIndeed, riding the arms of Al Leiter and Mike Hampton, and the bats of \nBenny Agbayani and the venerable Mike Piazza, the Mets are as strong as \nthey have been in years and couldn't be more ready for the Giants or \nwhomever they may face next.\n  The Yankees, on the other hand, have had a tough time of it lately. \nLosing their last 15 of 18 games, one might say they did not so much \nrace into the playoffs as limp. But this team is nowhere near down, nor \nanywhere near out. No franchise in the history of the game has had such \nachievement. To regain their championship form, they will rely on \nveteran and newcomer alike. Stalwarts such as Bernie Williams, Derek \nJeter, and Scott Brosius have proven a winning combination along with a \nseasoned pitching staff including Andy Pettitte, Mariano Rivera and \n``The Rocket'' Roger Clemens. Add to this already formidable lineup \nGlenallen Hill, Jose Canseco, and David Justice and the Yankees ought \nnot be counted out as they seek to claim their 26th World Championship\n  With this in mind, I along with my fellow New Yorkers, and Mets and \nYankees fans everywhere, wait not so patiently, cheer not so quietly, \nknowing that we may again have our subway series. Good luck Mets and \nYankees!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9848-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9848-S9849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING KELO-LAND TV\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Within this\n\n[[Page S9849]]\n\ncategory, the outstanding achievements KELO-TV made in it's ``Tradition \nof Caring'' public service announcement led them to be chosen as first \namong four national finalists at the presentation of the Emmy awards in \nNew York City.\n  The ``Tradition of Caring'' public service announcement culminates \nthree outstanding years of active community involvement by all of KELO-\nLAND TV's employees on behalf of over twenty charitable organizations. \nThe purpose of their public service campaign was to facilitate employee \nand community involvement in local causes. To effectively implement \ntheir campaign, employees were divided into teams based on similar \ninterests with each team focusing on a particular organization within \nthe community. Their personal approach to public service has not only \nwon them an Emmy, but it has significantly helped organizations \nthroughout South Dakota gain positive exposure and financial \nassistance.\n  KELO-LAND TV richly deserves this distinguished award. It is an honor \nfor me to share with my colleagues KELO-TV's exemplary leadership and \nstrong commitment to both the development and enhancement of South \nDakota's local communities through public service.

EMMETT O. TEMPLETON\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Emmett O. \nTempleton of Birmingham, Alabama who recently received the American \nCollege of Radiology's (ACR) Gold Medal. Dr. Templeton currently chairs \nthe department of radiology at Montclair Baptist Medical Center in \nBirmingham and continues to faithfully serve the community.\n  Dr. Templeton is an extraordinary individual who, as Chairman of the \nboard of Chancellors of the American College of Radiology, made a \nlasting impression on Members of Congress by his straight-talking \nstyle. He served his specialty, radiology, and the nation's public \npolicy in health by dealing with problems head-on and working to find \nsolutions. Dr. Templeton has been an asset to all of us in Congress and \nis deserving of the ACR Gold Medal which recognizes his marvelous \nachievements.\n  In addition, I have included the remarks made in the ACR Bulletin \nabout Dr. Templeton and why he has been awarded the Gold Medal.\n\n                       Emmett O. Templeton, M.D.\n\n       At 53, Emmett ``Neal'' Templeton, M.D., is one of the \n     youngest recipients of the ACR Gold Medal. A unique and \n     talented radiologist, Dr. Templeton is perhaps best known for \n     his outstanding contributions and dedicated service to the \n     college. Never one to toot his own horn, Dr. Templeton's \n     unassuming manner, excellent intermediary talents and astute \n     guidance have earned him the widespread respect of his peers. \n     He has played a significant role in the advancement and \n     success of the ACR and has been an inspiration to many of his \n     colleagues in the southeast.\n       An ACR Fellow, Dr. Templeton became actively involved with \n     the ACR fewer than 15 years ago, yet has served on more than \n     20 commissions and committees and participated for several \n     years on many of them. The wide range of committees he has \n     assisted is a reflection of his avid interest in all aspects \n     of radiology, including accurate coding, practice matters and \n     relationships with clinics and hospitals.\n       ``Neal is an unusually bright and charismatic individual, \n     which is immediately evident to those he meets. It is the \n     reason he has so frequently been chosen for leadership,'' \n     says Milton Gallant, M.D., director of radiology at The \n     General Hospital Center at Passaic in New Jersey. \n     ``Leadership opportunities, coupled with unusual \n     statesmanship and hard work, have resulted in his endeavors \n     being uniformly successful.''\n       Dr. Templeton has selflessly shared his time and counsel in \n     ACR leadership roles, beginning as vice chair for the \n     Commission on Radiologic Practice, The Commission on \n     Economics, the Committee on State and Economic Legislation of \n     the Commission on Economics, the Committee on Coding and \n     Nomenclature and the Commission on Government Relations have \n     all benefitted from his direction as chair. From 1992 to \n     1994, he served as vice chair of the Board of Chancellors. \n     The following two years he served as chairman of the board \n     while also serving as chairman of the Commission on \n     Government Relations. In 1996 he was elected ACR president.\n       Bibb Allen Jr., M.D., one of Templeton's partners at \n     Birmingham Radiological Group, saw firsthand the sacrifices \n     Templeton willingly made during his tenure on the Board of \n     Chancellors. ``Neal spent the vast majority of his personal \n     time away from the hospital conducting the business of the \n     college,'' Allen says. ``All radiologists have benefitted \n     from Neal's leadership and skill.''\n       Dr. Templeton is also a member of the Radiology Residency \n     Review Committee, the AMA Practice Expense Advisory \n     Committee, AMA-CPT Editorial Panel, the Government Relations \n     Oversight Committee and the Practice Expense Advisory \n     Committee panel.\n       His effective management style has made him an accomplished \n     mediator. He is well known for his concern and support for \n     technologists, office managers and office staff, recognizing \n     the importance of their role in the practice of radiology. \n     According to Barbara E. Chick, M.D., past councilor, \n     chancellor and vice president of the ACR, ``His availability \n     to meet with anyone, at any time, to help problem-solve was a \n     great asset to the field of radiology when the ``turf'' \n     battles were so common.'' Chick adds, ``I believe his keen \n     insight has been beneficial to many practices in their \n     marketing and reimbursement activities.''\n       Templeton has a unique knowledge of radiologic practice and \n     economic matters. He has been appointed to the boards of HMO \n     and PPO organizations as a result of the model hospital and \n     imaging center practices he has demonstrated in his own \n     practice. One of the highlights of his career was his \n     stewardship of diagnostic imaging centers as an alternative \n     to private office or hospital practice. He was an early \n     expert in this concept during a time when the recognition of \n     radiologists as ``physicians'' was not unequivocal.\n       Currently chair of the department of radiology at Montclair \n     Baptist Medical Center, Birmingham, Ala., Templeton earned \n     his medical degree from the University of Alabama in 1973 and \n     completed his internship and residency at the University of \n     Alabama's hospitals and clinics. Even after achieving the \n     highest positions in the ACR, he continues to serve the \n     college and radiology ``in the trenches.''\n       Michael A. Sullivan, M.D., associate chairman of the \n     department of diagnostic radiology at Ochsner Clinic in New \n     Orleans, sums up Templeton's character nicely: ``Neal is a \n     wonderful individual who is forthright, honest and hard-\n     working. He exemplifies the term `involved radiologist.' \n     ''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9849-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9849-S9850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING HARCUM COLLEGE'S 85th ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n85th anniversary of Harcum College. The Harcum Post Graduate School was \nopened by Edith Hatcher, a talented concert pianist, and her husband \nOctavius Marvin Harcum. Together they chose a venture that would \ncombine her ``talents as an educator and artist and his business vision \nand ability.'' Harcum College opened its doors on October 1, 1915 in \nMelville Hall, with three students and five pianos.\n  In its early years, Harcum was a preparatory school, giving students \nthe skills needed to attend college. Mr. Harcum was the first \nPresident, but when he died tragically in a car accident in 1920, Edith \nassumed the Presidency. She remained in that position for more than 30 \nyears. The college continued to grow, yet it was a proprietary \ninstitution and faced financial difficulties. In 1952 it could no \nlonger be run as a profitable enterprise; Edith declared bankruptcy.\n  The Junto Adult School was a non-profit educational corporation \nfounded by Benjamin Franklin. It purchased the assets of Harcum and \ndecided to use it as a two-year college for women. Philip Klein assumed \nleadership, and in 1955, Pennsylvania granted Harcum permission to be \nthe first junior college in the Commonwealth's history to confer the \nAssociate of Arts and Science degrees.\n  Throughout the years, tremendous expansion of facilities has occurred \nyet Harcum remains committed to its original philosophies. Harcum \nCollege embraces a value system based on four principles: a respect for \nand appreciation of diversity; the ability to make sound ethical and \nmoral choices; the need to take responsibility for self and others; and \na commitment to lifelong learning. All members of the Harcum community \nare committed to the success of one another.\n  Harcum College has always placed learning first and is committed to \nproviding individualized educational experiences for a diverse \ncommunity of learners. Harcum educated students in the arts and \noccupational skills, and in Mrs. Harcum's words, the college respected \neach student as an ``individual with personal needs, interests, \naptitudes, and aspirations.''\n\n[[Page S9850]]\n\n  I commend Harcum College for its accomplishments and commitment to \neducation. Harcum has faced many challenges over the years, and I \ncongratulate the institution as it remains an outstanding educational \nfacility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9850-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              2000 NATIONAL DISTINGUISHED PRINCIPALS AWARD\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate an exceptional elementary school principal, Mr. Karl \nSchleich of Wasilla, Alaska. He is the 2000 recipient of the National \nDistinguished Principals Award for Alaska.\n  The National Distinguished Principals Program (NDP) was established \nin 1984 as an annual event to honor elementary and middle school \nprincipals who set the pace, character, and quality of the education \nchildren receive during their early school years. The program is \njointly sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and the National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals (NAESP). It calls attention \nto the fundamental importance of the school principal in achieving \neducational excellence for pre-kindergarten through eighth grade \nstudents.\n  Mr. Schleich's reputation for getting things done was established in \nsoutheast Alaska when, in his first position as an educational leader, \nhe oversaw the creation of a grade 6-8 middle school in a former grade \n7-12 building and then founded a regional association to support others \nmaking similar transitions. As an assistant principal, he helped model \na middle school program that received statewide and national attention. \nIn his role as principal at Snowshoe Elementary School, he has boosted \nschool improvement efforts, developed and trained staff in schoolwide \nassessments of writing, reading comprehension, and early literacy \nskills, as well as portfolios of children's work. Karl Schleich is \ncommended by his colleagues for his uncommon interpersonal skills and \nenergy that he has demonstrated in his 12 years as a principal.\n  Our Nation's future depends on today's educators. Currently, 40 \npercent of America's 4th graders read below the basic level on national \nreading tests. On international tests, the nation's 12th graders rank \nlast in Advanced Physics compared with students in 18 other countries. \nAnd one-third of all incoming college freshmen must enroll in a \nremedial reading, writing, or mathematics class before taking regular \ncourses. This country is in need of more devoted and talented \neducators. I commend Mr. Schleich for his hard work and dedication to \nour children. He is educating those who will lead this country in \ncreating, developing, and putting to work new ideas and \ntechnology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9850-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JOSEPH E. BAGGETT\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor Captain Joseph E. Baggett, Judge Advocate Generals' Corps, United \nStates Navy, upon his retirement after twenty-nine years of devoted, \nactive duty service in our great nation's Navy.\n  Captain Baggett was born into a military family. The son of a career \nenlisted Marine, Captain Baggett grew up in the presence of the United \nStates Navy in such diverse locations as Naval Air Station Pensacola, \nMarine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, and the United Kingdom. Raised with \nthe values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment, and with a family \ntradition of service, it only made sense that he too would pursue a \nmilitary career.\n  Captain Baggett graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Tulane University in \nMay 1971, and entered the Navy through Tulane's Naval Reserve Officer \nTraining Corps. At that time Captain Baggett raised his hand and took \nhis oath to support and defend the Constitution. In the years since \nthat day he has devoted indeed all of his great energy, talent, and \nintellect to that task. He has been steadfast in his covenant to this \nnation and his devotion to those with whom he has served. An \nillustrious career gives eloquent testimony to his service to our \ncountry and to our Navy's legal community.\n  After two tours as a Supply Corps officer, including service onboard \nUSS Rich (DD-820), he entered the Navy's Law Education Program and \ncommenced the study of law at Tulane University. After earning his \nJuris Doctor degree in 1977, his first tour of duty as a Navy Judge \nAdvocate was at Naval Legal Service Office, Jacksonville, Florida where \nhe served as a formidable military prosecutor tirelessly pursuing \njustice on behalf of the Navy.\n  Captain Baggett's subsequent tours demonstrate his exceptional talent \nfor international and operational law, his unsurpassed academic \ncredentials, and his desire to serve the Fleet wherever required. In \nsuch diverse assignments as Commander Middle East Force onboard USS \nLaSalle (AGF-3) and USS Coronado (AGF-11), Commander Iceland Defense \nForce, and Commander Sixth Fleet, serving onboard USS Belknap (CG-26) \nand USS Iowa (BB-61), Captain Baggett's legal acumen and diplomatic \nskill repeatedly helped safeguard America's Interests and project \nAmerica's presence in these often complex areas of the world. \nInterspersed were tours in Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs, the \nInternational Law Division of the Office of the Judge Advocate General, \nand the University of Miami where he earned a Masters of Law degree in \nOcean and Coastal Law.\n  With his vast experience with forward-deployed, operational forces, \nCaptain Baggett was able to quickly contribute to a number of vital, \nNational-level issues in subsequent Washington staff assignments, \nincluding tours on the Joint Staff's Strategic Plans and Policy \nDirectorate, as Deputy Assistant Judge Advocate General for \nInternational Law, and as the Defense Department Representative for \nOcean Policy, where he was pivotal in developing United States policy \non a variety of issues, including issues involving the newly formed \nRussian Federation. With this comprehensive top-level, international \nlegal perspective, Captain Baggett was the obvious choice to become the \nCounsel for National Security to the Deputy Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  Returning to the Fleet as the Senior Staff Judge Advocate for the \nCommander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Captain Baggett was a major \ninfluence in high-level decisionmaking related to all aspects of Fleet \noperations, including environmental coordination and enforcement, rules \nof engagement, medical law, military justice, and the legal aspects of \nshore activity management. Captain Baggett's subsequent tour as the \nCommanding Officer of the Navy's flagship Naval Legal Service Office, \nin Norfolk, Virginia, demonstrated once again his exceptional \nleadership skills. Here he mentored the young men and women of the \nNavy's legal community about the operational imperatives of the Navy, \nand constantly stressed the paramount need to serve the Fleet.\n  Captain Baggett's wealth of expertise of Navy won him the assignment \nas Director of the Legislation Division in the Navy's Office of \nLegislative Affairs. In this capacity his consistent sound judgment and \nflawless tact ensured Navy issues were properly conveyed to Senate \nCommittees and Subcommittees.\n  Standing beside this officer throughout his career has been his wife \nSuzanne, a lady to whom he owes much. She has been his key supporter, \ndevoting her life to her husband, to their two sons, Merritt and \nGraham, and to the men and women of the Navy family. She has traveled \nby his side for these many years. Her sacrifice and devotion have \nserved as an example and inspiration for others.\n  With these words before the Senate, I seek to recognize Captain \nBaggett for his unswerving loyalty to the Navy and the Nation. The \nDepartment of the Navy and the American people have been served well by \nthis dedicated naval officer. He will be missed. He has left the Navy \nbetter prepared to face the challenges and opportunities of the 21st \ncentury. We thank him and wish Joe, and his lovely wife Suzanne, fair \nwinds and following seas as they continue forward in what will most \nassuredly remain lives of service to this Great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9850-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9850-S9851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EDWIN J. KUNTZ\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the passing \nof an outstanding leader in the agriculture community of Montana. I \nfirst met Ed\n\n[[Page S9851]]\n\nKuntz and his family in the 1960's. He and his family lived in the \nsmall community of Custer, Montana. They farmed small grain, sugar \nbeets and fed cattle. It was a typical diversified farming operation \nfound on the many irrigation projects along the Yellowstone River.\n  Ed was a little different. He was not only of the land but was of the \npeople who lived on the land and called it home. Just another average \nAmerican of the silent Americans who served this country when asked and \nserved his community when no one else would. Average? Not at all. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  His service to his community and neighbors did not stop at the county \nline. He was an excellent farmer and stockman. His love and respect for \nthe sugar industry took him to national leadership where he was one of \ntheir most respected leaders. With the demands on the farm and \ndedication to a family, he still found time to work for the sugar beet \nindustry not only for himself but his neighbors. I know first hand the \nimpact he had on this town of Washington as he represented the many \nsugar growers across the country.\n  He was born May 3, 1926 in Billings, Montana. He was educated and \ngraduated from Custer High School in 1944 and enlisted in the Army Air \nCorps and trained as a gunner on a B-17. While on furlough, he married \nhis high school sweetheart, Peg Qusest. This December they would have \nbeen celebrating being married 56 years.\n  Ed became a director on the Mountain States Beet Growers Association \nand served 35 years on that board. He was treasurer for more years than \nanybody can count and president for 10 years. He also served on the \nboard of directors of the American Sugar Beet Association in \nWashington, D.C. and devoted many hours away from the farming operation \nand family.\n  He is survived by his wife, Peg of Custer, Montana, a daughter, \nBelva; 2 sons, Rick and Cody.\n  By paying our respect to Ed Kuntz, we acknowledge the unsung leaders \nacross this land who silently build a nation every day. He was just one \nthat has been described as being a part of the greatest \ngeneration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9851-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO GENERAL ANTHONY ZINNI, USMC (RET.)\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nGeneral Anthony Zinni, United States Marine Corps, on the occasion of \nhis completion of a successful tour of duty as Commander in Chief, \nUnited States Central Command, and his retirement from active duty \nafter 36 years of loyal service. I offer these remarks with great \nrespect for General Zinni, a true American patriot and a Marine's \nMarine.\n  General Zinni is a remarkable individual, a distinguished combat \nsoldier, and an inspiring, uncompromising leader. During his 36 year \nmilitary career, General Zinni's intellect, candor, and unshakeable \noptimism have had a profound, positive influence on the U.S. Armed \nForces from the Quang Nam province of Vietnam to the sheikdoms of the \nMiddle East, and a hundred points in between. A life long adventure \nthat began in a small Pennsylvania town on the banks of the Schuykill \nRiver has taken him around the world and to the top echelons of \nmilitary leadership.\n  A first generation American, General Zinni began his service to the \nnation in 1961. His father, Antonio Zinni, who immigrated from Italy \nand fought for his adopted country in the trenches of France in World \nWar I, and his mother, Lilla, instilled in General Zinni an \nunconditional devotion to the principles of American freedom and \nliberty and a profound respect for military service. On his first day \nof classes at Villanova University, with the lessons of his parents in \nmind, General Zinni joined the Marine Corps. From the Augustinians and \nthe Marine Corps Drill Instructors, General Zinni developed an \nintellectual prowess and professional military acumen that would \ndistinguish him as a ``cut above'' throughout his career.\n  Beginning with two combat tours in Vietnam, General Zinni embarked on \na series of assignments that reflect the myriad missions to which the \nmilitary has been deployed in the latter part of the 20th Century--\ncombat operations, humanitarian operations, peacekeeping and peace \nenforcement. Following Vietnam, General Zinni participated in \nhumanitarian relief operations in the Philippines and in Northern Iraq. \nHe commanded U.S. military forces in Somalia and also commanded the \ntask force responsible for safeguarding the withdrawal of U.N. \npeacekeeping forces from Somalia in 1995.\n  In August 1997, General Zinni, recognized as one of the most \noperationally competent, most experienced and most versatile military \nleaders in uniform, was selected by the President to be the Commander \nin Chief of United States Central Command. Following a unanimous \nconfirmation vote by this chamber, General Zinni spent the next three \nyears representing the United States and ensuring the security of U.S. \ninterests in one of the most challenging areas of the world.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, United States Central Command \nencompasses a region that includes 25 nations, extending from Egypt and \nthe Horn of Africa through the Arabian Peninsula and Gulf States, to \nthe newly independent central Asian nations and Pakistan. While \nabundant in cultural, ethnic and religious diversity, these same \nenriching features are also the source of deep-rooted, historic \nanimosities--animosities within the region and toward the United \nStates. Guided by his imperative to genuinely understand the unique \nperspective of a society and his desire to work with the people of the \nregion, General Zinni earned the respect and administration of the \narea's national leaders. There is no question that he was the right man \nin the right place at the right time.\n  While we acknowledge the long list of General Zinni's accolades, we \nrecognize that the challenges of military life are most successfully \naccomplished as a team effort. General Zinni's wife, Debbie, and their \nchildren Lisa, Tony, and Maria have shared the challenges and rewards \nof General Zinni's military life. The journey which brought General \nZinni to Central Command, the hallmark of his distinguished military \ncareer, would not have been possible without the unconditional and \nloving support of his family.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I congratulate you and your family \nfor your service to the Nation, the Armed Forces and to the Marine \nCorps. Semper Fi! General, as a former Maine, I salute you on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9851-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IDAHO'S OLYMPIC CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy good friend Lowell Guthrie for his commitment to higher education, \nand his generosity to the students at Western Kentucky University in \nBowling Green, Kentucky.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Lowell for many years and have \nwitnessed his compassion for others on numerous occasions. Lowell has a \nkind heart and a giving spirit, and he constantly thinks of ways to \nimprove the quality of life for others. Lowell has\n\n[[Page S9852]]\n\nbuilt a successful business in Bowling Green and is an active member of \nthe Bowling Green community. He is a leader in education, providing \nopportunities for his employees and for others whom he does not know by \nfunding scholarships to Western Kentucky University. He has \nconsistently been a contributor to WKU and has now stepped up as a \nleader in Western's Investing in the Spirit capital campaign with a \n$1.8 million gift to provide student scholarships and to construct a \nclock and bell tower on the WKU campus.\n  The clock and bell tower will stand in ``The Guthrie Plaza'' in \nmemory of Lowell's brother, Sgt. 1st Class Robert Guthrie, an American \nsoldier who died in the Korean War, and it will honor all those \nassociated with WKU who have lost their lives in service to their \ncountry. The courtyard area of The Guthrie Plaza will be constructed in \nhonor of Lowell's wife, Judith Carolyn Guthrie.\n  The tower and courtyard will enhance the appearance of WKU's campus \nbut more importantly it will serve as a reminder to thousands of \nstudents and alumni of those who sacrificed their lives so that we may \nhave freedom. Lowell's generosity and his commitment to education will \nensure that hundreds of students from all backgrounds will receive a \nquality education and the opportunity to succeed in whatever field of \nstudy they choose.\n  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I \noffer heartfelt thanks to Lowell and to the entire Guthrie family for \ntheir continuing commitment to Western Kentucky University, their \ncommunity and to the education of America's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9852-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9852-S9853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:09 p.m. a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 366.

A bill to shift Impact Aid funding responsibility for \nmilitary connected children and property from the Department of \nEducation to the Department of Defense; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n ``EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR MILITARY CONNECTED CHILDREN ACT OF 2000''\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Educational \nAssistance for Military Connected Children Act of 2000,'' legislation \nthat would transfer from the Department of Education to the Department \nof Defense financial responsibility for impact aid payments used to \nsupport the education of military dependents.\n  The impact aid program is authorized as Title VIII of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. Unlike other ESEA programs, \nhowever, impact aid payments are not used to support specific \neducational activities. Rather, these payments serve as general aid to \nlocal educational agencies to replace tax dollars which are foregone as \nthe result of the presence of the Federal government. For example, \nFederal property--such as military installations--is not subject to \nproperty taxes. In addition, under the terms of the Soldiers' and \nSailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, many military personnel do not pay \ntaxes in the States and localities where their children attend school.\n  Replacing lost revenues that would otherwise have been available to \nsupport local schools is an obligation of the Federal government in \nthose cases where the revenue loss is directly related to Federal \naction. The Department of Education, through the impact aid program, \nprovides nearly $1 billion each year for this purpose.\n  Over the past two years, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions has been reviewing all ESEA programs. In the course of \nthat review, I have come to the conclusion that the children of \nmilitary personnel would be better served if the impact aid provided on \ntheir behalf were offered through the Department of Defense.\n  For one thing, DOD officials are in a far better position than are \nEducation Department personnel to assess the needs of schools on or \nnear military bases and to be aware of activities--such as downsizing \nor the construction or renovation of base housing--which can have a \nmajor effect on the amount of the impact aid assistance available to a \nschool. In many cases, my committee has been asked, after the fact, to \naddress specific impact aid problems which have confronted schools as a \nresult of such decisions.\n  In addition, problems such as inadequate funding, overcrowded \nconditions, and lengthy delays in the issuance of impact aid payments \ncould be better addressed if their resolution were the responsibility \nof those who are most familiar with the needs of these schools and \ntheir students.\n  On a number of occasions in the past, defense-related legislation has \nincluded provisions which have directly changed impact aid or have \nsupported parallel programs. I do not see that the interests of schools \nor students are best served by this duplication of effort.\n  The Department of Defense currently offers of variety of services to \nmilitary dependents--ranging from child care to health services. I \nbelieve the education of these children to be equally important. The \nlegislation I am offering today is, I believe, a good starting point \nfor impact aid reform designed to improve the educational opportunities \navailable to military dependents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 3159. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nclarify provisions relating to the use of accrued compensatory time by \ncertain public employees; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n        state and local government family friendly workplace act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation. This bill continues my effort to help \nworking parents balance the demands between work and family.\n  Over the past five years, we have been talking about the difficulty \nthat parents have balancing work and family obligations. I do not think \nthere are two values that are more highly or intensely admired in \nAmerica than these. The first one is the value we place on our \nfamilies. We understand that more than anything else the family is an \ninstitution where important things are learned, not just knowledge \nimparted but wisdom is obtained and understood in a family which \nteaches us not just how to do something but teaches us how to live.\n  The second value which is a strong value in America and reflects our \nheritage is the value of work. Americans admire and respect work. The \ndifficult issue that face us as a nation, is how are we going to \nresolve these tensions? I think that is one of the jobs, that we\n\n[[Page S9862]]\n\nhave to try and make sure we build a framework where people can resolve \nthose tensions. Since 1965, the amount of time parents spend with their \nchildren has dropped 40 percent and a 1993 study that found that 66 \npercent of adults surveyed nationwide wanted to spend more time with \ntheir children.\n  This tension between the workplace and the home place, juxtaposed or \nset in a framework of laws created in the 1930's that does not allow us \nflexibility, is a problem. For example, you might be asked to do \novertime over and over and over again, and you do overtime, and then \nyou are paid time and a half. But at some point, you would rather have \nthe time than the money. If the employer agreed to it voluntarily--both \nparties--we ought to let that happen. Right now, it is against the law. \nAccording to a number of surveys, this is what Americans want. For \nexample, a poll by Money magazine found that 64 percent of the American \npeople--and 68 percent of women--would rather have their overtime in \nthe form of time off, than in cash wages. Eighty-two percent said they \nsupported the Republican's plan to give working men and women more \ncontrol over their hard-earned time. Money magazine, May 1997.\n  In an attempt to address these work and family tensions, in each of \nthe last three Congresses, I have introduced legislation. Each of these \nbills provide flexible working arrangements--or ``flex-time,'' and \ncompensatory time off--or ``comp time.''\n  The comp time provisions in the Family Friendly Workplace Act (S. \n1241) would permit employees to choose, if the employer agreed, to be \ncompensated with time-and-a-half compensatory time off for overtime \nhours worked in lieu of time-and-a-half pay--whenever time is more \nvaluable than financial compensation to the employee. This gives hourly \nemployees the ability to meet their family obligations while still \ntaking home a full paycheck.\n  The flex time provisions would allow private sector hourly employees \nto work biweekly work schedules the same as federal employees have been \nable to since 1978. Rather than being limited to 40 hours in a seven-\nday period, private sector workers could schedule 80 hours over a two-\nweek period in any combination if their employers agree. Overtime would \nhave to be paid for any hours ordered by the employer in excess of \nthose in the designated biweekly work schedule. For example, if an \nemployer asked an employee to work 45 hours in a week when the employee \nwas scheduled to work only 35 hours under the biweekly work schedule, \nthe employer would be required to pay the employee 10 hours of overtime \ncompensation. This is true even though absent the agreement, the \nemployer would only be required to pay the employee five hours of \novertime.\n\n  When these provisions were developed, I took seriously the concerns \nraised by my constituents that adequate protections had to be contained \nin the bill to make sure this was a real choice made by employees--not \nemployers. Both of the provisions were designed to do just that. In the \nFamily Friendly Workplace Act employers cannot require accepting \ncompensatory time off in lieu of over time pay as a condition of \nemployment. Nor can they require employees to work flex time as a \ncondition of employment. In addition, such agreements to work these \nalternative work schedules have to be in writing, signed by the \nemployee. Coercion into these programs--or even attempted coercion--is \nstrictly prohibited and contain severe penalties.\n  Due to the nature of comp time, there also are protections specific \nto that program. Employers would be prohibited from coercing, or \nattempting to coerce, employees into using or not using their comp \ntime. The bill requires employers to cash-out their employees' comp \ntime bank at the end of each year or in the alternative, within thirty \ndays of their employees' request. These cash-out provisions serve two \nimportant purposes. First, it ensures that employers who offer the \noption of comp time do not do so with the belief that it will give them \nability to avoid paying overtime. Second, it also structures comp time \nprograms with a built-in incentive for employers to allow employees to \nuse their comp time when it is needed by the employee.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to provide these superior \nprotections to state and local government workers. First, it will \nprohibit the practice of requiring employees to accept comp time as a \ncondition of employment. It also will require state and local \ngovernments to cash-out comp time banks at the end of each year or \nwithin thirty days of request by the employees. Finally, it will \nspecifically prohibit state and local governments from forcing \nemployees to use their accumulated comp time against their wishes. It \nis those workers who are giving up time with their families--they \nshould be able to use it to spend time with their families. These \nprotections will impact 290,405 workers in Missouri, or approximately \ntwelve percent of the workforce.\n  No doubt, state and local governments will be concerned about the \ncost of cashing out these comp time banks or changing their scheduling \npatterns in order to allow workers to use their accumulated comp time. \nAs a former Governor, I understand these concerns. However, I have to \ntake seriously the practice that can no longer be called isolated \nincidents. Forcing employees to work over time takes away time from \ntheir families. Our police officers, fire fighters, corrections' \nofficers, and other state and local government workers should have the \nchoice whether that time should be compensated with time or money. They \nknow what best fits their needs and should not be forced--with the \nblessings of the federal government--into giving up that choice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 3160. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study \nthe suitability and feasibility of designating the Abel and Mary \nNicholson House, Elsinboro Township, Salem County, New Jersey, as a \nunit of the National Park System, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n abel and mary nicholson house national historic site study act of 2000\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Abel and \nMary Nicholson House National Historic Site Study Act of 2000. This \nbill would require the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nsuitability and feasibility of designating the Abel and Mary Nicholson \nHouse located in Elsinboro Township, Salem County, New Jersey, as a \nunit of the National Park System. As part of the study the Secretary \nwould also be required to consider management alternatives to create an \nadministrative association with the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail \nRoute. The bill I am introducing today would authorize the National \nPark Service to acquire this land in compliance with the service's \nstandard rules and regulations.\n  Mr. President, the Abel and Mary Nicholson House is prized for its \narchitectural and historical significance to, not only my state, but, \nour entire nation. It is a unique resource which can provide \nunparalleled opportunities for studying our national cultural and \nnatural heritage. Situated along Alloway Creek, a tributary of the \nDelaware River, the house is surrounded by an intact cultural landscape \nof farm fields, wetlands and forests. The original access to the house \nwas from the creek, as rivers were the highways of 18th century \nAmerica.\n  The Abel and Mary Nicholson House is a Delaware Valley, brick, \npatterned-end mansion constructed in 1722. The original portion of the \nhouse has existed for 280 years with only routine maintenance, no major \nremodeling or restoration, and without the intrusion of either \nelectricity or a central heating system. It stands alone as the only \nknown, pristine survivor of an Anglo-American building tradition that \nexisted for three quarters of a century.\n  The Nicholson House is changing the thinking of architectural \nhistorians about the construction and use of rooms in the earliest \nhouses of the Delaware Valley. The house has been called an \narchitectural Rosetta stone that provides new insight to our \nunderstanding of the use and function of interior space during the 18th \ncentury. Additionally, Mr. President, an 1859 addition to the house \nenhances the significance of the property with a similar level of \narchitectural integrity.\n  Mr. President, the Abel and Mary Nicholson House also has cultural \nsignificance in its well-documented associations with the earliest \nQuaker settlement in North America and the first permanent English \nsettlement in New\n\n[[Page S9863]]\n\nJersey. Abel Nicholson arrived in New Jersey at the age of three. He \nwas brought to New Jersey by his father, Samuel Nicholson, a follower \nof John Fenwick. They arrived in 1675, seven years before William Penn \narrived to settle Philadelphia. John Fenwick was the founder of \nGreenwich and Salem, New Jersey, the first permanent English-speaking \nsettlements on the Delaware River.\n  Samuel Nicholson purchased 2,000 acres in Elsinboro Township, New \nJersey and a 16-acre lot in the City of Salem where he constructed a \nhome. It was in the Salem house that the first Salem Meeting of the \nSociety of Friends was organized in 1676. In 1680, Samuel Nicholson \ndonated the Salem house to the Salem Meeting and relocated to the \nElsinboro property. In 1693, Abel Nicholson married Mary Tyler, the \ndaughter of another Quaker. Abel and Mary Nicholson built the present \nhouse, in 1722, which historians believe either replaced or abutted the \nearlier structure built by his father.\n  Mr. President, the Nicholson House represents the Mid-Atlantic \nregion's colonial history and traditions. Because of its architectural \nintegrity and what it is teaching scholars about how 18th century \nbuilding spaces were used, it is considered to transcend regional \nsignificance and ranks as one of America's iconic early structures.\n  Mr. President, the Abel and Mary Nicholson House is a national \ntreasure that deserves consideration for preservation and protection so \nit can continue to teach future generations of Americans about the \ncontributions and lives of the early Americans. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3160\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, at this time I would like to return to \nour discussion of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library, which is a \nproject in the Interior conference committee report that we have been \ndiscussing from time to time throughout the day.\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\n  I spoke earlier, for several hours, about concerns I have had with \nthe language in the conference committee report. The language \nauthorizes $50 million in Federal expenditures for the library in \nSpringfield. It says that the purpose of those expenditures would be \nfor the construction of the library, for planning, design, acquiring, \nand constructing the library. But it is interesting; the actual \nlanguage in the authorization does not say who is getting the money. It \nsays that the $50 million would be going to an entity that would be \nselected later.\n  So the Senate and the House have a conference committee report before \nus with a $50 million authorization for the library in Springfield, IL, \nbut we do not know to whom we are going to give the money.\n  When I saw this language earlier on, when the authorizing bill came \nfrom the House to my Senate committee, I saw that as a problem. I saw \nit also as a problem that there was no requirement that the \nconstruction project be competitively bid.\n  I thought, what if this money falls into the hands of a private \nentity? The entity in the bill could apparently be private or public. \nThere is no restriction in the bill that it can only go to a public \nentity. There is no suggestion in the bill that the money has to go to \nthe State of Illinois.\n  I thought, we have to take care to make sure that we have protections \nin there for the taxpayer, so that this money cannot be spent \nimproperly.\n  Senator Durbin came in and spoke earlier. He said that he supports a \nbidding process with integrity, as do I. I appreciate Senator Durbin's \nsupport and the support I have had from all of my 99 colleagues in the \nSenate, where we have gone on record by passing legislation over to the \nHouse that says the Senate thinks it is a good idea that this $50 \nmillion authorization for the Lincoln Library in Springfield, IL, \nrequires that the project be competitively bid in accordance with the \ncomprehensive Federal competitive bid guidelines. I thank all my \ncolleagues in the Senate for their support on that proposition.\n  I talked to many of my colleagues in the last couple weeks about this \nissue, and every single one of them agreed: Isn't it a good idea that \nwe restrict that money so it cannot be misused? After all, it is not \neven clear where the money is going.\n  It is possible that the money would go to the State of Illinois. If \nit does go to the State of Illinois, I think that would be preferable \nto it being given to an individual or to a private corporation.\n  I described earlier in the day how there is a private not-for-profit \norganization out there that has recently been organized known as the \nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation, and that I do not \nthink it would be a good idea to give the taxpayer's money to a private \nnot-for-profit organization in which case it would be up to the board \nof directors of that corporation as to how the money would be handled. \nWe would not have safeguards for the public.\n  But I also pointed out that if the money went to the State of \nIllinois, and the State of Illinois directed the money to its Capital \nDevelopment Board, there was a real problem.\n  The State of Illinois has a procurement code that was amended a few \nyears ago. It does, in general, seek to ensure competitive bidding. It \nis an improvement over old laws that the State of Illinois used to \nhave.\n  When I was in the State senate in Springfield, in 1997, I voted for \nthe current State procurement law. But we pointed out that there is a \nloophole in there, and I regret that I missed that loophole. The \nloophole is that the Capital Development Board has a way to opt out of \ncompetitively bidding projects. It is a highly unusual and irregular \nloophole.\n  A letter from the Capital Development Board to Senator Durbin stated \nthat the project would have to be competitively bid because they would \nrequire it. They said they couldn't do things that were not \ncompetitively bid. That is nice they put that in their letter, but \ntheir letter is flatly contradicted by their statute. The statute that \ngoverns the Capital Development Board has a clear opt-out so that the \nState can just opt out of competitively biding this project. Fifty \nmillion dollars in taxpayer money is a lot of money.\n\n  The one issue Senator Durbin mentioned concerned the attachment of \nFederal competitive bid guidelines to this project in Springfield, to \nmake sure it was properly applied and that we didn't have political \ninfluence in the awarding of the many contracts that would be given \nout. There is, after all, $120 million of taxpayer money, when you \ninclude the State of Illinois money, the Federal money, the city of \nSpringfield money, and any private money that is contributed to the \nproject. That is a lot of money. You would think you would want careful \nsafeguards in that law. It is hard for me to think of any reason \nanybody would oppose the strictest possible exceptions on how we spend \ntaxpayer money to ensure that there is competitive bidding.\n  Senator Durbin wondered how would it work if Federal requirements \nwould apply; the State of Illinois wouldn't know how to handle it if \nFederal guidelines were applied. I don't think that is correct. As I \npointed out to Senator Durbin, it is very clear the State contemplates \nthat Federal guidelines will frequently be attached when the Federal \nGovernment gives money to the State of Illinois. If you get Federal \nmoney from somewhere or you get money from somebody, it is not unusual \nthat strings are attached.\n  Article 20 of the Illinois procurement code, source selection and \ncontract formation, at 500/20-85, contemplates the attachment of \nFederal strings. Section 20-85, Federal requirements: A State agency \nreceiving Federal aid funds, grants, or loans shall have authority to \nadopt its procedures, rules, project statements, drawings, maps, \nsurveys, plans, specifications, contract terms, estimates, bid forms, \nbond forms, and other documents or practices, to comply with the \nregulations, policies, and procedures of the designated authority, \nadministration, or department of the United States in order to remain \neligible for such Federal aid funds, grants, or loans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print this statute in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  West's Smith-Hurd Illinois Compiled Statutes Annotated Chapter 30. \n Finance Bonds and Debt Act 500. Illinois Procurement Code Article 20. \n                Source Selection and Contract Formation\n\n       Sec. 20-85. Federal requirements. A State agency receiving \n     federal-aid funds, grants, or loans shall have authority to \n     adopt its procedures, rules, project statements, drawings, \n     maps, surveys, plans, specifications, contract terms, \n     estimates, bid forms, bond forms, and other documents or \n     practices to comply with the regulations, policies, and \n     procedures of the designated authority, administration, or \n     department of the United States, in order to remain eligible \n     for such federal-aid funds, grants, or loans.\n\n\n                     historical and statutory notes\n\n       Section 99-5 of P.A. 90-572, Article 99, approved Feb. 6, \n     1998, provides:\n       ``Effective date and transition. This Article, Sections 1-\n     15 through 1-15.115 of Article 1, and Article 50 take effect \n     upon becoming law. Articles 1 through 45 and 53 through 95 \n     take effect January 1, 1998, solely for the purpose of \n     allowing the promulgation of rules to implement the Illinois \n     Procurement Code. The Procurement Policy Board established in \n     Article 5 may be appointed as of January 1, 1998, and until \n     July 1, 1998, shall act only to review proposed purchasing \n     rules. Articles 1 through 45 and 53 through 95 for all other \n     purposes take effect on July 1, 1998.''\n       For applicable effective date of laws provisions in \n     Illinois governing Sec. 99-5 of P.A. 90-572, Art. 99, see 5 \n     ILCS 75/0.01 et seq.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Clearly, the State of Illinois contemplates that for \nmany grants from the Federal Government, they will have to comply with \nthe Federal Government's requirements. That is not unusual. The Federal \nGovernment has requirements for education money, for Medicaid money, \nand the like. For this project, I think it is reasonable.\n  We don't want to unduly hamper it. But Federal competitive bidding, \nwho would oppose that? I don't think Democrats would oppose it. I don't \nthink Republicans would oppose it. Certainly no Democrat, no Republican \nin the Senate wished to go on record opposing it. It is a simple, safe \nprecaution for the taxpayers.\n  Again, this statute, which we have talked about on and off all day, \nconclusively demolishes the letters that are\n\n[[Page S9871]]\n\nbeing put out by the Capital Development Board saying they must use \ncompetitive bidding and that there is no way competitive bidding won't \nbe used.\n  Let me reflect on that argument again. They are saying that clearly \ncompetitive bidding will be used. This project now is the focus of a \nlot of attention around the State of Illinois, and many people have \nsaid it will definitely be competitively bid.\n  If that is the case, why such stiff opposition to attaching the \nFederal competitive bid guidelines? If they are going to bid it \naccording to the book and there won't be any problems with the \ncontracts, then why is anybody opposed? Why is it? I don't know.\n  Clearly, the Office of the Governor of Illinois believed strongly \nenough that these guidelines, these restrictions, not be attached. \nInstead, they chose to go around the Senate and try to get the language \nsnuck into a conference committee report, stripped of the competitive \nbidding language, and in a way so that it would be rolled into an $18 \nbillion appropriations bill that is a must-pass bill. That conference \ncommittee report cannot be amended or recommitted. They went to a lot \nof trouble. In fact, they were practically doing anything and stopping \nat nothing to avoid the competitive bid guidelines which they are \nessentially saying they are going to do anyway. That doesn't make a lot \nof sense to me. Why the objection? Why the fierce fight over requiring \nFederal procurement laws be followed?\n  Now, throughout the day, I have set the context in which this debate \nhas been occurring. I believed it necessary because for those who \naren't from the wonderful land of Lincoln, the great State of Illinois, \nthey may not be fully familiar with the politics.\n  Sometimes our politics have become famous. Chicago has famous \npolitical traditions. The State government probably hasn't been as well \nknown as the city of Chicago's government. But I believed I needed to \nset the table, to lay the foundation and give the Senators from other \nStates the context in which I was concerned that this money would be \nprovided in a way that would permit unfettered discretion on the part \nof whoever might get this $50 million authorized appropriation.\n  I read a number of articles into the Record this morning that talked \nabout problems that have occurred in State government in Illinois, not \njust under Republican administrations but under both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, where, because of a lack of competitive \nbidding, because of lax, weak procurement laws that left too much to \nthe subjective preferences of State officials on awarding contracts, we \nhave had of a sad history of procurement problems in the State of \nIllinois. Hopefully, the State's new procurement law will cut down on \nfuture problems such as that. But as I have pointed out, it has a few \nloopholes that I hope will get cleaned up.\n\n  We have talked about leases of buildings. We have talked about \nconstruction projects. We have highlighted a number of instances in \nwhich those leases at that time were not competitively bid, where there \nwere a lot of questions about the amounts taxpayers were paying for the \nState to lease buildings. And certainly the people involved in leasing \nthe properties to the State seem to be very involved in the political \nprocess, which raises a lot of questions in one's mind.\n  I also talked about the hotel loan, which involved a loan to a \npolitically connected developer to build the Springfield Renaissance \nHotel. It was a $15 million loan from the State of Illinois. It \nappeared also, as we read some of those articles, that Federal money \nwas involved in that, too, and that that loan was never repaid to the \nState of Illinois. Some payments were made. I don't know what the \nunpaid balance is today, but I think it is quite substantial. That \ndeveloper still has that hotel, too. This hotel is very close, about a \nblock and a half, maybe two blocks away, as we saw, from the proposed \nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library.\n  If the library is built and it becomes the wonderful attraction we \nhope it will be for citizens from all over the country to come and \nenjoy and learn about Abraham Lincoln in the hometown of Abraham \nLincoln, certainly it will generate a lot of tourist revenue for the \ncity of Springfield. I imagine the Springfield Renaissance Hotel would \nbenefit from the projections of increased tourism. I hope that would be \nthe case. I hope that perhaps at that time the hotel, the partnership \nthat runs it, would think about whether they couldn't make more \npayments to the State on that $15 million taxpayer loan that goes back \nto the early 1980s.\n  I know that State officials released personal guarantees and waived \nthe State's right to foreclose on that hotel loan. It is clear there \nprobably isn't much of a legally enforceable note anymore. You would \nhave to wonder if those people would think about whether it wouldn't be \na good idea for them, the right thing for them to do, to try to make \npayments when they could. They probably would argue that the notes are \nworthless now and that the State's rights as lender were waived while \nthe loan was in default. It is kind of unusual. In fact, I have never \nreally heard of a lender, when they have a bad loan, waive all their \nrights. It seems kind of odd to me.\n  In any case, there is another episode in our State's recent history \nthat I was very vocal on when I was in the State senate. That was on \nhow riverboat licenses were given out.\n  Back in about 1990, the State created 10 riverboat licenses. The \nfirst six of them were fairly site specific in their statute on where \nthe river boat licenses had to go.\n  That always raised questions because there were questions of whether \nin drawing up the statute the State was actually attempting to steer \nthese riverboat licenses to certain individuals. It just so happened \nthat an investor in the first riverboat license awarded under the \nIllinois gaming law was the very same individual, Mr. William Cellini, \nabout whom we have read some articles, who got the hotel loan, didn't \nhave to pay it back, had the leases of the State buildings, and has \nbeen involved in politics in Illinois for a long time.\n  I would, if I could, like to continue on in an examination of what \nhappened when the State didn't competitively bid the riverboat \nlicenses, and I always believed they should have been competitively \nbid. You had licenses that turned out to be phenomenally lucrative. In \nsome cases, very small investments made many people very rich, very \nquickly. There was always a question as to how the State determined who \ngot the licenses. The people who wound up getting the first six \nlicenses, which were fairly site-specific, tended to be people who were \nvery much involved in State politics in Illinois. They were what I \nwould call ``insiders'' in the State capitol. Of course, they always \nencouraged the perception that it was just a coincidence that these \nvery lucrative licenses fell into their hands. And they got real rich, \nreal quick.\n  In fact, a riverboat was put up in Joliet, IL. I remember when I was \nin the State senate, that boat was called the Joliet Empress. We could \nnot find out the financial results of these boats. It was an exception \nto the freedom of information laws in Springfield, and even though \nthese boats got a license from the State, they didn't have to give out \nfinancial information to the public. But the Joliet Empress decided to \ndo a public bond offering, as I recall. In order to do that public \noffering of its debt securities, it had to file a registration \nstatement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the process \nof filing that statement, they disclosed their investors and disclosed \nsome of the financial results of the riverboat.\n  I am going to suggest that the original investment was somewhere in \nthe neighborhood of $20 million. In the first 18 months, as I recall, \nthe nine people who owned the riverboat took in something like $87 \nmillion in cash dividends. It kind of makes the Internet firms that we \nare reading about in the soaring NASDAQ index seem like nothing. This \nwas really a bonanza for the people who wound up with these riverboat \nlicenses.\n  When I read on the floor of the Illinois State Senate how lucrative \nthese licenses were, I thought it was wrong that the State wasn't \ncompetitively bidding those licenses. They were setting up a process by \nwhich people who wanted these licenses could go through the politicians \nwho could give it to them on a no-bid basis. And in so doing, the State \nwas leaving an awful lot of money on the table. In fact, they were \nliterally lighting a match to millions of dollars they could have \nreaped\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\nhad they auctioned off those licenses and created some kind of bidding \nprocess and not allowed political favoritism to ever be a question in \nthe awarding of those licenses.\n  In fact, there was a lot of opposition to ever competitively bidding \nthose licenses. Certainly, the people who wound up owning or wanting \nthe licenses never wanted those competitively bid. Instead, what \nhappened, in order to raise revenue in the early 1990s, on a few \noccasions the State raised income taxes on everybody else.\n  Mr. President, let me go, if I may, to a couple of articles that \ndescribe how the State gave out the no-bid riverboat licenses. Again, \nthis is all in the context of examining what happens when State, \nFederal, or local government--any government at all--don't put \nrestrictions on money they are giving out for contracts, or on benefits \nthat they are giving out, when they don't make sure there is a \ncompetitive bidding process involved. Questions always arise as to \nwhether there is political favoritism.\n  This article is from the Chicago Sun-Times of February 26, 1993. The \nbyline is by Ray Long. The headline is, ``Developer Hits Riverboat \nJackpot; Stock Sale Windfall Steams Treasurer.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Chicago Sun-Times \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Chicago Sun-Times, Feb. 26, 1993]\n\n   Developer Hits Riverboat Jackpot; Stock Sale Windfall ``Steams'' \n                               Treasurer\n\n                             (By Ray Long)\n\n       Politically powerful Springfield developer William Cellini \n     has sold $5.3 million in riverboat casino stock as part of a \n     deal that prompted the state treasurer to call for a windfall \n     tax on such transactions.\n       Argosy Gaming Co., owner of the Alton Belle riverboat, \n     reported that Cellini sold 277,778 shares, netting him $4.9 \n     million after fees, in last week's first public offering of \n     Illinois riverboat stock.\n       Argosy sold a total of $76.6 million in stock, and the \n     original shareholders collected $29.5 million, the company \n     said.\n       Cellini remains the largest single shareholder, and his \n     remaining shares could be worth more than $50 million, based \n     on the value of the public shares.\n       Argosy plans to use money from the sale to pay start-up \n     debts, fund a new riverboat and develop gambling in Louisiana \n     and Missouri.\n       State Treasurer Patrick Quinn, a Democrat, said, ``I've got \n     steam coming out of my ears'' from anger over the Argosy \n     deal. ``It's downright obscene.''\n       A probable gubernatorial candidate in 1994, Quinn said \n     Cellini should have been denied his piece of the Alton \n     riverboat license because of questions about his role in a \n     state loan to build the Springfield Ramada Renaissance hotel.\n       ``I don't think if you take the taxpayers to the cleaners \n     once, you should get a second chance to put more money in \n     your own pocket,'' Quinn said while taping ``The Reporters,'' \n     to be aired at 9 p.m. Sunday on WMAQ-AM (670).\n       The state should impose a windfall tax on investors in \n     riverboat gambling ventures that start private and later go \n     public, Quinn said.\n       In a separate interview, Cellini, a top Republican fund-\n     raiser and friend of Gov. Edgar's, said the Springfield hotel \n     arrangement was proper.\n       As for the riverboat transaction, he said he had been \n     ``obligated at one time for an amount approaching a million'' \n     dollars. He said federal regulations about new public \n     offerings prevented him from discussing details about the \n     company or stock sale.\n       The Ramada Renaissance received a 1982 state loan for $15.5 \n     million at 12\\1/4\\ percent interest. After recurring payment \n     disputes, the loan was restructured in 1991 for $18.6 million \n     at 6 percent.\n       Cellini said he was one of 80 partners in the hotel. ``I \n     have never taken out or realized one penny from the hotel,'' \n     he said.\n       Quinn's staff said the lenders defaulted in 1987 under \n     former state Treasurer Jerry Cosentino and former Gov. James \n     R. Thompson, a Republican and friend of Cellini's.\n       But Cellini disputed this account. ``During the time of the \n     loan,'' he said, ``I don't believe we were ever declared in \n     default--except in order to refinance and restructure, there \n     may have been needed language implying such.''\n       Quinn said: ``A lot of folks, I think, are pretty upset \n     about getting taxed to the limit and then seeing government \n     operate . . . as a personal piggy bank for insiders. This is \n     wrong.''\n       Mike Lawrence, spokesman for Edgar, said the Gaming Board's \n     initial approval of the Alton riverboat project was granted \n     before the governor took office. The final license approval \n     came in 1991 after Edgar took office.\n       William Kunkle, Gaming Board chairman, said Cellini passed \n     the agency's background check.\n       Meanwhile, Thursday, the Gaming Board met in Chicago and \n     failed to reach agreement on how to implement a legal limit \n     of 1,200 gambling customers per riverboat.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, there are a number of other articles \nthat have been written over the years about how the State gave out the \nriverboat gambling licenses in Illinois. The record is replete with \nproblems that the State had, or questions that were raised about how \nthe licenses were awarded. They just happened to be awarded to people \nwho seemed to be involved in the political process.\n  That was something I was concerned about at the time. I was in the \nState senate at that time; this goes back to 1994. There is an article \nin the Chicago Sun-Times that discusses how I was seeking competitive \nbidding on those State riverboat licenses.\n  This is an article from April 10, 1994, entitled, ``Riverboat Deal is \nPlum For Insiders,'' by Dennis Byrne of the Chicago Sun-Times:\n\n       The agreement between Mayor Daley and Gov. Edgar to bring \n     riverboat gambling to Chicago should make a lot of people \n     happy: Chicago taxpayers and schoolchildren, who will benefit \n     from the additional revenues, and the thousands of casino/\n     entertainment center employees.\n       But the folks who should be the happiest are the well-\n     connected insiders who are already raking it in from the \n     state's 10 suburban and Downstate riverboats and who stand to \n     make hundreds of millions more from the Chicago riverboats.\n       That would be thanks to a little-noticed part of the \n     agreement changing the law that bans owners of one riverboat \n     license from having more than a 10 percent interest in a \n     second. If approved by the Legislature, they could own a \n     second license and up to a 10 percent interest in a third.\n       So folks such as Eugene Heytow, chairman of the politically \n     connected Amalgamated Trust & Savings Bank, where William \n     Daley, the mayor's brother, once was president, could keep \n     his stake in a riverboat in Galena while buying a chunk of \n     one in Chicago. And William Cellini, a powerful friend of \n     Edgar and former Gov. James R. Thompson, could buy into \n     Chicago big-time while keeping his lucrative interest in the \n     Alton Belle. So could Gayle Franzen, the Republican candidate \n     for DuPage County Board chairman. And so on.\n       You could argue that they should get a piece of the Chicago \n     action because the state is changing the rules of the game, \n     that when they invested in the suburban and Downstate boats \n     they believed they wouldn't face any competitive risk from \n     Chicago.\n       However, it's not a very convincing argument in the face of \n     the obscene profits that they have already harvested from \n     their state-protected monopolies. State Sen. Peter G. \n     Fitzgerald (R-Inverness), a banker, has calculated that the \n     profits have been great enough to cover initial investments \n     in only a matter of months--the kind of return that might \n     make Hillary Rodham Clinton envious. In the case of the Alton \n     Belle, a $20 million or so capital investment (and a paltry \n     $85,000 for a state licensing fee) seeded a company that now \n     has an estimated market value approaching a half billion \n     dollars.\n\n  Let me read that again.\n  This is from Dennis Byrne, ``Riverboat Deal is Plum for Insiders.''\n\n       In the case of the Alton Belle, a $20 million or so capital \n     investment--and a paltry $85,000 for a State licensing fee.\n\n  The guys who got the riverboats gave the State $85,000. The State \ngave them a license and ceded a company that now has an estimated \nmarket value approaching $.5 billion.\n  Not a bad deal if you are giving the $85,000 and they are giving you \nthe license. It is worth, at that time they say, $.5 billion. What did \nthe taxpayers get out of this with no competitive bidding? They had \ntheir income taxes raised during that time.\n\n       For an initial outlay of just a couple hundred grand 2\\1/2\\ \n     years ago, investors now would own tens of millions of \n     dollars worth of stock. Cellini himself plucked $4.9 million \n     when he sold some of his stock when the company went public, \n     but still retains some $60 million worth of stock.\n       And if they invest in Chicago boats? Using the city's \n     figures, Fitzgerald calculates that annual net income on each \n     boat could approach $50 million, and that the market value of \n     each boat (at five times earnings) could exceed a quarter of \n     a billion dollars.\n       Thankfully, though, they'd have to sink more into the \n     Chicago boats, because, unlike the license for suburban and \n     Downstate boats, the city licenses would be competitively \n     bid. Who gets the license will depend, in part, on how much \n     the bidder is willing to give to the city in admission, \n     franchise and other fees. Unfortunately, though, the state's \n     20 percent gaming tax on gross receipts will not be raised, \n     for the Chicago or Downstate boats. Nor do we know if other \n     municipalities that are granted new boats will be able to \n     demand competitive bidding.\n       Fitzgerald believes that even if the 20 percent state tax \n     were raised significantly, to as high as 60 percent, the \n     owners still would make a nice profit. So if we truly believe\n\n[[Page S9873]]\n\n     that the boats are a public good, maybe we should allow the \n     public to rake off at least as much as some politically \n     connected pals.\n\n  Mr. President, I understand that the Presiding Officer has an \nobligation, so I will try to focus my remarks and enable the Presiding \nOfficer to meet that obligation.\n  We have introduced a number of articles on this point all during the \nday to lay the context in which my concerns were raised about this very \nlarge project in Springfield.\n  I guess now we are down to the point where we have to ask the big \nquestion: Is the proposed Abraham Lincoln Library in Springfield, IL, \nanother insider deal? I certainly hope it doesn't become one. This may \nor may not be now. We will not know until it is done. But we should do \nour very best to prevent it from becoming one.\n  We have said if we don't have careful controls, the money could wind \nup in private hands. It wouldn't have to be competitively bid under the \nlanguage in the conference report. If the money winds up in State \nhands, then under the language that passed out of the House in the \nconference report, and which the Senate has basically said they don't \nlike because it doesn't have Federal competitive bidding in it, if the \nmoney went to a private entity and went to the State--we have seen the \nState without competitive bidding. I would hate to see the monument to \n``Honest Abe'' discussed in one of these many articles that have been \nwritten by investigative reporters. Competitive bidding could be opted \nout if it were the Capital Development Board that were doing the \nproject.\n  As I pointed out, it is not unusual for the State to have to live \nwithin Federal competitive bid guidelines. This is not an unusual \nrequest. Then there is the State code. The State procurement code \nspecifically contemplates the application of Federal guidelines such as \nthese Federal competitive guidelines.\n  Are there red flags on this project? I want to sum those up again. We \ntalked earlier in the day about some of the red flags.\n  We had the cost of the project increasing as the project has been \ntalked about over the last few years. It started out as a proposed $40 \nmillion project in February of 1998. It went to a $60 million project \n13 months later, in March of 1999. When I first came to the Senate, it \nwas a $60 million project. Then one month after that, the next report \nsaid it was a $148 million project--up from the most recent $60 million \nestimate on advice from ``designers and fiscal advisers.'' That raised \nthe red flag in my mind. I thought we had to bird-dog this project. \nAfter all, that is a big expenditure in any city, and it is certainly a \nbig expenditure in the city of Springfield, our State capital.\n  The estimated cost, adjusted for inflation, of our State capitol is \nonly $70 million compared to the $148 million that we saw referred to \nthere, and now the $120 million that they are talking about for this \nlibrary.\n  The cost of other buildings in Springfield: the Willard Ice Building \nis a $70 million building; the Prairie Capital Convention Center is a \n$60 million building.\n  We are really talking about a very visible project in Springfield. We \ndiscussed the location as well of this library. We noted its proximity \nto the Springfield Ramada Renaissance Hotel. We talked at length about \nthe history of the Springfield Renaissance Hotel. We noted that this \nproject is intended to and will stimulate tourism, if it is done right, \nin the city of Springfield. That hotel stands to benefit from that. It \nwould be nice if we could get some payments on that $15 million State \nloan from back in 1982 to build that.\n  We have not yet noted, and I think we need to note, that Mr. Cellini, \nwhom we have discussed, has been active in seeking to raise money for \nthe private foundation that is connected to the library. Let me see if \nI can focus on that for one second and find a citation for you, Mr. \nPresident. There are newspaper articles, I believe, that suggest he has \nbeen out actively trying to raise money for the library. I would like \nto find that citation.\n  Incidentally, I should also mention that the Ronald Reagan \nPresidential Library cost $65 million.\n  It is a State Journal Register article from September 5, 1999, a \nlittle over a year ago:\n\n       William Cellini reported to be heading private fundraising \n     drive for the project.\n\n  So we are beginning to connect this all back into some of the \nprojects we have read about throughout the course of the day. These are \nconnecting threads, and set against the backdrop of procurement history \nand controversy in Illinois, I think there is good reason for Congress \nto be careful with this project. I think it is reasonable to look at \nall these red flags and say, this $50 million in Federal money, we \nbetter make sure it is buttoned down; better be careful, we don't want \nto happen to this money what has sometimes happened in the past. We \ndon't want this project ever to be the subject of one of these \ninvestigative reports in one of our State's fine newspapers.\n\n  In light of the time restraints we are running up against tonight, \nthe hour is late and I recognize that, I thank my colleagues again for \nall their support, for going on record in favor of competitive bidding \nin accordance with the Federal competitive bidding guidelines. I \ncertainly hope the House will reconsider the position that has come out \nof the House in opposition for buttoning down this money and having \ntighter controls on it, to make sure that none of it winds up being \ninvolved in an insider deal, and that Springfield gets $120 million \nworth of value out of the $120 million that is intended to be spent on \nthis monument for Abraham Lincoln.\n  Some may wonder why I have sought to filibuster the Interior \nappropriations bill over this matter. They would note $50 million is a \nsubstantial amount, but as a percentage of the entire appropriations \nbill, it is relatively small in comparison. There are literally \ncountless projects throughout the country that are contained in that \nbill. I believed it was important to come to the floor and to lay out \nthis case because it goes to the very heart of the appropriations \nprocess in Washington.\n  I understand those who oppose the competitive bidding will eventually \nhave a good opportunity to move their bill and make sure the \ncompetitive bidding isn't in there. But I hope we are going to have \nillumination here. I think the people of Illinois can know who their \ngovernment is and what it is about. I think that the people of this \ncountry may see, through the prism of Illinois, how serious and \nconsequential the ethical foundations of their government can and must \nbe.\n  This issue of whether we make sure this money is competitively bid \ngoes to the very heart of the appropriations process. We ought to take \ngreat care of the people's money. The people's money represents \nprecious hours of hard work, sweat, and time away from family. The \nAmerican people are fundamentally generous, and they will permit \nreasonable expenditures for the good of their country, their \ncommunities, and their State. However, Mr. President, don't abuse them. \nDo your best to make sure that there are sufficient safeguards so the \npeople can know that their taxpayer dollars will not simply be trampled \non by political insiders. That is what bothers me personally, eats at \nme--the people who oppose provisions such as this act, as though $50 \nmillion in taxpayer money is a quarter. How can we ever put too many \ncontrols on taxpayer money? Why would anyone not welcome even more \nstringent competitive bid rules? Why would anybody oppose that? I can't \nthink of a good reason.\n  The backdrop of problems we have had in the State of Illinois for a \nlong time, which I illuminated today, and the legacy of insider dealing \nmake me very reluctant to turn over this particular $120 million \nwithout doing everything I can to protect it.\n  I thank all of those who have stayed with me tonight, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/04/senate-section/article/S9873-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
