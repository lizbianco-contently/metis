We are going to be in session until at least \nclose to noon today.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 4577, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4577) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2001, and for other purposes.\n  Pending:\n\n       McCain amendment No. 3610, to enhance protection of \n     children using the Internet.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation bill before the Senate today contains a program level of \n$104.5 billion, an increase of $7.9 billion or 8.2 percent over the \nfiscal year 2000 program level. This program level was achieved by \nsavings in the following areas: The temporary assistance to needy \nfamilies, supplemental security income, and the State children's health \ninsurance programs. Further, savings were also achieved by advance \nfunding an additional $2.3 billion of education dollars into fiscal \nyear 2002, while keeping the same overall level of advances as last \nyear. The actual budget authority in the bill is $97.35 billion, the \nfull amount of the subcommittee's allocation under section 302(b) of \nthe Budget Act.\n  Given the subcommittee's allocation there were inadequate resources \nto sufficiently fund important health, education and training programs. \nTherefore savings needed to be found in order to expand these high \npriority discretionary programs. For example, savings were achieved by \nshifting $1.9 billion in unspent fiscal year 1998 State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program (SCHIP) funds into fiscal year 2003. Currently \n38 States and the District of Columbia have not spent their SCHIP funds \nwhich are due to expire on September 30, 2000. By reappropriating \nfunds, these 38 States and the District of Columbia will have an \nopportunity to spend these dollars in future years.\n  The recommendations made in the bill both keeps faith with the budget \nagreement and addresses the health,\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\neducation, employment and training priorities of the Senate.\n  While consistent with the budget agreement, many tough choices had to \nbe made. Senator Harkin and I received over 1,800 requests from Members \nfor expanded funding for programs within the subcommittee's \njurisdiction. In order to stay within the allocation and balance the \npriorities established in the budget agreement and expressed in Member \nrequests, we had to take a critical look at all of the programs within \nthe bill. I want to take this opportunity to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, for his hard work and support in \nbringing this bill through the committee and on to the floor for full \nconsideration by all Senators.\n  The programs funded within the subcommittee's jurisdiction provide \nresources to improve the public health and strengthen biomedical \nresearch, assure a quality education for America's children, and offer \nopportunities for individuals seeking to improve job skills. I'd like \nto mention several important accomplishments of this bill.\n  Nothing is more important than a persons health and few things are \nfeared more than ill health. Medical research into understanding, \npreventing, and treating the disorders that afflict men and women in \nour society is the best means we have for protecting our health and \ncombating disease.\n  Since January of 2000, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee has held nine \nhearings on medical research issues.\n  We have heard testimony from NIH Institute Directors, medical experts \nfrom across the United States, patients, family members, and advocates \nasking for increased biomedical research funding to find the causes and \ncures for diseases Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, ALS, AIDS, \ncancer, diabetes, heart disease, and many other serious health \ndisorders. We have also heard from advocates on both sides of the stem \ncell debate. The bill before the Senate contains $20.5 billion for the \nNational Institutes of Health, the crown jewel of the Federal \ngovernment. The $2.7 billion increase over the fiscal year 2000 \nappropriation will support medical research that is being conducted at \ninstitutions throughout the country. This increase will continue the \neffort to double NIH by fiscal year 2003. These funds will be critical \nin catalyzing scientific discoveries that will lead to new treatments \nand cures for a whole host of diseases.\n  Head Start: To enable all children to develop and function at their \nhighest potential, the bill includes $6.2 billion for the Head Start \nprogram, an increase of $1 billion over last year's appropriation. This \nincrease will provide services to an additional 60,000 children \nbringing the total amount of kids served in fiscal year 2001 to \n936,000. This increase will put us on track to enroll one million \nchildren in Head Start by the year 2002.\n  Community health centers: To help provide primary health care \nservices to the medically indigent and underserved populations in rural \nand urban areas, the bill contains $1.1 billion for community health \ncenters. This amount represents an increase of $100 million over the \nfiscal year 2000 appropriation. These centers will provide health care \nto nearly 11 million low-income patients, 4.5 million of whom are \nuninsured.\n  Youth Violence Initiative: The bill includes $1.2 billion for \nprograms to assist communities in preventing youth violence. This \ninitiative, begun in fiscal year 2000, will continue to address youth \nviolence in a comprehensive way by coordinating programs throughout the \nFederal government to improve research, prevention, education and \ntreatment strategies to identify and combat youth violence.\n\n  Drug demand initiative: To curb the effects of drug abuse, the bill \nincludes $3.7 billion for programs to help reduce the demand for drugs \nin this country. Funds have been increased for drug education in this \nNation's schools; youth offender drug counseling, education and \nemployment programs; and substance abuse research and prevention.\n  Women's health: Again this year, the committee has placed a very high \npriority on women's health. The bill before the Senate provides $4.1 \nbillion for programs specifically addressing the health needs of women. \nIncluded in this amount is $27.4 million for the Public Health Service, \nOffice of Women's Health, an increase of $6.1 million over last year's \nfunding level to continue and expand programs to develop model health \ncare services for women, provide monies for a comprehensive review of \nthe impact of heart disease on women, and to launch an osteoporosis \npublic education campaign aimed at teenagers. Also included is $253.9 \nmillion for family planning programs; $169 million to support the \nprograms that provide assistance to women who have been victims of \nabuse and to initiate and expand domestic violence prevention programs \nto begin; $149.9 million for sexually transmitted diseases; $177.5 \nmillion for breast and cervical cancer screening; and $2.7 billion for \nresearch directed at women at the National Institutes of Health.\n  Medical error reduction: The Labor-HHS Subcommittee held several \nhearings to explore the factors leading to medical errors and received \ntestimony from family members and patients detailing their experiences \nwith medical mistakes. The Institute of Medicine also gave testimony \nand outlined findings from their recent report which indicated that \n98,000 deaths occur each year because of medical errors. The bill \nbefore the Senate contains $50 million to determine ways to reduce \nmedical errors and also recommends that guidelines be developed to \ncollect data related to patient safety, best practices to reduce error \nrates and ways to improve provider training.\n  LIHEAP: The bill maintains $1.1 billion for the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The bill also provides an \nadditional $300 million in emergency appropriations. LIHEAP is a key \nprogram for low income families in Pennsylvania and cold weather states \nthroughout the nation. Funding supports grants to states to deliver \ncritical assistance to low income households to help meet higher energy \ncosts.\n  Aging programs; For programs serving the elderly, the bill before the \nSenate recommends $2.4 billion, an increase of $133 million over the \nfiscal year 2000 appropriation. Included is: $440.2 million for the \ncommunity service employment program which provides part-time \nemployment opportunities for low-income elderly; $325.1 million for \nsupportive services and senior centers; $521.4 million for congregate \nand home-delivered nutrition services; and $187.3 million for the \nNational Senior Volunteer Corps. Also, the bill provides increased \nfunds for research into the causes and cures of Alzheimer's disease and \nother aging related disorders; funds to continue geriatric education \ncenters; and the Medicare insurance counseling program.\n  AIDS: The bill includes $2.5 billion for AIDS research, prevention \nand services. Included in this amount is $1.6 billion for Ryan White \nprograms, an increase of $55.4 million; $762.1 million for AIDS \nprevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control; $60 million for \nglobal and minority AIDS activities within the Public Health and Social \nServices Funds; and $85 million for benefit payments authorized by the \nRicky Ray Hemophilia Trust Fund Act.\n  Education: To enhance this Nation's investment in education, the bill \nbefore the Senate contains $40.2 billion in discretionary education \nfunds, an increase of $4.6 billion over last year's funding level, and \n$100 million more than the President's budget request.\n  Education for disadvantaged children: For programs to educate \ndisadvantaged children, the bill recommends $8.9 billion, an increase \nof $177.8 million over last year's level. These funds will provide \nservices to approximately 13 million school children. The bill also \nincludes $185 million for the Even Start program, an increase of $35 \nmillion over the 2000 appropriation. Even Start provides education \nservices to low-income children and their families.\n  Title VI block grant: For the Innovative education program strategies \nState grant program, the bill contains $3.1 billion, an increase of \n$2.7 billion over fiscal year 2000. Within this amount, $2.7 billion is \nto be used to assist local educational agencies, as part of their \nlocally developed strategies, to improve academic achievement of \nstudents. Funds may be used to address the shortage of highly qualified \nteachers, reduce class size, particularly in the early grades, or for \nrenovation and construction of school facilities. How the funds shall \nbe spent is at the sole discretion of the local educational agency.\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\n  Impact aid: For impact aid programs, the bill includes $1.030 \nbillion, an increase of $123.5 million over the 2000 appropriation. \nIncluded in the recommendation is: $50 million for payments for \nchildren with disabilities; $818 million for basic support payments, an \nincrease of $80.8 million; $82 million for heavily impacted districts; \n$25 million for construction and $47 million for payments for Federal \nproperty.\n  Bilingual education: The bill provides $443 million to assist in the \neducation of immigrant and limited-English proficient students. This \nrecommendation is an increase of $37 million over the 2000 \nappropriation and will provide instructional services to approximately \n1.3 million children.\n  Special education: One of the largest increases recommended in this \nbill is the $1.3 billion for special education programs. The $7.1 \nbillion provided will help local educational agencies meet the \nrequirement that all children with disabilities have access to a free, \nappropriate public education, and all infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities have access to early intervention services. These funds \nwill serve an estimated 6.4 million children age 3-21, at a cost of \n$984 per child. While also supporting 580,500 preschoolers at a cost of \n$672 per child.\n  TRIO: To improve post-secondary education opportunities for low-\nincome first-generation college students, the committee recommendation \nprovides $736.5 million for the TRIO program, a $91.5 million increase \nover the 2000 appropriation. These additional funds will assist in more \nintensive outreach and support services for low income youth.\n  Student aid: For student aid programs, the bill provides $10.6 \nbillion, an increase of $1.3 billion over last year's amount. Pell \ngrants, the cornerstone of student financial aid, have been increased \nby $350 for a maximum grant of $3,650. The supplemental educational \nopportunity grants program has also been increased by $70 million, the \nwork study program was increased by $77 million and the Perkins loans \nprograms is increased by $30 million.\n  21st Century Community Learning Centers: For the 21st Century After \nSchool program, the bill provides $600 million, an increase of $146.6 \nmillion over last year's level. This program supports rural and inner-\ncity public elementary and secondary schools that provide extended \nlearning opportunities and offer recreational, health, and other social \nservices programs. The bill also includes language to permit funds to \nbe provided to community-based organizations.\n  Job training: In this Nation, we know all too well that unemployment \nwastes valuable human talent and potential, and ultimately weakens our \neconomy. The bill before us today provides $5.4 billion for job \ntraining programs, $16.7 million over the 2000 level. Also included is \n$652.4 million, an increase of $19.2 million for Job Corps operations; \n$950 million for Adult training; and $1.6 billion for retraining \ndislocated workers. Also includes is $20 million for a new program to \nupgrade worker skills. These funds will help improve job skills and \nreadjustment services for disadvantaged youth and adults.\n  Workplace safety: The bill provides $1.3 billion for worker \nprotection programs, an increase of $90 million above the 2000 \nappropriation. While progress has been made in this area, there are \nstill far too many work-related injuries and illnesses. The funds \nprovided will continue the programs that inspect business and industry, \nassist employers in weeding out occupational hazards and protect \nworkers' pay and pensions.\n  There are many other notable accomplishments in this bill, but for \nthe sake of time, I mentioned just several of the key highlights, so \nthat the Nation may grasp the scope and importance of this bill.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator Harkin and \nhis staff and the other Senators on the subcommittee for their \ncooperation in a very tough budget year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond, is recognized to call up an amendment regarding \ncommunity health centers.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is another pending amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3602\n\n   (Purpose: To increase funding for the consolidated health centers)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, amendment No. 3602 is at the desk. I ask \nthat it be called up for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself, Mr. \n     Hollings, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Akaka, \n     Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n     Breaux, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Burns, Mr. Campbell, Mr. L.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 23, line 23, strike ``4,522,424,000'' and replace \n     with ``4,572,424,000''.\n       On page 92, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Amounts made available under this Act for the \n     administrative and related expenses for departmental \n     management for the Department of Labor, the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education \n     shall be reduced on a pro rata basis by $50,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to offer what I think is a very \nimportant amendment to increase the funding this bill provides for a \nvital piece of our Nation's health care system--our community health \ncenters.\n  This amendment, which I am very pleased to offer in conjunction with \nmy colleague, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, who has been a long-\ntime supporter of community health centers--as was the late Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, the father of the distinguished occupant of the \nchair, who was a great champion of community health centers--along with \na total of 58 cosponsors, would increase funding for community health \ncenters by a total of $50 million for this coming year. That is a $50 \nmillion increase over that which is already included. The offset we use \nto fund this health center increase is a reduction in the departmental \nmanagement fund for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education.\n  The managers of this bill, Senators Specter and Harkin, clearly had a \nvery difficult task in crafting this bill. There is a lot of money in \nit, but there are even more demands and requests for good things that \nthis bill does. And they have to compete for the funds that, although \nthey are significant, are still limited.\n  Despite the competing demands, the underlying bill has a $100 million \nincrease for community health centers. I sincerely commend the chairman \nand the ranking member for their efforts to include this very needed \nincrease in the funding for the CHCs. At the same time, I believe very \nstrongly that adding an additional $50 million for health center \nfunding is crucial to ensure that these vital health care providers \nhave sufficient resources behind them to do everything they can to \nprovide for the uninsured and medically underserved Americans.\n  All of us who have talked about health care know that the lack of \naccess to care is perhaps the largest single health care problem that \nfaces our Nation today.\n  Part of this problem is a lack of health insurance. About 44 million \nAmericans are not covered by any type of health plan. But an equally \nserious part of the problem is that many people are simply unable to \nget access to a health care provider. Even if they have insurance, a \nyoung couple with a sick child is out of luck if they can't get in to \nsee a pediatrician or other health care provider. In too many urban and \nrural communities around\n\n[[Page S5716]]\n\nthe country, there just are not enough doctors to go around.\n  I urge my colleagues, if they have not done what I have done--and \nthat is, to visit community health centers in their States--that they \ndo so. You will be amazed and you will be very uplifted to see the work \nthat is going on each and every day in these community health centers.\n  Community health centers in a center city, in the poorest \nneighborhoods, are reaching out and helping everyone--from the very \nyoung to the teenage mother perhaps with a child, or a teenager who is \nexpecting a child, to the very elderly, who have difficulty getting \naround.\n  We see the same thing in rural areas, in some of the communities that \nare the hardest to access in our State. There are community health \ncenters with dedicated physicians and nurses and health care \nprofessionals who are there to answer the health care needs of people \nwho would have no chance of getting service were it not for the health \ncenters.\n  These community health centers are truly the safety net of our health \ncare system. For all of my colleagues, I trust they do know about these \ncenters, but for other concerned citizens who may be watching, I \nsuggest they find out about the community health centers in their area. \nWhat are they doing; are they serving people in need? I can tell my \ncolleagues, based on the experience in my State, they are delivering \nthe service to people who otherwise would not be served, were it not \nfor these CHCs.\n  We all know there are problems with access to health care. There are \nmany good ideas on additional steps we need to take. Some people want \nnationalized health care. Other people want new tax credits, subsidized \nhealth insurance. Others want to expand governmental health programs. \nSome people want to enhance insurance pooling arrangements. All of \nthese have been proposed in an effort to make sure people have the \nhealth coverage and can get the care they need. As different and as \ndiverse and as creative as many of these ideas are, they all have one \nthing in common: They are not going to be passed into law this year. \nAll these wonderful ideas are going to come together. They are going to \nclash. We will look at them and talk about them, and we are going to \nrefine them and argue about them and go down different roads. They are \nnot going to pass this year. The breadth of the disagreement over these \npolicy issues and the political complications of an election year make \nit totally unlikely that Congress will bring any of these new ideas to \nreality.\n  There is one thing we can still do this year, something we can pass \ninto law that will make a big difference for many people who lack \naccess to health care. What we can do is dramatically increase funding \nfor community health centers and help them reach out to even more \nuninsured and underserved Americans.\n  Just for the technical background, health centers are private not-\nfor-profit clinics that provide primary care, preventive health care \nservices in thousands of medically underserved urban and rural \ncommunities around the country. Partially with the help of Federal \ngrants, health care centers provide basic care for about 11 million \npeople every year, 4 million of whom are uninsured. Health centers \nprovide care for 7 million people who are minorities, 600,000 farm \nworkers, close to 1 out of every 20 Americans, 1 out of every 12 rural \nresidents, 1 out of every 6 low-income children, and 1 out of every 5 \nbabies born to low-income families.\n  Despite this great work, there are millions of Americans who still \ncannot get access to health care. The demand for the type of care these \ncenters provide simply exceeds the resources available. Today we can \nhelp change this. There are as many as 44 million who are not covered \nby a health plan. We are covering about 11 million. We need to do \nsomething to make sure we serve those additional people. We are \nbuilding on a program that has proven itself to be effective.\n  This is probably the best health care bargain we can get because \nthese not-for-profit centers leverage the Federal dollars that go into \nthem. They collect insurance from those who are insured. They can \ncollect Medicare or Medicaid. They are a vehicle for providing the \nservice. The average cost per patient served by a community health \ncenter in my State is something like $350 a year. That is how much it \ncosts them because of the other reimbursements and because of \nthe efficiencies and economies of scale. That is less than $1 a day. \nNot too many plans can provide so much bang for the buck, so much \nimportant delivery of health care service. This is probably the first \npriority of all the health care problems we are facing, and there are \nmany. We can do something that will have a real impact on access to \ncare and the uninsured. It is the best thing we can do to expand that \nsafety net and pursue the search for better health care.\n\n  There are a couple of key reasons why community health centers are so \nimportant. No. 1, these dollars build on an existing program that \nproduces results. Unlike many other health care proposals that suggest \nradically new and untested ideas, health centers are known entities. \nThey do an outstanding job. They are known, respected, and trusted in \ntheir communities.\n  Numerous independent studies, in addition to the observations of \nthose of us who have traveled around to visit them, confirm that \ncommunity health centers provide high quality care in an efficient and \ncost-effective manner. Health centers truly target the health care \naccess problem. By definition, health centers must be located in \nmedically underserved communities, which means places where people have \nserious problems getting access to health care. So health centers \nattack the problem right at its source--in the communities where those \npeople live. Health centers are relatively cheap. Health centers can \nprovide primary and preventive care for one person for less than $1 a \nday, $350 a year. That has to be one of the best health care bargains \naround.\n  This proposal is not a Government takeover of health care. \nAdmittedly, this amendment calls for more Government spending, but \nunlike most other health care proposals, this funding would not go to \ncreate or expand a huge health care bureaucracy. This amendment would \ninvest additional funds into private organizations which have \nconsistently proven themselves to be efficient, high quality, cost-\neffective health care providers.\n  If this amendment succeeds, it will mean an overall increase in \nhealth center funding of $150 million. That level of increase will put \nus on a path to double health center funding over 5 years. As my \ncolleagues know, this same goal, doubling funding over 5 years, is what \nwe challenge ourselves to provide to the National Institutes of Health. \nThrough these increased funds to health centers, we continue our \nsupport for the good work that goes on in health centers. As in NIH, we \nhave increased funding for biomedical research that produces medical \ninnovations and develops ways to save, improve, and prolong people's \nlives. I have supported those efforts. In fact, the underlying bill \ncontains funding increases for NIH that will keep us on the track for \ndoubling NIH funding over 5 years for this, the third straight year.\n  But as we expand the envelope for what is possible in the world of \nhealth care, we must also ensure that more Americans have access to the \nmost basic level of primary care services, including regular checkups, \nimmunizations, and prenatal care. If we are not reaching some \nAmericans, it doesn't matter how much we put into health care research. \nIt doesn't matter how many innovations we come up with. It doesn't \nmatter how many new drugs or new procedures or new techniques we \ndevelop. If they don't have access to the basic health care system, it \nis not going to help them at all.\n  That is why I believe it is so important to set the same noble goal \nwe have set for research, doubling funding over 5 years, and adopt it \nfor community health centers as well. There is widespread bipartisan \nsupport for both this 5-year plan as well as for the first-year \ninstallment. Nineteen of my Senate colleagues cosponsored what I called \nthe REACH initiative--a resolution calling on Congress to double health \ncenter funding over 5 years.\n  This resolution has since been made part of the congressional budget \nresolution that establishes our tax and\n\n[[Page S5717]]\n\nspending goals and priorities. Sixty-seven Senators joined in my \ninitial request for the 1-year funding increase of $150 million. This \namendment, which makes this 1-year increase a reality, has 57 \ncosponsors.\n  I am pleased to say that Gov. George W. Bush has publicly announced \nhis support for funding increases for community health centers \ncomparable to what this amendment would provide.\n  I thank my colleagues who have joined in these efforts for their \nsupport. I urge all of my Senate colleagues to support this amendment. \nA dramatic increase in community health center funding is one of the \nfirst and most important things Congress can do this year to truly help \nthe uninsured and medically underserved Americans. Let us not waste the \nopportunity to make it happen.\n  I express my thanks to the chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I compliment our distinguished colleague \nfrom Missouri for offering this amendment and for his steadfast support \nover the years. I compliment my distinguished colleague, Senator Bond, \nfor his continued support for community health centers. This has been a \nmatter he has taken a special interest in and he has organized enormous \nsupport, with a letter having 67 signatories, 58 cosponsors, and \nreflecting a very broad consensus as to the importance of this program.\n  The program would add in the current fiscal year $1.187 billion for \ncommunity health centers. The Appropriations Committee has increased \nfunding by $100 million over fiscal year 2000. Senator Bond now wants \nan additional $50 million, with an offset from administrative expenses \npro rata among the three Departments.\n  We are prepared to accept Senator Bond's amendment. This is always a \nmatter of finding enough money and adjusting the priorities. There is \nno one among the 100 Senators who knows that better than Senator Bond, \nbecause he chairs the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and \nIndependent Agencies. I think his subcommittee and this subcommittee \nhave the toughest job in funding matters. But we agree there ought to \nbe more money in community health centers to serve people in both rural \nand urban areas who are disadvantaged and do not have access to primary \nhealth care.\n  There is nothing more important than health, so we are going to \naccept the amendment. When we come to conference, we may have to modify \nthe offset as to the administrative cost, but we will do our very best \nto maintain the funding in this important item.\n  One other comment. I commented yesterday that the President had \nissued a veto threat after the subcommittee reported out a bill, and \nSenator Harkin had some words for the President, which I thought came \nbetter from the ranking member in the same party as the President. I \nmade the point yesterday--and I think it is worth repeating today--\nabout the priorities established by Members of Congress. We have \ncontacts that the President does not have. There are 535 of us who fan \nout across America. Most of the Senators have fanned out already today, \ngoing back to their States to assess local needs.\n  The Constitution gives the Senate the authority for appropriations. \nBills have to be signed by the President. But what Senator Bond has \ndone is a good illustration of getting a broad consensus. That makes an \nimpact upon the subcommittee when we look at our priorities. If 67 \nSenators sign a letter and 58 sign on as cosponsors, you wonder what \nhappened to the other 9 in the interim. That is a very strong showing, \nand we intend to make that point when we do our best to honor the full \n$150 million increase and as we move down to have an assessment of our \npriorities versus the President's priorities.\n  Speaking for the majority, we are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend from \nPennsylvania, the chairman of the committee. If he really wants us to \nget the rest of the 67, we will be happy to go about it. But I found \nthe chairman and the ranking member so responsive to my persuasive \narguments that I didn't think they needed any more weight on this. I \nsincerely appreciate the willingness of the chairman to accept this.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nincreased funding for Community Health Centers. These health centers \noffer much-needed primary and preventative health care services to \nhundreds of medically underserved urban and rural communities across \nour country.\n  Currently, the Labor, Health and Education Appropriations bill before \nus would provide $100 million in Budget Year 2001 for these health \ncenters. The amendment I have cosponsored with Senator Bond and Senator \nHollings would provide an additional $50 million, bringing the total \ninvestment to $150 million. This amendment, Mr. President, is very \nimportant. It deserves the Senate's support. There are millions of \nAmericans who rely on Community Health Centers for their health care \nneeds. We have an obligation to ensure that those necessary services \nare not interrupted due to a lack of sufficient federal funds.\n  The value of the services provided by these health centers becomes \nquite apparent when you consider that right now there are at least 44 \nmillion uninsured people in our nation; and of those 44 million people, \nMr. President, 4 million of them receive health services from Community \nHealth Centers. When you combine the uninsured with the under-insured, \nthat total rises to 10 million--yes, Mr. President--10 million patients \nwho look to these centers for health care.\n  In my own home state of Ohio, the Third Street Community Clinic in \nMansfield and the Neighborhood Family Practice in Cleveland, for \nexample, are just two of the 69 Community Health Centers that serve \nmore than 200,000 Ohioans each year. In just the first three months of \nthis year, Ohio's Community Health Centers medically treated more than \n29,000 uninsured people, of whom more than 31 percent--nearly one-\nthird--were children under 18 years of age.\n  These health centers provide critical health services to those who \nwould otherwise not have access to health care providers. The centers \noffer prenatal care to uninsured or under-insured pregnant moms, and by \ndoing so, are working to prevent undue adverse risks to the health of \nunborn babies. The health centers also provide immunizations so that \nyoung children can continue to be healthy, even those that live in \nmedically underserved urban or rural areas.\n  And, in practical terms, by providing these and other types of \nprimary and preventive care, Community Health Centers save Medicare and \nMedicaid dollars, because these services significantly reduce the need \nfor hospital stays and emergency room visits.\n  The value of Community Health Centers should not be underestimated--\nnor should they be underfunded. The challenge we face today is that we \nhave to make sure funding keeps pace with the growing numbers of \nAmericans who will be in need of the health care services provided by \nthese centers. To keep pace with this rapid growth, the overall budget \nfor Community Health Centers will need to increase from $1 billion to \n$2 billion by Fiscal Year 2005. This $1 billion increase would enable \nthe health centers to provide care to an additional six to ten million \npeople.\n  Because of the pressing need to increase funding, I am also a \ncosponsor of Senator Bond's REACH Initiative, which is the ``Resolution \nto Expand Access to Community Health Care.'' This important Initiative \nwould double the federal contribution for Community Health Centers over \nthe next five years. And, the Bond/Hollings amendment to the Labor, \nHealth, and Education Appropriations bill before us now would keep us \non track of meeting this five-year plan by increasing this year's $100 \nmillion allocation to $150 million.\n  I commend my colleagues from Missouri and South Carolina for their \namendment and for their tireless commitment to Community Health \nCenters. I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this important \namendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, It has been over 30 years since I set \noff on my hunger tour of South Carolina, where I observed first-hand \nthe shocking condition of health care and nutritional habits in rural \nparts of my state. The good news is, we have come a long way since \nthen. The bad news is, there is still much work to be done. Like the \n``hunger myopia'' I described in my book\n\n[[Page S5718]]\n\nThe Case Against Hunger, we suffer today from a sort of ``health care \nmyopia'', a condition in which a booming economy and low unemployment \nrates mask a reality--that many Americans eke out a living in society's \nmargins, and most of them lack health insurance. Ironically, as the \nstock market soars, so do the numbers of uninsured in our country, at a \nrate of more than 100,000 each month; 53 million Americans are expected \nto be uninsured by 2007.\n  The health care debate swirls around us, reaching fever pitch in \nCongress, where I have faith that we will soon reach an agreement on \nexpanding coverage and other important issues. However, I see a need to \nimmediately address the health care concerns of these left-behind and \nsometimes forgotten citizens. They cannot and should not have to wait \nfor Congress to hammer out health care reform in order to receive the \nmedical care so many of us take for granted. That's why I am \nsponsoring, along with Senator Bond, this amendment to provide an \nadditional $50 million for health centers in this bill. Fifty-seven \ncosponsors have joined us in working toward our objective. I would like \nto thank subcommittee chairman Sen. Specter and ranking member Sen. \nHarkin for their advocacy on behalf of community health centers. I look \nforward to working with them as the bill moves to conference so that we \nmay ensure health centers across the nation receive the support they \ndeserve.\n  While ideas about health care have changed dramatically, community \nhealth centers have remained steadfast in their mission, quietly \nserving their communities and doing a tremendous job. Last year, \ncommunity health centers served 11 million Americans in decrepit inner-\ncity neighborhoods as well as remote rural areas, 4.5 million of which \nwere uninsured. It's no wonder these centers have won across-the-board, \nbipartisan support. They have a proven track record of providing no-\nnonsense, preventive and primary medical services at rock-bottom costs. \nThey're the value retailers of the health care industry, if you will, \ntreating a patient at a cost of less than $1.00 per day, or about $350 \nannually.\n  Let me emphasize that this measure is a cost-saving investment, not \nan increase in spending. Not only are these centers providing care at \nlow costs, but they are saving precious health care dollars. An \nincreased investment in health centers will mean fewer uninsured \npatients are forced to make costly emergency room visits to receive \nbasic care and fewer will utilize hospitals' specialty and inpatient \ncare resources. As a consequence, a major financial burden is lifted \nfrom traditional hospitals and government and private health plans. \nEvery federal grant dollar invested in health centers saves $7 for \nMedicare, Medicaid and private insurance: $6 from lower use of \nspecialty and inpatient care and $1 from reduced emergency room visits.\n  The value of community health centers can be measured in two other \nsignificant ways. First of all, the centers' focus on wellness and \nprevention, services largely unavailable to uninsured people, will lead \nto savings in treatment down the road. And secondly, health centers \nfoster growth and development in their communities, shoring up the very \npeople they serve. They generate over $14 billion in annual economic \nactivity in some of the nation's most economically-depressed areas, \nemploying 50,000 people and training thousands of health professionals \nand volunteers.\n  It should also be noted that community health centers are just that--\ncommunity-based. They are not cookie cutter programs spun from the \nfederal government wheel, but area-specific, locally-managed centers \ntailored to the unique needs of a community. They are governed by \nconsumer boards composed of patients who utilize the center's services, \nas well as local business, civic and community leaders. In fact, it is \nstipulated that center clients make up at least 51% of board \nmembership. This set-up not only ensures accountability to the local \ncommunity and taxpayers, but keeps a constant check on each center's \neffectiveness in addressing community needs.\n  In South Carolina, community health centers have a long history of \nmeeting the care requirements of the areas they serve. The Beaufort-\nJasper Comprehensive Health Center in Ridgeland, the Franklin C. Fetter \nFamily Health Center in Charleston, and Family Health Centers, Inc. in \nOrangeburg were among the first community health centers established in \nthe nation. The Beaufort-Jasper Center was very innovative for its day, \nin the late 1960s, tackling not only health care needs, but related \nneeds for clean water, indoor toilets and other sanitary services. \nToday, the number of South Carolina health centers has grown to 15. \nThey currently provide more than 167,000 people, 38% of which are \nuninsured, with a wide range of primary care services. Yet despite the \nsuccess story, a need to throw a wider net is obvious. Of the 3.8 \nmillion South Carolinians, nearly 600,000 have no form of health \ninsurance. That means roughly 15% of the state population is uninsured. \nAnother 600,000 residents are ``underinsured,'' meaning that they do \nnot receive comprehensive health care coverage from their insurance \nplans and must pay out-of-pocket for a number of specialty services, \nprocedures, tests and medications.\n  South Carolina's statistics are mirrored nationwide. The swelling \nranks of the uninsured are outgrowing our present network of community \nhealth centers. Adopting this amendment will ensure the reach of \ncommunity health centers expands to meet increasing demand. It is our \nresponsibility to continue providing our neediest citizens with a basic \nhealth care safety net. What better way to do that than by building on \na program with a record of positive, fiscally responsible results? \nEveryone can benefit and take pride in such a worthwhile investment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be a sponsor of this \nimportant amendment to increase funding for community health centers. \nEach year, these centers provide quality health care to 11 million \nAmericans in 3,000 rural and inner-city communities in all 50 states, \nincluding 4.5 million people who are uninsured. As the number of \nuninsured Americans across the country continues to grow, the need for \nthe services is especially great.\n  Community health centers recently touched Juan Ramon Centeno's life \nin Worcester, Massachusetts. Mr. Centeno was 54 years old when a \nbilingual nurse working with Great Brook Valley Health Center arrived \nat the public housing project where he lived to conduct health \nscreenings. Mr. Centeno felt ill, but because he did not have insurance \nor resources for medical care, he had not sought care. The nurse found \nthat his blood pressure was high, he had risk factors for diabetes, and \nhad not received preventive health care for many years.\n  Health center physicians promptly examined Mr. Centeno and found him \nat high risk for a cardiovascular accident. This timely intervention \nenabled Mr. Centeno to receive good health care and to be placed on \nmedication through the health center pharmacy, which enables patients \nto obtain prescription drugs at the reduced prices available under \nMedicaid.\n  Day in and day out, community health centers are providing life-\nsaving services like these. Yet too often, the centers are struggling \nto obtain the resources they need. In Massachusetts, over a dozen \ncommunity health centers currently face severe financial difficulties. \nCongress cut Medicare reimbursement rates for the centers in 1997, in \nspite of the fact that the number of people eligible for their services \ncontinues to rise. The result for many health centers has been \nbankruptcy, low morale among the health care professionals who are \ndedicated to serving the poor, and great concern in the communities \nthat this needed access to health care will be lost. It is unacceptable \nfor Congress to permit health centers that have proved so effective for \nso many years to suffer such severe financial difficulties, \nparticularly in this time of prosperity.\n  The Senate made a wise commitment to double the funding over the next \nfive years for medical research at the National Institutes of Health, \nand it has kept that commitment. By making a similar commitment to \ndouble the funding for community health centers--ten percent of the \ncost of the commitment we made to medical research--we can ensure that \nthe benefits of modern medicine will remain available to millions of \nlow-income working families. The Senate is at its best when it approves \namendments like this one\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\non a bipartisan basis. I intend to do all I can to see that this year's \nfinal appropriations bill, and future appropriations bills, maintain \nour commitment to the extraordinary work of the nation's community \nhealth centers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this side has no objection to the \namendment. In fact, we wholeheartedly support the amendment. I \ncompliment the Senator from Missouri for his leadership, and I also \ncompliment Senator Hollings on this issue.\n  Community health centers are really the last sort of backstop for so \nmany people in this country who don't have health insurance--44 million \npeople in America don't have health insurance. Mainly, these are the \nones who, right now, for their health needs really need the community \nhealth centers. We have about seven in our State of Iowa. We are \nopening another one this summer. About 66,000 people are served per \nyear in the State of Iowa by our community health centers.\n  The really good thing--and the Senator from Missouri knows it--about \ncommunity health centers is they are engaged in preventive health care, \nkeeping people healthy in the first place, not just coming in when they \nare sick. They do a lot of outreach work with low-income people. They \nhelp with their diets, lifestyles, and with the medicines they need to \nkeep them healthy. That is one of the great services they provide.\n  We increased the funding for community health centers over last year \nby $100 million. This would add another $50 million on to it. The need \nis actually even more than that, but as the Senator from Missouri \nknows, we have all these things we need to balance in the bill. This is \na welcome addition to our community health centers.\n  Again, I compliment the Senator from Missouri for his leadership. We \nhappily accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3602) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will soon suggest the absence of a \nquorum. I want Senators to know that we are open for business and for \ntaking amendments. Senator Specter and I are willing to sit here and \ntake amendments this morning. If Senators have amendments and they are \naround, please come. As you can see, the floor is wide open. You won't \nhave a waiting line and you can speak for as long as you want. This is \nthe time to come and offer amendments on this bill.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CHAFEE. Mr. President, as many of you know, I joined Senators \nGraham, Robb, Bryan, and others in introducing S. 2758, the Medicare \nOutpatient Drug Act of 2000 this past Tuesday.\n  While I strongly support S. 2758 and urge my colleagues to support \nit, I was very troubled by the process in this Chamber last night. We \ntalk a good game about wanting to pass legislation on a bipartisan \nbasis. In fact, at a Centrist Coalition meeting earlier this week, many \nSenators from both sides of the aisle--led by the minority leader--were \ntalking about how the two parties should be working together to produce \na prescription drug bill for our Nation's seniors.\n  However, the prescription drug amendment that we debated and voted on \nlast night proved otherwise. It suggested that all the talk about \nbipartisanship is merely a facade. It was clear from the procedural \nwrangling that led to the vote on the Robb amendment that there is no \nintention by the Democratic leadership to work together to fashion a \nbipartisan compromise on a Medicare prescription drug bill.\n  In fact, it is my understanding that minority leader told others not \nto let me--one of the author's of this bill--know about this motion \nahead of time. That doesn't sound very bipartisan to me.\n  Sadly, the amendment last night really undermines our ability to work \ntoward a compromise to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. If \nwe were really interested in producing a bipartisan bill that could be \nsigned into law, we would be working together on a proposal rather than \nfiling motions such as the one last night, which was destined to go \ndown to partisan defeat.\n  I had high hopes when I stood with Senators Graham, Robb, Bryan, and \nothers on Tuesday and we announced the introduction of our Medicare \nOutpatient Drug Act. I had hopes that we would be able to work this \nbill through the legislative process, give this bill an airing at the \nFinance Committee, and work with Republicans and Democrats alike to \nfine-tune it into a product that the President could sign into law.\n  I think most of us here would agree it is time to update the Medicare \nprogram to include a prescription drug benefit. I hear about this issue \nback in Rhode Island more than any other issue. The senior population \nin Rhode Island is the second largest in the Nation--second only to \nFlorida. The seniors in my State constantly approach me about the high \ncost of their prescription drug bills. I expect most of us hear more \nabout this issue from our constituents than any other.\n  However, filing procedural motions that are doomed to failure is not \nthe way to achieve this important goal. I am afraid that some on the \nopposite side of the aisle aren't really interested in passing a \nMedicare prescription drug bill this year--they would rather that we do \nnothing and use this issue to try to defeat some of us in the fall.\n  Let's not hold the 39 million Medicare recipients in this country \nhostage to partisan politics.\n  I believe the legislation I introduced with Senators Graham, Robb, \nBryan, and others is one of the most responsible and comprehensive drug \nbills in Congress. And, more important, it would help relieve seniors \nof the growing burden of high prescription drug bills.\n  However, while I support this legislation and regretfully voted in \nsupport of the Robb amendment last night because I am committed to \npassing a good prescription drug bill to help our Nation's seniors, I \ndo not believe the exercise last night was constructive. Sadly, it was \nquite the opposite.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5719-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5719-S5721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH, AND HUMAN SERVICES AND RELATED \n                AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS, 2001--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to be offering an amendment to \nthe pending appropriations bill that I want to talk about this morning.\n  I commend the chairman, Senator Specter, and the ranking member, \nSenator Harkin, for their work to increase funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health. As all of us know, Congress is on track toward \ndoubling the funding for important health research and investigation \nthrough the NIH. That is critically important to this country.\n  I am one of those who has been supportive of doubling the funding for \nthe National Institutes of Health. The NIH is trying to unlock the \nmystery of many of the diseases that ravage the\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\nbodies of people who are suffering from Parkinson's disease, cancer, \nheart disease, and so many other diseases that afflict the American \npeople and people around the globe. The type of research that is taking \nplace at the National Institutes of Health is exciting and vibrant and \npaying big dividends.\n  I thought I would mention, as I start, something I saw one day at the \nNIH called the healing garden. This was an exhibit out at the NIH \ncampus where they had a series of plants growing in this aquarium-like \ndevice called the healing garden. I asked the folks at NIH for an \nexplanation, and they told me about it.\n  They said a lot of people think modern medicines, especially the \nmedicines that are developed through research at NIH to respond to the \nchallenges of treating diseases, come from chemicals. But they told me \nthat a lot of medicines come from natural substances we find all over \nthe Earth. They were displaying some of those substances in this \nhealing garden.\n  I want to describe a couple of the things they were displaying \nbecause it is interesting. NIH is gathering from around the world \n50,000 to 60,000 different species of plants, shrubs, and trees and \ntesting and evaluating what kind of properties they have to heal and \ntreat diseases.\n  The common aspirin comes from the bark of a willow tree. The Chinese \nknew that a couple of thousand years ago. If they had a headache, they \nwould chew the bark of a willow tree. In modern medicine, aspirin is a \nchemical modification of that active ingredient derived from willow \ntree bark. Now aspirin is produced chemically, but the bark of the \nwillow tree was the derivative.\n  The java devil pepper was in the healing garden. Drugs used to treat \nhypertension, or high blood pressure, which were used formerly as a \ntranquilizer, come from the java devil pepper. Who would have guessed \nthis connection if not for the research by the scientists who \ndiscovered it?\n  Agents that fight tumors, leukemias or lymphomas, come from the plant \ncalled the mayapple.\n  The rose periwinkle produces drugs used as anticancer agents \nprimarily in treating Hodgkin's disease and a variety of lymphomas and \nleukemias.\n  Foxglove is used in the medications digitalis and digitoxin, which \nare used to treat congestive heart failure and other cardiac disorders.\n  Of course, we all know about aloe, an active ingredient, of course, \nin skin care preparations.\n  It is interesting that, as funding has increased for studying plants \nand animals, scientists at the NIH are finding quite remarkable things. \nDeep in the Amazon rain forest lives a frog that has a deadly toxin on \nits skin. They believe that from studying the toxin of that frog, they \ncan create a painkiller that is 200 times more powerful than morphine \nand not addictive. Think of that: 200 times more powerful than morphine \nand not addictive.\n  There is another frog which is very rare that has a toxin on its skin \nthat is so deadly that a drop of it on the skin of a human being causes \nthe heart to stop.\n  The scientists asked the question: If there is something this \npowerful that it causes a human heart to stop, can we unleash the power \nof that toxin to do something positive?\n  That is the kind of evaluation and study that is occurring at the NIH \nroutinely.\n  As we double the funding for the National Institutes of Health, there \nare all of these wonderful scientists and researchers doing this \nmassive amount of research--research to decode the human genome, \nresearch to grow new heart valves around parts of the heart muscle that \nare clogged, deep brain research to uncover the secrets of Parkinson's \ndisease.\n  As all of this research occurs through the doubling of funding at \nNIH, we should say thanks to Senator Harkin and Senator Specter for \ntheir leadership and commitment over several years to move this \nCongress to invest in these efforts that are so important to this \ncountry's future.\n  Now, let me go from that compliment to talking about how this \nresearch is dispersed across this country. There is a trend for how \nthis research funding is allocated throughout the country that is very \nsimilar to what happens in other areas of the federal Government's \nresearch budget. The research that comes through the billions and \nbillions of dollars that we spend--nearly $20 billion proposed for \nfiscal year 2001 at the NIH alone --has historically been clustered in \na few areas of the country. In most cases, big universities get big \ngrants that make them bigger, and from around those universities, you \nsee the development of businesses springing up from that research. You \nwill see the result of NIH research in a few areas of the country \nproducing very significant opportunities. Then you will see other \nsignificant parts of America with almost no research base through the \nNIH.\n  Should research be done where it is done best? Yes, of course. But \nthe largest universities in this country, in a handful of States, get \nmost of the research dollars in part because the grants are peer \nreviewed by people from the same institutions that get the grants in \nthe first place. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n  The chart I have here shows the way NIH funding is currently \ndistribution across the country. If you look at the States in this \ncountry shown in the white shaded areas--mostly in the middle of the \ncountry--you will see that these States get very little funding for \nmedical research.\n  The States shown in the blue and red areas--California, Texas, New \nYork, Massachusetts, and so on--are the States that get most of the \nresearch grants.\n  This pie graph here shows what happens as a result of this imbalance. \nAs you can see, three States get 35 percent of all of the medical \nresearch funds provided by the NIH. Institutions in three States get \nover a third of all the Federal dollars on medical research. In fact, \none state alone received 15 percent of total NIH funds.\n  This little white slice shown on the chart represents 21 States that \nshare only 3 percent of the research.\n  Why does that matter? If you live in one of these States, and you \nhave Parkinson's disease, or you have breast cancer, or you have any \none of a number of very serious health problems, and you want to \nparticipate in the cutting-edge medical research conducted by the NIH \nthrough one of its grantees, you may well have to travel hundreds and \nhundreds or perhaps thousands of miles to avail yourself of the \nclinical trials.\n  Second, there are wonderful institutions in the middle part of \nAmerica that have the capability to provide unique and beneficial \nresearch on a range of issues ranging from cancer, to heart disease, to \ndiabetes, and more through the funds we are providing at NIH. But they \ndo not get the opportunity because the system is stacked against them.\n  At the NIH, we have a program called IDeA, or the Institutional \nDevelopment Award program, that is intended to rectify this \ngeographical inequity by helping historically under funded states to \nbuild their medical research capacity. IDeA is very similar to the \nEPSCoR program that exists in other federal agencies.\n  This program is under funded at NIH. The IDeA program is funded at \nthe level of $100 million in the House-passed bill, which I think is \ntoo low. But it is funded at only $60 million here. That is an increase \nfrom $40 million to $60 million, and for that, I appreciate the efforts \nof Senators Specter and. But we ought to at least meet the House level. \nAnd we ought to do even more.\n  My amendment will take our proposed funding to the level of $100 \nmillion in the House bill. Through this amendment, we will simply say \nthat we want to encourage the distribution of research across this \ncountry to all of the centers of genius--no matter where they are--that \nexist.\n  In States such as North Dakota, Iowa, South Dakota, and up and down \nthe farm belt, we are losing a lot of population. This map shows that. \nAll these red blotches on this map indicate counties that have lost \nmore than 10 percent of their population.\n  What you see is that the middle part of our country is being \nsystematically depopulated. Why has that happened? Why, when you have \nso many people living on top of each other in apartment buildings in \nbig cities and fighting through traffic jams just to get to and from \nwork each day, is the middle part of our country being depopulated?\n\n[[Page S5721]]\n\n  At least part of the answer to that question relates back to what we \ndo at the Federal level. We say that $20 billion will be made available \nthrough the National Institutes of Health to form centers of excellence \nfor scientific research in medicine. We move that money to specific \nareas of the country where there is already a significant population, \nand from that springs economic opportunity and biotechnology companies \nand new jobs. We simply exacerbate all of these problems with the way \nwe spend our money at the Federal Government.\n  There are centers of genius in the middle part of this country, in \nMinnesota and North Dakota and South Dakota and Kansas and Oklahoma. \nThere are small centers of excellence that could do wonderful \nscientific research, but they do not get the funding. Why? Because the \nbiggest States get all the money. Three States get a third of all the \nmoney through the NIH.\n  I am not suggesting that anything illegal is going on. It is just \nthat we have a system that perpetuates itself and creates a \ncircumstance where three States get fully one-third of the billions of \ndollars we provide for medical research and 21 other States are left to \nshare 3 percent of the medical research. And that predicts and \npredetermines where the centers of excellence will be in the future.\n  It also, in my judgment, is unfair to all of those folks who live so \nfar away from the biggest centers, where most of the money is moving \nto, because it is not going to be very easy for them to be involved in \nclinical trials for such things as their breast cancer, their lymphoma. \nThey are going to have difficulty getting cutting-edge medical \ntherapies.\n  That ought not be the case. I want to change that. I am hoping, with \nthe cooperation of Senator Specter and Senator Harkin, and with a new \ndetermination in the House and the Senate, that we can come to an \nunderstanding that, as we double the funding for the NIH, we can also \ndo much better for this program at NIH called IDeA. Again, this program \nlets us reach out and find ways to use NIH funding all across this \ncountry, to get the best of what everyone in this country has to offer, \nto find all the centers of excellence that exist everywhere, and have \nthem come to bear on research and inquiry. I am convinced that this \nrepresents our best chance to try to find ways to cure some of these \ndiseases that ravage people who live in this country and the rest of \nthe world.\n  We are making a lot of progress. With this amendment, I do not mean \nin any way to suggest we are not making great strides. Doubling the NIH \nbudget is a terrific thing to do. It will produce enormous rewards for \nall who live in this country and those who will come after us. But it \nis also the case that we must do better in the distribution of this \nresearch money if we are going to be able to have access to all the \nbest minds this country has to offer. That is the purpose of my \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota is a meritorious amendment on \ninstitutional development within the National Institutes of Health. We \nhave a figure of $60 million there as part of $2.7 billion.\n  The subcommittee and the full committee have been very--aggressive, \nis the right word--to increase NIH funding. We did it at $2.7 billion \nin this bill. We had $2.2 billion last year, $2 billion the year \nbefore, a billion before that. I agree totally with the thrust of what \nthe Senator wants to accomplish.\n  When we sit down with the House in conference, there is always a lot \nof give-and-take with a bill that is at $104.5 billion. It would be my \nintention to do what we can to reach the figure of $100 million, which \nis what the Senator wants, because I think that is the right figure. \nWhat I suggest is that the Senator give Senator Harkin and me and the \nother conferees the flexibility to negotiate. There is a lot of give-\nand-take.\n  For those watching on C-SPAN, the process is, after we pass our bill, \nwe go to a conference with the House, which has passed a bill. Then we \nsit down with long sheets and go over all the points and try to reach a \ncompromise. To have that flexibility would be helpful. I know there are \na number of programs the Senator from North Dakota would like to stay \nat the Senate figure, as opposed to the House figure which may be \nlower. If we could reach that accommodation, I believe we would obtain \nthe objectives which the Senator from North Dakota wants, to give the \nconferees that flexibility to assert the Senate position on other \nmatters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is alluding \nto the analogy of the legislative process being akin to the making of \nsausage. Often, neither are a pretty process, so it is better, perhaps, \nto speak less of it. I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania that I am \nmore concerned about the destination than I am about the route by which \nwe get there.\n  He has indicated that he supports the $100 million level in the House \nbill for the IDeA program. Senator Harkin has indicated the same. For \nthat reason, I will not proceed with my amendment, with the \nunderstanding that their intention will be to reach that level in \nconference.\n  My sense is that we are making a lot of progress. Before the Senator \nwas in the Chamber a few moments ago, I said he and Senator Harkin will \nhave the undying gratitude of the American people for their persistence \nand relentless work to increase funding at NIH. This is very important, \nnot just for people who live here now but for generations to come.\n  My concern, as we do that, is to make sure we get the full genius of \nall the American people working on these scientific inquiries into \ntreating and curing these ravaging diseases. I want more funding in the \nIDeA program so that smaller States have the opportunity to access \nthese grants and we can put to work their scientists and their medical \nschools and their communities to meet our nation's medical research \ngoals.\n  I appreciate my colleague's response.\n  I will not ask for a vote on my amendment. What I will do is ask that \nwe handle it in conference, as the Senator has suggested.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis comments about what Senator Harkin and I are trying to do--and, \nreally, it is the whole committee and the full Senate. We will, I \nthink, accomplish what he is looking for--the $100 million--in the \nfinal analysis. I think the old saying that you don't want to see \neither sausage or legislation made may have some merit. I think when we \ndeal with our national health, we are dealing with ``prime rib.'' We \nwill make some tasty morsels here for the benefit of America, I think.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator in the Chamber, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5721-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5721-S5722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NO APOLOGY NECESSARY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier this morning a Member of the \nSenate described the circumstances on the floor of the Senate yesterday \nwith respect to a vote on the issue of a prescription drug benefit for \nMedicare. Yes, there was a vote on that issue. I want to describe why \nthat motion was offered and the importance of it.\n  I also want to say that, while I certainly have the greatest respect \nfor my colleague, this was not a circumstance where the minority leader \nor anyone else intended to surprise anybody. When the minority leader \nor any other\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\nSenator is pursuing an agenda he believes is important for our country, \nhe does not go desk to desk in the Chamber asking permission from \nanyone else to offer an amendment. That is not the way the Senate \nworks, of course.\n  The minority leader believes very strongly, as does almost every \nsingle member of this caucus, and perhaps some others in the Senate, \nthat we need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nprogram. Life-saving miracle drugs can only perform miracles for those \nwho can afford them. Senior citizens all too often are choosing between \ngroceries and the prescription drugs they need. If we were to create \nthe Medicare program today, unquestionably we would have a prescription \ndrug benefit in that plan.\n  We have been very relentless in saying we believe we must add a \nprescription drug benefit to the Medicare program and we should do it \nin this Congress. We cannot and will not apologize for being relentless \nin that pursuit. We have had very few opportunities on the floor of \nthis Senate to pursue our agenda. Yesterday was one of them.\n  If, at the end of the day, we get a bipartisan agreement to add a \nprescription drug benefit to the Medicare program, then we will be \nrewarded for our success by the senior citizens in this country who \nwill be able to have access to the prescription drugs they need. If, at \nthe end of the day, we do that, I guarantee that it will only be \nbecause, for the last couple of years, we have been relentless on the \nfloor of the Senate and in the House, saying this Congress must do \nthis.\n  We have had others who say, yes, we agree about the need for a \nprescription drug benefit, but we want to have the private insurance \ncompanies write a plan, and so on and so forth. The fact is that the \nprivate insurance companies have said publicly, and they have come to \nmy office and said repeatedly, ``We will not write a plan; we cannot \nwrite a plan.'' It is not within the range of financial possibilities \nfor us to do what the majority party is proposing. In fact, one company \nofficial said, ``We will write a plan that has $1,000 in benefits, and \nwe would have to charge $1,200 in premiums for the plan to cover the \nadministrative and other costs of the benefit.'' That is the same as \nhaving no plan, the same as doing nothing in terms of adding \nprescription drug coverage to Medicare.\n  Our goal is to find a way to solve this problem in this Congress. \nThis Congress, with all due respect, on some of the big issues, has \nbeen a Congress of underachievers. We can do a lot better than this. We \ncan add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. We can pass a campaign \nfinance reform bill. We can pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. We can \npass an education bill that reduces class size and helps rebuild and \nrenovate some of our nation's dilapidated schools. We can do these \nthings if we put our minds to it. But somehow there is this notion by \nat least those who control the agenda that what we need to do is tuck \nin our wings and get out of town and do as little as possible.\n\n  I don't want to belong to a Congress of underachievers. I want our \nCongress to do the things we ought to be doing together. Yes, a \nprescription drugs benefit in Medicare is one of those items. We cannot \napologize for what we did yesterday. We must, at every opportunity, \ncontinue to push and coax and pull those in the Chamber who don't \nreally want to do this to join us and fix what is wrong with respect to \nthis Medicare program.\n  What is wrong, in part, is that it doesn't have coverage for \nprescription drugs, and there are a lot of senior citizens who are \nprescribed medications that will allow them to live longer and \nhealthier lives, and they discover they can't afford them.\n  A woman in Dickinson, ND, who had breast cancer was told by her \ndoctor that in order to reduce the chances of a recurrence of her \nbreast cancer, she must take this prescription medicine. This woman, \nwho was on Medicare and had a small fixed income, said, ``Doctor, there \nisn't any way I can afford that medicine. There is no way. I am just \ngoing to have to take my chances.'' This situation faces too many \nsenior citizens who need prescription medicine and find that they \ncannot afford it. That is why we must put a prescription drug benefit \nin the Medicare program.\n  Let's do something at the same time that puts some downward pressure \non drug prices. Prices have risen too fast and too far on prescription \ndrugs.\n  I just want to say that no one crossed any lines by not going to \nevery desk in the Chamber about that motion yesterday. We are going to \nkeep trying until we get enough votes in the Senate to add a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare plan. It is for a good \nreason. This country needs that sort of policy in place right now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as in morning \nbusiness for a time not to exceed 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today \nto offer my congratulations and thanks to my Chief of Staff, David \nKline Garman, who has dedicated his entire life to public service. \nToday, in fact, marks the 20th anniversary of David's service in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  David's public service career began even before he came to the \nSenate. While attending Duke University in the 1970s, he participated \nin Naval ROTC and during the summer of 1976 he served with the naval \namphibious task force which rescued American Nationals from Beirut \nduring the Civil War in Lebanon.\n  After graduating with Honors from Duke in 1979, he served in the \nPeace Corps working on rural water supply projects in Nepal. He came to \nthe Senate on June 23, 1980 to work as an intern with Senator Richard \nDick'' Stone (D-Florida), beginning in the Senator's mail room and \nworking his way up to assist on defense, finance, banking and energy \nissues.\n  After David attended the Democratic Convention in 1980, he began to \nreconsider his political affiliation and on the day Ronald Reagan was \ninaugurated in 1981, David joined my staff to serve as Legislative Aide \non defense and foreign relations. He was soon promoted to Legislative \nAssistant for energy and natural resources.\n  In addition to his legislative expertise, David is extremely \nknowledgeable in the nuts and bolts of high technology. In the late \n1980s he became Founding Coordinator for the U.S. Senate Microcomputer \nUsers Group. This group was instrumental in changing Senate technology \npolicy so that each office could decide what type of computer system it \nwould utilize. Previously, Senate offices could only use a system \nselected by the Senate Computer Center.\n  David's broad range of intellectual interests led me to select him to \njoin the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence when I \nwas a Member of the Committee. He played a key role in the development \nof ``environmental intelligence'' capabilities in the intelligence \ncommunity and at the national laboratories.\n\n  Some of David's best work occurred when he joined the staff of the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He was responsible for \nenvironmental issues, including the Clean Air Act, Global Climate \nChange Policy, energy R and Arctic Research, Science and Technology \npolicy.\n  While David worked incredibly long hours on highly technical policy \nissues at the Energy Committee, he went to school at night and in 1997 \nearned a Master of Science in Environmental Sciences at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity. That I consider a very noteworthy achievement.\n  Despite his many hours of work and study, David did find the time to \nmeet a beautiful woman, Kira Finkler, and her lovely daughter Bonnie. \nKira, who works on the Minority staff of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee did not allow energy policy differences to stand in \nthe way of their relationsip. They were married in December of 1998.\n  By this time, I had asked David to move from the Energy Committee and \nbecome my Chief of Staff. And as all Senators know, this is about the \nhardest job there is in a Senate office, because it is the Chief of \nStaff who has to get the trains to run on time. David does a superb job \nand I am deeply\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\ngrateful to him for how well he does his job.\n  I encourage his friends to join me in celebrating and recognizing \nthis 20th anniversary.\n  As anyone can tell, David is a highly versatile and intelligent \nperson who can handle almost any responsibility given to him. There are \nfew people I know who are as capable as David. In addition to all of \nhis substantive knowledge, David is a superb, outstanding speech \nwriter, although he didn't write this speech. Some of the best speeches \nI have given were written by David.\n  Mr. President, there is a huge turnover of the staff on Capitol Hill. \nThat reflects the long hours, modest pay and economically rewarding \nopportunities available in Washington's private sector. It is rare to \nfind such an incredibly dedicated public policy servant as David Garman \nand I salute him today for 20 extraordinary years of service in the \nSenate and to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5723-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5723-S5724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GAS PRICES AND GAS TAXES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about a \ntopic that is in the newspapers today and that has been all week; that \nis, the crisis concerning energy and our gasoline price structure \ncurrently prevalent throughout the country.\n  I think it is fair to go back and evaluate what has happened over the \nlast 8 years in the Clinton/Gore administration.\n  I think it is obvious to all that the answer to our energy shortage \nby the Clinton administration is pretty much to put our economic \ndestiny in the hands of the foreign oil price-fixing cartel because \ntheir answer to the shortage has been to increase oil imports and \ndecrease domestic production.\n  The first time we saw this crisis coming was a few months ago. The \nreaction of the administration was to send the Secretary of Energy, \nSecretary Richardson, almost with a tin cup, to beg OPEC to increase \ntheir oil production. That was the answer.\n  The success of that effort is somewhat limited when you recognize \nthat there is more pressure throughout the world to utilize oil. A \nconsequence of that, of course, is the realization that the Asian \neconomy is coming back, which is putting more pressure for oil in that \npart of the world. We found our reserves substantially lower as a \nconsequence of the cold winter and an inadequate supply of heating oil. \nWhile we had this situation developing, it was quite evident what was \ngoing to happen behind the supply and demand curve. The demand was \ngreater than the supply. We were pulling down our reserves faster than \nwe were replacing them.\n  It is kind of interesting to see the ``blame game'' that is going on \nin Washington.\n  The administration is blaming the price increase on the oil \ncompanies, and on the refiners--on anyone but themselves; on anyone \nother than recognizing that the Clinton/Gore administration has not \nreally had an energy policy that has been identifiable.\n  The first graphic explanation is going back to a time a few years ago \nwhen the Vice President came to the Chamber and broke a tie vote to \nestablish a 4.3 cent-per-gallon gas tax. That, I think, can certainly \nbe reflected on as the ``Gore gas tax.''\n  Following that, we saw a series of activities by the administration \nthat hardly would relieve the coming shortage that was evident, even at \nthat time.\n  The administration has taken vast areas of the Rocky Mountain \noverthrust belt off limits to energy exploration. These are areas where \nthere is a high potential for oil and gas discoveries--Colorado, \nWyoming, and Montana. And other States were simply taken off limits. It \nis estimated that 64 percent of those areas have been removed.\n  There are areas in the Continental Shelf that they put off limits to \nenergy exploration.\n  Furthermore, the Vice President, in a statement made in Louisiana, \nstated that if he were elected President, he would pursue a policy of \nno more leases if anyone even attempted to thwart existing leases that \nhave been issued.\n  During that timeframe, the administration vetoed legislation to open \nup the small sliver of the Arctic Coastal Plain where reserves had been \nestimated as high as 16 billion barrels. That is just in my State of \nAlaska. It is estimated that if indeed the potential reserves were \nthere, it would replace our current imports from Saudi Arabia over a \nperiod of 30 years.\n\n  Further, the administration has put domestic energy reserves off \nlimits through a unilateral designation of new national monuments under \nthe Antiquities Act.\n  It is a pretty simple equation. Domestic production is down 17 \npercent, and imports are up 14 percent.\n  We talk about rising gasoline prices in various areas of the country. \nWe have talked about the refineries, and why they can't address this \nand continue with an uninterrupted supply at a relatively low price.\n  What the administration doesn't tell you is the reality--that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, through mandates, has caused a \nsignificant increase associated with the mandate for reformulated \ngasoline.\n  Who pays the price associated for this reformulated gasoline?\n  Why is it so high?\n  It is kind of interesting. When you go through the State of Illinois \nand the State of Wisconsin, you are made aware that as of June 1 there \nwas a mandate by the Environmental Protection Agency that reformulated \ngasoline containing ethanol replacing MTBE be established. That costs \nroughly 50 cents more a gallon. You cannot use the same gasoline in \nSpringfield, IL, that you would use in Chicago, IL, because of the \npolicies of the EPA.\n  I am not going to debate the merits of the regulation. But I will \ndebate the reality that these regulations cost money because they \nrequire customizing, if you will, of the gasoline and the refining \nprocess.\n  It is kind of interesting to also note that we have lost 36 \nrefineries in this country in the last decade. They haven't built a new \nrefinery in almost 25 years. Why not? Obviously, it is not a very \nattractive business to get into, or the oil companies would be moving \ninto it. They are moving out of them. The reason: It takes decades; in \nsome cases not that long, but several years to get permits. The \npermitting process is legitimate. But if you can't basically get there \nfrom here, you are going to have very little interest in pursuing \nrefineries.\n  I think it is fair to say that the administration's overzealous \npolicies are responsible for closing some 36 regional refineries. The \nfact that no new ones have opened during the 8 years under the Clinton/\nGore administration is a valid, understandable, legitimate reason as to \nwhy we are seeing gasoline prices in regional areas mandated by new \npolicies from EPA prevail. The Vice President can try to shift the \nblame to the oil companies for higher prices, but let's not forget that \nhe personally cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for higher \ngasoline prices.\n\n  To attempt to counteract that, we have a firm policy that is \nintroduced in legislation which is the Republican energy production \nproposal for the year 2000. We recognize what has happened in this \ncountry. Today, the average price of gasoline is $1.68 per gallon. In \nthe Midwest, the average is $1.87. The only way to address this \nresponsibly is through a series of incentives that not only stimulate \ndomestic production by opening up the overthrust belt, by opening up \nareas in the coastal OCS area, opening up areas in the arctic where we \nare likely to find significant discoveries, but have a goal in the \nlegislation. The goal is to reduce dependence upon imports to less than \n50 percent in a 10-year period of time. In the Vice President's book \n``Earth in the Balance,'' on page 73, he identifies ``higher taxes on \nfossil fuels . . . is one of the logical first steps in changing our \npolicy in a manner consistent with a more responsible approach to the \nenvironment''; that is, taxing higher fuels to discourage people from \nusing fuels.\n  He further says it ought to be possible to establish a coordinated \nglobal program to accomplish the strategic goal of completely \neliminating the internal combustion engine over, say, a 25-year period. \nThe implications of that, of the Vice President encouraging high costs \nto address perhaps the elimination of the internal combustion engine, \nor his belief, if indeed it is his belief, that higher taxes on fossil \nfuel is\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\none of the first steps in changing our policies, certainly is \noccurring.\n  However, let's be realistic and recognize in this country our \ntransportation system depends on oil. Don't expect modest OPEC \nincreases to bring prices down at the pump. As we have seen in this \nlast announcement by an increase in OPEC of 700,000 barrels a day, the \nmarket sophistication has already made a judgment. The judgment is that \nprices are going to continue to rise. Right after this announcement, \nwest Texas medium crude rose 72 cents Wednesday on the New York \nMercantile Exchange, up an additional 28 cents by the afternoon, where \ncontracts for August delivery were $31.65 a barrel. Last year at this \ntime, oil was selling for about $12 to $14 a barrel.\n  If there are those who were misled by the assumption that energy was \ngoing to substantially be increased by this OPEC announcement, remember \nthat 700,000 barrels a day does not come to the United States alone. \nOur share of that is 15 percent. That is only 109,000 barrels a day. In \nthe District of Columbia, we consume 121,000 barrels a day, to give a \ncomparison. The last OPEC production increase in March, which was to \nproduce a 1.7 million-barrel increase, may have yielded roughly 500,000 \nbarrels due to cheating on production overquota.\n  As we look to the future, it is amusing to recognize that the \nadministration has now come out with what it referred to as a detailed \nblueprint for congressional action. Mind you, they are asking, now, for \ncongressional action. The President has called on Congress to pass a \nproposal to encourage more stripper well production.\n  First, we don't have a proposal. There is no legislation set up. We \nhave in the Republican package, a proposal to increase stripper well \nproduction. But now the President is saying we need to get some of \nthese American wells back in operation.\n\n  Where has he been? We have been trying to encourage the \nadministration to support legislation that would put in place a foreign \nceiling. They have not proposed any. And now he is saying he has a \nprogram. Where is it, Mr. President? He says we need to get some of \nthese things back in operation.\n  He further states that Congress is not reauthorizing Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. He went into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the \nother day as a consequence of an accident on the Mississippi River to \nkeep refinery production going. He didn't ask us for authority. He has \nthe authority. He knows he has the authority. This is another \nsmokescreen.\n  We look at his concern over the supply in the Northeast corridor this \ncoming winter. What has he done about the supply to increase it? \nAbsolutely nothing. He has no plan, no proposal, no increased \nproduction. The President or the Vice President or his advisers simply \ndo not understand the reality that this is a supply and demand issue. \nUnless we increase the supply, we are going to have shortages. That is \nevident by what we are seeing in the paper. We have $2.33, $2.40, and \n$2.49 a gallon for gasoline in this country. This particular headline \nsuggests that the gas price rise shakes Democrats. The reason it shakes \nthe Democrats, and the reason this is a partisan issue, is because the \nDemocrats and the administration simply have no plan and have not had a \nplan associated with the energy shortage that is occurring in this \ncountry today.\n  As I come to the Senate floor today to address this matter and \nreflect on how we are going to correct it, the simple response is that \nwe are going to have to increase our supplies, and we will have to do \nit dramatically and in a timely manner. If we don't do that, we are \ngoing to continue to see an increase in the price of oil, and an \nincreased dependence on imports. One of the frustrating things about \nthe continued dependence on imports is from where those imports are \ncoming.\n  Last year, we imported about 300,000 barrels of crude oil from Iraq. \nThis year we are importing about 750,000 barrels from Iraq. A lot of \npeople perhaps have forgotten we fought a war over there in 1991 and \n1992. We lost 147 lives. We had roughly 427 wounded, 23 were taken \nprisoner.\n  Today, what we are doing, and this is where I am critical of our \nforeign policy, for all practical purposes, we are buying his oil, \nsending him our dollars, taking his oil, putting it in our airplanes, \nand going over and bombing. What kind of a foreign policy is that? It \nis just about that simple. Not very complex.\n  He is making a press release every time we bomb saying, here is how \nmany people Americans killed in my country. He waves that around and \ngenerates more support. The dollars we are paying go to the Republican \nGuards for his safety and protection. And he is smuggling oil out, in \naddition to that which is under the auspices of the United Nations. \nWhat is he doing with the generation of funds from the smuggling of the \noil? He is building up his arsenal, his capability with missiles, his \ncapability with the biological weaponry. Here is a very bad man out \nthere. And we are supporting his regime because we are becoming more \ndependent on him as a source of oil.\n  What does that do to strengthening stability in the Middle East? It \nis pretty hard to say, but it certainly represents a threat against \nIsrael. It is well known, the disposition of Iraq and Saddam Hussein \nrelative to the threat against Israel and the peace we all hope will \ncome to the Middle East.\n  I could go on at great length. I see other Senators desiring to \ndiscuss various matters. It is my intention as chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee to put together in this next week a \nchronology of certain portions of our negative exposure, if you will. \nOne is on gasoline prices, one is on refinery operations, one is on the \navailability and continued uninterrupted supply of natural gas.\n  The other is the delivery system within our electric power industry \nand our transmission grids. It is appropriate we start preparing \nourselves for a train wreck that is going to come. We are seeing it in \ngasoline prices as a consequence of shortage of crude oil. We are going \nto see it spread, as we see in the northeastern part of the Nation \nwhich is so dependent on oil for the generation of electricity, as the \nsummer warms up.\n  Last year they were paying $10 and $11 a barrel for oil. This year \nthey are going to be paying over $30. The electrical rates in the \nNortheast corridor are going to go up dramatically. They thought they \nhad higher rates for fuel oil last year. They have not seen anything \nyet. We are going to have brownouts this year because the capacity of \nthe transmission lines, for all practical purposes, is just about at \ntheir maximum in certain areas.\n  Why haven't we built more transmission lines? FERC has been sitting \nfor 3 years on a rate case, a rate case that is going to make a \ndetermination of whether or not it is financially beneficial for the \ninvestment in transmission lines in the sense they can recover their \ninvestment.\n  What about natural gas? The electric industry is moving into the area \nmore and more and converting to natural gas, but while the supply of \nnatural gas is abundant, we are now pulling down our reserves. Last \nyear, our reserves were about 160 trillion cubic feet; this year, they \nare about 150. We are using more gas than we are finding. We are using \ncurrently about 20 trillion cubic feet. The estimate is about 30 to 35 \nin the next 10 years. We are not finding a replacement. So we are going \nto have a crunch in natural gas, and natural gas is going to go up.\n  It is estimated the industry is going to have to spend $1.5 trillion \nto put in new infrastructure for delivery into various parts of the \ncountry. From where is the capital going to come? It is only going to \ncome if they get an adequate return on their investment; otherwise, \nthey are not going to build the pipelines.\n  This whole thing is coming to a head. The American people are \nbeginning to wake up a little bit. The administration is beginning to \npoint the blame to industry, to Congress, to the refiners, to anybody \nbut themselves, because this administration has not had an energy \npolicy of any consequence, as evidenced by the President's statement \nthat suddenly he is concerned and suddenly he sends something to \nCongress--if we can identify just what this is he sent up--calling on \nCongress to pass a variety of administrative proposals. They do not say \nwhat the proposals are. He is a little late. It is like somebody \nfiddling while Rome burned.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5725-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5725-S5730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                    APPROPRIATIONS, 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have been asked by the leader to file \na number of amendments as an amendment to the underlying Labor-HHS \nbill. The amendment is the Republican energy security package. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be so filed. I appreciate the willingness of \nthe leader to file the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator has the right to \nfile an amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am here as the ranking member on the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill, which is pending this morning. We had \nhoped Senators would come over and offer amendments. We had a good \namendment earlier by Senator Bond from Missouri. I thought we could \nmove ahead on that, but it looks as though we have diverged to other \nissues.\n  As long as that is the case, I feel constrained also to talk about \nthe problems we have with high gasoline prices in the Midwest.\n  I was listening to my colleague from Alaska speak. Quite frankly, I \ngot to thinking about what is happening in the Midwest and upper \nMidwest with high gasoline prices. It occurred to me there are all \nkinds of rumors going around about why this is happening: There is a \nbroken pipeline; there is a shortage of crude oil; reformulated \ngasoline, with ethanol is the problem--there is all this talk swirling \naround out there, everybody blaming everybody else.\n  No one knows the answers. That is why yesterday I wrote a letter to \nthe chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nasking him to hold emergency public hearings to subpoena the heads of \nthe major oil companies, bring them to Washington and put them under \noath, and then start asking them the tough questions. Then I believe we \nmight get to the bottom of it.\n  I say to the chairman of the Energy Committee, use the powers of \nsubpoena. Bring the heads of the oil companies to Washington. Maybe \nthey do have an answer. Maybe there are logical reasons why the price \nof gasoline is so high. I doubt it, but let them have their say. I say \nput them under oath, just as we did with the tobacco company executives \na few years ago. Let's put them under oath and ask them the tough \nquestions. Let Senators from both sides ask them the questions about \nwhy we have these high and divergent gasoline prices in the upper \nMidwest. Maybe we can get somewhere and find answers.\n  I also asked the head of the Federal Trade Commission to do the same \nthing: subpoena records and subpoena the oil company executives to come \nto Washington in an open, public hearing so that the public can hear \nfor themselves the answers to these questions.\n  I want to talk for a moment about all of the claims and assertions \ngoing around that reformulated gasoline and ethanol are the cause of \nthe increase in prices in the upper Midwest. I just heard the Senator \nfrom Alaska allude to reformulated gasoline being part of the problem. \nIf reformulated gasoline is the problem, then why is it that we have \nreports that of instances where reformulated gasoline, including where \nethanol is used, is actually below the price of conventional gasoline.\n  That has happened in Louisville, KY, and St. Louis, MO, where they \nhave an RFG requirement, according to EPA.\n  EPA has said that RFG with ethanol would not be more than a penny a \ngallon higher than RFG without ethanol. Even that may be high. \nYesterday, in Chicago, the price of conventional gasoline at wholesale \nwas $1.24 a gallon. The price of reformulated gasoline with ethanol was \n$1.24 a gallon. It was the same price at the wholesale level. And said, \nin some markets, we found that reformulated gas is at a lower price \nthan conventional gasoline. That makes sense because ethanol is now \nactually cheaper than gasoline.\n  The Senator from Alaska talked about an energy policy. One of the \nenergy policies of this administration has been to promote the use of \nethanol and renewable fuels. I know the Presiding Officer is a big \nsupporter of ethanol, too. So is this Senator. But every time we try to \npromote ethanol, we are stymied by the oil companies. They have some \nreason why they cannot use ethanol. I will tell my colleagues why they \ndo not want to use ethanol: Because they cannot control it, and if we \ncontinue to produce more ethanol in this country, it is going to \nprovide an alternative to gasoline which will keep the price of \ngasoline down. That is purely and simply why the oil companies do not \nwant ethanol. We have been through this battle going clear back to the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and earlier.\n\n  Years ago, the oil companies put lead in their gasoline. We found out \nlead was causing all kinds of problems, physiological problems in kids \nand adults. So we had to force them to take the lead out. In order to \nkeep the octane up, then they said: We are going to use these aromatic \nand toxic compounds, such as toluene, benzene, and xylene. They put \nthat witch's brew together in the gasoline to keep the octane up.\n  Then we found out many of these compounds were air polluting, toxic, \nand carcinogenic. About that time, around 1990, we passed the Clean Air \nAct. We in the Senate mandated an oxygenate requirement of 3.1 percent \nfor gasoline to clean up the air and to meet clean air standards.\n  That is what the Senate adopted. It went to conference. I thought we \nhad it settled that we were going to have 3.1 percent. The oil \ncompanies weighed in. They got that knocked down to 2.0 percent.\n  We may not have appreciated what they were up to. Two percent oxygen \nis better than nothing so we went with 2 percent. But the oil companies \nhad something called methyl tertiary butyl ether, which they could use \nas an oxygenate and also that would help meet the clean air standards, \nat the 2-percent level. MTBE would not have been so heavily used at the \n3.1 percent level because MTBE has a much lower oxygen content than \nethanol.\n  Ethanol could do it at the 3-percent level but not MTBE. So the oil \ncompanies got back in, knocked it down to 2 percent, and guess what \nhappened. The market was flooded with MTBE, and because the oil \ncompanies have control over it, it has kept the production of ethanol \ndown for the last decade.\n  Then what did we find out? First of all, we had the lead that the oil \ncompanies pushed off on us. Then we had the aromatics and toxics which \nthey pushed off on us. Now we have MTBE which they pushed off on us, \nand it is polluting water supplies all over the country. State after \nState is beginning to ban MTBE, such as California and other States. I \nassume that presently, or very shortly, we are going to have a ban on \nall MTBE in the United States.\n  They fooled us once, they fooled us twice, and they fooled us three \ntimes. Are we going to let them fool us again? Now they say they can \ncome up with something else. Now they have something else they are \ngoing to try to put in the gasoline to meet the Clean Air Act. They \nwant to get rid of the oxygenate requirement in fuel totally and do it \ntheir way. Then ethanol does not have a role. That is the oil companies \nfor you. They stymied everything we have ever tried to do to provide \nfor alternative source fuel, especially ethanol.\n  It costs basically the same amount of money to take oil out of the \nground today as it did a year ago or a year and a half ago. It does not \ncost any more. Yet we see the price going up.\n  The International Energy Agency has pointed out we have a greater \nsupply, than demand of oil by about 3 million barrels a day. I have \nalways thought, if supply exceeds demand, the price goes down. The oil \ncompanies have stood that on its head. We have an excess of supply over \ndemand by 3 million barrels a day and the price is way up.\n  The Senator from Alaska said that over the next--I don't know what \ntimeframe he was using--that the oil companies would need $1.5 trillion \nfor new infrastructure, $1.5 trillion for new pipelines, new \nrefineries, new infrastructure for oil and gas. Yet we try to get a few \nmillion dollars to help ethanol production, to help biomass fuels which \nare renewable. We need to get a few million dollars in for the use of \nhydrogen in fuel cells and for fuel cell research, which would be a \ntremendous\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\nalternative to burning gasoline in our cars--where you could take solar \nenergy, in the form of direct solar energy or biomass, or \nhydroelectric, use that power to separate hydrogen from oxygen, take \nthe two atoms of hydrogen off of the water, separate the hydrogen off, \nuse that hydrogen--you can compress it, you can store it, you can pipe \nit--you can even liquefy it; that is a little expensive--and then you \ncan put that through a fuel cell. As it goes through a fuel cell, it \ncombines again with oxygen, and it makes electricity. And you use that \nelectricity to power lights, to drive a car, to drive a bus. That is \nbeing done today.\n  We have buses running in Vancouver, British Columbia powered only by \nfuel cells. We have the technology. It is a little expensive right now, \nI grant that. But the more we mass-produce it, the cheaper it is going \nto become.\n  The future for energy production and energy use is not bleak; it is \nvery bright. It is clean, it is renewable, and it is plentiful. If we \ncan get out from underneath the grip that the oil companies have on \nAmerica, if we can move ahead, instead of $1.5 trillion for new \ninfrastructure for oil and gas, if we just take a fraction of that \namount of money and put it into fuel cell production, put it into \nbiomass fuels and solar energy and the production of ethanol, we could \nhave a blend of fuels in this country that would offset the increases \nwe would need over the next 20 to 50 years.\n  But this Congress will not invest in it. This Congress--will not \ninvest nor have other Congresses invested--in what is needed for clean, \nrenewable energy in the form of hydrogen extraction for fuel cells.\n  As I said, we have two paths to go. We can go down that same path we \nhave been going down with the whole carbon cycle, using more and more \noil, refining it, trying to clean up the air, trying to clean up oil \nspills, or we can go for clean, renewable fuels like ethanol and \nbiodiesel, and hydrogen for use in fuel cells which are much more \nefficient, too, by the way.\n  So, no, we do not have to continue to pay obeisance to the oil \ncompanies. I think maybe now, with what is happening in the upper \nMidwest, what we see happening around the country, maybe now Congress \ncan start to move and make some changes in our energy policy.\n  The bottom line: Get the oil company executives here. Put them under \noath. Ask them the tough questions. Then we will begin to get to the \nbottom of this.\n  I did not mean to really talk on energy, but I heard the Senator from \nAlaska talking about it and thought I should respond because I believe \nthere is another side to this story other than just going down the \npathway of promoting oil and more oil use in this country and around \nthe world.\n  But as I said in the beginning, we are here because of the Labor-HHS \nbill and the impact it has on our society in all of its forms: \neducation, health, job training, medical research.\n  I believe one of the crucial aspects of our bill that we fund here \nevery year on Health and Human Services is the need--the great need--we \nhave in this country to ensure that our elderly citizens have access to \nquality health care. That is why the administrative costs of medicare \nand the running of the program fall under our jurisdiction. The actual \nlevels of Medicare and Social Security fall under the Finance \nCommittee. But we are charged with the responsibility of making sure it \nruns and that the elderly get the kind of quality health care \naccessibility that they need. One of the items impacting the elderly \nthe most in that regard today is the extremely high price of \nprescription drugs.\n\n  Last night, we had a crucial vote in the Senate on that issue. We had \nthe first real vote this Congress on whether our seniors should get \nhelp with the high cost of prescription drugs. That is what the vote \nwas about. Unfortunately, all but two of our colleagues on the \nRepublican side joined together to defeat Senator Robb's motion and to \ndeny seniors the help they desperately need with high prescription drug \ncosts.\n  It is too bad it fell along partisan lines. This is not a partisan \nissue. I have had town meetings with seniors in my State. I don't ask \nthem whether they are Republicans or Democrats. They all come to the \nmeetings. It tears my heart out to hear their stories of $4,000, \n$5,000, as much as $6,000 a year that they are paying out of pocket \nevery year for prescription drugs with no help. It should not be a \npartisan issue. It is too bad that all of our colleagues on the \nRepublican side joined together to defeat it except two.\n  I hope it is only a temporary setback. I challenge our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle to join us, to join our seniors, to join \nthe overwhelming majority of Americans who support a Medicare drug \nbenefit. Our seniors need real help. They don't need the kind of sugar \npill that is being prescribed by the House Republican leadership.\n  The House Ways and Means Committee this week passed a prescription \ndrug benefit. Quite frankly, it does not answer the problem. It is an \ninsurance program that reimburses insurance companies, not our seniors. \nIt is not affordable. It is not an option for seniors in all regions of \nthe country. It is not universal. There is no guaranteed access to \nneeded drugs and local pharmacies. There are no protections against \nhigh drug costs. Who benefits from what the House did? The drug \ncompanies and the insurance companies. The House basically said that if \nyou are a single person and you make over $12,500, there is no \nassistance to you. They are saying to the seniors of this country, if \nyou make over $12,500 a year, tough luck. You have to pay for it all \nout of pocket. A lot of the people who have incomes under $12,500 \nqualify for Medicaid anyway; they get help with their drug costs.\n  What the Republicans in the House did only answers a need for a very \nnarrow band of seniors--the very poor. What about the elderly who are \nmaking $15,000 a year? They are left out in the cold. Seniors making \n$20,000 a year who may still have payments on a house, maybe they have \ntheir property taxes to pay, they have heating bills, food bills, they \nhave clothing bills. We would like to have them enjoy a little bit of \ntheir retirement years, maybe take a little vacation once in a while. \nThey can't do that. They won't be able to do that under the House-\npassed bill because they will have to have an income of less than \n$12,500 a year. If it is over that, even with that, the benefits go to \nthe drug companies and insurance companies and not to the seniors.\n  I think our seniors have waited long enough. They have been in the \nwaiting room long enough for this. When our seniors see the vote that \nwas taken last night, they are going to be mad, and they have every \nright to be. That is the first time we voted on this. We will continue \nto try. We will reach across the aisle and hope to make this a \nbipartisan effort. Senators will have another chance to vote again on \nthe issue of prescription drug benefits for our elderly. Hopefully, the \nnext time we do it, we will have a different result. We can provide \nmeaningful help for our seniors to pay the extremely high cost of drugs \nthey are having to pay today. So many of our seniors are being forced \nto choose between food, heat in the wintertime, maybe even air \nconditioning in the summertime, a choice between that and paying for \nprescription drugs. It is a choice they should not have to face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner pertaining to the introduction of S. 2782 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before addressing the Senate on the \nmatters before us in terms of education and the HHS appropriations \nbill, I commend my good friend from Iowa for a splendid presentation on \nenergy policy as well as on prescription drugs. He talked with great \nknowledge and understanding about some of these advanced technologies \nwhich can make an enormous difference in terms of our region of the \ncountry, the Northeast. With the kinds of research he has supported and \nwhich the administration has tried to achieve with their budgets being \ndenied by the other side, I am very hopeful that we can follow a number \nof those recommendations that he has made. I think they are sensible \nand responsible, and they can make an enormous difference on energy \npolicy.\n  As always, he has summarized very completely the challenge that is \nbefore the American people on the question of prescription drugs. We \nhad a brief debate last evening. We have been waiting some 17, 18 \nmonths to get action.\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\n We still have not had the action by the respective committees. Given \nthe fact that so many of our senior citizens are suffering, we want to \nmove this process forward.\n  I join with the Senator from Iowa and our other colleagues, the \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Graham, Senator Robb, and our leader, Senator \nDaschle, who has done so much to advance this issue for us in the \nSenate, hoping that we can in the remaining days fashion and shape \nlegislation that will have the support of this body. I think, as was \nevident last night, we still have a long way to go.\n  I regret very much that we are taking up the Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations bill for education, before we have completed action on \nthe authorizing bill, the Elementary and Secondary Education At. I am \ndistressed by this fact because we know that education is a national \npriority.\n  We have an opportunity this year to do our part to help local \ncommunities improve their schools by strengthening the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. And, to Democrats, this is must-pass \nlegislation.\n  We have tried to make this a priority in the Senate. Six weeks ago we \nwere debating education policy. That legislation was pulled. We did \nreceive assurances that we would get back to the debate on education \npolicy, but we have not had that opportunity to do so. I regret it. \nParents regret it and students and teachers and those involved in the \neducation of the children of this country should regret it.\n  We now have before us the funding mechanisms for education. We are \nreally putting the cart before the horse. We are talking about the \nfunding without having the debate on what the education policy should \nbe.\n  That is not the way to deal with the Federal involvement and \nparticipation in sound education policy. We have differences about how \nto do what we ought to fund. We have a limited role, granted. Only 7 \ncents out of every dollar that is expended at the local level is \nactually provided by the Federal Government, but this is not an \nunimportant funding stream.\n  Historically, what we have tried to do is debate these issues, \nresolve these questions, develop a policy, and then fund that policy. \nBut we have not had that opportunity. This is in spite of the fact that \nwe have had a lot of bold statements about the importance of education.\n  We had our majority leader in January of this year saying:\n\n       Education is going to be a central issue this year. For \n     starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act. That is important.\n\n  That is what I wish we had the opportunity to do. However, it has \nbeen 6 weeks since we had that legislation. We had it before the Senate \n6 days, and 2 days we had debate only. We had eight amendments, and \nthree of those were unanimously accepted. There were only 5 amendments \nthat would not have been universally accepted by roll call votes.\n  We have our leader talking about the importance of education as a \nmatter of national priority in January. At the Mayors Conference on \nJanuary 29, he said:\n\n       But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's \n     not going to just be words. . . .\n       Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in \n     the Congress this year. . . .\n\n  That was in 1999.\n  On February 1, 2000:\n\n       We're going to work very hard on education. I have \n     emphasized that every year I've been majority leader. . . . \n     And Republicans are committed to doing that.\n\n  Then he said on February 3, 2000:\n\n       We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act. . . . Education will be a high priority in this \n     Congress.\n\n  Congress Daily, April 20, 2000:\n\n       . . . Lott said last week his top priorities in May include \n     an agriculture sanctions bill, Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act reauthorization, and passage of four \n     appropriations bills.\n\n  And we still haven't had the reauthorization.\n  On May 2, the majority leader was asked:\n\n       Senator, on ESEA, have you scheduled a cloture vote on \n     that?\n       Senator Lott. No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. . . . \n     But education is number one in the minds of the American \n     people all across this country and every state, including my \n     own state.\n\n  We are still waiting for that. We had 55 different amendments on the \nbankruptcy bill. Why aren't we saying that education is important? Why \naren't we debating it today, or this afternoon, or next Monday, and \nhaving votes on it? We are not doing that and we ought to be doing \nthat--It is the Nation's business.\n  So this is an important matter for policy makers and parents. When \nthey hear the leaders of the Senate saying it is a priority and it is \nimportant, that we ought to do it, we have to do it, we are committed \nto doing it, yet we never do it, they have to ask are we serious about \nthis issue. I think these are very serious questions: Are we going to \nfind the time to debate what is on the minds of most families in this \ncountry? How their children are going to get the best possible \neducation? What are we going to do at the local level, State level, and \nFederal level to try to be able to achieve it? This is a matter of very \nconsiderable concern.\n  Secondly, I remind our colleagues that education is only 2.3 percent \nof the Federal fiscal year 2000 budget. Defense is 15 percent. Interest \non the debt is 12.3 percent. Entitlements are 12.6 percent. Medicare is \n6.5 percent. Medicare is 11.1 percent. Social Security is 22.5 percent. \nNondefense discretionary is 17.1 percent.\n  I don't think that is what American families think is a priority. \nThis institution is about prioritizing for the American people. How do \nwe reflect their principal concerns in prioritizing and allocating \nresources in the budget? I daresay that American families want more \nthan 2.3 percent of our Federal budget supporting education.\n\n  Now, there are those on the other side of the isle who do not want to \nsee that. They say they don't want any Federal participation. Some on \nthat side have advocated the abolition of the Department of Education. \nThey have wanted to rescind money that we have appropriated. That has \nbeen their position, and I don't agree with it.\n  When you see that education is only 2.3 percent of the Federal \nbudget--if you took any part of America and brought together a group of \nAmericans and asked them how they wanted to allocate the Federal \ndollars, they will talk about national security, certainly, and that is \nan important priority, and Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security; \nthose are obviously matters of priority. But they would also want to \nmake sure we were going to do more in the area of education--more than \n2.3 percent. If you take what we are doing at the K-through-12 level, \nit is below 1 percent. The remainder of the 2.3 percent includes higher \neducation initiatives including Pell grants and Stafford loans. If you \nlook at what we are doing for the 53 million American children going to \nschool every day, we are at less than 1 percent--less than 1 percent of \nour budget.\n  I think we are talking about what most families want. They want a \npartnership between the Federal, State, and local governments to try to \nfind out what programs are effective and what will enhance academic \nachievement and accomplishment for their children. Let's invest in \nthose programs and let's have tough accountability measures to make \nsure we are going to get results. That is what this side of the aisle \nwants to do.\n  This chart is reflective of what has been happening. The Federal \nshare of education funding has declined. This shows in 1980, elementary \nand secondary education--it was 11.9 percent in 1980, and it was down \nto 7.7 percent in 1999. The second part is higher education, 15.4 \npercent in 1980, and down to 10.7 percent in 1999. These indicators are \ngoing down when they ought to be going up. That is basically the issue \nof choice.\n  If you look at what is happening in terms of allocation of priorities \nin the elementary and secondary education, we are seeing the collapse \nof the national commitment in terms of educating children in this \ncountry. This is wrong. We are talking about priorities, and I think \nthis is an issue that will have to be a matter before the country in \nthis national election.\n  We have seen in the eighties and coming into the nineties a gradual \ndecline in Congress assisting local communities, at a time when there \nhas been an exploding population in K-12. There are scarcer resources \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\nassist local communities, as we have been able to acquire an increasing \nknowledge and awareness about efforts that are actually working and \nenhancing academic achievement.\n  That is the dilemma. That is the dilemma with the budget resolution. \nThe Republican budget resolution allocated a certain amount of \nresources for the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. I admire the \nwork that has been done by my colleagues, Senator Harkin from Iowa and \nSenator Specter from Pennsylvania. In spite of their best efforts, \nbecause there has been a reduced allocation for their budget, there is \ngoing to be a cutback in many of the programs which make a vital \ndifference in educating the children of this country.\n  It does not have to be that way. Included in this budget is a tax cut \nof some $718 billion over 10 years. When there is an allocation for a \ntax cut of $718 billion, there is going to be a short shrift of some \nprograms, and in this instance it is education. The American people \nought to understand that. I believe it is a higher priority to invest \nin children and in programs that work rather than having tax breaks for \nwealthy individuals and corporations of this country.\n  This ought to be an issue during the course of this election because \nif we are not going to see any departure or change in the leadership in \nthe House or the Senate, we will continue to see this decline in \nassisting in education. That is irrefutable.\n  I am going to review for the Senate what has happened to some \nprograms that have focused on the enhancement of education. There are \ncutbacks by the Republican leadership in allocating resources to the \nSenate appropriations subcommittee because they want a large tax break \nover a period of years. Democrats have some tax breaks, about a third \nof what the Republicans want. We have about a third of the cut, but we \nenhance the programs that are working. That is the major difference.\n  This is not a time for cuts in education. We need to increase our \ninvestment in education to ensure a brighter future for the Nation's \nchildren. Unfortunately, the bill approved by the House of \nRepresentatives is a major retreat from these priorities. It slashed \nfunding for education by $2.9 billion below the President's request. \nThe House bill is even worse than the bill that is before the Senate. \nUnless we are going to enhance some of these programs during the debate \nnext week, then we cannot expect, when the House and Senate meet, that \nthere is going to be a compromise that is not going to have a further \ndiminution of our commitment than what is before the Senate at this \ntime.\n  The House bill zeros out critical funds to help States turn around \nfailing schools. It slashes funding for 21st century learning center \nprograms by $400 million below the President's request, denying 900 \ncommunities the opportunity to provide $1.6 million for after-school \nactivities to keep children off the streets, away from drugs and out of \ntrouble, and help them with their studies.\n  Of all the requests for resources for programs by local communities, \nperhaps the highest number of requests is for after-school programs. \nThey are working, they are effective, and they are keeping children out \nof trouble and enhancing academic achievement. These programs are being \ncut.\n  It eliminates the bipartisan commitment to help communities across \nthe country reduce class size in the early grades. The federal Class \nSize Reduction program is making a difference. For example, in Columbus \nOhio, class sizes in grades 1-3 have been reduced from 25 students per \nclass to 15 students per class. We need to invest more in this program, \nso that communities can continue to reduce class sizes.\n\n  It cuts funding for Title I by $166 million below the President's \nrequest, reducing or eliminating services to 260,000 educationally \ndisadvantaged children to help them master the basics and meet high \nstandards of achievement--260,000 fewer children will be able to \nbenefit from that program.\n  It reduces the funding for the Reading Excellence Act by $26 million \nbelow the President's request, denying services to help 100,000 \nchildren become successful readers by the end of the third grade. What \nsense does that make? We ought to be enhancing our effort to ensure \nliteracy among children in our country. We know what works. Instead, \nthey are cutting back on that effort which has been very successful.\n  It slashes funding for Safe and Drug Free Schools by $51 million \nbelow the President's request, denying communities extra help to keep \ntheir students safe, healthy, and drug-free, with the development of \nconflict resolution programs to help schools and school teachers have \nmore orderly, disciplined classrooms and schools. This program is used \nin schools all over this country. It is not going to resolve all the \nproblems of school violence and school discipline, but it is enormously \nhelpful and useful in trying to help teachers, parents, and officials \nin local communities to make schools safer and drug-free.\n  This bill does nothing to help communities meet the most urgent \nrepair and modernization needs.\n  These needs are especially urgent in 5,000 schools across the \ncountry. We have the GAO study that says it will cost $112 billion to \nrepair and modernize schools so that children go to school in buildings \nthat are modern and safe, and not overcrowded. The administration has \ncome up with a very modest program to help schools in this effort. This \neffectively turns its back on that effort.\n  It slashes funding for GEAR UP by $125 million below the President's \nrequest, denying more than 644,000 low-income middle and high school \nstudents the support they need for early college preparation and \nawareness activities.\n  It does nothing to increase the funding for Teacher Quality \nEnhancement Grants, so that more communities can recruit and retain \nbetter qualified teachers.\n  It slashes funding for Head Start by $600 million below the \nPresident's budget, denying 50,000 low-income children critical \npreschool services.\n  It slashes funding for dislocated workers by $181 million below the \nPresident's request, denying over 100,000 dislocated workers much-\nneeded training, job search, and re-employment services.\n  It reduces funding for Adult Job Training by $93 million below the \nPresident's request, denying 37,2 and the second part is higher \neducation 00 adults job training this year.\n  If this program goes through, in terms of trade with China, we know \nthere are going to be sectors of our economy that are going to do very \nwell, but there are others that are going to be adversely impacted.\n  Rather than cutting back and slashing training programs for workers \nwho are going to be dislocated, we ought to be strengthening those \nprograms, if we are going to be fair and have a fair and balanced \npolicy on the issues of trade. We are going in the wrong direction.\n  It cuts youth opportunities grants by $200 million below the \nPresident's request, eliminating the proposed expansion to 20 new \ncommunities, reducing the current program by $75 million, and denying \n40,000 of some of the most disadvantaged youth a bridge to the skills \nand opportunities of our strong economy and alternatives to welfare and \ncrime.\n  It slashes Summer Jobs and Year-Round Youth Training by $21 million \nbelow the President's request, reducing the estimated number of low-\nincome youth to be served by over 12,000.\n  What do you expect these young people are going to be involved in? \nYou don't think they are going to look for other routes? And then we \nare going to have complaints about the problems in terms of an increase \nin violence and dangerous behavior when we are basically underserving \nand failing in terms of meeting these requirements--all because we are \ntrying to save money for a tax break for wealthy individuals. That is \nthe alternative.\n  The Senate bill does take some positive steps towards better funding \nfor higher education.\n  It does increase the Pell grant by $350 to $3,650. This is enormously \nimportant.\n  The average income for those families is $9,000. If you take children \nwith similar academic test results--not that test results are the only \nindicator; but let's take those--that makes it even more extraordinary \nbecause these children who are coming from low-income\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\nand lower-middle income families don't have the advantages that many \nother children have in taking these prep courses for the SATs and other \ncollege aptitude tests. But if you take children with the same academic \ntest results, the chance for children in the lower quarter percentile \nto continue in higher education is 25 percent of what it would be if \nthey were in the top third of income. Mr. President, 82 percent of \nchildren in the top third income bracket continue in higher education. \nAnd for just the children who are eligible, 25 percent of them continue \nin higher education from the lower income bracket.\n  We are finding the disparity in education increasing. We made the \nefforts years ago, starting in the 1960s, with Republican and \nbipartisan support, to try to see that there was not going to be \nenormous disparity in the area of education. That is increasing now. \nThe danger we are facing is whether we are going to see it further \nincrease in the areas of technology.\n  There has been a funding increase of $1.3 billion in IDEA, which I \nstrongly support. I remember offering the amendment last year when we \nhad the tax bill. It was $780 billion over 5 years, to fully fund the \nIDEA. That would have taken a fifth of the tax bill. And it went down \nin a resounding defeat. It was a pretty clear indication that the \nRepublican leadership won't fully fund IDEA for a tax cut, but will try \nto fund the IDEA even if it means cutting back in some of these very \nimportant programs that reach out to the neediest children.\n  Once again, the Republican leadership has put block grants ahead of \ntargeted funding for education reforms. Block grants are the wrong \napproach. They prevent the allocation of scarce resources to the \nhighest education priorities. They eliminate critical accountability \nprovisions that ensure better results for all children. The block grant \napproach abandons the national commitment to improve education by \nencouraging proven effective reforms of public schools.\n  Block grants are the wrong direction for education and the wrong \ndirection for the Nation. They do nothing to encourage change in public \nschools.\n  The bill includes $2.7 billion more for the title VI block grant, but \nit eliminates the Federal commitment to reducing class size. It does \nnothing to guarantee funds for communities to address their urgent \nschool repair and modernization needs.\n  It is unconscionable to block grant critical funds that are targeted \nto the neediest communities to reduce class size. Under the bipartisan \nClass Size Reduction Program that has received bipartisan support for \nthe past 2 years, funds are distributed based on a formula that is \ntargeted to school districts 80 percent by poverty and 20 percent by \npopulation. But under the title VI block grant, funding is distributed \nbased solely on population--it includes no provisions to target the \nfunds to high poverty districts. This is unacceptable, when it is often \nthe neediest students that are in the largest classes.\n  The national class size average is just over 22 students per class. \nBut, in many communities--especially in urban and rural communities--\nclass sizes are much higher than the national average.\n  In 1998, the publication Education Week found that half of the \nelementary teachers in urban areas and 44 percent of the teachers in \nnonurban areas had classes with 25 or more students.\n  Next week, we will have the opportunity to address education in this \npending Senate appropriations bill.\n  Democrats will offer amendments to address as many of these critical \nneeds as possible. I intend to offer an amendment to increase funding \nfor Title II of the Higher Education Act, to help communities recruit \nand train prospective teachers and put a qualified teacher in every \nclassroom. In addition, I will offer an amendment to increase funding \nfor skills training by $792 million to ensure the Nation's workers get \nthe support they need in today's workplace.\n  Senator Murray will offer an amendment to continue the bipartisan \ncommitment we have made over the last two years to help communities \nreduce class size in the early grades.\n  Senator Harkin and Senator Robb will offer an amendment to ensure \nthat communities get the help they need to meet the most urgent repair \nand modernization programs.\n  Senator Dodd will offer an amendment to increase funding for the 21st \nCentury Learning Centers Program, so more children will have the \nopportunity to attend after-school activities.\n  Senator Bingaman will offer an amendment to help States turn around \nfailing schools.\n  Senator Reed will offer an amendment to increase funding for the GEAR \nUP programs, so more children will be able to attend college.\n  Other colleagues will offer additional amendments to increase the \nNation's investment in education. The time is now to invest more in \neducation. The Nation's children and families deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I want to just take a moment of the Senate's time to \nspeak on where we are on the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The American people have waited more than 3 years for Congress to \nsend the President a Patients' Bill of Rights that protects all \npatients and holds HMOs and other health plans accountable for their \nactions.\n  Every day the conference on the Patients' Bill of Rights fails to \nproduce agreement on meaningful patient protections, 60,000 more \npatients endure added pain and suffering. More than 40,000 patients \nreport a worsening of their condition as a result of health plan \nabuses. This is happening every single day we fail to take action.\n  By all accounts, Republicans are working amongst themselves on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. They are working in the middle of the night, \nbehind closed doors, to produce a partisan bill that will surely fail \nthe test of true reform. The crocodile tears were flowing from the eyes \nof the Senate Republican leadership on June 8 when we took the \nbipartisan, House-passed Managed Care Consensus Act to the floor for \nits first Senate vote. That legislation, which passed the House with \noverwhelming bipartisan support last year, is a sensible compromise \nthat extends meaningful protections to all patients and guarantees that \nhealth plans are held accountable when their abuses result in injury or \ndeath.\n  Democratic Conferees sent a letter to Senator Nickles on June 13. In \nthat letter, we reiterated that we remained ready to negotiate on \nserious proposals that provide a basis for achieving strong, effective \nprotections. But the Assistant Majority Leader has not responded. The \nsilence is deafening.\n  The gap between the Senate Republican plan and the bipartisan \nlegislation enacted by the House in the Norwood-Dingell bill is wide. \nAnd the intransigence of the Republican conferees is preventing \nadequate progress.\n  Make no mistake. We want a bill that can be signed into law this \nyear. There is not much time left. We need to act now. The Republican \nleadership continues to refuse to guarantee meaningful protections to \nall Americans. They continue to delay and deny action on this critical \nissue. This debate is about real people. It is about women, children, \nand families.\n  This issue is a very basic and fundamental issue. It is whether \ndoctors, nurses, and families are going to make the medical decisions \nfor patients free of the decisions of the accountants for the HMOs. \nThat is what this bill is really all about. That is why over 300 \norganizations support our particular proposal: patients organizations, \nevery women's organization, every child's advocate, every cancer \nprevention and treatment organization is for us, every medical \norganization--including strong support from the American Medical \nAssociation. None of these organizations support the Senate Republican \nprogram or the lack of progress in the conference.\n  A third of all the Republicans in the House of Representatives \nsupported the Dingell-Norwood bill. Now we have effectively 49 Members \nof the Senate who are supporting the Dingell-Norwood legislation. To \njust get a majority, one would think the changes that would have to be \nmade in this would be extremely easy. I don't think they are that \ncomplex. But we still have the Republican leadership denying us the \nchance to do it.\n  I am always interested in the silence on the other side. I asked: In \nthis Patients' Bill of Rights, which we have basically supported on our \nside, which one of these guarantees do you not\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nwant to provide for your families and for your constituents?\n  The first one is to protect all patients with private insurance. This \nis the difference. Under the Democratic proposal, there are 161 million \nAmericans who are covered. Under the Senate Republican program, there \nare only 48 million. Under the bipartisan House of Representatives \nprogram, it is 161 million. We ought to be able to decide that pretty \neasily. Do we want to cover everyone, which is 161 million, or are we \ngoing to cover only 48 million? If you put people together in a room, \nthey have to be able to come out with some number. The Republican bill \nleaves out millions of Americans. I find it absolutely extraordinary to \nthink that we wouldn't provide protections for all Americans.\n\n  Do we want to leave out the 23 to 25 million State and local \nemployees--teachers, firefighters, police officers, public health \nnurses, doctors, garbage collectors, et cetera? Do we want to leave \nthem out? They were left out of the Senate bill sponsored by the \nRepublicans. We included them.\n  Do you want to leave out those who are the self-employed--farmers, \nchild care providers, cab drivers, people who work for companies that \ndon't provide insurance, contract workers, workers who are between jobs \nand unemployed? We cover them, 12 to 15 million people. The Republican \nbill does not cover them.\n  The bipartisan legislation that we support and which we voted on in \nthe Senate on June 8 covers everyone. But the Senate Republican \nleadership says ``no'' to farmers, truck drivers, police officers, \nteachers, home day care providers, fire fighters, and countless others \nwho buy insurance on their own or work for state or local governments. \nRepublican conferees steadfastly refuse to cover all Americans. Their \nflawed approach leaves out two-thirds of those with private health \ninsurance--more than 120 million Americans.\n  The protections in the House-passed bill are urgently needed by \npatients across the country. Yet, the Republican leadership is adopting \nthe practice of delay and denial that HMOs so often use themselves to \ndelay and deny patients the care they need. It's just as wrong for \nCongress to delay and deny these needed reforms, as it is for HMOs to \ndelay and deny needed care.\n  We have listened to statements on the other side that, ``This is all \npolitics. This is all politics.'' We are asking: What is politics, to \ntry to include everyone? What is politics is not including them and \nbeing in the debt of the HMOs and the industry. That is the politics.\n  So we ask, what is it that we don't want to provide--which one of \nover twenty different protections? Are we going to deny access to \nspecialists? Are we not going to permit clinical trials? Are we going \nto refuse women access to OB/GYNs? What about prescription drugs that \ndoctors give; are we not going to guarantee that? Or are we going to \nprohibit the gag rule so doctors can give the most accurate information \non various treatments? I hope. Are we going to ensure external and \ninternal appeals as well as accountability? Are we going to ensure \nemergency room access? I would think so. Which of these protections do \nthe Republicans not want to guarantee to the American people? That is \nthe question we are asking. The American people are entitled to an \nanswer. Three hundred organizations that represent the American people \nsay they are entitled to it. We ought to be doing something about it.\n  Every day, we find out that Americans are being harmed. We were able \nto get bipartisan legislation through the House of Representatives. At \nthe dead end of our conference, the courageous Congressmen, Mr. Norwood \nand Mr. Ganske, came over and indicated that they believe we are not \nmaking progress. They support our efforts in the Senate. Two prominent \ndoctors who happen to be Republicans strongly support our effort in the \nSenate to get action.\n  We reject the concept that this is just a political ploy. It is \ninteresting to me, having been here for some time, that whenever you \nagree with the other side, it is wonderful and you are a statesman. If \nyou differ, you are a politician; it is done for political purposes. We \nhave listened to that all the time. We heard it last night on \nprescription drugs. We heard it on hate crimes. We heard it with regard \nto the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The American people understand the importance of this legislation. We \nwant to give assurances to the American people, we are not letting up \non this issue. We are going to press this issue on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. We are going to press it, and press it, and press it until \nwe get the job done.\n  We are going to do the same with prescription drugs, so our friends \non the other side ought to get familiar with it. Just as we are going \nto come back to the issue of minimum wage, we are going to come back to \nit, and back to it, and back to it, if you want to dust off your \nspeeches already and say that that is politics.\n\n  The idea of guaranteeing someone who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks \nof the year, that they are not going to live in poverty is a fairness \nissue which the American people understand. We ought to guarantee that \nminimum wage for work in America. You can name it or call it anything \nyou want, as long as we vote on it and get it and make sure they get \nthe fair increase they deserve.\n  I thought we would have the chance to get into the debate and \ndiscussion on a number of these issues, but we are not having that \nopportunity today. I look forward to debating the issues the first of \nthe week.\n  Mr. President, Congress can pass bipartisan legislation that provides \nmeaningful protections for all patients and guarantees accountability \nwhen health plan abuse results in injury or death. The question is \n``will we''?\n  The American people are waiting for an answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The \nPost article details the latest event in the continuing international \nstruggle that American Joseph Cooke has endured as he seeks the return \nof his children.

Well, despite this promise at the highest \nlevels government, the Kostanz Special Service for Foster Children now \nis limiting the access that Joseph Cooke's mother has to visiting her \ngrandchildren--apparently as a punishment for all the recent media \nattention the case has received. This is outrageous, Mr. President. And \nit simply cannot be tolerated.\n  Let me take a moment to review the events that have led to where we \nare today on this issue. At the recent European conference on ``Modern \nGovernance in the 21st Century,'' President Clinton met with Chancellor \nSchroeder to discuss several pressing international concerns. One \nissue, in particular--one I had urged President Clinton to raise with \nthe Chancellor--was the tragic situation of U.S. children being \nabducted by a parent and taken to Germany.\n  It was necessary to raise this issue with Chancellor Schroeder \nbecause parents--and not just American parents, either--have had a very \ndifficult time getting their children back when they have been abducted \nand taken to Germany. Although Germany has signed the Hague Convention, \nour ally--yes, our ally--has not taken their obligations under the \nConvention seriously. In fact, from 1990 to 1998, only 22 percent of \nAmerican children for whom Hague applications were filed were returned \nto the United States from Germany--and that percentage includes those \nwho were voluntarily returned by the abducting parent.\n  Last month, I spoke on the floor about the Joseph Cooke case--a case \nthat illustrates perfectly Germany's reluctance to return kidnapped \nchildren. In Mr. Cooke's case, his wife took their two children to \nGermany, and without his knowledge, turned them over to the German \nYouth Authority. Despite Mr. Cooke's desperate attempts to get his \nchildren back, a German court decided that they were better off with a \nGerman foster family than with their American father. Only after \nPresident Clinton's meeting with Chancellor Schroeder and only after \nMr. Cooke's case received considerable publicity and media attention, \ndid Germany agree to help Joseph Cooke.\n  The Germans promised to allow Mr. Cooke and his family visitation \nwith his children. The Germans also promised to form a working group \nwith the United States to examine pending abduction cases. Chancellor \nSchroeder agreed to ``think about organizational and institutional \nconsequences to be taken'' to speed up the German court process and \nmake changes in German law to allow visitation rights for those parents \npreviously prevented from seeing their children at all. Although the \nChancellor acknowledged that it would be difficult to reverse German \ncustody decisions, he assured President Clinton that this soon-to-be-\ncreated commission would work on providing the so-called left-behind \nparents access to their children.\n  But now, as the Washington Post reports, Germany is restricting \nvisitation of the Cooke children's American grandmother from open, six-\nhour visits to supervised, two-hour visits in a psychologist's office. \nWe must take a very tough stance against this, Mr. President. We must \njudge Germany by its recent actions--not its recent words--recent, \nempty words. We must hold Germany to its promises and see to it their \ngovernment matches words with deeds and returns every single American \nchild.\n  Given Germany's reversal on the visitation agreement, I am even more \nskeptical now about the sincerity of Germany's commitment to return \nkidnapped children. I say that partly because German officials have \nrepeatedly blamed their non-compliance on the independence of their \njudiciary system. They say that they are reluctant to challenge court \nrulings because the courts are separate and independent from the \nparliament. Chancellor Schroeder even likened such interference to the \ndays of Nazi Germany, when he told a German newspaper that: ``We have \nalways fought for the well-being of the children to be at the core of \ndivorce and custody cases. That is the only standard. The times in \nwhich Germany would routinely change the decisions of the courts \n[during the Nazi era] are over, thank God'' (Reuters, 6/1/00).\n\n  I find that argument very interesting since the United States has a \nvery independent judiciary branch, yet we return children in 90% of all \ninternational abduction cases. And, our return rate of German children, \nspecifically, is equally high. Even according to the German Justice \nMinistry's own figures, from 1995 to 1999, there were 116 cases of \nGerman parents demanding children back from the United States. Of those \ncases, the U.S. courts refused to return the children in only four \ncases. During those same five-years, there were 165 known cases in \nwhich a parent living in the United States wanted his or her children \nreturned from Germany. Yet, in 33 of those cases, German courts \ndeclined to return the children (AP Worldstream, 6/2/00).\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about Germany's offer to create a \n``working group'' with the United States given the result of a similar \npromise Germany made to France. French President Jacques Chirac, who \nhas characterized Germany as applying ``the law of the jungle'' in \nabduction cases (The London Evening Standard, 6/1/00), repeatedly asked \nGermany to address the difficulty his country is having in getting \nFrench children returned. In response, Chancellor Schroeder agreed to \ncreate a ``working group'' between the two nations to reach some \nresolution. While this working group was created a year ago, results \nhave yet to come in on its effectiveness. Given France's experience, it \nis crucial that we hold Chancellor Schroeder to his word and see to it \nthat his words are not just empty promises made in an attempt to \nimprove a tarnished image in the international community.\n  Assistant Secretary of State for consular affairs, Mary Ryan will be \nin Germany this weekend where, according to the Washington Post, ``she \nwill be raising this specific issue with every person she meets in the \nGerman government.'' I am encouraged to see that our State Department \nhas indicated that it is outraged by Germany's action--perhaps now, \nthey will take these kinds of cases seriously and take some type of \nsignificant action against Germany. Never-the-less, I urge her and our \nState Department and President Clinton to not take Germany's broken \npromises lightly. We must insist that the Germans reverse these \nrestrictions on visitation, otherwise there is absolutely no reason to \nset up the commission.\n  Mr. President, we cannot tolerate lip service from our allies. We \nmust hold the German government's feet to the fire. No excuses should \nbe accepted by the parents of these children, nor by this Senate, nor \nby this Congress, nor by the American people. This must be a priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5731-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5731-S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRESCRIPTION DRUG AMENDMENT OF SENATOR ROBB\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nwith the outcome of the vote that occurred last evening here in the \nSenate. I am referring to the vote on Senator Robb's amendment \nconcerning a Medicare benefit for prescription drugs.\n  Last night, we had an opportunity to give millions of elderly and \ndisabled Americans something they desperately require, a universal \nprescription drug benefit. Yet, this measure was defeated, mostly along \nparty lines, by a vote of 44-53. Our nation's seniors deserve better.\n  The need for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare has grown \neach and every year. Advances in medical science have revolutionized \nthe practice of medicine. And the proliferation of pharmaceuticals has \nradically altered the way acute illness and chronic disease are treated \nand managed.\n  These remarkable advances, however, have not come without a cost. \nSince 1980, prescription drug expenditures have grown at double digit \nrates and prescription drugs constitute the largest out-of-pocket cost \nfor seniors. For millions of seniors, many of whom are living on a \nfixed income and do not\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\nhave a drug benefit as part of their health insurance coverage, access \nto these new medicines is beyond reach.\n  Even more alarming, it is estimated that 38 percent of seniors pay \n$1,000 or more for prescription drugs annually, while 3 in 5 Medicare \nbeneficiaries lack a dependable source of drug coverage. This lack of \nreliable drug coverage for today's seniors is reminiscent of the lack \nof hospital coverage for the elderly prior to the creation of Medicare. \nBack in 1963, an estimated 56 percent of seniors lacked hospital \ninsurance coverage. Today, after all our investments in health care and \nprevention, 53 percent of seniors still lack a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  The need for a Medicare prescription drug benefit is a top concern \nfor the elderly and disabled in my home state of Rhode Island. Many \nseniors continue to be squeezed by declines in retiree health insurance \ncoverage, increasing Medigap premiums and the capitation of annual \nprescription drug benefits at $500 or $1000 under Medicare managed care \nplans. Mr. President, seniors in my state are frustrated and burdened \nboth financially and emotionally by the lack of a reliable prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  While the need for a prescription drug benefit is clear and the \ndesire on the part of some members of Congress is there, action on \nMedicare prescription drug legislation has been slow. The Senate \nFinance Committee has held a series of hearings on the subject of \nMedicare prescription drugs, however, the committee to date has been \nunable to produce a bill.\n  In May, I joined Senator Daschle and several of my Democratic \ncolleagues, in introducing S. 2541, the Medicare Expansion of Needed \nDrugs Act. This legislation seeks to provide millions of elderly and \ndisabled Americans with an adequate, reliable and affordable source of \nprescription drug coverage.\n  The MEND Act embodies the principles that I believe are necessary for \nan adequate prescription drug benefit--it is voluntary, accessible to \nall seniors, affordable, provides a reliable benefit and is consistent \nwith broader Medicare reform.\n  Last evening, the Senate had a real and possibly its only opportunity \nto enact a prescription drug benefit when Senator Robb offered an \namendment during the consideration of the fiscal year 2001 Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill that would \nhave provided a universal Medicare prescription drug benefit to our \nnation's seniors. While the proposal differs slightly from the MEND \nAct, it embraced the principles that I view as necessary for a good \nbenefit. Regrettably, this crucial amendment was defeated.\n  I sincerely hope that the stated desire of many of my colleagues to \ncreate an adequate and affordable Medicare prescription drug benefit \nwill become a reality this year. During this time of strong economic \nprosperity, we should all feel compelled to seize this opportunity to \nstrengthen and enhance Medicare for the new millennium.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5732-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HATE CRIMES AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as hate-crimes legislation was recently \ndebated and voted on by the United States Senate, I would like to \nbriefly explain my vote on this issue. I believe that all victims of \ncrime, and most certainly victims of violent crime, are deserving of \nspecial status. After due process has been afforded and guilt \ndetermined, perpetrators of crimes should be punished speedily for the \npeace of the community and to bring some measure of resolution for the \nvictim. However, creating different classifications of victims, and \nrendering punishment based upon such classifications threatens the \nnotion of ``Equal Justice Under Law,'' the principle that adorns the \nUnited States Supreme Court building and should suffuse our entire \nlegal system.\n  Violence itself, whether motivated by hate, revenge, greed, lust, \nenvy, or some other evil motivation, threatens the peace of our \ncommunities and our citizens' sense of security. The Kennedy amendment \nwould include minor crimes against property within the definition of \nhate crimes, but would not have included such heinous acts as the \nOklahoma City federal building bombing, or the school shooting at \nColumbine High School, both of which left lasting, painful memories for \nthe local communities in Oklahoma and Colorado, and even the Nation as \na whole.\n  Rather than focusing on the particular motivation of the criminal, \nCongress and the states should provide law enforcement officials the \nresources necessary to fully prosecute all crimes. The diligent \nenforcement of existing laws will serve as an effective deterrent \nagainst criminal acts motivated by bigotry and hate, or any other \ndistasteful compulsion. A more comprehensive strategy than what is \nembodied in the Kennedy amendment is warranted in light of the fact \nthat in 1998 there were 16,914 murders committed in the United States \n(an average of 46 every day), and of the 16,914, only thirteen were \ndeemed to be hate crimes.\n  I supported the Hatch amendment, which studies how extensive the hate \ncrimes problem is and whether these heinous crimes are being fairly and \naggressively prosecuted in the same manner as other similar crimes. I \nalso welcome the Justice Department technical and financial assistance \nto states which need help in pursuing and identifying hate crimes. This \nis a far better role for the federal government than moving to \nfederalize all state actions against hate crimes.\n  The Kennedy amendment also raised concerns by experts about \nconstitutionality. Ultimately, it threatened to create more problems in \nthe criminal justice system than it purported to solve, and I \nconsequently voted ``no'' on the amendment and yes on the more \nreasonable Hatch amendment. I pledge to my constituents that I will \nsupport aggressive state prosecution of hate crimes, and I will \ncontinue to work to maintain safe communities, including actively \nsupporting legislation that furthers that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5732-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5732-S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INTERNET TAX MORATORIUM AND EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nDorgan, in introducing legislation designated to address the issue of \nInternet sales taxation.\n  As a consumer, I know first-hand how popular, simple and easy it is \nto buy items over the Internet. In fact, the Internet saved me at \nChristmas when I bought last-minute gifts for my wife, four children \nand our two little granddaughters.\n  But, as a member of both the Senate Finance and Commerce committees, \nI also know Congress has an obligation to examine how these same, tax-\nfree Internet sales can financially harm businesses and state \ngovernments.\n  Senator Dorgan's bill balances the concerns of state and local \ngovernments with the importance of maintaining easy access to Internet \nservices. It allows state and localities to enter into an interstate \ncompact for the purpose of simplifying their sales tax systems for \nremote sales. Once 20 states have joined the compact, Congress can \ndisapprove of their efforts. If Congress does not act, those states \nthat have joined the compact and simplified their sales tax systems, \nwill be authorized to collect sales tax on the purchases their citizens \nmake over the Internet.\n  Our proposal, recognizing that collecting taxes must not be overly \nburdensome for online retailers, also provides a collection fee for all \nInternet retailers who collect these taxes. It ensures Internet \npurchases are not singled out for special tax treatment at the expense \nof neighborhood businesses, and state and local governments. This \nrestores equality, a key aspect of any good tax system, without placing \nan unfair burden on anyone. I believe that this is a fair and equitable \nbill that takes reasonable steps to address the concerns of both online \nretailers and state and local governments.\n  We all agree Internet access should not be taxed, and that states and \nlocalities should not be allowed to impose discriminatory taxes on the \nInternet. In fact, Senator Dorgan's bill extends the moratorium on \nthese types of sales for another four years.\n  But, I ask, is it fair to levy sales taxes on a person who buys a \nbook from his local bookstore, but not his neighbor who buys that same \nbook over the Internet?\n  I do not think it is fair. It isn't fair to residents who must pay \nthe local\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\nsales tax because they don't own a computer. It isn't fair to local \nretailers collecting the tax who must compete with Internet retailers \nwho don't. And, it isn't fair to the states and their local governments \nthat are losing money they need to fight crime and fires, and to give \ntheir children a quality education.\n  In Louisiana, sales taxes make up 33 percent of all revenues. \nEconomists estimate that Louisiana could lose up to $172 million in \nstate revenues by 2002 because Internet sales are not taxed. Other \nstates are confronted with similar difficulties. When faced with these \nfacts, it's no wonder two-thirds of Americans support Internet sales \ntaxes.\n  The sales tax is not a new tax. It has been collected by states from \ntheir citizens for more than 100 years. It should be collected on all \nsales, regardless of whether they occur on Main Street or the \ninformation superhighway. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2775. From \nthe beginning of the debate on the Internet Tax Moratorium Act, I have \nfought for the sovereignty of state and local elected officials and a \nlevel playing field for on-line and off-line retailers. This bipartisan \nbill accomplishes both of these goals by allowing the states to work \ntogether in an Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact to simplify and \nstreamline the existing sales tax system in to a blended rate that will \nenable remote on-line and off-line sellers to collect and remit sales \ntaxes without an undue burden. While states work toward this objective, \nthe current tax moratorium will be extended four more years.\n  In addition to providing greater equity in the tax treatment of both \nInternet-based and Main Street businesses, this legislation also \nprovides means for on-line retailers to pay their fair share in \nsupporting the communities in which their employees and customers live. \nLocal sales tax revenue contributes to the infrastructure and emergency \nservices of these communities. Also of importance is the aid these \nfunds provide to local education. If the high-tech community is truly \nlooking to expand the domestic pool of eligible employees, they should \nbe lauding this legislative approach because of the support it will \nprovide the local, public school systems. Sales tax revenue will help \neducate the future programmer, software developer, or information \narchitect for the virtual world of tomorrow.\n  As a former state official, I understand the important role state and \nlocal officials play in establishing public policy. Although Internet \nsales represent a small portion of overall consumer sales today, Net \nsales are increasing every day. Without a level playing field between \non-line and off-line retailers, the forty-five states and the District \nof Columbia that collect sales tax could be crippled by the budgetary \nimpact.\n  The Internet offers a more convenient means of purchasing goods. No \nlonger do consumers need to fight traffic, search for a parking space, \nand deal with sometimes unhelpful sales people in order to purchase an \nitem. This legislation would further ease on-line purchases by removing \nthe confusing and often misunderstood use tax remission policies of \nstates. The consumer would be able to take care of any tax questions in \none transaction.\n  Some of my colleagues claim that applying existing sales taxes to the \nInternet will destroy this powerful news, information and commerce \nmedium. I, on the other hand, do not see any signs of a slowing of the \nNet. It is growing so quickly that we are running out of Internet \naddresses. If anything, enacting this legislation now will enable new \n``e-tailers'' to adjust their business design to adapt to this policy. \nIn addition, this fear completely ignores the fact that these taxes are \nalready due. They are not collected because it is too difficult.\n  The National Governors Association, the National Retail Federation, \nand the e-Fairness Coalition are among the groups that believe this \nlegislation is a proper approach to level the e-commerce playing field. \nI urge my colleagues to join with this bi-partisan group in supporting \nthe balanced approach of S. 2775 that accomplishes one of the main \ngoals of the Internet Tax Freedom Act: to find a way to simplify the \nexisting sales and use tax structure for remote sellers while the \nmoratorium remains in place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5733-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   CONGRATULATING ESTONIA ON THE EIGHTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF VICTORY DAY\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, June 23rd marks the 80th \nanniversary of Voidhupuha, or Victory Day, recalling Estonia's break \nfrom Russian control in 1920. On this holiday, Estonians commemorate \nthe battles during the War of Independence in which military forces \nfought to regain Baltic control over the region. On Victory Day \nEstonians also celebrate the contributions of all who have fought for \nthe cause of independence throughout their country's history.\n  Many lives were lost for the cause of Estonian independence. Three \nbattles, Roopa, Venden-Ronnenberg, and finally Vonnu were the turning \npoints that ultimately led to the defeat of the opposing army. The \nTartu Peace Treaty in 1920 marked the end of centuries of struggle and \nfinally granted independence to Estonia.\n  On Victory Day, Estonians also remember those who battled against the \nNazis and the Soviets. From 1944 until 1991 the Soviets again occupied \nEstonia, and during this time those who voiced opinions against the \ngovernment were typically sentenced to 25 years in a Gulag prison, and \n5 years in exile. The designation of June 23rd as Victory Day signifies \nthat all those involved in the crusade for freedom are remembered for \ntheir efforts, and that their messages live on.\n  Estonia has become a strong independent country since 1991 when it \nagain rid itself of Soviet occupation. It is a free-market economy and \nhas established a rule of law.\n  This year we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the refusal by the \nUnited States to recognize Soviet domination of the Baltic states. The \nrecognition of Estonia as free and independent is positive, but does \nnot go far enough. What we celebrate this year is what we must help to \npreserve next year and the year after that. We must be sure that \nEstonia, Lithuania, and Latvia are admitted into NATO as an unequivocal \nstatement of the West's support for Baltic freedom and independence.\n  Being the son of a Lithuanian immigrant myself, I take great pride in \nthe accomplishments of the Baltic states. I support admitting the \nBaltic states into NATO and I hope my colleagues here in the Senate \nwill support their entry also in the next round of NATO expansion.\n  That debate we will save for another day, but I am sure all of my \ncolleagues can agree on the importance of Estonia's struggle for \nfreedom and independence, and will join me in congratulating Estonia on \nthe 80th anniversary of Victory Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5733-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5733-S5734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE BOSTON CELTICS' ``HEROES AMONG US'' AWARD\n\n Mr. KENNEDY.

What they all have in common is the \nextraordinary contributions they have made to our community. They are \nrole models for us all. They demonstrate the fundamental importance of \nthe individual in our society, by proving that each person can truly \nmake a difference. All of these heroes saw a need to achieve change or \ntake other action in order to improve the lives of others.\n  This past season was the third season in a row that the Boston \nCeltics have honored one or more these heroes at home games for the \nspecial contributions they have made to our society. In those three \nseasons, the Celtics have honored 114 men and women with the ``Heroes \nAmong Us'' Award, which is one of many programs that the Boston Celtics \nCharitable Foundation has initiated. The Foundation is dedicated to \nimproving the lives of the youths of New England through innovative \noutreach initiatives. The Boston Celtic\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nplayers actively participate in these programs in many ways--from \nwashing cars, to raising funds for books for the Boston Public Schools, \nto cleaning up sites for the development of homes for low and middle \nincome families in Boston.\n  I commend the Celtics for their commitment to improving the quality \nof life for the members of our community, and I commend all of these \n``Heroes Among Us'' for their dedication and their inspiring \nleadership.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat a deduction equal to fair market values shall be allowed for \ncharitable contributions of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly \ncompositions created by the donor; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     artist-museum partnership act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the \n``Artist-Museum Partnership Act,'' which would encourage the donation \nof original works by artists, writers and composers to museums and \nother public institutions, thus ensuring the preservation of these \nworks for future generations. This bill would achieve this by restoring \ntax equity for artists. Artists who donate their self-created works, \nlike art collectors who donate identical pieces, would be allowed to \ntake a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the work.\n  Under current law, art collectors who donate works to qualified \ncharitable institutions may take a tax deduction equal to the fair \nmarket value of the work. This serves as a powerful and effective \nincentive for collectors to donate works to public museums, galleries, \nlibraries, colleges and other institutions rather than keep them hidden \nfrom the public eye. Unfortunately, artists who create those same works \nmay not take such a deduction. Instead, artists may only deduct the \nmaterial cost of the work which is, in most cases, a nominal amount. \nThis is simply unfair to artists in Vermont, and artists across the \nnation, who want to donate their works for posterity.\n  Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a \ndeduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work, but Congress \nchanged the law with respect to artists in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. \nSince then, fewer and fewer artists have donated their works to museums \nand cultural institutions. The sharp decline in donations to the \nLibrary of Congress clearly illustrates this point. Until 1969, the \nLibrary of Congress received 15 to 20 large gifts of manuscripts from \nauthors each year. In the four years following the elimination of the \ndeduction, the library received only one gift. Instead, many of these \nworks have been sold to private collectors, and are no longer available \nto the general public.\n  For example, prior to the enactment of the 1969 law, Igor Stravinsky \nplanned to donate his papers to the Music Division of the Library of \nCongress. But after the law passed, his papers were sold instead to a \nprivate foundation in Switzerland. We can no longer afford this massive \nloss to our cultural heritage. This loss was an unintended consequence \nof the tax bill that should now be corrected.\n  Over thirty years ago, Congress changed the law for artists in \nresponse to the perception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of \nthe law by inflating the market value of self-created works. Since that \ntime, however, the government has cut down significantly on the abuse \nof fair market value determinations. Under this legislation, artists \nwho donate their own paintings, manuscripts, compositions, or scholarly \ncompositions, would be subject to the same new rules that all taxpayer/\ncollectors who donate such works must now follow. This includes \nproviding relevant information as to the value of the gift, providing \nappraisals by qualified appraisers, and, in some cases, subjecting them \nto review by the Internal Revenue Service's Art Advisory Panel.\n  In addition, donated works must be accepted by museums and libraries, \nwhich often have strict criteria in place for works they intend to \ndisplay. The institution must also certify that it intends to put the \nwork to a use that is related to the institution's tax exempt status. \nFor example, a painting contributed to an educational institution must \nbe used by that organization for educational purposes. It could not be \nsold by the institution for profit. Similarly, a work could not be \ndonated to a hospital or other charitable institution, that did not \nintend to use the work in a manner related to the function constituting \nthe donee's exemption under section 501 of the tax code. Finally, the \nfair market value of the work could only be deducted from the portion \nof the artist's income that has come from the sale of similar works, or \nrelated activities.\n  In addition to restoring tax equity for artists and collectors, this \nbill would also correct another disparity in the tax treatment of self-\ncreated works--the difference between how the same work is treated \nbefore and after\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\nan artist's death. While artists may only deduct the material costs of \ndonations made during their lifetime, donations of those same works \nafter death are deductible from estate taxes at the fair market value \nof the work. In addition, when an artist dies, works that are part of \nhis or her estate are taxed on the fair market value.\n  The time has come for us to correct an unintended consequence of the \n1969 bill and encourage rather than discourage the donations of art \nworks by their creators. The public benefit to the nation, when artists \nare encouraged to contribute their works during their lifetimes, cannot \nbe overemphasized. It allows historians, scholars, and the public to \nlearn directly from the artist about his or her work. From artists \nthemselves, we can learn how a work was intended to be displayed or \ninterpreted and what influences affected the artist.\n  In Vermont, we were lucky enough to have Sabra Field, a well known \nartist who has been creating wood block prints for the past 40 years, \ndonate over 500 of her own original prints to Middlebury College, at \ntheir behest. With those prints, Middlebury will establish the Sabra \nField Collection so that students of the college as well as Vermonters \nand visitors to our state will be able to view her original works on \ndisplay. We Vermonters owe her our thanks for her incredible \ngenerosity. Under current law, Ms. Field, whose prints have sold for up \nto $4,000 on the market, was unable to deduct the fair market value of \nthe donated works from her taxes, as a collector of those same works \nwould have been able to. In that instance, the public's gain was Ms. \nField's loss. This legislation would create a win-win situation for \nall.\n  The Senate recently recognized the importance of the arts in our \nchildren's education when it passed a resolution designating March 2000 \nas ``Arts Education Month.'' The Artist-Museum Partnership Act could \nmake a critical difference in an artist's decision to donate his or her \nwork, rather than sell it to a private party, where it may become lost \nto the public forever. I cannot think of a better way to enhance arts \neducation than to encourage the donation of art works by living \nartists, a few of whom we are lucky enough to have in Vermont, to \npublic institutions across the nation.\n  I want to thank my colleagues Mr. Bennett and Mr. Lieberman for \ncosponsoring this bipartisan legislation. Mr. President, I would also \nlike to submit to the record a letter from the Association of Art \nMuseum Directors, in support of this bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                Association of Art\n\n\n                                             Museum Directors,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2000.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert Bennett,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Bennett. On behalf of the \n     Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD), I thank you for \n     introducing legislation that would allow artists, composers \n     and writers to take a deduction of the fair-market value of a \n     contribution of their own work to a charitable institution.\n       As a result of changes to the tax code in 1969, visual \n     artists, writers and composers can no longer take a deduction \n     based on the fair-market value of a contribution of their own \n     work to a charitable organization. The artists' deduction is \n     limited to the cost of materials in preparing a work--in the \n     case of a visual artist, canvas and paint. However, a \n     collector, making an identical donation, may take the fair \n     market value of the work. Also, once the artist dies, his or \n     her spouse may contribute the work and use the fair-market \n     value as the basis of the donation.\n       As a result, contributions to museums and libraries by \n     living artists and writers have all but disappeared in the \n     last 30 years, depriving the public of access to its cultural \n     heritage, since many of the pieces are sold abroad or into \n     private collections and never seen again. If instead the \n     works were contributed to a charitable institution, the \n     artists could, while still alive, provide interpretations and \n     insights that would be of enormous benefit to the public in \n     understanding 20th century art.\n       Artists like Chuck Close and Sam Gilliam who have achieved \n     a considerable degree of success, would be more willing to \n     share their work with the public through donations to major \n     institutions. However, the benefits of the proposed \n     legislation would not be limited to major artists and \n     institutions.\n       Many smaller museums would benefit from contributions by \n     local artists in the community who could be important in \n     documenting geographic, ethnic, religious or regional \n     examples of art.\n       The AAMD, which was founded in 1916 and represents 170 art \n     museums nationwide, fully supports the enactment of this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Millicent Hall Gaudieri,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Byrd):\n  S. 2782. A bill to establish a commission to examine the efficacy of \nthe organization of the National Nuclear Security Administration and \nthe appropriate organization to manage the nuclear weapons programs of \nthe United States; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                national commission on nuclear security\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this legislation on behalf of myself and \nSenator Byrd, believe would establish a commission to examine the \nDepartment of Energy; National Security programs, which I believe will \nhelp restore the trust of the American people in the nuclear weapons \nprograms of the United States.\n  Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, the Nation learned that two identical \ncomputer hard drives, containing highly classified nuclear weapons \ninformation, were missing at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. These \ncomputer discs are used by the Department of Energy's Nuclear Emergency \nSearch Team (known as NEST) to respond to incidents of nuclear \nterrorism or other nuclear incidents.\n  The Committee on Armed Services held a hearing, in both open and \nclosed session, earlier this week to hear from the Secretary of Energy \non this matter. I must tell my colleagues that I was not satisfied with \nall the answers provided by the Secretary during that hearing.\n  Sadly, this most recent incident is just one more potentially \ncatastrophic security failure in a series of security failures at our \nimportant nuclear weapons labs. I need not remind my colleagues that it \nwas just one year ago this week that Congress was in the midst of an \nintensive investigation into allegations of Chinese espionage at these \nvery same Department of Energy labs.\n  Under the Rules of the Senate, the Committee on Armed Services is \nresponsible for ``the national security aspects of nuclear energy,'' \nwhich includes the DOE nuclear weapons labs. We take this \nresponsibility very seriously.\n  That is why, today, I and Senator Byrd are sending to the desk a bill \nto establish a congressional commission--with commissioners to be \nappointed solely by the leadership of the Congress--to examine the \nefficacy of the current structure of DOE and to make recommendations to \nthe Congress on whether the Department of Energy's national security \nprograms--particularly nuclear weapons programs--should remain as a \nsemiautonomous agency within the Department of Energy, or be moved to \nthe Department of Defense, or possibly be established as an independent \nagency, as was the case with the Atomic Energy Commission.\n  Let me be clear, this commission will not re-examine or make \nrecommendations regarding the internal structure of the NNSA, which was \nthoroughly reviewed and debated during the National Defense \nAuthorization Conference last year. Nor will it hinder the new NNSA \nAdministrator's efforts to fully establish his new agency. I am \nconfident that, under General John Gordon's leadership, the internal \nstructure of the NNSA will be sound. To the contrary, the existence of \nthe commission will act as a safeguard against those who would seek to \nimpede General Gordon in carrying out his statutory missions.\n  There is no higher calling--of any Member of this body or any \nPresident--than to protect this great Nation from the threats from \nnuclear weapons.\n  It is my intent to require this commission to report back to Congress \nin May of next year, to capture both the current and the forthcoming \nAdministrations' views on where these programs should reside.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2782\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE DELIVERY OF \n                   EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The State of New Jersey developed and implemented a \n     unique 2-tiered emergency medical services system nearly 25 \n     years ago as a result of studies conducted in New Jersey \n     about the best way to provide services to State residents.\n       (2) The 2-tiered system established in New Jersey includes \n     volunteer and for-profit emergency medical technicians who \n     provide basic life support and hospital-based paramedics who \n     provide advanced life support.\n       (3) The New Jersey system has provided universal access for \n     all New Jersey residents to affordable emergency services, \n     while simultaneously ensuring that those persons in need of \n     the most advanced care receive such care from the proper \n     authorities.\n       (4) The New Jersey system currently has an estimated 20,000 \n     emergency medical technicians providing ambulance \n     transportation for basic life support and advanced life \n     support emergencies, over 80 percent of which are handled by \n     volunteers who are not reimbursed under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.\n       (5) The hospital-based paramedics, also known as mobile \n     intensive care units, are reimbursed under the medicare \n     program when they respond to advanced life support \n     emergencies.\n       (6) The New Jersey system saves the lives of thousands of \n     New Jersey residents each year, while saving the medicare \n     program an estimated $39,000,000 in reimbursement fees.\n       (7) When Congress requested that the Health Care Financing \n     Administration enact changes to the emergency medical \n     services fee schedule as a result of the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1997, including a general overhaul of reimbursement rates \n     and administrative costs, it was in the spirit of \n     streamlining the agency, controlling skyrocketing health care \n     costs, and lengthening the solvency of the medicare program.\n       (8) The Health Care Financing Administration is considering \n     implementing new emergency medical services reimbursement \n     guidelines that would destabilize or eliminate the 2-tier \n     system that has developed in the State of New Jersey.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Health Care Financing Administration should--\n       (1) consider the unique nature of the emergency medical \n     services delivery system in New Jersey when implementing new \n     reimbursement guidelines for paramedics and hospitals under \n     the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act; and\n       (2) promote innovative emergency medical service systems \n     enacted by States that reduce reimbursement costs to the \n     medicare program while ensuring that all residents receive \n     quick and appropriate emergency care when needed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       EDWARDS AMENDMENT NO. 3613\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. EDWARDS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, H.R. 4577, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 27, line 24, before the period insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That of the $33,750,168 made \n     available under this heading for syphilis and chlamydia \n     elimination, not less than 70 percent of the amount by which \n     such $33,750,168 is in excess of the amount made available \n     for such purposes for fiscal year 2000 shall be used to \n     implement the National Plan to Eliminate Syphilis''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BAYH AMENDMENT NO. 3614\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BAYH submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill, H.R. 4577, supra; as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 53, strike line 12 and all that follows \n     through line 10 on page 54.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 3615\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI (for Mr. Lott) submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by him to the bill, H.R. 4577, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Energy Security and \n     Federal Fuels Tax Relief Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) increasing dependence on foreign sources of oil causes \n     systemic harm to all sectors of the domestic United States \n     economy, threatens national security, undermines the ability \n     of federal, state, and local units of government to provide \n     essential services, and jeopardizes the peace, security, and \n     welfare of the American people;\n       (2) dependence on imports of foreign oil was 46 percent in \n     1992, but has risen to more than 55 percent by the beginning \n     of 2000, and is estimated by the Department of Energy to rise \n     to 65 percent by 2020 unless current policies are altered;\n       (3) at the same time, despite increased energy \n     efficiencies, energy use in the United States is expected to \n     increase 27 percent by 2020.\n       (4) the United States lacks a comprehensive national energy \n     policy and has taken actions that limit the availability and \n     capability of the domestic energy sources of oil and gas, \n     coal, nuclear and hydro;\n       (5) a comprehensive energy strategy needs to be developed \n     to combat this trend, decrease the United States dependence \n     on imported oil supplies and strengthen our national energy \n     security;\n       (6) the goal of this comprehensive strategy must be to \n     decrease the United States dependence on foreign oil supplies \n     to not more than 50 percent by the year 2010;\n       (7) in order to meet this goal, this comprehensive energy \n     strategy needs to be multi-faceted and include enhancing the \n     use of renewable energy resources (including hydro, nuclear, \n     solar, wind, and biomass), conserving energy resources \n     (including improving energy efficiencies), and increasing \n     domestic supplies of nonrenewable resources (including oil, \n     natural gas, and coal);\n       (8) however, conservation efforts and alternative fuels \n     alone will not enable America to meet this goal as \n     conventional energy sources supply 96 percent of America's \n     power at this time; and\n       (9) immediate actions also need to be taken in order to \n     mitigate the effect of recent increases in oil prices on the \n     American consumer, including the poor and the elderly.\n       (b) Purposes.--This purposes of this Act are to protect the \n     energy security of the United States by decreasing America's \n     dependency of foreign oil sources to not more than 50 percent \n     by the year 2010 by enhancing the use of renewable energy \n     resources,\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\n     conserving energy resources (including improving energy \n     efficiencies), and increasing domestic energy supplies and to \n     mitigate the immediate effect of increases in energy prices \n     on the American consumer, including the poor and the elderly.\n\n  TITLE I--ENERGY SECURITY ACTIONS REQUIRED OF THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY\n\n     SEC. 101. ANNUAL REPORT ON UNITED STATES ENERGY INDEPENDENCE.\n\n       (a) Report.--Beginning on October 1, 2000, and annually \n     thereafter, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Defense and the heads of other Federal agencies, \n     shall submit a report to the President and the Congress which \n     evaluates the progress the United States has made toward \n     obtaining the goal of not more than 50 percent dependence on \n     foreign oil sources by 2010. The Secretary shall adopt as \n     interim goals, a reduction in dependence on oil imports to \n     not more than 54 percent by 2005 and 52 percent by 2008.\n       (b) Alternatives.--The report shall specify what specific \n     legislation or administrative actions must be implemented to \n     meet this goal and set forth a range of options and \n     alternatives with a benefit/cost analysis for each option or \n     alternative together with an estimate for the contribution \n     that each option or alternative could make to reduce foreign \n     oil imports.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Zimbabwe Democracy Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Deliberate and systematic violence, intimidation, and \n     killings have been orchestrated and supported by the \n     Government of Zimbabwe and the ruling ZANU-PF party against \n     members, sympathizers, and supporters of the democratic \n     opposition, farmers, and employees. The violence has resulted \n     in death, a breakdown in the rule of law, and further \n     collapse of Zimbabwe's economy.\n       (2) The lawlessness, harassment, violence, intimidation, \n     and killings directed at the opposition and their supporters, \n     farmers and farm employees continues at President Mugabe's \n     explicit and public urging despite two court rulings that the \n     occupations are illegal and must be ended.\n       (3) The breakdown in the rule of law has jeopardized \n     Zimbabwe's future, including international support for \n     programs which provide land ownership for the large number of \n     poor and landless Zimbabweans, other donor programs, economic \n     stability, and direct investment.\n       (4) The orchestrated violence and intimidation directed at \n     opposition supporters has created and fostered an environment \n     which seriously compromises the possibility of free and fair \n     elections.\n       (5) The crisis in Zimbabwe is further exacerbated by the \n     fact that Zimbabwe is spending millions of dollars each month \n     on its involvement in the civil war in the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo. Those resources could finance equitable \n     and transparent land reform, other programs to promote \n     economic growth and alleviate poverty, and programs to combat \n     the spread and effects of the world's highest HIV infection \n     rate.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is therefore the policy of the \n     United States to support the people of Zimbabwe in their \n     struggles to effect peaceful, democratic change, achieve \n     broad-based and equitable economic growth, and restore the \n     rule of law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FLOYD POST OFFICE\n\n  The bill (H.R. 3018) to designate certain facilities of the United \nStates Postal Service in South Carolina was considered, read a third \ntime, and passed.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \ntoday to pay tribute to the late Keith Olgesby, who is being honored \ntoday through the passage of H.R. 2952, which redesignates the facility \nof the United States Postal Service located at 100 Orchard Park Drive \nin Greenville, South Carolina, as the ``Keith D. Oglesby Station.''\n  Mr. Keith Olgesby deserves this honor which this legislation bestows. \nThe tragic and unexpected death of Mr. Oglesby last year shocked and \nsaddened the community of Greenville. Postal employees, his peers, and \ncustomers have requested that Mr. Oglesby be remembered in the \nGreenville community by the designation of this U.S. Post Office in his \nname. I believe that this legislation honors his life as a public \nservant for his community and State.\n  Mr. Oglesby contributed much to the improvement of the Greenville \ncommunity and the State of South Carolina. He was the Postmaster of \nGreenville County for six years. During his lifetime and posthumously, \nhe was awarded twice the Postal Service's top public relations honor, \nthe Benjamin Award, given in recognition of community outreach \naccomplishments.\n  Among his many community service activities, Mr. Oglesby hosted the \nFirst Day of Issue ceremonies for the Organ & Tissue Donation Stamp. He \nvolunteered with the Salvation Army, the March of Dimes Walk America, \nand the American Cancer Society Relay for Life. He was a tireless \nworker and community activist. He was also honored\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\nas Volunteer of the Year in 1997 by the Greenville Family Partnership \n(an organization which aims to keep children safe and drug free).\n  I believe that Mr. Keith Oglesby deserves this honor which this \nlegislation bestows as he was a public servant who will always be \nremembered in his community and the State of South Carolina where he \nhonorably lived and served.\n  Mr. President, I also note today the passage of H.R. 3018, which \ndesignates various Postal facilities in South Carolina. These \nfacilities are the United States Post Office located at 301 Main Street \nin Eastover, South Carolina, as the ``Layford R. Johnson Post Office''; \nthe United States Post Office located at 78 Sycamore Street in \nCharleston, South Carolina, as the ``Richard E. Fields Post Office''; \nthe United States Post Office located at 557 East Bay Street in \nCharleston South Carolina, as the ``Marybelle Howe Post Office''; and \nthe United States Post Office located at 4026 Lamar Street in (the Eau \nClaire community of) Columbia, South Carolina, as the ``Mamie G. Floyd \nPost Office.''

Mr. President, it is my understanding that USAID obligates \nmost of its money for Zimbabwe through agreements with the Government \nof Zimbabwe. Notwithstanding this obligation procedure, it is my \nintention that the prohibition on assistance for the Government of \nZimbabwe not cut off all assistance to Zimbabwe but only that \nassistance that would otherwise have been provided for the benefit of \nthe government. Under the limitation contained in my amendment, \nassistance provided through nongovernmental organizations may continue, \neven though the initial obligation of funds may have been with the \ngovernment. Such assistance may only marginally benefit the government \nthrough, for example, the necessary use of providing assistance to the \npeople of Zimbabwe. This has particular relevance to microenterprise \nprograms which, I believe, would not be affected by the limitations in \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Zimbabwe Democracy Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Deliberate and systematic violence, intimidation, and \n     killings have been orchestrated and supported by the \n     Government of Zimbabwe and the ruling ZANU-PF party against \n     members, sympathizers, and supporters of the democratic \n     opposition, farmers, and employees. The violence has resulted \n     in death, a breakdown in the rule of law, and further \n     collapse of Zimbabwe's economy.\n       (2) The lawlessness, harassment, violence, intimidation, \n     and killings directed at the opposition and their supporters, \n     farmers and farm employees continues at President Mugabe's \n     explicit and public urging despite two court rulings that the \n     occupations are illegal and must be ended.\n       (3) The breakdown in the rule of law has jeopardized \n     Zimbabwe's future, including international support for \n     programs which provide land ownership for the large number of \n     poor and landless Zimbabweans, other donor programs, economic \n     stability, and direct investment.\n       (4) The orchestrated violence and intimidation directed at \n     opposition supporters has created and fostered an environment \n     which seriously compromises the possibility of free and fair \n     elections.\n       (5) The crisis in Zimbabwe is further exacerbated by the \n     fact that Zimbabwe is spending millions of dollars each month \n     on its involvement in the civil war in the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo. Those resources could finance equitable \n     and transparent land reform, other programs to promote \n     economic growth and alleviate poverty, and programs to combat \n     the spread and effects of the world's highest HIV infection \n     rate.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is therefore the policy of the \n     United States to support the people of Zimbabwe in their \n     struggles to effect peaceful, democratic change, achieve \n     broad-based and equitable economic growth, and restore the \n     rule of law.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE OR DEBT \n                   RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Assistance.--Except as provided in \n     subsection (b)--\n       (1) no United States assistance may be provided for the \n     Government of Zimbabwe;\n       (2) no indebtedness owed by the Government of Zimbabwe to \n     the United States Government may be canceled or reduced; and\n       (3) the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United \n     States Executive Director to each international financial \n     institution to oppose and vote against--\n       (A) any extension by the respective institution of any \n     assistance of any kind to the Government of Zimbabwe, except \n     for assistance to meet basic human needs and for good \n     governance; and\n       (B) any cancellation or reduction of indebtedness owed by \n     the Government of Zimbabwe to that institution.\n       (b) Conditions for Restoration of Eligibility for \n     Assistance and Debt Relief.--The provisions of subsection (a) \n     shall apply until the President certifies to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that--\n       (1) the rule of law has been restored in Zimbabwe, \n     including respect for ownership and title to property held \n     prior to January 1, 2000, freedom of speech and association, \n     and an end to the lawlessness, violence, and intimidation \n     sponsored, condoned, or tolerated by the Government of \n     Zimbabwe, the ruling party, and their supporters or entities;\n       (2) Zimbabwe has held parliamentary elections which are \n     widely accepted by the participating parties and the duly \n     elected are free to assume their offices;\n       (3)(A) Zimbabwe has held a presidential election which is \n     widely accepted by the participating parties and the \n     president-elect is free to assume the duties of the office; \n     or\n       (B) the government has sufficiently improved the pre-\n     election environment to a degree consistent with accepted \n     international standards for security and freedom of movement \n     and association;\n       (4) the Government of Zimbabwe has demonstrated a \n     commitment to an equitable, legal, and transparent land \n     reform program which should--\n       (A) respect existing ownership of and title to property by \n     providing fair, market-based compensation to sellers;\n       (B) benefit the truly needy and landless;\n       (C) be based on the principle of ownership and title to all \n     land, including communal areas;\n       (D) be managed and administered by an independent, \n     nongovernmental body; and\n       (E) be consistent with agreements reached at the \n     International Donors' Conference on Land Reform and \n     Resettlement in Zimbabwe held in Harare in September, 1998;\n       (5) the Government of Zimbabwe is making a good faith \n     effort to fulfill the terms of the Lusaka agreement on ending \n     the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and\n       (6) the Zimbabwean Armed Forces and the National Police of \n     Zimbabwe are responsible to and serve the elected civilian \n     government.\n       (c) United States Assistance Defined.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), in \n     this section, the term ``United States assistance'' means--\n       (A) any assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (excluding programs under title IV of chapter 2 of part I, \n     relating to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation);\n       (B) sales, or financing on any terms, under the Arms Export \n     Control Act;\n       (C) the licensing of exports under section 38 of the Arms \n     Export Control Act; and\n       (D) the provision of agricultural commodities, other than \n     food, under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance \n     Act of 1954.\n       (2) Exceptions.--The term ``United States assistance'' does \n     not include--\n       (A) humanitarian assistance, including food, medicine, \n     medical supplies;\n       (B) health assistance, including health assistance for the \n     prevention, treatment, and control of HIV/AIDS and other \n     infectious diseases;\n       (C) support for democratic governance and the rule of law;\n       (D) support for land reform programs consistent with \n     subsection (b)(4);\n       (E) support for conservation programs; and\n       (F) support for de-mining programs.\n       (d) Waiver.--The President may waive the provisions of \n     subsection (a) if he determines that it is in the national \n     interest of the United States to do so.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I think it would be appropriate at this \nmoment for me to say that this Presiding Officer, Senator Pat Roberts, \nis one of the best among the Presiding Officers in the Senate today. He \npays attention to what is going on on the floor. Even though there may \nnot be much going on, he is alert to what is happening on the floor.\n  This is the premier upper Chamber in the world today. There are 61 \nnations in the world that have bicameral legislative bodies today. All \nthe others have unicameral legislative bodies. But the U.S. Senate and \nthe Italian Senate are the only bicameral legislative bodies in the \nworld today in which the upper Chamber is not dominated by the lower \nChamber.\n  It is so important that this Senate be seen as a model, as a Senate \nin which there is decorum and order, a Senate which reveres the Chair \nand respects the Chair. This is one reason why I have been, of late, \nurging the Chair to maintain order in the well of the Senate. Now, 59 \nSenators out of 100 Senators today came to this body after I was \nmajority leader of the Senate. Almost 60 percent of the Senators here \ntoday were not Members of this body when I was last majority leader of \nthe body.\n  Now, what I look upon as some disorder in the Senate is when Senators \nget into the well and mill around. It really looks like the floor of \nthe stock exchange, and it does not bring credit upon the Senate. I am \nsure that many senates throughout the States of this Nation look at \nthis Senate as the model, look at this Senate as the body from which \nall senates should learn. But I fear that they see just the opposite.\n  I have been in the State legislature in my own State, and I have been \nin both houses. I have to say, frankly, that the decorum, the order \nwithin the House of Delegates in West Virginia and in the West Virginia \nSenate is far more to be desired than we find in that U.S. Senate. This \nis a situation that has really developed only during the last 10 or 12 \nyears. I am sure that as the 59 out of the 100 Senators who came here \nfollowing my last turn at the wheel as majority leader see this \ndisorder in the Senate, where so many Senators gather in the well and \nthey talk and they laugh and make a great deal of noise, these newest \nSenators probably believe that is the way it has always been. They may \nbelieve that is just normal for the Senate. But it is not.\n  I cannot imagine Senator Wallace Bennett, Senator George Aiken, \nSenator Norris Cotton, Senator Everett Dirksen, Senator Richard \nRussell, Senator Stuart Symington, Senator John Pastore, or Senator \nJoseph O'Mahoney going into the well. These were the Senators who were \nin this body when I came here. Senators didn't go down into the well \nand mill around in those days. Oh, they walked through the well, or \nthey might walk up to the table and ask something about the vote, or \nthey might walk up to the Parliamentarian and make some inquiry; but \nthey didn't gather in the well and carry on long conversations. They \nsat in their seats. Most of them knew how they were going to vote \nbefore they came to the floor. They had already been advised by their \nstaffs or they studied the legislation. So they didn't go into the \nwell. I think that looks bad upon the Senate.\n\n  I don't think the Senate sets a good example when we are so oblivious \nto how the Senate appears to the people who are watching their \ntelevisions sets or to the people in the galleries. Hundreds of \nthousands of people come to Washington every year, and many of them sit \nin the Senate galleries and watch the Senate. I wonder what is going \nthrough their minds when they see these Senators come in here and \ngather in the well and carry on loud conversations. How different it is \nwhen Senators, upon occasion, sit in their seats. How very impressive \nit is when the U.S. Senate acts in accordance with the standing orders \nand rules of the Senate.\n  It is the duty of the Chair to maintain order in the Senate and, of \ncourse, when there is confusion that arises in the galleries, it is the \nduty of the Chair--without being asked from the floor, without a point \nof order being made from the floor--to maintain order and decorum in \nthe Senate.\n  I am trying to get the Senate to think about this and go back to the \nold ways, wherein Senators voted and then went to their chairs, or they \nvoted from their desks. There is a standing order of the Senate that \nrequires Senators to vote from their desks. I don't intend to be set-\njawed about it, and if Senators want to walk through the well to see \nwhat it is we are voting on, or if they want to vote from someplace \nother than their own desks, I have no quarrel with that. But I think \nthey ought to sit down. There are plenty of places where Senators can \nconverse. We can go to the respective Cloakrooms, or we can walk \noutside the Chamber. So it isn't that Senators are required to avoid \nspeaking to one another in the Chamber. We ought to be conscious that \nthis Senate is the model--or it should be.\n  I hope Senators will read what I have said. They see me insist on the \nwell's being cleared and they may think I am trying to run the Senate. \nOf course, I am not. I want people to revere the Senate and respect the \nSenate. If they respect this body, they will have more respect for the \nlaws that we enact.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time I have taken not \nbe charged against my request thus far.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator from Kansas who \nis a model Presiding Officer, and there are a few others in this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5757-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5757-S5758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING SENATOR DANIEL K. INOUYE AS RECIPIENT OF THE CONGRESSIONAL \n                             MEDAL OF HONOR\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the strength of this Nation lies in its \npeople. Throughout our Nation's history, American men and women have \nbeen called upon time and time again to serve the Nation in times of \nperil. These men and women, at great risk to themselves and without \nregard to their personal safety, have given their all for their \nCountry. These are the true heroes of America.\n  We have some of such heroes in this body who have given so very much \nfor their country--Senator Max Cleland,\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\nSenator Bob Kerrey; there are others. But today I speak of one such \nAmerican hero, our esteemed colleague, Daniel Inouye.\n  Like many others in this body, I have always thought of Senator \nInouye as a national hero. I know of his wartime heroics in France and \nItaly during World War II. I know of how he fought to protect the \ntroops with whom he served, without regard for his own life. Even \nthough gravely wounded, Lieutenant Daniel Inouye continued to fight, \nadvancing alone against a machine-gun nest that had his men pinned \ndown. I know that, upon returning home, Dan Inouye spent twenty months \nin Army hospitals after losing his right arm. He came home as a \nCaptain, with a Distinguished Service Cross, a Bronze Star, a Purple \nHeart with cluster, and twelve other medals and citations.\n  After receiving his law degree at George Washington University Law \nSchool, Danny broke into politics in 1954 with his election to the \nTerritorial House of Representatives. After Hawaii became a State on \nAugust 21, 1959, Danny Inouye won election to the United States House \nof Representatives as Hawaii's first Congressman, and was re-elected to \na full term in 1960. In 1962, he was elected to represent Hawaii in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  I am proud to say that I am one who voted for statehood on behalf of \nboth Alaska and Hawaii. I believe that I am the only Senator still \nserving here today who voted for statehood for both of these states. I \nam very proud of having done that. I believe that I am also one of only \nthree members of today's Senate who were here when Dan Inouye joined \nthis body in 1963.\n\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Danny Inouye on many, many \noccasions over the years. He is a man of utmost integrity, who works \ntirelessly on behalf of his constituents and on behalf of the Nation. \nHe is one Senator who was extremely supportive of me during my service \nas Majority Leader, as Minority Leader, as Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and now as the Committee's Ranking Member. He \nis a Senator on whom I have relied for truth, for integrity, for \nsteadfastness, for forthrightness, and as one who is highly dedicated \nto his work here in the Senate.\n  Danny Inouye is a man who is modest about his many accomplishments \nhere in the Senate, as well as his wartime heroics. He is not one to \ntalk much about those things. He is a quiet, self-effacing Senator. But \nwe are all aware of his great service to this Country throughout his \nadult life.\n\n  I am immensely proud of this outstanding American in our midst, and \nwe are deeply moved that, this week, Danny Inouye was awarded the \nhighest military honor that can be bestowed upon any American citizen--\nthe Congressional Medal of Honor. He has joined the ranks of the six \nother United States Senators who have received the Congressional Medal \nof Honor, namely, Senator Adelbert Ames of Mississippi, Senator Matthew \nS. Quay of Pennsylvania, Senator William J. Sewell of New Jersey, \nSenator Francis E. Warren of Wyoming, Senator Henry A. du Pont of \nDelaware, and Senator J. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska. Senator Inouye is \nthe only United States Senator in history to receive the Medal of Honor \nfor service in World War II.\n  A bit of verse comes to mind.\n\n       This I beheld, or dreamed it in a dream:\n       There spread a cloud of dust along a plain;\n       And underneath the cloud, or in it, raged\n       A furious battle, and men yelled, and swords\n       Shocked upon swords and shields.\n\n       A prince's banner\n       Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by foes.\n       A craven hung along the battle's edge\n       And thought, ``Had I a sword of keener steel--\n       That blue blade that the king's son bears--but this\n       Blunt thing!'' He snapt and flung it from his hand,\n       And lowering, crept away and left the field.\n\n       Then came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead,\n       And weaponless, and saw the broken sword,\n       Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,\n       And ran and snatched it; and with battle shout\n       Lifted afresh, he hewed his enemy down,\n       And saved a great cause that heroic day.\n\n  Danny Inouye has this same bravery as described of the king's son in \nEdward Rowland Sill's poem. Danny Inouye is the kind of man who sees \nbeyond the hilt-buried sword in the dry and trodden sand. He is a man \nwho sees opportunity in the worst of situations, rather than despair. \nAnd, seizing every opportunity to advance a good cause, he acts swiftly \nand courageously to meet adversity head-on.\n  I thank the Chair again, and express to Danny Inouye and his lovely \nwife, on behalf of my wife Erma and me, our congratulations, our best \nwishes, and our thankfulness to the Almighty for giving us two such \nwonderful friends--Senator and Mrs. Daniel Inouye.\n  I thank the people of Hawaii for repeatedly sending Danny Inouye to \nthe Senate.\n  I express this hope, and I am sure Daniel Inouye would say the same \nif he were here:\n  May God, the Almighty Creator, always watch over and keep the Senate \nof the United States, and may God always bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Kansas, I ask \nunanimous consent that the quorum call be dispensed with, and, without \nobjection it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5758-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5758-S5759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              URGING COMPLIANCE WITH THE HAGUE CONVENTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 293\n\n       Whereas the Department of State reports that at any given \n     time there are 1,000 open cases of American children either \n     abducted from the United States or wrongfully retained in a \n     foreign country;\n       Whereas many more cases of international child abductions \n     are not reported to the Department of State;\n       Whereas the situation has worsened since 1993, when \n     Congress estimated the number of American children abducted \n     from the United States and wrongfully retained in foreign \n     countries to be more than 10,000;\n       Whereas Congress has recognized the gravity of \n     international child abduction in enacting the International \n     Parental Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993 (18 U.S.C. 1204), the \n     Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (28 U.S.C. 1738a), and \n     substantial reform and reporting requirements for the \n     Department of State in the fiscal years 1998-1999 and 2000-\n     2001 Foreign Relations Authorization Acts;\n       Whereas the United States became a contracting party in \n     1988 to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of \n     International Child Abduction (in this concurrent resolution \n     referred to as the ``Hague Convention'') and adopted \n     effective implementing legislation in the International Child \n     Abduction Remedies Act (42 U.S.C. 11601 et seq.);\n       Whereas the Hague Convention establishes mutual rights and \n     duties between and among its contracting states to expedite \n     the return of children to the state of their habitual \n     residence, as well as to ensure that rights of custody and of \n     access under the laws of one contracting state are \n     effectively respected in other contracting states, without \n     consideration of the merits of any underlying child custody \n     dispute;\n       Whereas article 13 of the Hague Convention provides a \n     narrow exception to the requirement for prompt return of \n     children, which exception releases the requested state from \n     its obligation to return a child to the country of the \n     child's habitual residence if it is established that there is \n     a ``grave risk'' that the return would expose the child to \n     ``physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child \n     in an intolerable situation'' or ``if the child objects to \n     being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity \n     at which it is appropriate to take account of the child's \n     views'';\n       Whereas some contracting states, for example Germany, \n     routinely invoke article 13\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\n     as a justification for nonreturn, rather than resorting to it \n     in a small number of wholly exceptional cases;\n       Whereas the National Center for Missing and Exploited \n     Children (NCMEC), the only institution of its kind, was \n     established in the United States for the purpose of assisting \n     parents in recovering their missing children;\n       Whereas article 21 of the Hague Convention provides that \n     the central authorities of all parties to the Convention are \n     obligated to cooperate with each other in order to promote \n     the peaceful enjoyment of parental access rights and the \n     fulfillment of any conditions to which the exercise of such \n     rights may be subject, and to remove, as far as possible, all \n     obstacles to the exercise of such rights;\n       Whereas some contracting states fail to order or enforce \n     normal visitation rights for parents of abducted or \n     wrongfully retained children who have not been returned under \n     the terms of the Hague Convention; and\n       Whereas the routine invocation of the article 13 exception, \n     denial of parental visitation of children, and the failure by \n     several contracting parties, most notably Austria, Germany, \n     Honduras, Mexico, and Sweden, to fully implement the \n     Convention deprives the Hague Convention of the spirit of \n     mutual confidence upon which its success depends: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That Congress urges--\n       (1) all contracting parties to the Hague Convention, \n     particularly European civil law countries that consistently \n     violate the Hague Convention such as Austria, Germany and \n     Sweden, to comply fully with both the letter and spirit of \n     their international legal obligations under the Convention;\n       (2) all contracting parties to the Hague Convention to \n     ensure their compliance with the Hague Convention by enacting \n     effective implementing legislation and educating their \n     judicial and law enforcement authorities;\n       (3) all contracting parties to the Hague Convention to \n     honor their commitments and return abducted or wrongfully \n     retained children to their place of habitual residence \n     without reaching the merits of any underlying custody dispute \n     and ensure parental access rights by removing obstacles to \n     the exercise of such rights;\n       (4) the Secretary of State to disseminate to all Federal \n     and State courts the Department of State's annual report to \n     Congress on Hague Convention compliance and related matters;

Res. 303.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 303) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the treatment by the Russian Federation of \n     Andrei Babitsky, a Russian journalist working for Radio Free \n     Europe/Radio Liberty, which had been reported from the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations, with an amendment, as \n     follows:\n\n  [The parts of the resolution intended to be stricken are shown in \nboldface brackets and the parts of the resolution intended to be \ninserted are shown in italic.]\n\n                              S. Res. 303\n\n       Whereas Andrei Babitsky, an accomplished Russian journalist \n     working for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a United States \n     Government-funded broadcasting service, faces serious charges \n     in Russia after being held captive and beaten by Russian \n     authorities;\n       Whereas the mission of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's \n     bureaus in Russia is to provide Russian listeners objective \n     and uncensored reporting on developments in Russia and around \n     the world;\n       Whereas Russian authorities repeatedly denounced Mr. \n     Babitsky for his reporting on the war in Chechnya, including \n     his documentation of Russian troop casualties and the Russian \n     Federation's brutal treatment of Chechen civilians;\n       Whereas Senate Resolutions 223 and 262 of the One Hundred \n     Sixth Congress condemning the violence in Chechnya and urging \n     a peaceful resolution to the conflict were adopted by the \n     Senate by unanimous consent on November 19, 1999, and \n     February 24, 2000, respectively;\n       Whereas on January 16, Mr. Babitsky was arrested by Russian \n     police in the Chechen battle zone, was accused of assisting \n     the Chechen forces, and was told he was to stand trial in \n     Moscow;\n       Whereas Russian authorities took Mr. Babitsky to a \n     ``filtration camp'' for suspected Chechen collaborators where \n     he was severely beaten and then transferred to an undisclosed \n     location;\n       Whereas on February 3, the Government of the Russian \n     Federation announced that it had traded Mr. Babitsky to \n     Chechen units in exchange for Russian prisoners, a violation \n     of the Geneva Conventions to which Russia is a party;\n       Whereas on February 25, Mr. Babitsky was released by his \n     captors in the Republic of Dagestan, only to be jailed by \n     Russian officials for carrying false identity papers;\n       Whereas Mr. Babitsky says the papers were forced on him by \n     his captors and used to smuggle him across borders;\n       Whereas Mr. Babitsky now faces charges from the Government \n     of the Russian Federation of collaborating with the Chechens \n     and carrying false identity papers and is not allowed to \n     leave the city of Moscow;\n       Whereas on February 25, a senior advisor in Russia's \n     Foreign Ministry published an article in The Moscow Times \n     entitled ``Should Liberty Leave?'', which condemned the \n     coverage by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty of the war in \n     Chechnya, particularly reporting by Radio Free Europe/Radio \n     Liberty correspondent Andrei Babitsky, and which stated that \n     it would ``be better to close down the branches of Radio \n     Liberty on Russian territory'';\n       Whereas on March 13, the Russian Ministry of the Press \n     ordered Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Moscow Bureau to \n     provide complete recordings of broadcasts between February 15 \n     and March 15, an action that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty \n     described as ``designed to intimidate us and others'';\n       Whereas on March 14, the Russian Ministry of the Press \n     issued a directive to prevent the broadcast of interviews \n     from Chechen resistance leaders, an act of censorship which \n     undercuts the ability of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to \n     fulfill its responsibilities as an objective news \n     organization;\n       Whereas the treatment of Mr. Babitsky intimidates other \n     correspondents working in Russia, particularly those covering \n     the tragic story unfolding in Chechnya;\n       Whereas Russia's evolution into a stable democracy requires \n     a free and vibrant press; and\n       Whereas it is imperative that the United States Government \n     respond vigorously to the harassment and intimidation of \n     Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, [That the Senate--\n       [(1) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to drop \n     its charges against Mr. Babitsky;\n       [(2) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     provide a full accounting of Mr. Babitsky's detention;\n       [(3) condemns the Russian Federation's harassment and \n     intimidation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and other \n     news organizations;\n       [(4) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     adhere fully to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \n     which declares in Article 19 that ``everyone has the right to \n     freedom of opinion and expression;

Mr. President, this resolution, S. Res. 303, which I \nintroduced with Senator Grams and Senator Leahy on May 4, expresses our \ndeep concern about the continuing plight of the Russian journalist \nAndrei Babitsky. The resolution was approved unanimously by the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee on June 7.\n  Mr. Babitsky, an accomplished journalist working for Radio Free \nEurope/Radio Liberty, still faces serious charges in Russia after being \nheld captive by Russian authorities, beaten, and detained in a \n``filtration camp'' for suspected Chechen collaborators.\n  The resolution asks the Russian Government to drop its trumped-up \ncharges against Mr. Babitsky, and provide a full accounting of his \ndetention.\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\n  In addition, the resolution states that the Senate condemns \nharassment and intimidation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and \nother news organizations. It calls upon the Russian Government to \nadhere fully to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which calls \nfor freedom of expression worldwide.\n  For 10 years, Mr. Babitsky has helped fulfill the mission of Radio \nFree Europe/Radio Liberty to provide Russian listeners with objective \nand uncensored reporting. But Russian authorities, displeased with Mr. \nBabitsky's courageous reporting on the war in Chechnya, accused him of \nassisting the Chechen forces and ordered him arrested in the battle \nzone last January.\n  After six weeks in captivity, Mr. Babitsky was released, and then \njailed again by Russian officials for carrying false identity papers. \nHe says the papers were forced upon him. After an international outcry \narose over his case, he was again released. But he still is not allowed \nto leave Moscow, and he still faces charges for carrying false papers \nand aiding the Chechens.\n  In addition, Russian authorities have continued to condemn Radio \nLiberty's coverage of the Chechen conflict, and have suggested that \nRadio Liberty should be forced to abandon its facilities in Moscow and \nthroughout Russia. The authorities have taken steps to censor Radio \nLiberty and to intimidate its correspondents and others.\n  The United States should respond vigorously to this harassment and \nintimidation. The Russian government should drop its trumped-up charges \nagainst Mr. Babitsky. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Kansas, I ask \nunanimous consent that the committee amendment be agreed to, and, \nwithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 303), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 303\n\n       Whereas Andrei Babitsky, an accomplished Russian journalist \n     working for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a United States \n     Government-funded broadcasting service, faces serious charges \n     in Russia after being held captive and beaten by Russian \n     authorities;\n       Whereas the mission of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's \n     bureaus in Russia is to provide Russian listeners objective \n     and uncensored reporting on developments in Russia and around \n     the world;\n       Whereas Russian authorities repeatedly denounced Mr. \n     Babitsky for his reporting on the war in Chechnya, including \n     his documentation of Russian troop casualties and the Russian \n     Federation's brutal treatment of Chechen civilians;\n       Whereas Senate Resolutions 223 and 262 of the One Hundred \n     Sixth Congress condemning the violence in Chechnya and urging \n     a peaceful resolution to the conflict were adopted by the \n     Senate by unanimous consent on November 19, 1999, and \n     February 24, 2000, respectively;\n       Whereas on January 16, Mr. Babitsky was arrested by Russian \n     police in the Chechen battle zone, was accused of assisting \n     the Chechen forces, and was told he was to stand trial in \n     Moscow;\n       Whereas Russian authorities took Mr. Babitsky to a \n     ``filtration camp'' for suspected Chechen collaborators where \n     he was severely beaten and then transferred to an undisclosed \n     location;\n       Whereas on February 3, the Government of the Russian \n     Federation announced that it had traded Mr. Babitsky to \n     Chechen units in exchange for Russian prisoners, a violation \n     of the Geneva Conventions to which Russia is a party;\n       Whereas on February 25, Mr. Babitsky was released by his \n     captors in the Republic of Dagestan, only to be jailed by \n     Russian officials for carrying false identity papers;\n       Whereas Mr. Babitsky says the papers were forced on him by \n     his captors and used to smuggle him across borders;\n       Whereas Mr. Babitsky now faces charges from the Government \n     of the Russian Federation of collaborating with the Chechens \n     and carrying false identity papers and is not allowed to \n     leave the city of Moscow;\n       Whereas on February 25, a senior advisor in Russia's \n     Foreign Ministry published an article in The Moscow Times \n     entitled ``Should Liberty Leave?'', which condemned the \n     coverage by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty of the war in \n     Chechnya, particularly reporting by Radio Free Europe/Radio \n     Liberty correspondent Andrei Babitsky, and which stated that \n     it would ``be better to close down the branches of Radio \n     Liberty on Russian territory'';\n       Whereas on March 13, the Russian Ministry of the Press \n     ordered Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Moscow Bureau to \n     provide complete recordings of broadcasts between February 15 \n     and March 15, an action that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty \n     described as ``designed to intimidate us and others'';\n       Whereas on March 14, the Russian Ministry of the Press \n     issued a directive to prevent the broadcast of interviews \n     from Chechen resistance leaders, an act of censorship which \n     undercuts the ability of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to \n     fulfill its responsibilities as an objective news \n     organization;\n       Whereas the treatment of Mr. Babitsky intimidates other \n     correspondents working in Russia, particularly those covering \n     the tragic story unfolding in Chechnya;\n       Whereas Russia's evolution into a stable democracy requires \n     a free and vibrant press; and\n       Whereas it is imperative that the United States Government \n     respond vigorously to the harassment and intimidation of \n     Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to drop \n     its charges against Mr. Babitsky;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     provide a full accounting of Mr. Babitsky's detention;\n       (3) condemns the Russian Federation's harassment and \n     intimidation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and other \n     news organizations;\n       (4) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     adhere fully to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \n     which declares in Article 19 that ``everyone has the right to \n     freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes the \n     freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, \n     receive and impart information and ideas through any media \n     regardless of frontiers''; and\n       (5) urges the Government of the Russian Federation and the \n     President of the United States to implement the \n     recommendations in Senate Resolutions 223 and 262 of the One \n     Hundred Sixth Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/23/senate-section/article/S5760-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5760-S5761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF THE OLYMPICS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
