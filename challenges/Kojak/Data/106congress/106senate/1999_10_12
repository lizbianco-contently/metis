The Chair advises the Senator from Nevada that \nthe majority has 2 hours 53 minutes; the minority, 3 hours 23 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friends from Arizona and Virginia that we will \ntry to speak now and even out the time.\n  Mr. President, I give myself such time as I may consume.\n  We have heard a lot about nuclear testing recently, but no one has \nexperienced nuclear testing as has the State of Nevada. Just a few \nmiles from Las Vegas is the Nevada Test Site. There we have had almost \n1,000 tests, some above ground and some below ground. You can travel to \nthe Nevada Test Site now and go and look at these test sites. You can \nsee where the above-ground tests have taken place. You can drive by one \nplace where bleachers are still standing where people--press and \nothers--would come and sit to watch the nuclear tests in the valley \nbelow. You can see some of the buildings that still are standing \nfollowing a nuclear test. You can see large tunnels that are still in \nexistence where scores and scores of tests were set off in the same \ntunnels. You can go and look at very deep shafts where underground \ntests were set off.\n  The State of Nevada understands nuclear testing. At one time, more \nthan 11,000 people were employed in the Nevada desert dealing with \nnuclear testing. Now, as a result of several administrations making a \ndecision to no longer test nuclear weapons, there are only a little \nover 2,000 people there. Those 2,000 people are there by virtue of an \nExecutive order saying we have to be ready if tests are deemed \nnecessary in the national interest. So the Nevada Test Site is still \nthere. The people are standing by in case there is a need for the test \nsite to again be used.\n  The cessation of testing caused the largest percentage reduction of \ndefense-related jobs in any Department of Energy facility. Today, as I \nindicated,\n\n[[Page S12330]]\n\nthere are a little over 2,000 of those jobs.\n  The State of Nevada is very proud of what we have done for the \nsecurity of this Nation. Not only have we had the above-ground nuclear \ntests and the below-ground nuclear tests, but we have Nellis Air Force \nBase which is the premier fighter training center for the U.S. Air \nForce--in fact, it is the premier fighter training center for all \nallied forces around the world. I had a meeting recently with the \ngeneral who runs Nellis Air Force Base. He was preparing for the German \nAir Force to come to Las Vegas to be involved in the training systems \navailable for fighting the enemy in fighter planes.\n  Also, 400 miles from Las Vegas and Nellis Air Force Gunnery Range, \nyou have Fallon Naval Air Station. It is the same type of training \nfacility, not for the Air Force but the Navy. Virtually every pilot who \nlands on a carrier has been trained at Fallon. It is the premier \nfighter training center for naval aircraft--Fallon Naval Air Station.\n  There are many other facilities that have been used over the years. \nToday, we have Indian Springs Air Force Base which is 50 miles out of \nLas Vegas--actually less than that--where they are testing drones, the \nunmanned aircraft. So we have given a lot to the security of this \nNation; we continue to do so.\n  When we talk about nuclear testing, I can remember as a young boy, I \nwas raised 60 miles from Las Vegas.\n  We were probably 125 miles from where the actual detonations took \nplace. We would get up early in the morning at my home in Searchlight \nand watch these tests. They would announce when the tests were coming.\n  We always saw the flash of light with the above-ground tests. \nSometimes we did not hear the sound because it would sometimes bounce \nover us.\n  We were the lucky ones, though, because the winds never blew toward \nSearchlight or Las Vegas. The winds blew toward southern Utah and \nLincoln County in Nevada.\n  As a result of these above-ground tests, many people developed \nradiation sickness. They did not know it at the time. People did not \nunderstand what fallout was all about.\n  Yes, in Nevada, we understand nuclear testing as well as anyone in \nthe world.\n  Nevada is going to continue its national service whether this treaty \nis ratified or not. We have already stopped testing in the traditional \nsense.\n  I want everyone to understand that even though I am a supporter of \nthis treaty, I believe it would be much better, rather than having \neveryone march in here tonight and vote up or down on this treaty, that \nwe spend some more time talking about it. I am convinced it is a good \nthing for this country, a good thing for this Nation, but I have some \nquestions. We should answer some questions.\n  I have the good fortune of serving on the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. I am the ranking Democrat \non that subcommittee, with the head Republican on the subcommittee, \nSenator Domenici of New Mexico. It is our responsibility to appropriate \nthe money for the nuclear defense capabilities of this country. We do \nthat. We spend billions of dollars every year.\n  One of the things we have tried to do, recognizing we do not have \ntraditional testing--that is underground testing or above-ground \ntesting; of course, we do not do above-ground testing--is to provide \nother ways to make sure our nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable. No \nmatter what we have done in the past, we have to make sure our weapons \nare safe and reliable.\n  How can we do that? We are attempting in this country to do the right \nthing. We have the Stockpile Stewardship Program under which we are \nconducting tests now. They are not explosions. We are doing it through \ncomputers. We have some names for some of our tests.\n  One of them is subcritical testing. What does that mean? It means we \nset off an explosion involving nuclear materials, but before the \nmaterial becomes critical, we stop it. There is no nuclear yield. Then \nthrough computerization, in effect, we try to determine what would have \nhappened had this test gone critical. That is an expensive program, but \nit is a program that is absolutely necessary, again, for the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear stockpile.\n  About 2 years ago, I gave a statement before our subcommittee. This \nwas a statement on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on which we had a \nhearing. In that statement, I wrote about the loss of confidence in new \nweapons that could not be tested under the treaty and how this loss of \nconfidence would prevent recurrence of the costly and dangerous nuclear \narms race of the past 50 years.\n  I wrote about the confidence between former adversaries that would \ncome from the treaty because no longer would we or they have to worry \nabout significant new imbalances in deterrent forces, because no new \nweapons could be built.\n  I wrote about how that confidence would lead to more and more \nreductions in nuclear stockpiles and move the world even further away \nfrom nuclear annihilation.\n  I wrote about how the international example of refraining from \nnuclear testing, along with stockpile reductions, would reduce \nthe incentives for non-nuclear states to develop nuclear weapons.\n\n  I did not write 2 years ago about the upcoming Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty review conference in which only states that have ratified the \ntreaty will have effective membership.\n  That review conference will be able to change the conditions under \nwhich the treaty goes into force, and the United States, I am sorry to \nreport, will have no place at that table unless the treaty is ratified \nby this Senate before that conference.\n  I wrote about more than the benefits of this treaty. I also wrote \nabout some of its uncertainties and some of the concerns, I believe, we \nneed to study and review, and about the debate that is needed for their \nresolution.\n  I pointed out that a prohibition against any and all nuclear \nexplosions would reduce confidence in stockpile reliability and safety \nunless some other means was developed to maintain that confidence.\n  I noted that the Stockpile Stewardship Program was conceived to \nprovide that other means. We have had 2 years of experience with this \nprogram, but I wrote about the uncertainties faced by science-based \nstockpile stewardship. I noted the plan depends critically on dramatic \nincreases in computational capability. That is why in our subcommittee \nwe have worked very hard to spend hard-earned tax dollars to develop \nbetter computers. The development of computers is going on around the \nworld, but no place is it going on at a more rapid pace than with the \nmoney we have provided through this subcommittee. We are doing it \nbecause we believe through computerization, we can have a more safe and \nmore reliable stockpile.\n  It is only through, as I wrote, these dramatic increases in \ncomputational capability and equally dramatic increases in resolution \nwith which non-nuclear experiments can be measured that we can go \nforward with certainty of having a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile.\n  I noted persistent support by Congress and the administration was \nabsolutely necessary, not on a short-term basis but on a long-term \nbasis. I noted Congress and the administration had to support the \nscience-based Stockpile Stewardship Program; that we must set the \npattern for the world; it can be done, and we can do it.\n  I did say that the support of Congress and the administration was \nabsolutely necessary but not necessarily sufficient because the \nstewardship program is being developed at the same time that its \narchitects are learning more about it. It is a study in progress. I \nwrote then, and I believe now, the learning process will continue.\n  I pointed out that the test ban treaty would not prevent nuclear \nweapons development. It would only inhibit the military significance of \nsuch development. We are not going to develop new weapons. We have not \ndeveloped new weapons.\n  Let's talk, for example, about what can be done. You can have the \ndevelopment of crude nuclear explosives that are difficult to deliver, \nbut these could be developed with confidence without testing. We know, \ngoing back to the early days of things nuclear, that ``Fat Man'' had \nnot been tested. That was the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. There \nwas no test. It was a huge\n\n[[Page S12331]]\n\nweapon, as large as the side of a house. They had to build a pit in the \nrunway to load it. They had to reconfigure the B-29 so it could drop \nthis huge weapon, but it was not tested.\n  Stopping testing is not going to stop the development of nuclear \nweapons. Rogue nations and other nations can develop these weapons if \nthey see fit. But these crude weapons will not upset the deterrent \nbalance.\n  Also, some say the treaty would prevent the introduction of new \nmodern weapons that could weaken strategic deterrence. For example, \nnations could not build sophisticated new weapons; they would be stuck \nwith what they have. What they have may be good, may be bad.\n  I pointed out the treaty could not guarantee total cessation of \nnuclear testing because very low-yield tests and higher yield \n``decoupled'' tests might not be detected with confidence. You could \nhave small, very small tests. It would be very hard to detect.\n  You could also have the situation where a signatory nation could \nexecute a high-yield ``unattended'' explosion. What does that mean? \nWhat it means is that for a high-yield ``unattended'' explosion in a \nclandestine operation--nobody could identify the signatory nation that \nwas being noncompliant.\n  For example, let's say someone developed a nuclear device and \nsecretly dropped it in the ocean and then left. When the device went \noff someplace deep in the ocean, the country that dropped it in the \nocean could certainly know that it exploded. But others could not \nidentify who did it. It would be very hard to develop or make a new \nstockpile doing it this way, but it is possible. There are ways around \neverything.\n  But in spite of all these things that you could throw up as ways to \nget around the treaty--the ``decoupled'' tests and dropping them in the \nocean, of course, you can do those kinds of things--but in spite of \nthat, the positive nature of this treaty far outweighs any of these \nthings that I have mentioned.\n  I did say in that statement I made before our subcommittee that the \nUnited States takes its treaty obligations seriously. We would not in \nany manner do what I have just outlined. But other nations might \nconduct themselves in that fashion. You cannot conduct your foreign \npolicy believing that everybody is going to do everything the right \nway.\n  I do say that in all of these areas of uncertainty, I wrote about the \nneed of the United States for a prolonged, comprehensive investigation \nand debate. That is where we have failed. We should have had hearings \nthat went over a period of years, not a few days.\n  It is through consultation and the testimony of experts, and debate \namong Members of this body and the other body, that the issues and \nquestions can be properly framed, examined, and resolved.\n  I was overly optimistic when I wrote in the conclusion of my \nstatement to the hearing as follows:\n\n       These uncertainties and their associated issues will be the \n     subject of intense debate by the Senate as we move toward a \n     policy decision that will define an appropriate balance \n     between the treaty's costs, its risks, and its promised \n     benefits.\n\n  There has been no intense debate. I was too optimistic because we did \nnot ``move'' toward a policy decision; we did not do anything. We \nstumbled, lurched perhaps. I was too optimistic because intense debate \nhas not been conducted by the Senate. There have been a few little \nthings that have gone on. For example, in my subcommittee we have done \na few things. But we have needed extensive debate.\n  What have we had in the last few days, literally? We have had some \nexperts come in. We have had some hurriedly conducted hearings. That \nisn't the way you approach, perhaps, one of the most important treaties \nthis country has ever decided.\n  I think the chairmen and the ranking members of both the Armed \nServices Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, during the last \nfew days, have done the best they could under the circumstances. I \ncommend them for trying. But I do not think we should base this treaty \non what has gone on in the last few days.\n  I was too optimistic because I did not realize we would enter a time \nagreement to debate this most important issue for 14 hours. I do not \nthink it is appropriate. I think it prevents amendments that may be \nnecessary.\n  I indicate that I rise in support of this treaty. I do it without any \nreluctance. I do say, however, that we should have more debate. We \nshould have more consultation. We should have more hearings. That would \nallow us to arrive at a better, more informed decision.\n  I have heard some people speak on this floor saying they want more \ninformation. They are entitled to that. I think we are rushing forward \non a vote on this. We should step back. I think if there is an \nopportunity today to avoid the vote this afternoon or tomorrow, we \nshould do that. I do not think we need to rush into this.\n  The President has written a letter indicating, for the good of the \ncountry, this vote should be put off. I agree with that. I am not \nafraid to cast my vote. I have indicated several times this morning \nthat I will vote in favor of the treaty. I do not, for a moment, \nbelieve that there are others who feel any differently than I in our \nresponsibility. Our job is to cast votes. I only wish Members were \ngiven the time and opportunity to become as informed as possible so \nthat all Members are given an opportunity to improve this treaty--\nthrough debate, through dialogue, and perhaps even through amendment.\n  Again, I rise in support of this treaty, not because I had an \nopportunity to consider all the issues and the expert opinion on these \nissues. I rise in support of the treaty because on the whole we are \nmuch, much, much better off with it than without it.\n  I have only a partial list of prominent individuals and national \ngroups in support of this test ban treaty: Current and former Chairmen \nand Vice Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; former Secretaries of \nDefense; former Secretaries of State; former Secretaries of Energy; \nformer Members of Congress; Directors of the three National \nLaboratories; we have other prominent national security officials; arms \ncontrol negotiators; we have many prominent military officers who have \nbeen members of the Chiefs of Staff; scientific experts from all over \nthe United States with the greatest academic institutions; we have \nNobel laureates--more than a score of Nobel laureates who support this \ntreaty--former senior Government officials and advisors; ambassadors; \nnational groups; medical and scientific groups; public interest groups; \nreligious groups.\n  I have eight or nine pages of prominent individuals and national \ngroups in support of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty that I \nask unanimous consent be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nPartial List of Prominent Individuals and National Groups in Support of \n                       the CTBT--October 9, 1999\n\n\n current and former chairmen/vice-chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff\n\n       General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff.\n       General John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff.\n       General Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff.\n       General David Jones, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff.\n       Admiral William Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff.\n       General Joseph Ralston, Vice Chairman.\n       Admiral William Owens, former Vice Chairman.\n\n\n                     former secretaries of defense\n\n       Robert McNamara.\n       Harold Brown.\n       William Perry.\n\n\n                      former secretaries of state\n\n       Warren Christopher.\n       Cyrus Vance.\n\n\n                      former secretaries of energy\n\n       Hazel O'Leary.\n       Federico Pena.\n\n\n                         former acda directors\n\n       Ambassador Ralph Earle II.\n       Major General William F.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thought it was understood that we would \nalternate sides as we proceeded this morning.\n  Mr. REID. I would only say to my friend from Virginia, I am happy to \nalternate. The only thing is, you will have to speak less than we do. \nYour speeches will have to be shorter because you have less time. I \nspoke with the Senator from Arizona. What is the time now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 2 hours 53 minutes; the \nminority, 3 hours 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. So it has narrowed down to about the same time. Fine, we \nwill alternate back and forth.\n  Mr. WARNER. The time--\n  Mr. REID. Is very close to being equal.\n  Mr. WARNER. As an opponent to the treaty, I would like to proceed, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that all right with the Senator from \nWisconsin?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My understanding is, I would be next in line after the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  During the period of last week, a number of Senators sought to obtain \nfrom the President a letter addressing his views on the timing of a \nvote on this treaty. Over the weekend, in consultation with the White \nHouse staff, I learned that this letter would be delivered. It was \ndelivered to the Senate leadership yesterday afternoon.\n  I shall now read it and place it in the Record:\n\n     Dear Mr. Leader:\n       Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduled to vote on the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I firmly believe the Treaty is \n     in the national interest. However, I recognize that there are \n     a significant number of Senators who have honest \n     disagreements. I believe that proceeding to a vote under \n     these circumstances would severely harm the national security \n     of the United States, damage our relationship with our \n     allies, and undermine our historic leadership over 40 years, \n     through administrations Republican and Democratic, in \n     reducing the nuclear threat.\n       Accordingly, I request that you postpone consideration of \n     the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Throughout this debate, the hallmark has been differing views, \ndiffering views by honestly motivated colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. I am not suggesting everyone on this side, in other words, is \nopposed to the treaty, but the practical matter is, there seems to be a \ndivision along this aisle.\n  In addition, as recited by my good friend, the deputy leader of the \nDemocrat side, the Senate has received communications from a wide range \nof individuals, again, on both sides of this issue. The Armed Services \nCommittee held three consecutive hearings. Secretary Schlesinger came \nforward with a very clear statement in opposition to the treaty and \nexpressed, on behalf of five other former Secretaries of Defense, the \nsame viewpoint. That occurred immediately following the current \nSecretary of Defense, Secretary Cohen, appearing before the Armed \nServices Committee, together with General Shelton, and taking the view \nin support of the treaty. All through last week intermittently these \ncommunications came to the Senate in writing, orally or otherwise--\nformer Secretary of State Kissinger, former National Security Adviser \nBrent Scowcroft, again, communicating their desire to see that the \ntreaty not be voted upon at this time.\n  I mention that because of the seriousness of the treaty, one that \nlasts in perpetuity--theoretically, in perpetuity--asking this Nation \nto take certain steps with regard to our ability to monitor the \neffectiveness and the safety of our nuclear arsenal. To me, it is clear \nsuch a treaty should only be voted on when those types of conflicting \nopinions have been, as nearly as possible, resolved. The laboratory \nDirectors, likewise, came before our committee; they are not involved \nin the political arena. But one after the other in testimony tried to \nindicate where they are in the test program. We\n\n[[Page S12334]]\n\nare not there yet. It could be anywhere from 5 and, one even said, 20 \nyears before the milestones now scheduled are put in place for this \nsubstitute scientific, largely computerized test program will take the \nplace of the actual tests.\n  Against that background--and I speak only for myself--I have joined \nwith Senator Moynihan and, hopefully, others in preparing a Dear \nColleague letter, which will be circulated this morning, with the \nSenator from Virginia opposed to the treaty, prepared tonight to vote \nagainst it or tomorrow, whenever the case may be, and my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from New York, who spent much of his \nlifetime in foreign affairs, a recognized expert, steadfastly in favor \nof the treaty and prepared to vote in support of it. I find on both \nsides of the aisle there are Senators of a like mind who believe that \nin the interest of national security, today is not the time to vote for \nthat treaty.\n  The letter from the President, it was hoped by some, would refer to \nhis belief as to the scheduling of when this treaty should next be \naddressed in terms of a vote by the Senate. It is clear; his last \nparagraph does not address that issue. He simply says: Accordingly, I \nrequest that you postpone consideration on the Senate floor.\n  Given that situation, it seems to me it is incumbent upon, hopefully, \na majority of Senators, hopefully 25 or more from each side, to come \nforward and state that they firmly believe the final consideration of \nthis treaty should be laid at a time beyond the current Congress and \nthat final vote should not take place until the convening of the 107th \nCongress. The Senate at that time would review the entirety of the \nrecord. A new President will be in office, and the combination of a new \nPresident and his perspective, the Senate constituted, as it will be in \nthe 107th, and that point in time is the critical moment for this \nSenate to determine the merits and demerits of this treaty to the \nextent that, through reservations and other means, changes could be \nbrought about and then, if it is the desire of the majority of the \nSenate, to move towards a vote.\n\n  That, to me, is a reasonable course of action. Next year \nconstitutional elections of the United States take place. We all are \nvery familiar with the dynamics of that critical period in American \nhistory, particularly in the months preceding the election. Should this \ntreaty be subjected to the rifts of the dynamics of an election year, \ngiven its importance to our national security? Clearly in this \nSenator's mind, I say no. My distinguished colleague from New York has \njoined me in the same conclusion. This country has exercised a \nleadership role in arms control for 40 years. Indeed, this treaty has--\nnot in my judgment in its present form--in the minds of others a \npotential to be another milestone in our progress towards arms control \nand the reduction of the threat of nuclear weapons.\n  In fairness to all sides, would it not be wiser to delay the vote and \nmake certain it is the consensus of a majority of this Chamber, before \nthat decision is finalized today or tomorrow, the majority of this \nChamber saying we concur in the observation for a number of reasons, \none of which clearly came before the Armed Services Committee, and that \nis, that the Intelligence Committee, on its own initiative, has \ninitiated a new study of the capabilities of the United States to \nmonitor low-level tests of actual weapons, should some nation, a \nsignatory to this treaty or otherwise, decide to test live weapons.\n  We are at a crossroads in history which will affect this Nation for \ndecades to come. What possible rush to judgment compels a vote tonight \nor tomorrow? Would it not be more prudent that such a vote now be by a \nmajority of the Senate in support of the two leaders, Senator Lott and \nSenator Daschle, both of whom have handled this matter, in my judgment, \nconscientiously, always foremost in mind the security interests of this \ncountry today, tomorrow, and the indefinite future? I salute both \nleaders.\n  That is my brief opening. I wish to continue and summarize what our \ncommittee did last week. We received over 15 hours of testimony from a \nwide range of witnesses, from the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs to current and former National Laboratory Directors \nand career professionals in the field of nuclear weapons. We also \nreceived letters from many public officeholders, former Secretaries of \nDefense, State, Secretaries of Energy, Chairmen of the Joints Chiefs, \nDirectors of Central Intelligence, and former lab Directors on the \nmerits and the pitfalls of the CTB Treaty. Other public officeholders \ncame forward in favor, but there is a strong division.\n  I don't think anyone, the President or, indeed, the Senate, could \nhave foreseen the outpouring of conscientious opinion, opinions \ndirected solely in the best interests of this country, not politics, by \nthese former officials. They are in the Record for all to see. These \nare people with decades of experience in national security. Their \nstatements reflect honest disagreements, disagreements primarily with \nthe stance taken by the President and senior members of his \nadministration.\n  In my view, the body of facts that the Armed Services Committee has \naccumulated over the past several days clearly puts the arguments of \nmany of the administration officials in serious question. We have \nlearned we do not have the full confidence in the United States' \ntechnical capability to verify this treaty to the zero-yield threshold \nthat President Clinton unilaterally imposed, more or less, on this \ncountry. And other countries can conduct military-significant live bomb \ntests at levels below our detection capability. That is the essence of \nit. We do not have all of the seismic equipment, in the judgment of the \nIntelligence Committee, in place and ready to meet the deadlines of \nthis treaty so we could detect another nation that desired to use live \ntests in violation of their commitments under this treaty.\n  We have learned that our nuclear weapons will, to some degree, \ndeteriorate over time. That is pure science. The physical properties of \nthe materials deteriorate over a period of time. We cannot guarantee \nthe safety and reliability of our highly sophisticated nuclear weapons \nin perpetuity--always remember, in perpetuity. Testing is needed.\n  The Stockpile Stewardship Program is the concept of a substitute for \nthe live testing that we have had these 50 years. That 50-year record \nof testing gives us the confidence today, and for a number of years \nforward, in the reliability and safety of our stockpile. But there is \nsome point in time, due to the deterioration of weapons, and other \nfactors, that we will have to shift to a new means of testing. The \nadministration's proposal under this treaty is the Stockpile \nStewardship Program. It is a computer simulation substitute for actual \ntesting. The scientists tell us this will not be proven--this \nsubstitute--for perhaps 5, 10, maybe up to 20 years. I repeat, \nmilestones are being put in place, but there is no certainty as to \nwhen, collectively, those milestones will constitute a system to \nreplace actual testing. The estimates vary from 5, 6, 7 years, perhaps \nout to 20.\n  Yet we are being asked to ratify a treaty affirming that we shall \nnever again, in perpetuity, actually test any of our nuclear weapons. \nWe have learned the CTBT will do nothing--not a single thing--to stop \nproliferation by rogue nations and terrorists. Iraq and Iran will sit \nback and laugh. Right now, Iraq is defying the world over similar arms \ncontrol agreements, similar U.N. sanctions, and the United Nations is \nentangled in what appears to be a hopeless debate over how to resolve \nthe need to continue to monitor Saddam Hussein's program of weapons of \nmass destruction. A clear example of how the most well-intentioned \ninternational agreements have failed is right there, today.\n  Rogue nations can easily develop and field, with a high degree of \nconfidence, a single stage device--a ``dirty old bomb,'' as they refer \nto it--without any testing. Ironically, the first weapon dropped by the \nUnited States was never tested with an actual test.\n  Many of my colleagues, again, honestly disagree on the conclusions, \npointing out that reasonable people can examine the same body of facts \nand reach different conclusions. That is my grave concern. We should \nnot be ratifying a treaty as long as reasonable doubt to that degree \nexists as to whether the treaty is in the national security interest of \nthe United States. The stakes are far too high.\n\n[[Page S12335]]\n\n  The Armed Services Committee began its hearings with a closed \nhearing, where we heard from career professionals and experts with \ndecades of experience, from the Department of Energy, the National \nLaboratories, and the Intelligence Committee. Their testimony focused \non recent facts--facts that were not fully known at the time this \ntreaty was signed by the President some 2 years ago. Their assessment \nis they would have to go back and reexamine a lot of facts to determine \nthe viability, or lack of viability, of the capability of this Nation \nto monitor low-level tests.\n\n  Much of that information we learned was developed over the last 18 \nmonths. Therefore, those facts were not available to the Congress or \nthe President when the CTBT was signed in 1996. The information \npresented to the Armed Services Committee on Tuesday is highly \nclassified and, of course, cannot be discussed in open session. But one \nfact is very relevant. Because of disturbing new information, the \nIntelligence Committee--on its own initiative--decided to revisit and \nupdate the 1997 NIE, national intelligence estimate, on the U.S. \nability to monitor the CTBT. I have been informed, as have other \nmembers of the committee, that it will take until next year to complete \nthat work. That is a clear, credible basis for not moving forward today \nor tomorrow on a vote.\n  I advised Secretary Cohen and General Shelton on the following day, \nWednesday morning, when they testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee that they had the opportunity to make their case for this \ntreaty before the elected representatives of the American people, and \nthat they did. I believe the burden is on the administration to prove--\nmaybe beyond a reasonable doubt--that ratification of this treaty is in \nthe national security interest of our Nation. They simply did not make \nthat case. And I say that with all due respect to my good friend and \nformer colleague, Secretary Cohen.\n  We are being asked to give up--permanently--our tried and true, \nproven ability to maintain the safety and reliability of our nuclear \nstockpile and to rely instead on a computer simulation and modeling \ncapability that will not be fully developed or proven for many years--\nif at all. We are being asked today to put at some degree of risk our \nnuclear deterrent capability, in exchange for the promise that we may \nhave a way to adequately certify that capability at some uncertain \nfuture date. The question before the Senate is, Can we afford to take \nsuch a gamble? This Senator believes the answer is no.\n  For more than 50 years, one of the top national security priorities \nof every American President has been to maintain a credible nuclear \narsenal and deterrent to aggression against ourselves and our allies, \nand it has worked. The credibility of the United States in the world is \na direct reflection of our military capability. If that credibility is \never called into question by our inability to ensure the safety and \nreliability of nuclear weapons--a vital segment of our military \ncapability--then we have done our Nation a great disservice. The stakes \nfor this debate are very high.\n  For 50 years, our nuclear umbrella--the deterrent provided by the \nU.S. nuclear arsenal--has kept peace in Europe. Unquestionably, the \nthreats in Europe following World War II were deterred by this \ncapability. Yet it is that very deterrent that could be jeopardized by \nthis treaty. Dr. Schlesinger stated it clearly when he asked, ``Do we \nwant a world that lacks confidence in the U.S. deterrent or not?''\n  I hope all Members will take the time to examine carefully the body \nof facts that the Armed Services Committee and, indeed, the Foreign \nRelations Committee have accumulated and recorded for Senators.\n\n  Simply put, the CTBT, at this time, jeopardizes our ability to \nmaintain the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal--perhaps not \nright away but almost certainly over the long run. According to Dr. \nJames Robinson, Director of Sandia National Laboratory: ``To forego \ntesting is to live with uncertainty.''\n  Much has been said about what other Presidents have done. They have \nall examined the possibility of entering into some type of \ninternational treaty. But no previous President has ever opposed a test \nban of zero yield and unlimited duration. President Eisenhower insisted \nthat nuclear tests of less than 4.75 kilotons be permitted and, in \nfact, continued low-yield testing through his administration's test ban \nmoratorium. President Kennedy terminated a 3-year moratorium on testing \nwhen the adverse consequences of the moratorium were realized, and he \ndeclared that ``never again'' would the United States make such a \nmistake. President Kennedy then embarked on the most aggressive series \nof nuclear tests in the history of the U.S. nuclear weapons program. \nPresident Carter also opposed a zero-yield test ban while in office.\n  To have an effective nuclear deterrent, we must have confidence in \nthe safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. These weapons are \nthe most sophisticated designs in the world. It is a certainty that, \nover time, these arsenals, high explosives, and electronic components \ncontained in these weapons will experience some level of deterioration. \nThat is simple science. The nature of our nuclear weapons program over \nthe past five decades provides little practical experience in \npredicting the effects of these changes.\n  What do we say to our sailors, soldiers, airmen, and marines who live \nand work in close proximity with these nuclear weapons? What do we say \nto the people of our Nation, and indeed nations around the world, who \nlive in the vicinity of our nuclear weapons? These are weapons that are \nstored in various locations around the world, that rest in missile \ntubes literally several feet away from the bunks of our submarine \ncrews, that are regularly moved across roads and airfields around the \nworld. How can we take any action which in any way jeopardizes or calls \ninto question the safety of these weapons? As Dr. Bob Barker, former \nAssistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy, told the Armed \nServices Committee on Thursday, ``to leave in place weapons that are \nnot as safe as they could be is unconscionable.''\n  History tells us that weapons believed to be reliable and thoroughly \ntested, nevertheless, develop problems which, in the past were only \ndiscovered, and could only be fixed, through nuclear testing. As \nPresident Bush noted in a report to Congress in January 1993: ``Of all \nU.S. nuclear weapons designs fielded since 1958, approximately one-\nthird have required nuclear testing to resolve problems arising after \ndeployment.'' In three-quarters of these cases, the problems were \nidentified and assessed only as a result of nuclear testing, and could \nbe fixed only through testing. Let me emphasize, most of these problems \nwere related to safety.\n  The Clinton administration has proposed remanufacturing aging weapons \nrather than designing and building new ones. The problem is that we \nsimply don't know if this new approach is possible. Almost every \nweapons designer we have heard from over the past 3 years has raised \nconcerns with any attempts to change components, such as plutonium and \nhigh explosives, in the heart of the weapon. Many of the materials and \nmethods used in producing the original weapons are no longer available. \nTo assure that the remanufactured weapons work as intended most agree \nthe new weapons would have to be validated through underground nuclear \ntesting.\n  Every system will become obsolete at some point in time--if for no \nother reason, for deterioration due to aging. CTBT will not allow us to \nreplace aging or unsafe systems in the future.\n  Supporters of the treaty, argue that if a problem with the stockpile \nis identified, the President can always exercise ``Safeguard F'' and \nwithdraw from the treaty and test. The military leaders and the three \nlab directors have all conditioned their support for CTBT on the \nguarantee that the President would exercise ``Safeguard F'' and \nwithdraw from the treaty if a problem develops with our nuclear \nstockpile. But how realistic is that? It is highly unlikely that this \nsafeguard would ever be used by the United States to withdraw from the \ntreaty even if serious problems should occur in the stockpile. Has the \nUnited States ever withdrawn from a treaty? We are struggling today \nunder the weight of the ABM Treaty which was signed in 1972 with a \nnation that no longer exists: withdrawing from the treaty is simply \nwithout precedent.\n  And what would the international ramifications be of such a \nwithdrawal\n\n[[Page S12336]]\n\nfrom the treaty? Wouldn't it be worse to withdraw years down the road, \nafter other nations have presumably followed our lead, than to simply \nnot ratify in the first place?\n  In addition, the notion of being able to test quickly in an emergency \nis unrealistic. Even if the United States should decide to withdraw \nfrom CTBT, the lab directors report that it would take at least 2 to 3 \nyears of preparation before a test could be conducted, and our testing \ninfrastructure continues to deteriorate. By withdrawing, the United \nStates would be announcing to the world that we have such a serious \nproblem with our nuclear deterrent that we have lost confidence in the \nreliability of our nuclear stockpile, and that we must initiate a \nprogram to repair or replace the weapon or weapons and conduct tests to \nconfirm the results. Such an action would be highly destabilizing.\n  Proponents of the CTBT have asserted that the treaty will have no \nadverse impacts on U.S. national security, that we will be able to \nconfidently maintain and modernize U.S. strategic and theater nuclear \nforces to the extent necessary without ever conducting another nuclear \nexplosive test. In fact, the CTBT will force the United States to forgo \nany number of important initiatives that may be required to ensure the \nlong-term viability and safety of our strategic and theater nuclear \ndeterrent forces.\n  The CTBT will lock the United States into retention of a nuclear \narsenal that was designed at the height of the cold war. Many of the \nnuclear systems that we developed to deter the Soviet Union are simply \nnot suited to the subtle, and perhaps more difficult, task of deterring \nrogue states from using nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Such \ndeterrence will require the United States to possess nuclear weapons \nthat pose a credible threat to targets such as rogue state biological \nweapon production facilities that may be located deep underground in \nhardened shelters. At the same time, for such weapons to be credible \ndeterrents, they must not threaten to create significant collateral \ndamage or radioactive fallout. Such weapons do not exist today in the \nU.S. arsenal.\n  I am also concerned that this treaty's zero yield test ban is not \nverifiable. It is difficult, if not impossible, to detect tests below a \ncertain level. And testing at yields below detection may allow \ncountries, such as Russia, to develop new classes of low-yield, \ntactical nuclear weapons. This possibility makes recent statements by \nsenior Russian officials claiming that they are now developing tactical \nnuclear weapons especially troubling. For example, this August, the \nRussian Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy, Lev Ryabev, stated that a \nkey Russian objective was the development of a tactical nuclear system. \nThis April, President Yeltsin reportedly approved a blueprint for the \ndevelopment and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons. Would we be able \nto detect tests of such tactical weapons? The development of any \nnuclear weapon, regardless of its yield, is militarily significant to \nthis Senator.\n  Further, countries that want to evade detection can do so by masking \nor muffling tests in mines, underground cavities, salt domes, or other \ngeological formations. I am convinced that the United States and the \ninternational community cannot now, and will not in the foreseeable \nfuture, be able to detect such cheating or testing below a certain \nlevel.\n  Proponents of the CTBT argue that the International Monitoring System \nestablished under the treaty will put in place capabilities exceeding \nthose that the United States and its allies can field today. These \nmonitoring sites will be owned and operated by the host countries, \nwhich I believe calls into serious question the reliability of the \ninformation collected and, thus, its value to our ability to detect a \nnuclear test.\n  Proponents of CTBT also argue that although the treaty may not be \nverifiable through detection methods, the on-site inspections make the \nCTBT verifiable. I disagree. The treaty requires an affirmative vote of \n30 of 51 members of the Executive Council to initiate an inspection. \nThe likelihood of obtaining that number, which could include such \ncountries as Iran and North Korea, is remote, if not impossible. \nFurther, the United States would have to present a case to the \nExecutive Council which would most likely compromise sensitive U.S. \nintelligence sources and methods. The timelines imposed by the treaty \nfor on-site inspections permit considerable coverup and deterioration \nof evidence. In addition, there is no guarantee that Americans will be \non the inspection teams. In fact, any state is explicitly permitted to \nblock inspectors from countries it does not like. The treaty gives the \ninspected state the final say in any dispute with inspectors.\n  Finally, ambiguities in the CTBT may allow other nations to legally \ncircumvent the clear intent of the treaty. The treaty does not define \nwhat constitutes a nuclear test. However, President Clinton has said \nthat the United States will interpret nuclear test to mean any nuclear \nexplosion, thus all tests are banned unless they are zero-yield. \nHowever, if other signatory nations interpret a less restrictive \ndefinition, they could conduct very low-yield tests and argue that they \nare not violating the language of the treaty.\n  I am concerned that while the United States would adhere to the CTBT, \nthereby losing confidence over time in our nuclear deterrent, other \ncountries would capitalize upon U.S. deficiencies and vulnerabilities \ncreated by the CTBT and violate the treaty, by escaping detection and \nbuilding new weapons.\n  I believe the risk the CTBT poses to U.S. national security by far \noutweighs any of the benefits that have been identified.\n  Mr. President, I shall reengage in this debate as the day progresses. \nI will pursue with Senator Moynihan the final presentation of our Dear \nColleague letter in the hopes that a number of Senators will see the \nwisdom in giving the leadership of the Senate the support they deserve \nshould a decision be made not to go forward today. That decision should \nembrace very clearly that it would be in the Senate's interest, in the \nNation's interest, and our security interest to revisit this treaty in \nterms of a final vote in the balance of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senate advice and \nconsent to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I have \nadvocated for consideration of this treaty since President Clinton \nsubmitted it to this body for advice and consent on September 22, 1997. \nNow, more than 2 years later, this important treaty is being considered \non the Senate floor. While I am pleased that we are having this debate, \nI am concerned about the manner in which we reached this point. I \nregret that the Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, \nhad only one day of hearings on this important arms control agreement \nand that the committee did not consider and mark up a resolution of \nratification.\n  I am concerned that this debate is too limited in duration and scope. \nThis is obviously serious business. And I hope that the manner in which \nthis treaty was brought to the floor does not doom it to failure. This \ntreaty should be fully debated on its merits. And this body should have \nthe opportunity to offer any statements, declarations, understandings, \nor conditions that we deem necessary. But this treaty should not be \ndefeated simply because the Senate has backed itself into a corner in \nwhich the choice is to vote up or down now without the option to \npostpone this important vote in favor of further consideration. Some of \nour colleagues have expressed their desire for further consideration. \nBut they have said that if they are forced to vote today, they will \noppose this treaty--not necessarily because they do not support the \ntreaty, but rather because they feel they cannot yet fully support it \nwithout further study.\n  I think putting Senators in this position is an irresponsible course \nof action.\n  As my colleagues know, I support this treaty. And I will vote in \nfavor of it today should it come to that. But I hope we will consider \nthe consequences of defeating this treaty, not on its merits, but \nbecause of the political box in\n\n[[Page S12337]]\n\nwhich we find ourselves. This treaty must not fall victim to politics. \nThe consequences of its defeat will be felt from Moscow to New Delhi to \nBeijing to Baghdad. And this body, the greatest deliberative body in \nthe world, would be sending the message that we did not want to spend \nmore time on one of the most important issues facing the world today.\n  We do live in dangerous times, Mr. President. Weapons capable of mass \ndestruction have replaced more conventional weapons in our world. New \nthreats continue to emerge. But we have the power to stem the tide of \nnuclear proliferation. Perhaps we cannot stop it completely. But we can \nmake sure that the nuclear arms race is stopped in its tracks and we \ncan make it extremely difficult for those with nuclear aspirations to \ndevelop a weapon in which they can have high confidence.\n  And we should do everything in our power to make the world safer for \nfuture generations. And if that includes delaying the vote on this \ntreaty, then we should swallow our political pride and do that.\n  As a number of my colleagues have already said, both in committee and \non this floor, the idea of a nuclear test ban dates back to the \nEisenhower administration. For more than 40 years, Presidents of both \nparties have advocated for such a treaty.\n  In a speech delivered on June 10, 1963, President John F. Kennedy \ndiscussed his support for the negotiation of a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty. He said--and I quote:\n\n       The conclusion of such a treaty, so near and yet so far, \n     would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most \n     dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a \n     position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest \n     hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of \n     nuclear arms. It would increase our security--it would \n     decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is \n     sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, \n     yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole \n     effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital \n     and responsible safeguards.\n\n  Mr. President, those words are as relevant today as they were when \nPresident Kennedy spoke them 36 years ago. Nuclear weapons are still \none of the greatest hazards on the planet. And they have been joined by \nchemical, biological, and other weapons of mass destruction. President \nKennedy spoke from the perspective of the cold war and the still \nescalating arms race with the Soviet Union. Now, in 1999, the cold war \nis over and the Soviet Union is no more. But we are on the brink of \nanother nuclear arms race, this time in south Asia. India and Pakistan \nare watching, Mr. President. And we have the opportunity to end their \nnuclear aspirations once and for all. Or to give them the cover they \nneed to continue testing.\n  We have the opportunity today at long last to become a party to a \ncomprehensive nuclear test ban treaty that will both stop the nuclear \narms race in its tracks and maintain our option to withdraw from its \nprovisions if our national security is threatened.\n  I hope that will be our paramount consideration in the coming hours \nas we decide whether to put this treaty up for a vote today or \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleagues have noted throughout this \ndebate, there are many reasons why the United States should become a \nparty to this important treaty. I will address three of them here.\n  First, this treaty will allow the United States to maintain our \nstrong nuclear deterrent. This treaty does not require the parties to \ndismantle their existing nuclear stockpiles. It does not prevent them \nfrom maintaining those stockpiles through scientific means. Rather, \nthis treaty prohibits further nuclear testing. The United States has \nnot conducted any nuclear tests for 7 years, and the administration has \ntestified that we have no intention of performing any further tests. \nThe Departments of Defense and Energy already have a substantial \ndatabase of information on the more than 1,000 nuclear tests that we \nhave already performed. And this information has been the basis for the \ndevelopment of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which the high-\nranking administration officials have testified is an effective \nmechanism for maintaining the safety and reliability of our nuclear \narsenal.\n  Second, this treaty will help to create a worldwide nuclear status \nquo. Parties to the CTBT will be unable to conduct nuclear explosive \ntests to improve their existing weapons or develop stronger ones. This \nmeans that the nuclear arms race will be literally frozen where it is. \nThis is beneficial to the United States for several reasons. It will \nallow us to maintain our nuclear superiority. It will protect us from \nthe threat of stronger weapons in the future. And, in fact, it ensures \nthat we will have the dubious distinction of having won the nuclear \narms race.\n  The third point in favor of this treaty I will make is this: the CTBT \nis effectively verifiable. Some have argued that this treaty is not \nverifiable. It seems that argument echoes in these halls every time we \ndebate an arms control treaty. But, again, that argument rings hollow. \nVerification is a tricky thing. All treaties, including arms control \ntreaties, are largely based on good faith among the parties to them. \nGood faith in the sense that the parties who have ratified the treaty \nhave promised to comply with the treaty's provisions. Collectively, the \nparties have agreed to a set of provisions, in the case of the CTBT to \nnot perform nuclear tests. Alone, a country can decide to no longer \nperform nuclear tests--as the United States has already done--but no \nother nation knows for sure if that country is living up to its \npromise.\n  Under a multilateral treaty such as the CTBT, all parties have agreed \nto the provisions and are subject to a verification regime that \notherwise would not exist. The CTBT says that if one party to the \ntreaty has evidence that a test has occurred, that party can request an \nonsite inspection. This inspection will occur if 30 of the 51 members \nof the CTBT's Executive Council agree that the evidence warrants such \nan inspection. This type of onsite inspection cannot occur outside the \nCTBT regime, Mr. President. And this inspection will allow the parties \nto the treaty to obtain information that cannot be obtained outside the \ntreaty regime.\n  No one here will claim that any treaty is 100 percent verifiable or \nthat some countries may try to cheat. But the Pentagon has said that \nthis treaty is effectively verifiable. And that is the key. The \nInternational Monitoring System created by this treaty includes 230 \ndata gathering stations around the world in addition to those already \noperating in the United States. Last week, Secretary of Defense William \nCohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``the information \ncollected by these sensor stations would not normally be available to \nthe U.S. intelligence community.'' In addition to this enhanced \ncapability, the United States is also permitted, under the provisions \nof the treaty and in accordance with international law, to use our own \nnational technical means to detect nuclear tests.\n  Mr. President, some people say that, because the United States has \nalready made the decision not to do any further nuclear testing--and \nindeed that we have not tested in seven years--that this treaty is \nunnecessary. They claim that the CTBT merely reinforces what we have \nalready done and that there is no real benefit to our ratification. In \nfact, as many of my colleagues have already addressed during this \ndebate, and as I have already noted, there are many benefits to this \ntreaty. We retain our leadership in the arms control arena. We maintain \nour nuclear superiority. And, importantly, we gain the ability to \nrequest and participate in onsite inspections of suspected nuclear \ntesting abroad. And, if the President is unable to certify that our \nnuclear arsenal is sound, we have the option to withdraw from the \ntreaty.\n  Mr. President, in urging my colleagues to support this important \ntreaty, I will again quote President Kennedy:\n\n       The United States, as the world knows, will never start a \n     war. We do not want a war. We do not now expect a war. This \n     generation of Americans has already had enough--more than \n     enough--of war and hate and oppression. We shall be prepared \n     if others wish it. We shall be alert to try to stop it. But \n     we shall also do our part to build a world of peace where the \n     weak are safe and the strong are just. We are not helpless \n     before that task or hopeless of its success. Confident and \n     unafraid, we labor on--not toward a strategy of nuclear \n     annihilation but toward a strategy of peace.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S12338]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arizona such \ntime as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, a number of us have concluded that we cannot support \nratification of the CTBT, that it will be defeated. But some have urged \nthat we put the vote off out of concern that rejection would send an \nundesirable message to the world.\n  I believe, however, that we should vote precisely because the world \nwould get a desirable message that the Senate took a stand that \ntreaties such as this must meet at least minimum standards for sensible \narms control. The CTBT fails that test. It is a sloppy, altogether \nsubstandard piece of work, and it deserves rejection.\n  Our colleague, Dick Lugar, opposes the CTBT ratification, as he has \nexplained, because he does not believe the treaty is of the same \ncaliber as arms control agreements that have come before the Senate in \nrecent decades. He cites two of the CTBT's many deficiencies: ``an \nineffective verification regime and a practically nonexistent \nenforcement process.''\n  Contrary to what treaty supporters have argued, the CTBT's rejection \nwould strengthen the hands of U.S. diplomats on such matters in future \nnegotiations. When they insist on more effective provisions, citing the \nneed to satisfy a rigorous U.S. Senate, their warnings would become \ncredible and influential. Such warnings would help free the United \nStates from having to go along with wrong-headed treaty terms dictated \nby countries that lack U.S. responsibilities around the world.\n  I note that as a good example of our negotiators changing their \nposition from that originally supported by the administration to go \ndirectly to the heart of key objections to this particular treaty. As \nyou know, no President had ever sought a zero-yield test ban treaty in \nperpetuity. In this case, the Joint Chiefs of Staff argued that we \nshould not have such a treaty.\n  The original position of the administration in the negotiations was \nto grant the United States an option without having to invoke the \nsupreme national interest clause to retire from the treaty after 10 \nyears and not to insist upon a zero-yield but, rather, to permit low-\nyield, what are called hydronuclear tests. Over time, our negotiators' \nposition was undercut, and in the end, according to the very people who \nnegotiated the treaty, in order to reach an agreement with other \ncountries, the United States conceded on those and other important \npoints. Those are two of the critical deficiencies in this treaty.\n  By rejecting the treaty now, the Senate would strengthen the hands of \nour future diplomats who negotiate these arms control agreements to \nenable them to make the point to their counterparts that the United \nStates is serious about treaties at least achieving minimal standards; \nwe consider these to be the kinds of minimal standards that are \nnecessary to bind the American people; and those negotiators would know \nthat Senate ratification would not occur unless the terms were as \nproposed by the United States.\n  As I said, no other President ever supported a zero-yield treaty, let \nalone one that would bind the United States forever, and neither should \nthe Senate.\n  If we proceed today to reject the CTBT, future U.S. negotiators will \nbe more inclined to seek the Senate's advice before the deal is \nfinalized and the administration demands our consent. This will serve \nthe U.S. national interests in various ways.\n  First, the Senate was never intended to be a rubber stamp, approving \nany ill-advised treaty negotiated by an administration. Our \nconstitutional duty in treaty-making is to perform the equivalent of \nquality control. Under the Constitution, the Senate's role is of equal \nstature with the President's. We in the Senate are entitled--indeed, we \nare obliged--to second guess the President's national interest \ncalculations regarding treaties.\n  There would inevitably be complaints from abroad, including from \nfriends, if we upset the CTBT apple cart. But that unpleasantness would \nbe minor and transitory, especially in light of the permanent harm the \nCTBT would do to our national security. The embarrassment of the \nPresident for buying into such a flawed treaty in the first place is \nnot desirable, but the Senate cannot avert it at any price.\n  Consider again Senator Lugar's words:\n\n       [The CTBT] is problematic because it would exacerbate risks \n     and uncertainties related to the safety of our nuclear \n     stockpile.\n\n  Those are the stakes, and they are serious. That crucial observation \nshould put into perspective the issue of likely complaints from foreign \nfoes and friends.\n  The Senate must fulfill its constitutional duty to ensure that \ntreaties meet at least minimum standards. We do the Presidency no \nfavors by shirking, and we do the Senate and the Nation harm if we \naccede to the President's diplomatic recklessness simply to spare him \nthe chore of mollifying the other states that forged the flawed treaty.\n  A query to my colleagues who are interested in delaying this vote to \navoid the embarrassment of rejecting a treaty negotiated by the \nadministration: Will the Senate defer to the President on the Kyoto \nGlobal Warming Treaty or the ABM multilateralization or demarcation \ntreaties?\n\n  Some administration spokesmen have used the offensive argument that \nSenate rejection of the CTBT would be a message to the world that we \nare not serious about arms control. To the contrary, rejecting this \ntreaty will help establish that we demand real arms control--not the \nshow, not the empty symbols, not the flimflam treaties that cannot \naccomplish their purposes. In rejecting the CTBT, we will be asking the \nworld to join in real antiproliferation measures, such as enforcement \nof the nonproliferation treaty which Russia, China, and North Korea \nviolate every time they spread nuclear weapons technology.\n  I quote again from Senator Lugar:\n\n       If a country breaks the international norm embodied in the \n     CTBT, the country has already broken the norm associated with \n     the nonproliferation treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, that is because 185-some nations have agreed not to \npossess these nuclear weapons, except for the nuclear powers. The \ntesting is simply a redundant violation of the possession in the first \nplace, which is already a violation of the NPT. So this treaty won't \naccomplish its minimal objective.\n  Second, enforcement of the United States resolutions requiring \ninspection of Iraq: It would be very helpful if our allies would help \nin this very meaningful and important activity rather than undercutting \nthe United States at every turn.\n  Again, Senator Lugar hit the point squarely:\n\n       The CTBT verification regime seems to be the embodiment of \n     everything the United States is fighting against in the \n     UNSCOM inspection process in Iraq . . . [which is] best not \n     repeated under the CTBT.\n\n  Third, perhaps we could get their support in our efforts to free U.S. \npolicy from the dead hand of the ABM Treaty and to deploy missile \ndefenses.\n  These are real, meaningful actions against the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction rather than empty symbolic gestures.\n  In asking the Senate to postpone the vote on this treaty until he has \nthe votes, the President is asking, first, to spare him personal \nembarrassment; and, second, to give him a chance to bind the United \nStates to a treaty that most do not think should ever go into force. \nThe CTBT will not improve with age.\n  Most Senators would have been content never to have voted on the \ntreaty. But the President has now denied the Senate that option. He \nwill not agree to forbear demanding consideration of the treaty next \nyear when he hopes to have the votes to pass it. Republicans have not \npoliticized this debate, but it is clear that unless we defeat this \ntreaty now, it will be a political issue next year when allegedly \nchanged circumstances--created, for example, by a new test by India or \nPakistan--will give the President the pretext to revive the debate.\n  It has become clear that the assurances we may now get from the \nPresident and our Democratic colleagues will not be the ironclad \ncommitments we recently agreed were necessary to induce the Senate to \ndefer this vote.\n\n[[Page S12339]]\n\n Therefore, to avoid the President politicizing the issue next year, we \nshould vote now.\n  Sometimes it is necessary to say or do the right thing and just let \nthe chips fall where they may. Ronald Reagan knew he would ruffle lots \nof foreign feathers--including some of our respected allies--when he \ncalled the Soviet Union an evil empire and when he stood his ground \nagainst Gorbachev in Reykjavik in favor of strategic defense. These \nmessages he sent were criticized by many as disruptive. They were \nsound. They served our national interests and the interests of decent \npeople around the world, and history has judged them favorably.\n  The Senate now has a chance to demonstrate strength and the good \nsense worthy of Ronald Reagan. If we do it, we will be flouting much \nconventional thinking, but we will, in fact, enhance our Nation's \ndiplomatic strength, protecting our national security and vindicating \nthe wisdom of America's founding fathers who assigned to the Senate the \nduty to protect the country from ill-conceived international \nobligations.\n  Let the Senate vote to reject the CTBT.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in the waning days of his administration, \nPresident Eisenhower proposed a test ban treaty to end all nuclear \ntests in the atmosphere, in the oceans, and under the ground. Nearly \nfour decades later, the Senate stands on the verge of a vote on \nratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I will vote in favor \nof ratification. I regret the move to postpone a vote because I am of \nthe firm conviction this treaty will help end the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons and increase the safety of the American people.\n  President Eisenhower proposed the test ban having recognized the \nincreasing danger posed by nuclear weapons. At that time, the threat \nwas very real. The American people had a vivid understanding of the \ndevastating consequences of nuclear weapons.\n  Those of us in our fifties remember the threat and the fear that we \nhad as children--the duck and cover drills, the constant reminders of \nthe devastation that a single nuclear weapon could produce to our \ncities and to our communities. In many ways, the problem we have today \ncomes from our success because the fear we once had has been displaced \nby a false sense of complacency, a sense of security that, in my view, \nis not justified, given the facts.\n  I would like to illustrate this danger by a realistic scenario, in my \nview, with a single Russian nuclear weapon. It is possible for a small \nband of discontented or terroristic members of either the Russian \nsociety or some other nation to raid a silo of Russian missiles in the \nRussian wilderness. Soldiers who are poorly trained, sparsely equipped, \nand irate at not having been paid in a year are easily overtaken or are \nwilling to cooperate.\n  Let's pick one city to illustrate the damage. I, again, call to my \ncolleagues' attention that this kind of game playing, this kind of \nexample was quite common as recently as 10 years ago. But today, when \nyou ask what kind of damage could occur as a result of a single nuclear \nblast, you are apt to have people scratching their heads, wondering \nwhat could happen. So let me take Chicago as an example.\n  First of all, unlike many of the other threats in the world, if a \nrocket left Russia, it would arrive in Chicago within an hour, probably \ntaking a trajectory over the top of the world across the Arctic pole. \nIt would detonate in Chicago within an hour, and on a bad day it would \nhit a target within a few hundred yards off Lake Michigan.\n  We spent a great deal of time assessing the danger of the nation of \nChina. Their missiles are not connected to their warheads. Their \nwarheads are disconnected; they are not together. It would take them \nseveral days and they are not targeted with the accuracy and would not \narrive with the same swiftness as an unauthorized or accidental launch \ncoming from Russia.\n\n  The first effect of the blast would be the nuclear flash. The air \nwould be heated to 10 million degrees Celsius. The blast would move out \nat a few hundred kilometers a second and its heat would be sufficient \nto set fire to anything combustible at a distance of 14 kilometers. \nPeople within 80 kilometers would be blinded. The blast effect would \nfollow. It would travel out from ground zero. Within 3 kilometers, \nthose who had not already been killed would die from this percussive \nforce.\n  The details of this kind of a blast needs to be understood by the \nAmerican people as this debate goes forward, because the good news of \nthe end of the cold war has been replaced with the bad news that we are \nincreasingly at risk of individuals or nonnation state people who \nchoose to do damage to the United States of America and do not care if \nthey die in the execution of their mission. They are willing to attack \nthe United States of America and they are willing to take American \nlives without regard to the fact that they may die in the execution of \ntheir mission.\n  A single Russian nuclear weapon launched accidentally, or a single \nnuclear weapon assembled by some rogue nation and delivered by whatever \nthe means to the United States of America, would do more damage than \nany other threat we currently have on the horizon. A single Russian \nsubmarine that was taken over by a similar sort of dissident faction \ncould launch 64 one-hundred-kiloton weapons at the United States. I do \nnot come here to alarm anybody about this. I come simply to remind \npeople that nuclear weapons are still the only threat that could kill \nevery single American. It would not take thousands to bring the United \nStates of America to its knees. It would not take the kind of total \nattack we once feared from the Soviet Union to bring America from being \nthe most powerful economic and military force on the Earth to being \nsomewhat short of No. 1, not only putting us at increasing risk but \nputting the rest of the world at risk as well.\n  CTBT is by no means the only thing we must do in order to reduce the \nrisk of proliferation. I would like to go through a few ideas prior to \ntalking about both our capacity to verify and the confidence I have \nthat we can maintain our stockpile without the need to test.\n  First, we have to maintain our intelligence capabilities: our ability \nto collect intelligence, to process, to disseminate, to deliver that \nintelligence to warfighters is far and away the best in the world. Talk \nto our allies in Kosovo, in Bosnia, in Desert Storm; talk to any of \nthose whose lives were at risk and were allied with the United States \nof America in a military effort and they will tell you our intelligence \ncollection and dissemination capability gave us the capacity to do the \nimpossible.\n  Our intelligence agencies, from time to time, make very highly \npublicized mistakes. Unfortunately, the publicity given to those \nmistakes gives some a lack of confidence in our capability of doing our \nmission. That lack of confidence is misplaced. We are an open society. \nAs a consequence, we tend--correctly so--to examine the things we do \nwhen we make mistakes. Unfortunately, at times it produces a situation \nwhere we are afraid of doing things because we are worried we are going \nto make a highly publicized mistake and therefore that mistake is going \nto ruin our career or make it difficult for us to advance. As a \nconsequence, we sometimes are a little too cautious.\n\n  Americans should not suffer the illusion we currently have the \nintelligence capacity to know everything that is going on in the world; \nwe simply do not. Indeed, we should not. We are not, as well, \nallocating enough resources, in my view, to make certain policymakers \nof the future are informed so conflicts that might occur can be avoided \nand so nuclear threats can be confronted before they emerge to be \nchallenges.\n  The second tool that must be maintained to confront the emerging \nnuclear threat is not only a strong military but an intent to use that \nmilitary to meet any individual or nation state that threatens the \nUnited States of America. Our military is the envy of the world. While \nwe must avoid the temptation of using our military forces in situations \nnot vital to U.S. interests, we must also continue to maintain the will \nto use military force in instances in which our national security is at \nrisk.\n  The third tool is national missile defense. I support the creation of \na limited national missile defense designed\n\n[[Page S12340]]\n\nto protect the United States of America from rogue state ballistic \nmissile launches and accidental launches. While the success of the \nrecent test of a prototype missile defense system demonstrates that \nlimited national missile defense is possible, we must also realize it \nis not a panacea for the dangers we will confront.\n  The fourth tool in our effort to secure the post-cold-war peace is \nfurther reductions in the American and Russian nuclear arsenals. I have \nargued on the Senate floor previously the President should immediately \ntake bold action to restart the arms control process. If we do not \ndrastically reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, the danger of \ntheir accidental use or proliferation will increase exponentially. I \nrecognize that deep reductions--while decreasing the chance of \nunauthorized or accidental launch--could actually increase the danger \nof material proliferation. Therefore, any such parallel reductions in \nour nuclear forces must include arrangements and a U.S. commitment to \nprovide funding to secure and manage the resultant nuclear material. \nThis is the fifth tool. We are fortunate we will not begin from scratch \non this problem. We can build on one of the greatest acts of the post-\ncold-war statesmanship, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram.\n  The final piece of the nuclear safety puzzle is the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. I support the CTBT because I believe it will enhance \nU.S. national security, reduce nuclear dangers, and keep the American \npeople safe. Let me explain how.\n  First, a fully implemented CTBT will all but halt the ability of \nthreshold states from establishing an effective and reliable strategic \nnuclear force. The inability of nations such as Iran and North Korea to \nconduct nuclear tests will make it much less likely for them to become \nnuclear powers. Along the same line, the inability of existing nuclear \nstates to conduct further nuclear tests will impede, if not stop, their \nefforts to make technological advances in yields and miniaturization, \nadvances already achieved by the United States.\n  Bluntly speaking, we have the most effective and deadly nuclear force \nin the world. Therefore, to maintain our existing nuclear edge, it is \nin our interest to ratify the CTBT and to halt the nuclear development \nadvancement of other nations.\n  In addition, we all have experienced coming to this Chamber to vote \non a sanction imposed upon an individual nation as a consequence of us \njudging correctly that that nation poses a threat and, in many cases, a \npotential nuclear threat to the United States of America.\n  We struggle with that vote because we know a unilateral sanction by \nthe United States of America will oftentimes be used by our allies as a \nmeans for them to capture the market share of some product we were \nselling to that nation. With this treaty, it is far more likely the \nSecurity Council will support multilateral sanctions that will enable \nus to get the desired effect without us having to suffer adverse \nconsequences as a consequence of unilateral sanctions.\n  In the post-cold-war era, nuclear weapons have become the Rolex \nwristwatch of international security, a costly purchase whose real \npurpose is not the service it provides but the prestige it confers. \nRatification and implementation of the CTBT is in our national security \ninterest precisely because it will help slow the expansion of the \nnuclear club and make it more difficult for nations to acquire these \ndeadly weapons.\n  Opponents of the CTBT focus their criticisms on two main points: \nverifiability of the treaty and the safety of our nuclear stockpile. \nLet me address each of these issues separately.\n  First, we can effectively monitor and verify CTBT. I purposely say \n``effectively monitor and verify'' because absolute verification is \nneither attainable nor a necessary standard. But it is the standard \nthat some have attempted to establish as a benchmark for ratification. \nNo treaty is absolutely verifiable.\n  My support for this treaty comes from my firm conviction that by \nusing existing assets, the United States can effectively monitor and \nverify this treaty. I base my convictions on the testimony of Gen. John \nGordon, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, and on the briefings \non this topic received by the Intelligence Committee over the years \nand, most important, the performance of those men and women who work in \na variety of agencies whose task it is to collect, to process, to \nevaluate, to analyze, and to disseminate intelligence to national \ncustomers, as well as war fighters who are defending the people of the \nUnited States of America.\n  The United States has the capability to detect any test that can \nthreaten our nuclear deterrence. The type of test that could be \nconducted without our knowledge could only be marginally useful and \nwould not cause a shift in the existing strategic nuclear balance. In \naddition, the United States has the capability to detect the level of \ntesting that would be required for another country to develop and to \nweaponize an advanced thermonuclear warhead.\n  Our intelligence community is the best in the world. This gives us an \nenormous lead over every other signatory. Public disclosures of \nintelligence community problems may have shaken confidence in our \nintelligence capabilities, but let me assure my colleagues that their \nconfidence should not be shaken. U.S. intelligence has the ability to \nknow what is occurring around the world regarding the development of \nnuclear weapons. It is our intelligence community that largely gives \nSecretary Cohen and General Shelton their confidence to say the treaty \nshould be ratified because it is in our national interest to do so.\n\n  I will briefly describe how we will know what is happening when \nsomeone tries to cheat. I will use all caution to make certain I give \naway nothing that will provide our enemies with indications of what our \nsources or our methods are, but I urge colleagues who doubt this to get \nfull briefings on what our collection capability is and what we are \nable to do to determine whether or not somebody is in violation of this \ntreaty.\n  I will briefly describe, as I said, and because the existence of this \nhighly secretive organization, the National Reconnaissance Office, has \nfinally been declassified--we are able now to admit that from space, \nthe United States can see you and can gather signals intelligence. I \nurge colleagues to get a full briefing on what the NRO can do in a \nclassified fashion. I believe my colleagues fully understand the \nsignificance of what I just said.\n  Every part of the globe is accessible from space. There you will find \nsatellite reconnaissance either watching or collecting electrical \nsignals from those who would do damage to the United States of America. \nThat is a tremendous capability that no one else can equal. This global \naccessibility from space is just one feature of a very complicated and \ncomplex system of collecting and analyzing information.\n  The National Security Agency is a second feature. They exploit \nforeign communications. That is the official unclassified description \nof its mission: NSA exploits foreign communications. Recently, \nHollywood has enjoyed making a couple of movies showing how NSA is a \nthreat to our Nation. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a \nHollywood make-believe story that is completely inaccurate and false. \nNSA is not a threat to us. If you are an unfriendly foreign government \nwanting to cheat on CTBT, NSA is certainly a threat to you.\n  To quote from their official unclassified agency description: ``They \nare on the cutting edge of information technology.'' They know what is \ngoing on in the explosion of information technology.\n  There is a third area beyond NSA, and that is called MASINT. It is a \npretty strange term for most people. It means measurement and \nsignatures intelligence, the recognition that in addition to being seen \nand being heard, objects, especially electronic objects, have other \nsignatures. Like your personal signature--if we collect enough \ninformation about someone's signature, it is not like anything else, it \nis unique, and we know exactly what it is, and we are collecting \nMASINT.\n  The Central Intelligence Agency gives us a fourth important feature. \nThe CIA employs a network of agents around the world who constantly \nprovide what is called HUMINT, human intelligence. HUMINT is a term of \nart\n\n[[Page S12341]]\n\nwhich simply recognizes people tend to talk, and when they do talk, we \ntry to have an agent listening. If an agent hears something, it is fed \ninto a fifth and important feature of the agency, and that is the CIA \nDirectorate of Intelligence.\n  The men and women of the CIA DI sift through enormous amounts of data \nevery day and separate fact from fiction, truth from lies. Through \ntheir analysis of all intelligence sources, they provide policymakers \nwith crisp statements of what our potential adversaries are doing and \nnot doing. If information is out there to get, we will get it. If it is \nimportant, we will analyze it and understand it. Once we understand \nit, policymakers will make sound decisions if someone decides to cheat \non the CTBT.\n\n  I am trying to paint a picture of just how sophisticated our \nintelligence community is. It is a community that on occasion has been \nfooled, but it has not been fooled often, and it has rarely been fooled \nfor very long. We have a world-class intelligence capability. We can \ncount on the intelligence community to monitor the CTBT and effectively \nverify it.\n  A second argument that has been used against the treaty by some is \nbased upon the suspension of nuclear testing required by the CTBT and \nthe argument that this will jeopardize the safety and reliability of \nthe U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. I have an extremely high level of \nconfidence in the nuclear stockpile even without continued testing.\n  The science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program, on which the United \nStates is spending $4.5 billion a year, is maintaining our \ntechnological edge without the need for further testing for the \nforeseeable future. This program is based on the most advanced science \nin the world. It is based on over 50 years of nuclear experience. It is \nbased on the results of over 1,000 American nuclear tests. It is a \nprogram that relies on the ability and ingenuity of U.S. scientists to \nmaintain our nuclear edge. But it is also a program that recognizes the \nneed to build in adequate safeguards to ensure safety and reliability.\n  The Stockpile Stewardship Program requires a rigorous annual review \nof the entire nuclear stockpile. As a part of this regime, both the \nSecretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy must certify to the \nPresident on an annual basis the stockpile is safe and is reliable. \nShould either Secretary be unable to offer this certification, the \nPresident, in consultation with Congress, is prepared to exercise the \nright of the United States to withdraw from the treaty and to resume \ntesting.\n  The United States has not conducted a nuclear test for over 7 years, \nbut the American people should understand our nuclear stockpile is \nsafe. Both the safeguards and the science exists to continue to assure \nits safety well into the future. And since we have made the decision we \ndo not need to test, it only makes sense that we use the CTBT to end \ntesting throughout the world.\n  Reflecting on his time in office, and his failure to achieve the goal \nof a nuclear test ban, President Eisenhower stated: ``Disarmament . . . \nis a continuous imperative. . . . Because this need is so sharp and \napparent, I confess I lay down my official responsibilities in this \nfield with a definite sense of disappointment.''\n  The Senate now has the opportunity to ratify the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty. We should ratify this treaty because, just as when it was \nfirst proposed nearly 4 decades ago, it is a positive step toward \nreducing nuclear dangers and improving the safety of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I see my friend from the great State of \nMontana is up to speak. I ask the chairman of the----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Delaware yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the question that I have for the Senator \nrelates to the letter from President Clinton to our distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, where President Clinton has asked that \nthe Senate not consider consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  I believe it is very much in the national interest that we not vote \non the treaty today because it would undermine national security by \nsending a message to the world that we are not for this treaty. I think \nit would encourage nations such as India and Pakistan, and perhaps \nrogue nations such as Libya, Iraq, and Iran, to test.\n  But the first of two questions which I have for the Senator from \nDelaware is whether the President might go further. The Senator and I \nattended a dinner last Tuesday night with the President. We both had \noccasion to talk to the majority leader and have heard the public \npronouncements. The majority leader has set a threshold, asking that \nthe President commit in writing that he would not ask to have the \ntreaty brought up next year. I believe we have to find a way to work \nthis out so the treaty is not voted on.\n  The first question I have of the Senator from Delaware is, What are \nthe realities of getting the President to make that request? He has \ncome pretty close in this letter. Why not make that additional request?\n  Mr. BIDEN. In response to my friend from Pennsylvania, I will say \nthat I, obviously, cannot speak for the President. But he has gone \nawfully far. He says: ``I believe that proceeding to a vote under these \ncircumstances would severely harm the national security of the United \nStates, damage our relationship with our allies, and undermine our \nhistoric leadership,'' et cetera. ``Accordingly, I request that you \npostpone consideration of [this] Test Ban Treaty on the Senate floor.''\n  Unless there is something incredible that is likely to happen in the \nnext 8 months, the President is not going to be--and I realize this is \na legitimate worry on the part of some; that the President will wait \nuntil the middle of an election year and raise a political issue by \nforcing people to vote for or against this treaty--but the likelihood \nof changing the votes of 22 Republican Senators between now and the \nelection is zero, I would respectfully suggest.\n  So what the President has done here is done the only thing I think a \nchief executive--Democrat or Republican--should do; that is, he did \njust as Jimmy Carter did when he asked for SALT II to be taken down. He \ndid not make a commitment he would not try to have it brought up. That \nis not what his letter said. What he said is: Bring it down. Don't vote \non it now. It is not in the national interest.\n  To have a President of the United States say, the treaty I, in fact, \nnegotiated--I want to go on record as saying you should not consider it \nat all during the remainder of my term in office, surely damages his \nability to deal internationally.\n  So I think he is observing the reality of the circumstance, which \nmeans that there will be no vote next year on the floor of the Senate--\nfor if that were the case, you might as well go ahead and have the vote \nnow.\n  The letter Jimmy Carter sent--and I shall read it--said:\n\n       In light of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, I \n     request that you delay consideration of the SALT II Treaty \n     on the Senate floor.\n       The purpose of this request is not to withdraw the Treaty \n     from consideration, but to defer the debate so that the \n     Congress and I as President can assess Soviet actions and \n     intentions, and devote our primary attention to the \n     legislative and other measures required to respond to the \n     crisis.\n       As you know, I continue to share your view that the SALT II \n     Treaty is in the national security interest of the United \n     States and the entire world, and that it should be taken up \n     by the Senate as soon as these more urgent issues have been \n     addressed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jimmy Carter.\n\n  This letter of the President of the United States--this President--\ngoes a lot further than President Carter went in pulling down SALT II. \nBut for the President to go beyond that, it seems to me, is to be \nbeyond what we should be asking any executive.\n  The Senator from Virginia has worked mightily to try to resolve this. \nHe has gone so far as to draft a letter which a number of Senators are \nlikely to sign, if they have not already signed, saying: In addition to \nthe President asking this be brought down, we the undersigned Senators \nask that it be brought down. And we have no intention of bringing that \ntreaty up next year. We do not think the treaty should be brought up in \nthe election year.\n  To make the President, from an institutional standpoint, guarantee \nthat\n\n[[Page S12342]]\n\nhe is now against the treaty that he ratified, it seems to me, is to be \ngoing beyond institutional good taste.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. For a question, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HELMS. I want to ponder a question to the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. HELMS. It was my understanding--perhaps mistakenly--that we were \nto go from side to side in our discussions. If that is not the case, I \nask unanimous consent that it be the case, when both sides are on the \nfloor seeking the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will respond. There has been a \nunanimous consent request that has been agreed to that to the extent \npossible that will be done. In this case, the ranking member sought \nrecognition, and no other person sought recognition.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator has been on his feet 20 minutes here. And two \nSenators have taken the floor from him. I want it to be understood I do \nnot want that to happen again.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it was not my intention--I thought the \nSenator from North Carolina, in effect, acknowledged that I should take \nthe question from the Senator from the State of Pennsylvania. I \napologize.\n  Mr. HELMS. I did not think it would be four questions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am not propounding the questions. I am \njust trying to answer the question. I hope I answered the Senator's \nquestion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I believe I asked one question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I had one more.\n  I believe I asked one question. I had one more. I would like leave to \nask one more question.\n  The question I have for Senator Biden is, Is there any other way \nprocedurally that this vote can be put off? We are considering the \ntreaty. There is a unanimous consent request, and while I do not agree \nwith what the Senator said in his first response--I believe the \nPresident can say more without being against the treaty. And I believe \nthere are political considerations which are behind not having the \nmatter brought up in fair consideration to Senator Lott's request there \nbe a commitment not to take it up all year. I think it highly unlikely \nthat there would be a shift among Republicans on a procedural matter to \nfind 51 votes--50 votes plus the Vice President. But we are dealing \nhere with matters of extraordinary gravity. I hope this matter can be \nworked out short of a procedural vote.\n  But I direct this question to the Senator from Delaware, whether \nthere is any other procedural alternative to getting this vote off the \nSenate agenda.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will respond very briefly and then yield \nto my friend from North Carolina.\n  My knowledge of Senate procedure pales in comparison to the Senator \nfrom North Carolina. I am not being solicitous. That is a statement of \nfact. But it is my understanding that the only procedural means by \nwhich we could move from this treaty to other business without a vote \nwould be if there were a motion to move from the Executive Calendar to \nthe legislative calendar. That would, as I understand it, require 51 \nvotes. That is the only thing of which I know. I do not know if anyone \nis going to do that.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the floor to my friend.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask the Parliamentarian for his views on it now, to get \nthat settled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian advises that the Senator's \nstatement is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, that may be the first time my procedural \njudgment has ever been ruled to be correct on the floor of the Senate. \nI am very happy the Senator suggested I ask that.\n  Mr. HELMS. I think the Senator has forgotten many times when he was \ncorrect.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator is very nice to say that. Seldom procedurally. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask the distinguished Senator from Montana, who has been \nawaiting a chance to speak, be recognized for such time as he may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nand the Chair.\n  I listened to the exchange. It is very interesting. Why we are in \nthis debate was not initiated by this side of the aisle. This whole \nprocess was not initiated by this side of the aisle. It was a reaction \nthat was initiated by our friends on the other side. That is irrelevant \nright now. What is relevant is our Nation's security and the merits of \nthis treaty and how it affects us and our national security. We have \nbut one deterrent for the safety of the people who live in this \ncountry, and that is our reliable nuclear capability. Once it is \nquestioned, then our ability to deter in this world of uncertainty \nwould be damaged.\n  I rise to record my opposition to Senate passage of the Comprehensive \nTest Ban treaty. This treaty bans all nuclear testing forever. Thus, it \nis a ban on ``bang'' for all time; it is not a ban on bombs. No one \nought to be under the illusion that this treaty ends nuclear weapons \ndevelopment by America's foes. At home, an essential part of the \nadministration's plan to implement the treaty is a ``safeguards \npackage''. The mere existence of the safeguards package speaks for \nitself: without them, the treaty poses too many risks. Unfortunately, \nthe treaty we are asked to vote upon contains none of the safeguards \nbecause the terms of the treaty expressly preclude making the \nsafeguards package part of the treaty. In other words, the treaty \nprohibits meaningful reservations. Consequently, we are asked to bet on \nthe come that the administration can deliver all that is promises in \nthe safeguards package, not only in the next few years but far into the \nfuture. We are told that the Joint Chiefs of Staff support the treaty \nwith the safeguards and is unable to comment on the merits of the \ntreaty without the safeguards. I fully understand the Chain of Command. \nOur leaders also understand the Chain of Command. We do not have to \nread too much between the lines to conclude that without the safeguards \npackage, this treaty poses unacceptable risks to our national security.\n  A total ban on all nuclear testing for all time has never been \nsupported by prior Presidents-and for sound reasons. This \nadministration's best sales pitch for a total ban on bangs for all time \nis that it is an important step in the direction of doing away with the \nthreat of nuclear war. This is a nice dream and a great idea for \nanother planet. But on earth it is a downright dangerous false hope. \nThe complete ban treaty has a fatal flaw in the real world: the treaty \nis unenforceable. In one sentence, the fatal flaw is that violations \ncannot be verified.\n  The best intentions humans can conceive are of no use if the treaty \nis not implemented not only by us but also by the other nuclear \nplayers. And what is the score? Well Russia and China have not ratified \nthis treaty and they are unlikely to do so. Even if they did, either \none could veto any attempts at enforcement by the U.N. Security \nCouncil. North Korea did not even participate in the negotiations about \nthe treaty. India and Pakistan have not signed on to the treaty. The \nscore on rogue nations such as Iraq and Libya varies but we have to ask \nwhether they could be trusted to keep their commitments anyway. The \nadministration has, once again, gone off and negotiated a deal that is \nnot acceptable to the Senate. I suppose the White House media spin will \nagain be that the United States will suffer a loss of world leadership \nif the Senate does not buy this pig in a pike treaty. Well maybe the \nnegotiators should have thought of that before they put American's \ncredibility on the line. The spinmeisters should re-read our \nConstitution. Treaties must be acceptable to two thirds of the \nSenators. That requirement has been there since the founding of the \nRepublic. The White House should not pretend to be shocked when the \nSenate turns down a treaty that it does not like because the treaty has \nno teeth. there are too many undefined characters in the world who are \nunaffected by this treaty.\n  This treaty is not a good idea for a number of other reasons. The \nagreement puts international handcuffs on nuclear technology testing by \nthe United States. Our country needs to have access to the testing of \ncurrent and possible future nuclear weapons,\n\n[[Page S12343]]\n\ndefensive as well as offensive. We know that some nations play fast and \nloose with nuclear weapons technology. This is not the case generally \nin the United States and is not the case specifically in Montana where \nwe maintain many Minutemen III missiles. Part of the Safeguard \nStewardship and Management Program proposed by the Administration to \nsell this treaty is to assure us that the nuclear stockpile remains \nsafe and reliable. But tests needed to create the data base and \nmethodologies for stockpile stewardship have not been done during the \nseven year moratoria our nation has voluntarily followed on testing and \nwould not be done under the mandatory terms of the treaty before us. \nSimply stated, the technology for stockpile stewardship is unproven. \nKey safety and reliability data can only be obtained from the actual \ntesting of weapons. We cannot take a chance on when or whether our \nnuclear weapons will go off. Can you imagine putting all your faith in \nan airplane flying right without making actual flight tests.? The \npilots I know still think an aircraft has to be flown before they are \nconvinced of its safety and reliability. Likewise, data from past tests \ncannot adequately predict the impacts of ongoing problems such as aging \ntaking into account the highly corrosive nature of materials with a \nshelf life of 20 years. What do we do in 25 years? The administration's \nanswer is to rely upon computer simulations or, as a last resort, to \nwithdraw from the treaty. The stakes are too high to depend upon \ntheoretical models and any treaty can be killed by a later law. But I \nsubmit these actions are closing the barn door after the horses are \ngone. Montanans as well as all Americans must have confidence in the \nsafety and reliability of the refurbished nuclear warheads remaining in \nour country. Our troops in the field must also have confidence in the \nnuclear weapons they carry. This test ban treaty precludes us from \nundertaking the technology testing that is essential for keeping \nconfidence in our nuclear deterrent capability.\n  The cold war may be over but the threat posed to the United States \nfrom nuclear weapons in hostile hands is far from over. Russia refuses \nto ratify Start II and continues to insist (along with the \nadministration) on strict compliance with the 1972 ABM Treaty. If ever \nthere was a lesson about not freezing nuclear technology in time, the \nABM Treaty is the model. Most Americans still do not know that our \ncountry is absolutely defenseless against ballistic missile attack not \nonly from Russia but also from any where else. There is mounting \nevidence that China has stolen priceless nuclear secrets from our \nnational laboratories. Only a complete fool would think that the \nactions of the Chinese indicate that they would curtail their rapid \nadvancement towards being a nuclear power, with or without this test \nban treaty. Neither India nor Pakistan have signed on to this treaty \nand I suppose the administration will try to blame that on the Senate \nsomehow. I submit, however, that the positions of Pakistan and India on \ntheir nuclear status have nothing whatsoever to do with this debate in \nthe Senate. We are aware that there are half dozen rogue nations out \nthere. They must really lick their lips when they think about America \nnot testing nuclear weapons anymore. Who seriously thinks this treaty \nwill slow down despots who pose current and future irresponsible and, \nperhaps, irrational nuclear threats to the United States? The \nadministration is making a serious error in judgment in mixing up what \nStates say at diplomatic conferences with what they go back home. This \nis not the time to handicap ourselves by assuming test ban obligations \nthat we would keep but others would either violate or ignore.\n  I have been called by many representatives of other states and heads \nof states. I asked one question: Will the signing of this test ban \ntreaty change the attitude of the Russians? Answer: No. By the PRC, the \nChinese? No. Will it change the attitude in India or Pakistan or North \nKorea or other suspected rogue entities? No. Then why do we put \nourselves in jeopardy by not testing?\n  In conclusion, I believe this treaty is fatally flawed because it is \nnot enforceable and will be ignored by the very nations we distrust. \nMoreover, to retain a credible nuclear deterrent capability, we must \nretain our ability to test our weapon systems for safety and \nreliability. Therefore, this treaty hurts us while helping our \npotential enemies. My vote is to oppose advice and consent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I believe the real question before us is \nwhether or not the world will be safer with or without the nuclear test \nban treaty. I believe we are safer.\n  From a very self-interested standpoint, if this treaty is adopted, it \ngives us the very real potential of locking all of our potential \nadversaries into permanent nuclear inferiority because they will not be \nable to conduct the sophisticated tests necessary to improve their \ntechnology, particularly when it comes to the miniaturization of \nnuclear warheads. It will, also, I think, contribute to an overall \nspirit which is advancing the cause of nuclear disarmament and also \nending the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  On the other side of the coin, if we step back from this treaty today \nand vote it down, I think we will set back this progress in trying to \nreduce nuclear arms throughout the world. All of us have come to this \nfloor with different viewpoints, but I suspect we would all say the \nprocess we have undertaken is somewhat suspect. I spent 12 years in the \nArmy, and I learned to grow up under the rule of ``hurry up and wait.'' \nWell, this process resembles ``wait and hurry up.'' The President \nsubmitted this treaty to the Senate over 2 years ago. Yet for months, \nno action was taken. Then last week, suddenly it was announced that we \nwould conduct a very limited debate, that we would have hastily \nconstructed hearings, and that we would move to a vote.\n  I think that process alone suggests that we wait, at least--as we \nconsider more carefully this treaty to discharge our obligations under \nthe Constitution--for a thorough and detailed analysis of all the \nconsequences. Indeed, this is a very complex subject matter, as the \ndebate on the floor today and preceding days has indicated.\n  I believe we need to take additional time. I hope we can take \nadditional time. But if the measure were to come before this body for a \nvote, I would vote to support the treaty because, as I have said, I \nthink passing this treaty would provide a safer world. Rejecting this \ntreaty would, I think, disrupt dramatically any further attempts at a \nsignificant comprehensive reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the \nworld.\n  I think it is somewhat naive to suggest that if this Senate rejected \nthe treaty, we could simply go back next week and begin to negotiate \nagain on different terms. I think we would be sending a very strong and \ndangerous signal to the world that we, rather than carefully \nconsidering this treaty, have rejected it almost outright. I think, \nalso, together with other developments, such as our genuine attempts to \nlook for a relaxation of the ABM Treaty, rejection could be construed \nas not suggesting we are serious about nuclear disarmament but, quite \nthe contrary, that we ourselves are beginning to look at nuclear \nweapons and nuclear technology in a different light, a light less \nfavorable.\n  Let me suggest something else. This treaty will not prevent us from \ntesting our nuclear technology. It will prevent us, though, from \nconducting tests involving nuclear detonation. We can in fact go on and \ntest our technology. We have been testing our technology constantly \nover the last 7 years without a nuclear detonation.\n  This treaty would not ban nuclear weapons. This treaty also would \nprovide for an extensive regime of monitoring sites--over 300 in 90 \ncountries. It would allow for onsite inspection if, in fact, a \nsignificant number of signatories to the treaty were convinced that a \nviolation took place. These additional monitoring sites, together with \nthe onsite inspections, are tools that do not exist today to curb the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons and the development of new nuclear \nweapons.\n  There has been some discussion about our ability to monitor the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons and, indeed, to monitor clandestine \ntests of nuclear devices. I think the suggestion has been made--and I \nthink it is inaccurate--that a nuclear detonation could take place \nwithout anybody\n\n[[Page S12344]]\n\nknowing anything at all about it. That is not the case at all. Just \nlast week, there was an article in the Washington Post entitled ``CIA \nUnable To Precisely Track Testing.'' If you read the article, it is \nclear that the CIA was able to detect two suspicious detonations at a \nRussian test site in the Arctic from seismic data and other monitoring \ndevices. What they could not determine is whether this detonation was \nhigh explosives of a nonnuclear category or a nuclear detonation. But \ncertainly we will have indications, if there is a clandestine test, \nthat the possibility of a nuclear detonation has taken place. That \nalone will give us, I believe, the basis to go forward and ask for \nonsite inspections and for an explanation, to use the levers of this \ntreaty which we do not have at this moment.\n\n  So the issue of verification, I think, is something that is quite \nobvious and prominent within this treaty, and the means of verification \nwere discussed at length by my colleague from Nebraska who pointed out \nall the different techniques our intelligence service has to identify \npossible violations of this treaty and, with this treaty, to be able to \npress those violations in a world forum so we can ascertain whether the \ntreaty has been adhered to or violated.\n  The whole notion of controlling nuclear testing is not new. \nThroughout this debate, my colleagues have discussed the initiatives \nthat began as early as the 1950s with President Eisenhower. Then, in \n1963, President Kennedy was able to sign, and the Senate ratified, the \nLimited Test Ban Treaty which outlawed nuclear explosions in the sea, \natmosphere, and in outer space. In 1974, we entered into a treaty with \nthe Soviet Union--the Threshold Test Ban Treaty--which prohibited \nunderground testing with yields greater than 150 kilotons. In 1992, \nCongress passed the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment which called for a \nmoratorium on testing. We are still observing today.\n  Also, I think it would be appropriate to point out that in fact for \nthe last 7 years, we have not detonated nuclear devices. Yet each and \nevery year, our scientists, the experts in the Department of Defense \nand Department of Energy, have certified that our nuclear stockpile is \nboth safe and reliable. So the assertion that we can never assure the \nreliability and safety of our nuclear stockpile without testing has \nbeen disproven over the last 7 years. We have done that.\n  Now, I believe we can in fact maintain a nuclear stockpile that is \nboth safe and reliable. We can do it using the new technology we are \ndeveloping, including but not exclusively related to, computer \nsimulations. We can do it by investing, as we are each year, billions \nof dollars--over $4 billion--so we can ensure that we have a safe \nnuclear stockpile and that these weapons would be reliable if we were \nforced to use them.\n  There is something else I think should be pointed out. This treaty \nhas been endorsed and recommended to us by the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Energy. \nThese are individuals who take very seriously their responsibility for \nthe national security of the United States. But some might suggest, \nwell, they are part of this administration and we really know that, \nreading between the lines, their recommendation might not be as \ncompelling as others.\n  But such logic would not suggest or explain why individuals such Gen. \nJohn Shalikashvili, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; \nGen. Colin Powell; Gen. David Jones; or Adm. William Crowe would in \nfact be supportive of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Nobody would \nsuggest why other prominent military officers, such as John Galvin, \nformer Supreme Allied Commander in Europe; Gen. Charles Horner, who \ncommanded the air forces in Desert Storm; Bernard Rogers, another \nformer Commander of NATO and Supreme Commander in Europe, would also \nrecommend and support this treaty. These individuals are concerned \nabout security and have spent their lives in uniform dedicated to the \nsecurity of this Nation and the protection of our people. They believe, \nas I do, that this will be a safer world with this treaty rather than \nif we reject this treaty. With this treaty, I think we can curtail \ndramatically the development of nuclear weapons by opposing powers to \nthe United States.\n  It is true that you can develop a nuclear weapon without a test. You \ncan develop the unsophisticated rudimentary weapons that were used in \nWorld War II. But you cannot develop the sophisticated technology which \nis the key to strategic nuclear power without nuclear testing.\n  If we accept this treaty, if we join with other nations, then we will \nbe in a much stronger position, and the world will be in a much \nstronger position, to ensure that countries such as India, Pakistan, \nand North Korea will be very challenged to develop the kind of \nsophisticated nuclear weapons that will alter the strategic balance \nthroughout the world. That in and of itself, I believe, will make it a \nsafer world.\n  Of course, the elimination of testing will have a positive \nenvironmental effect. Even though our tests now throughout the world \nare restricted underground, there is always the possibility of leakage \nof radioactive material. And we know how devastating that can be.\n  There are those who have been here today who argued that we should \nreject this treaty because it is not 100 percent verifiable. I would \nsuggest that we can, in fact, verify this treaty--that 100 percent is \nnot the standard we would reasonably use. As I have indicated \npreviously, we have already detected what we suspect are suspicious \ndetonations in Russia. We would be even better prepared to do that with \n300 more monitoring stations in 90 countries around the world. In fact, \nwe would then have an international forum to take our complaints and to \nforce an explanation, and, if necessary, an onsite inspection of a \ntest.\n  I think we have an obligation to carefully review and consider this \ntreaty. I believe that we do. And that consideration would be enhanced \nby additional time. I think it would be appropriate to take additional \ntime. But it would be a terrible, I think, disservice to the process of \nnuclear disarmament, of nuclear nonproliferation, and of a saner world \nif we were to reject this treaty out of hand. And the world is \nwatching.\n  President Clinton was the first head of state to sign this treaty. \nOne-hundred and fifty nations followed. Forty-one nations have ratified \nthe treaty, and several more, including Russia, are waiting again for \nour lead in ratifying. Unless we are part of this treaty, this treaty \nwill never go into effect because it requires all of the nuclear \npowers--those with nuclear weapons or with nuclear capabilities--to be \na party to the treaty before it can go into effect. I hope we either in \nour wisdom consider this more, or in our wisdom accept ratifying this \ntreaty.\n  Thirty-six years ago when the Limited Test Ban Treaty came to this \nfloor, a great leader of this Senate, Senator Everett Dirksen, was one \nof the forces who decided to take a very bold step that was as equally \ndaunting and challenging as the step we face today. His words were:\n\n       A young President calls this treaty the first step. I want \n     to take a first step, Mr. President. One my age should think \n     about his destiny a little. I should not like to have written \n     on my tombstone, ``He knew what happened at Hiroshima, but he \n     did not take a first step.''\n\n  The treaty is not the first step. But it is, I believe, the next \nlogical step that we must take. I believe none of us want to look back \nand say that we were hesitant to take this step, that we were hesitant \nto continue the march away from the nuclear apocalypse to a much saner \nand a much safer world.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Helms.\n  Mr. President, this whole debate reminds me of what the great \nphilosopher Yogi Berra once said: It is like ``deja vu all over \nagain.''\n  I thought we pretty well settled this argument years ago--back in the \n1970s and the 1980s--when the idea of unilateral disarmament through a \nnuclear freeze was proposed as the only way to end the nuclear arms \nrace between the United States and Russia. We rejected the nuclear \nfreeze concept. We put national security first. We won the cold\n\n[[Page S12345]]\n\nwar, not through unilateral disarmament and symbolic gestures but \nthrough strength, and we defeated the evil empire. The world is safer \nand we have been able to substantially reduce the number of nuclear \nwarheads and the threat of nuclear conflict.\n  So it is difficult to understand why this argument is back before the \nSenate today. It is difficult to understand why a U.S. President is \nback before us asking us to ratify an agreement which would tie this \nNation's hands behind its back and jeopardize our national security.\n  None of us support nuclear war. We are all against nuclear \nproliferation. But agreeing to forego all future testing of nuclear \nweapons is not the way to get there. It is a matter of national \nsecurity, of safety, and of common sense.\n  Because we refused to accept the siren call of the nuclear freeze \nmovement in the 1970s, we won the cold war, and we have subsequently \nbeen able to reduce our arsenal of nuclear warheads from 12,000 to \n6,000 under the START II treaty. The number is expected to be reduced \nfurther to 3,000 warheads by the year 2003. But despite these \nreductions and this progress, the United States must maintain a \nreliable nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future.\n  Although the cold war is over, significant threats to our country \nstill exist. At present, our nuclear capability provides us a deterrent \nthat is critical to our Nation and is relied on as a safety umbrella by \nmost countries around the world.\n  As long as our national security and our own nuclear deterrent rely \non the nuclear capability, we must be able to periodically test our \nexisting weapons as necessary to ensure their reliability and their \nsafety.\n  Reliability is essential. If our nuclear weapons are not reliable, \nthey are not much of a credible deterrent, and the nuclear umbrella \nthat we and our allies count on for our mutual defense will have gaping \nholes in it.\n  We have to face reality. Our nuclear stockpile is aging. Our nuclear \ninventory is older than it has ever been, and nuclear materials and \ncomponents degrade in unpredictable ways--in some cases causing the \nweapons to fail. Without testing, those potential problems will go \nundetected. Upgrades will not be possible. Reliability will suffer.\n  Safety is also essential. A permanent ban on testing would jeopardize \nthe safety of our nuclear arsenal by preventing us from integrating the \nmost modern advanced safety measures into our weapons. Even now our \nnuclear arsenal is not as safe as we can make it. Of the nine weapons \nsystems currently on hand, only one employs all of the most modern and \nsecure measures available. Safety modifications of this kind would \nrequire testing to make sure they worked as intended.\n  Sure, advocates of this treaty argue there are some other measures of \ntesting a weapon--safety and reliability. The Clinton administration \nhas proposed an ambitious program known as the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram which would use computer modeling and simulations to detect \nreliability and safety. However, many of the components of this system \nare unbuilt and untested. The National Ignition Facility, which is the \ncenterpiece of this program, is not scheduled to be completed until the \nyear 2003. There are already reports that it is years behind schedule. \nIt would be foolhardy to entrust our nuclear security to an unproven \nprogram which probably won't even be fully operational by the year \n2010. Reliability and safety: There must be certainty; at this point \nonly live testing provides that kind of certainty.\n\n  This treaty is based on a very noble, well-intentioned goal. There is \nno question that if the Senate were to ratify this treaty, it would be \na grand symbolic gesture, but noble goals and symbolic gestures are no \nsubstitute for good policy and hard reality.\n  I have already talked about a couple of reasons why this treaty is \nnot good policy--safety and reliability. But there are a couple of \nother reasons this treaty fails the hard-reality test, as well: \nVerification and enforcement. The hard reality is that the United \nStates usually tries to live up to the agreements it signs. If we \nratify this treaty, we will live by it; we have no guarantee other \nnations will be so inclined to follow the letter of the law.\n  Under this treaty, verification would be very difficult and \nenforcement would be impossible. It has no teeth. It is difficult now \nto detect nuclear tests with any confidence, and the verification \nmonitoring provisions in this treaty don't add to that confidence level \nat all. Yes, we could request onsite inspections if we thought someone \nhad been cheating, but that request would have to be approved by a \nsupermajority in the 51-member executive council. In addition, each \ncountry under the treaty has the right to declare 50-square-kilometer \nareas off limits to any inspection.\n  Even if we did catch a cheater, the treaty has almost no teeth--\npossible trade sanctions. That's it, possible trade sanctions. And we \nknow how difficult it is to maintain multilateral trade sanctions \nagainst Iraq, a country that blatantly invaded and looted a neighboring \ncountry and which consistently defies international inspection teams. \nNo one can believe we would be more effective at enforcing sanctions \nagainst more responsible nations of greater commercial importance such \nas India and Pakistan. There are no teeth.\n  That brings us back to the hard reality. Would we obey the treaty? \nYes, we would obey the treaty because that is the way we are. And \nothers would obey the treaty if it suited their whims of the moment. \nThe hard reality is if we ratify this treaty, we sacrifice our national \nsecurity, jeopardize the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. \nAnd what do we get in return? A noble, symbolic gesture. Nothing more. \nIt is not worth it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no. Unilateral disarmament was a bad \nidea in the 1970s and 1980s; it is a bad idea for the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I strongly support the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty. Why? Various reasons.\n  First, we have an opportunity to vote this week. I will cast my vote \nin favor of ratification because I believe to do otherwise would be a \ntragic mistake with extremely dire consequences for our Nation and \nequally dire consequences for the world. However, given the likelihood \nthe Senate will fall short of the two-thirds majority required under \nthe Constitution for ratification, I will support efforts to postpone \nthis vote. We cannot tell the world the United States of America, the \nleader of the free world, opposes this treaty. It would be a travesty.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty gives America a unique opportunity \nto leave a safer world for our children and for our grandchildren. We \ncannot prevent earthquakes; we can't prevent hurricanes or tornadoes, \nnot yet. I hope over time our ability to predict them--minimizing the \ndestruction of human life and property--will improve. But we can \nprevent nuclear war. We can halt the spread of nuclear weapons. We can \nprevent nuclear fallout and environmental destruction caused by nuclear \ntesting. And we can reduce the fear of a nuclear holocaust that all \nAmericans have lived with since the start of the cold war 50 years ago. \nWe can do all this, and we should.\n  Let me review some of the benefits we get from the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty, and let me explain why this treaty will make the world \nsafer for our children and grandchildren. First, under the CTBT, there \nis an absolute prohibition against conducting nuclear weapon test \nexplosions by the signators. This would include all countries that \npossess nuclear weapons, as well as those countries that have nuclear \npower or research reactors. It would also include countries that do not \nyet have nuclear facilities. This absolute prohibition of testing makes \nit much harder for countries that already have advanced nuclear weapons \nto produce new and more sophisticated nuclear weapons. Russia and China \nare prime examples.\n  The CTBT prevents the kind of arms competition we had during the cold \nwar. For example, without nuclear tests the Chinese will be unable to \nMIRV ICBMs with any degree of reliability. The Chinese have no \nassurance of the effectiveness of putting multiple warheads on missiles \nbecause they would not be able to test. Many believe China has made \nenormous strides in\n\n[[Page S12346]]\n\ntheir nuclear weapons capability because of decades of espionage, but \nthe CTBT provides one way to limit further sophisticated development.\n  The absolute prohibition on nuclear testing also helps prevent \ncountries with smaller and less advanced nuclear weapons from \ndeveloping more advanced nuclear warheads. This applies especially to \nIndia and to Pakistan. The strategy of using advanced nuclear weapons \ndepends on confidence. It depends on reliability. India and Pakistan \nwould not be able to build reliable and sophisticated nuclear weapons \nunder the treaty.\n  The treaty's terms also help prevent nations that are seeking nuclear \narms from ever developing them into advanced sophisticated weapons. I \nrefer to countries such as Iran and Iraq.\n  The second major reason for adopting this treaty is that ratification \nis critical to our ability to enforce and maintain the Non-\nProliferation Treaty, another treaty. The NPT is the bedrock of our \nefforts to stop the spread of nuclear arms to non-nuclear weapon \nstates. Many of the nations that signed the NPT, the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, and agreed to its indefinite extension did so on the \nunderstanding that there would be a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\n  The third reason for support is the CTBT will improve the ability of \nthe United States to detect nuclear explosions. Let me repeat that. It \nwill improve our ability to detect current explosions, the status quo \ncompared with today. The international monitoring system will have 321 \nmonitoring stations, including 31 in Russia, 11 in China, and 17 in the \nMiddle East. These stations will be able to detect explosions down to \nabout 1 kiloton, the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT--much lower than \nthe kinds of explosions we are talking about in this Chamber. In the \ncase of a suspicious event--that is, a report of an explosion that \ncould be nuclear, a mine site, or even an earthquake--any party can \nrequest an onsite inspection. With or without a treaty, we must \ncontinue all efforts at monitoring nuclear developments worldwide, but \nthe treaty provides a system that far exceeds current capabilities of \ninspection.\n  Now, turning to two of the major objections to those who oppose the \ntreaty: First, they claim actual nuclear tests--that is, explosions--\nare necessary to ensure that our stockpile of weapons works. We have \nput in place a science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program. Its purpose \nis to provide a high level of confidence in the safety and reliability \nof America's inventory of nuclear weapons. Under this program, our \nNational Weapons Laboratories spend $4.5 billion each year to check and \nto maintain these weapons. We can still test; we do test. We just \ncannot explode. The Secretaries of Defense and Energy, with the help of \nthe Directors of the National Laboratories, the Commander of the U.S. \nStrategic Command, and the Nuclear Weapons Council, must certify every \nyear to the President that the necessary high level of confidence \nexists.\n  Do not forget, $4.5 billion a year is spent on this. If they cannot \ngive that certification to the President, the President can then use \nthe so-called Safeguard F. What is that? That is the United States will \nbe able to withdraw from the treaty and test the weapon that is in \ndoubt; that is, if the President is not confident, the President can \nwithdraw.\n  The Directors of our weapons labs, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, along with four of his predecessors, and an impressive array \nof Nobel Prize winners believe the Stewardship Program will provide \nappropriate protection for our national security.\n  The second objection against the treaty is that it is impossible to \nverify that all nations are complying with the treaty. That is true. It \nis true we cannot detect every conceivable explosion at low yields. But \nour defense agencies have concluded--the Department of Defense--that we \nwill be able to detect tests that will have an impact on our national \nsecurity, and that is the threshold of concern to us.\n  Let me go through a few likely scenarios that would occur if we \nreject the treaty. First and most immediate would be on the Indian \nsubcontinent. India and Pakistan matched each other with nuclear tests. \nKashmir remains one of the world's most dangerous trigger points. U.S. \nrejection of the test ban treaty would destroy our ability to pressure \nthose two countries to halt further nuclear tests. Those countries \nwould likely begin to develop more sophisticated nuclear weapons, \nheightening the probability of their actual use in the region.\n\n  The second adverse consequence of rejection is this: China would \ncertainly prepare for more tests to increase the sophistication of its \nnuclear arsenal. At present, Chinese nuclear weapons do not pose a \nstrategic threat to the United States. Our rejection of the CTBT would \nallow them to begin a long-term development program with testing that \nwould make them such a threat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 8 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The third adverse consequence is American efforts to \npromote nuclear nonproliferation would become much more difficult \nbecause other nations would believe America's moral authority and its \nleadership were destroyed by our rejection of the CTBT.\n  The United States has been the world's leader in promoting arms \ncontrol. If we do not lead, no one else will. It is that simple. Our \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention led to its approval by \nRussia, by China, and others. Our ratification of the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty will lead other countries to agree to a complete ban on \nnuclear explosions.\n  As a footnote, let me add the American people, by an overwhelming \nmargin, understand the need to control nuclear testing. In a recent \npoll, 82 percent of Americans responded that they would like to see the \ntreaty approved. That is not a sufficient reason to vote for \nratification, but we should take note the public well understands the \ndangers of nuclear testing.\n  President Eisenhower began the first comprehensive test ban \nnegotiations in 1958 with the goal of constraining the nuclear arms \nrace and halting the spread of nuclear weapons. Mr. President, 31 years \nlater we have an opportunity to make this goal a reality. That is the \nlegacy I want to leave my son and all the children of Montana, of the \nUnited States, and of the world.\n  In sum, I think each of us has a moral obligation to leave this world \nin as good shape or better shape than we found it, and certainly \nratification of the test ban treaty fulfills that moral obligation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Maine is \nhere. I yield 15 minutes to the gracious Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee for his effort and cooperation.\n  With this debate on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, the \nSenate discharges one of its most fundamental and solemn duties, the \nstewardship of our national defense. I think there is little question \namong us that a world free of nuclear weapons would be a world more \nsecure. Obviously, we all look forward to the day when we do not have \nto rely on our nuclear stockpile as a necessary deterrent. We know full \nwell over 80 percent of the American people share that point of view. \nBut the fact is, that day has not yet arrived. Until it does, as the \nworld's last remaining superpower, we walk a line both fine and \nblurred. This debate must be about how we walk that line. It should be \nabout how we balance our clear and shared interests in a nuclear-free \nplanet within the reality of a post-cold-war world.\n  The reality is this: At the same time the world looks to us to \nprovide leadership in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, \nso, too, does it rely upon us for a credible nuclear deterrent that \nwill keep in check international aggressors, nations that seek to \nundermine democracy and freedom. That is the challenge before us, to \nmove towards our shared goal in a responsible and measured manner, ever \nmindful\n\n[[Page S12347]]\n\nthat a post-cold-war world does not mean a world devoid of duplicity or \ndanger. That is the dynamic we can neither escape nor ignore. That is \nthe dynamic that must inform each and every one of us as we consider \nthe ramification of a zero-yield treaty of unlimited duration.\n  The question is not whether we support nonproliferation measures. We \nobviously make that as one of our key national security objectives. The \nquestion is, Are we going to support a treaty that is a significant \ndeparture from what every Chief Executive of the atomic age, except \nPresident Clinton, has laid down for criteria in any test ban treaty? \nAre we going to support a treaty predicated on a program that is yet to \nbe tested and may remain unproven for decades? Are we going to support \na treaty that assumes reliable verification when we know we cannot \nalways detect low-level tests, when we know that rogue nations such as \nNorth Korea, Iraq, or Iran could develop crude first-generation nuclear \ndevices with no testing at all? In fact, the CIA Director George Tenet \nstated, back in 1997, in response to questions submitted to him by the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence:\n\n       Nuclear testing is not required for an acquisition of a \n     basic nuclear weapons capability. Tests using high explosive \n     detonations only could provide reasonable confidence in the \n     performance of a first generation device. Nuclear testing \n     becomes critical only when a program moves beyond basic \n     designs, incorporating more advanced concepts.\n\n  We cannot even verify what is going on in Iraq with Saddam Hussein. \nWe all recall we set up an onsite inspection program as a condition for \nhis surrender in the Persian Gulf war. Today he has systematically and \nunilaterally dismantled the U.N. weapons inspection system regime.\n  So these are the pressing issues that confront us about the \nratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. That is why I am \ndisappointed, regretting that we have had politics permeate both sides \nof the political aisle, both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue with respect \nto this debate. Because the ratification of any treaty, and certainly \nthis one, is a solemn and unique responsibility for the Senate, and we \nshould accord this debate the level of gravity it deserves. It is not \njust about process and procedure. It is certainly not about politics. \nIt is about policy; what is in the best interests of this country as \nwell as the security interests of the world. What is at stake is no \nless than our ability to stop proliferation and to ensure at the same \ntime the continued viability of our stockpile.\n  When we get into debates about procedure and process, I think it \nignores the overwhelming magnitude and gravity of the centerpieces of \nthis treaty. We should not be making this agreement a political \nfootball. Duty, a constitutional duty, compels us to look at the facts \nbefore us.\n  I can tell you, after I sat through hours of deliberations and \ntestimony on the Armed Services Committee last week, the facts are not \nreassuring. I know there is an honest difference of opinion among \nexperts, among former Secretaries of Defense. But you have to look at \nthe honest difference of opinion and take pause when you have six \nformer Secretaries of Defense, two former Clinton administration CIA \nDirectors, four former National Security Advisers, and three former \nNational Weapons Lab Directors, all opposing the treaty before us.\n  Why? Because they believe a no-testing, unlimited duration policy at \nthis time would fatally undermine confidence in the reliability of the \nU.S. nuclear stockpile as a sturdy hedge against the aggressive intent \nof once and future tyrants. That is a risk we simply cannot afford to \ntake.\n  Consider the backdrop of the Rumsfeld Commission report in 1998. We \nare all too familiar with the stark fact that North Korea, Iran, and \nIraq, to name a few, would be able to inflict major destruction on the \nUnited States within 5 to 10 years of making a decision to acquire \nballistic missile capabilities.\n  Thanks to the testimony last week of three current National Weapons \nLaboratory Directors, we also know full well that the very program the \nadministration proposes to rely on to monitor the safety, \neffectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the arsenal is between 10 \nand 20 years away from being fully validated and operational, and that \nis assuming it will work. That is 10 to 20 years. We could have weapons \nin our stockpile left untested and unproven for decades while rogue \nstates acquire the means of mass destruction.\n  That is what we are addressing today fundamentally: a treaty that has \nultimately been negotiated by this administration with a noble long-\nrange goal that almost everyone accepts but one which requires this \ncountry to accept an unproven and incomplete computer-model-based \nsystem for the security of our nuclear deterrent in this age of weapons \nproliferation. In other words, we put the cart before the horse. We \nought to know that our Stockpile Stewardship Program works first before \nwe commit to any zero-yield, unlimited-duration treaty.\n  As the Director of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Dr. Tarter, \ntestified to the committee last week, the program is an approach that \nthe country must pursue ``short of a return to a robust schedule of \nnuclear testing.'' By closing the door entirely, we would be making a \nquestion mark of our nuclear stockpile.\n  As President Bush reminded us in 1993, one-third of all U.S. nuclear \nweapons designs fielded since 1958--one-third--have required nuclear \ntesting to correct deficiencies after deployment.\n  In his words:\n\n       The requirement to maintain and improve the safety of our \n     nuclear stockpile and to evaluate and maintain the \n     reliability of U.S. forces necessitates continued nuclear \n     testing for those purposes, albeit at a modest level, for the \n     foreseeable future.\n\n  Even within the Clinton administration, these conditions found a \nvoice. According to Mr. Robert Bell, a member of the National Security \nCouncil staff, soon before President Clinton released his August 1995 \nstatement of support for the treaty, Defense Department officials \nargued that the United States should continue to reserve the right to \nconduct underground nuclear tests at a threshold of 150 kilotons or \nbelow.\n  That would seem to be the prudent course on what we know at this \nmoment in time. It is yet another fact today that we face a real danger \nof fewer and fewer scientists with the first-hand knowledge that comes \nfrom a testing process. Indeed, of the 85 remaining nuclear weapons \nexperts at the Los Alamos and Livermore Laboratories today, only 35 \nhave coordinated live underground tests.\n  Even as early as 1994, barely 18 months after the United States \nstopped underground nuclear testing, a report from the Congressional \nResearch Service sounded an alarm, and my colleagues would be wise to \nread it. Back in 1994, it sounded the alarm that:\n\n       These trends . . . threaten to undercut U.S. ability to \n     maintain the safety, reliability, and performance of its \n     warheads; to correct defects that are discovered or that \n     result from aging; and to remanufacture warheads. They also \n     work at cross-purposes with President Clinton's declaration \n     that the United States will maintain the capability to resume \n     testing if needed.\n\n  Again, we must remember that these considerations must be made in the \ncontext of a treaty that raises the bar by allowing absolutely no \ntesting at any level in perpetuity.\n  As Dr. John Nuckolls, the former Director of the Lawrence Livermore \nLaboratory, put it, even an ``extended duration test ban'' would \ntrigger the loss of all nuclear trained expert personnel as well as \n``major gaps in our understanding of scientific explosives.''\n  Again, the CRS in 1994 in its report said:\n\n       This skills loss is in its greatest jeopardy.\n\n  Director Tarter, the current Director of Lawrence Livermore \nLaboratory, testified before our committee last week. What did he say \nin his testimony?\n\n       It is a race against time. Before long, our nuclear test \n     veterans will be gone.\n\n  We are counting on our current cadre of experienced scientists to \nhelp develop and install the new tools that are only now starting to \ncome online.\n  We have now heard from our Directors: A minimum of 10 years and maybe \nas high as 20 years from now, the Stockpile Stewardship Program will be \ndetermined to be workable.\n  We have the loss of our nuclear scientists trained in the testing \nfield. That is a safety net we cannot do without as we walk the \ntightrope of sustaining a credible strategic nuclear deterrent and \naggressively promoting\n\n[[Page S12348]]\n\nglobal arms control. Consider that our successive agreements with the \nSoviet Union, and now Russia, will eventually reduce the entire \nAmerican nuclear warhead stock to about 25 percent of its peak size in \nthe cold war. Consider also that we maintain only 9 categories of \nnuclear weapons today from a level of more than 30 in 1985.\n  We are making remarkable strides, as we should, on our priorities in \nthe arms control arena. But knowledge about the arms we must sustain as \nbulwarks against future military conflicts cannot be lost, and this \nfact suggests that time has not ripened for the United States to \nsacrifice a 50-year, fool-proof position to keep the testing option \nopen as unprecedented arms reductions have occurred and must continue. \nIndeed, the administration itself agrees we need a viable strategic \nnuclear arsenal to deter conflicts that could arise in critical areas \nsuch as the Middle East, the western Pacific, or northern Asia.\n  In the view of the vast majority of treaty opponents and supporters \nalike who submitted opinions and testimony to the Armed Services \nCommittee last week, the Stockpile Stewardship Program will produce low \nlevels of confidence in many aspects of nuclear warhead capability for \nat least a decade to come and perhaps more.\n  Perhaps Dr. Robinson, the Director of the Sandia National Laboratory, \nput it best and simplest when he told the committee:\n\n       Confidence on the reliability and safety of the nuclear \n     weapons stockpile will eventually decline without nuclear \n     testing.\n\n  It was expert scientists, not politicians, who told the committee \nthat the Stockpile Stewardship Program brings the U.S. nuclear weapons \ncomplex into uncharted waters of reliability.\n  So, too, is confidence key when it comes to another vital component \nof this treaty, and that is verification. At first glance, the \ntechnology behind the treaty's verification regime seems airtight. \nArticle IV of the accord establishes a joint international monitoring \nsystem and international data center with a total of 337 facilities \naround the world. If these installations detect a potentially illegal \nunderground explosion that subsequent diplomacy cannot resolve, the \naccusing state may request an onsite inspection.\n  Fair enough, you might say, until you read the fine print. Then you \ndiscover that the onsite inspection provision requires an affirmative \nvote by 30 of the 51 members of the Executive Council of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization authorized under \narticle II, an awfully high threshold. Article II does not give the \nUnited States or any of its allies permanent or rotating seats on the \nCouncil.\n  That is not all. Science itself throws a wrench into the treaty's \nverification mechanism.\n  According to a 1995 study by the Mitre Corporation, an established \nscientific research center, neither the National Technical Means of the \nUnited States nor the Monitoring System envisioned by the treaty can \ndetect very low-yield or zero-yield tests.\n  Finally, article V of the treaty establishes ``measures to ensure \ncompliance.'' The most important of these measures entrusts the \nConference of States Parties, the treaty's ratifying governments, to \nrefer urgent cases to the United Nations Security Council, a forum in \nwhich Russia or China could exercise a unilateral veto.\n  In other words, article V could mean if the United States diagnosed \nan imminent nuclear danger in a strategic region of the world, Moscow \nor Beijing might emerge as the final courts of appeal for sanctions or \nother punitive acts.\n  The day for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty may come where we could \nhave a zero-nuclear testing regime for an unlimited period of time. It \nmay arrive. And we may be confident that we will be able to verify that \nlevel, as well as the low-level detections of other countries when it \ncomes to explosions. But I think we have to consider the facts as we \nknow them now.\n  I think we have to look very carefully at the troubling aspects of \nthe Stockpile Stewardship Program and whether it is a viable \nalternative to nuclear testing. In the strategic and scientific \ncommunities many say it is not, and maybe we will not know for 10 to 20 \nyears. That is what we are predicating our nuclear deterrent strategy \non.\n  So we have to vote--if we do vote today or tomorrow--on what we know \ntoday. We may know something differently in the future. But I submit \nthat we cannot subject our security interests to what we might know 20 \nyears from now.\n  I hope we will defer the vote on ratification because of all the \ncurrent concerns that I and others have cited. We would do well to heed \nthe advice of the letter that was submitted to the majority leader \nasking for deferral, the letter that was written by Henry Kissinger; \nJohn Deutch, a former CIA Director for the administration; and Brent \nScowcroft, that we should defer until we can give more consideration to \nall of the issues that are before the Senate with respect to this \ntreaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I respect the Senator from Maine very much, as I do the Senator from \nIndiana, who put out the five-page statement on why he opposes the \ntreaty. I want to speak to some of the things that some Senators have \nspoken to.\n  First of all, the Senator from Maine says we have to deal with the \nfacts as we know them. I hope she will keep that in mind when she votes \non missile defense. I hope the rest of my colleagues, who say we have \nto deal with the facts as we know them, keep that in mind when we vote \non missile defense.\n  I find it fascinating some of the very people who push the missile \ndefense and the abandonment of the ABM Treaty--where we have only had \nbasically one successful test, which is a far cry from what we are \ngoing to need to be able to develop a missile defense initiative--are \nthe same ones saying: But we can't go ahead with this treaty because we \ndon't know everything.\n  I respectfully suggest the ability of the scientific community to \nshoot multiple nuclear weapons out of the sky in the stratosphere and \nmake sure not a single one gets through is an even more daunting and \nchallenging program than the Stockpile Stewardship Program. But they \nseem to have no problem to be ready to abandon the ABM Treaty, which \nhas been the cornerstone, since Nixon was President, for our arms \ncontrol regime. But they have no faith. I find that fascinating, No. 1.\n  No. 2, I also find it very fascinating that everybody keeps talking \nabout nonverifiability. I have heard more than once this morning--not \nfrom the Senator from Maine but from others --the dictum of President \nRonald Reagan: Trust, but verify. That is constantly brought up: There \nis a reason why we can't be for this treaty. We can't verify it.\n\n  They say this treaty is not perfectly verifiable. That is true. But \nit is a red herring. This body has never demanded perfect verification.\n  Consider Ronald Reagan's treaty, the INF Treaty, that eliminated \nland-based intermediate-range missiles. That treaty was signed by \nPresident Reagan, the same man who coined the phrase: Trust, but \nverify.\n  Was the INF Treaty verifiable? Give me a break. No; it was not \nverifiable. It was not.\n  Listen to what the Senate Intelligence Committee said in response to \nRonald Reagan's assertion: Trust, but verify my INF Treaty. The \nIntelligence Committee said at the time:\n\n       Soviet compliance with some of the Treaty's provisions will \n     be difficult to monitor. This problem is exemplified by the \n     unresolved controversy between DIA [the Defense Intelligence \n     Agency] and other intelligence agencies over the number of \n     SS-20's in the Soviet inventory.\n       Ground-launched cruise missiles pose a particularly \n     difficult monitoring problem as they are interchangeable with \n     long-range Soviet sea-launched cruise missiles.\n\n  This the INF Treaty did not ban.\n\n       We are concerned that the Soviets could covertly extend the \n     range capability of a cruise missile, or covertly develop a \n     new ground-launched cruise missile which prohibited long-\n     range capability. . .\n       In an INF/START environment. . .the Soviet incentive to \n     cheat could increase because of a greater difficulty in \n     meeting targeting requirements.\n\n  Still, this Senate and my Republican colleagues--from Dick Lugar, who\n\n[[Page S12349]]\n\nquotes that he fought for the INF Treaty, and others, had no problem \nsaying that was a verifiable treaty. The ability to hide these things \nin barns, to hide them in haystacks, was greater than the ability of \nsomeone to muffle a nuclear explosion.\n  But no, I did not hear anything over on that side. I did not hear \nanybody saying: No, that's not verifiable. I guess that was a \nRepublican treaty. Maybe this is a Democrat's treaty. Maybe that is how \nthey think about it.\n  But I find this absolutely fascinating. It really--if my staff gives \nme one more suggestion, I am going to kill them. It says: The INF was \napproved 93-5. I thought I kind of made that point clear.\n  But at any rate, let me point out what else the Intelligence \nCommittee said about that INF Treaty. It said:\n\n       Since no verification and monitoring regime can be \n     absolutely perfect--\n\n  Let me read it again:\n\n       Since no verification and monitoring regime can be \n     absolutely perfect, a central focus for the Committee--\n\n  That is the Intelligence Committee--\n\n       has been to determine whether any possible infractions \n     would be of sufficient military significance to constitute a \n     threat to our national security interests. This calculus is \n     one which the Senate should bear in mind in its consideration \n     of the treaty.\n\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee was right in 1988, and their \nstandard is right today, even though this is pushed forward by a \nDemocratic President instead of a Republican President.\n  To impose this utterly unrealistic standard of verifiability on Bill \nClinton's test ban treaty, when no such standard was imposed on Ronald \nReagan's INF Treaty, may be an effective ``gotcha'' in politics, but it \nclearly does not look to the national interest of the United States.\n  No inspection--no inspection--by the way, for onsite inspections in \nthe INF Treaty, unless it was on prearranged sites. By the way, those \nof my colleagues who point out that we have to get 30 or 50 votes, our \nnegotiators are pretty smart. We have 30 to 50 votes based on \ncategories.\n  Let me tell you how membership on that committee would be determined.\n  The Executive Council is the decisionmaking body of the Treaty \nOrganization. Among other things, it authorizes on-site inspections.\n  There are 51 seats on the Council, divided geographically. Ten seats \nare allocated to parties from North America and Western Europe.\n  Of these, the treaty provides that ``at least one-third of the seats \nallocated to each geographical region shall be filled taking into \naccount political and security interests, by States Parties in that \nregion designated on the basis of the nuclear capabilities relevant to \nthe Treaty. . . .\n  The chief negotiator, Stephen Ledogar, told the Foreign Relations \nCommittee on Thursday that ``this is diplomatic language'' that assures \nthat the United States gets a de facto permanent seat on the Council.\n  Moreover, he said that there was an agreement among the Europeans and \nus that we would always have a seat.\n  Makeup of the Council is: Africa, 10 seats; Eastern Europe, 7 seats; \nLatin America, 9 seats; Middle East/South Asia, 7 seats; N. America/W. \nEurope, 10 seats; East Asia/Pacific, 8 seats.\n  There are 2-year terms.\n  A quick review of the candidates for seats that we should expect, in \nalmost all instances, to get all the votes of the West Europe/North \nAmerica group. So we start with 10.\n  Aside from Yugoslavia, Russia, and one of two others, the Eastern \nEurope group comprises strong United States allies. So that's another \n5-7 votes.\n  Similarily, many of the Latin American states are either: (1) strong \nallies or (2) strongly favor the test ban. So we should usually get \nmost of those 9 votes.\n  That gets us very quickly to the low-mid-20s, in most instances--even \nbeing conservative and assuming that we don't get all the votes in the \nabove 3 groups.\n  That leaves Africa, 10 seats; Middle East/South Asia group, 7 seats; \nand the East Asia, 8 seats. There is where our work, depending on the \nmakeup of the Council at the particular time, could get a little \nharder.\n  But even there the rosters have U.S. allies, or proponents of non-\nproliferation.\n  It is hard to see how we will not get to 30 in most instances.\n  In truth, it is more likely that most U.S. inspection requests, based \non our intelligence and the data from the International Monitoring \nSystem, will be easily approved.\n  It should also be noted that, unlike the U.N., Israel is a member of \na regional group, and will automatically get a seat on the Council \nunder a special rule that guarantees that one seat within each region \nbe filled on a rotational basis.\n  We can get 30 votes. We can get 30 votes any time we want. The reason \nwhy is we set up the committees the way we did. The flip side of that \nis, it will be hard for them to get 30 votes because the fact is that \nour intelligence community is saying we do not want onsite inspections \nin the United States. I don't know what treaty these folks are reading.\n  Let me make a second point. Here is the one lately that really gets \nme: The Soviet Union is going to be able to develop very small tactical \nnuclear weapons that, in fact, will lead to a different strategy in \nterms of their conventional defense. Guess what. We should all be \nstanding up on this floor going hooray, we did it, because I remember \nlast time we debated this issue of strategic weapons. What were we \nsaying?\n  I watched, by the way, with great interest Dr. Edward Teller last \nnight. I watched a long documentary because I used to have to debate \nhim around the country on SALT. He was wrong then; he is wrong now.\n  We used to argue that the real concern--I have been here for 27 \nyears--was the Soviets seeking a first strike capability. Remember? The \nSoviets are seeking a first strike capability. And all of their actions \nwere designed to do that. That is why they were building these new \nmassive SS-18s with 10 nuclear warheads, independently targeted, et \ncetera, et cetera. Through the leadership of a Republican President, we \nhave an agreement whereby they are going to dismantle those if we get \nthe treaty, the START treaty, passed. So guess what we are worried \nabout now. The exact opposite. We are worried now that they don't have \na first strike capability, that they aren't seeking nuclear \npredominance, but they are acknowledging their conventional forces are \nso bad they need tactical nuclear defense on their territory.\n  As they say in my church, examine your conscience, folks. Take a look \nat what this is. We hear this thing, and the public says: Is it true, \nJoe, they really are developing a new tactical weapon? My response is, \nit probably is true. But guess what. They now have 10,000 tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  They are worried now that they are going to be able to develop \nanother smaller tactical nuclear weapon, as if this treaty has anything \nto do with that. Come on. Come on. What we should be doing is rejoicing \nin the fact that the whole emphasis in the Soviet program has shifted \nto a recognition that they have to defend their homeland--their \njudgment--and they do not have the conventional forces capable of doing \nthat--their judgment--and so they are developing, allegedly, a very \nsmall tactical nuclear weapon--their judgment. Does that shift the \nstrategic balance? Give me a break. Give me a break.\n  I find this one of the most fascinating debates in which I have ever \nbeen engaged. I don't know what we are talking about. When my friend \nfrom Kentucky stands up and says, I thought we decided against \nunilateral disarmament, me, too--an are-you-still-beating-your-wife \nkind of question. Who is talking about unilateral disarmament? Where is \nthat anywhere in this treaty? Where does it say that? Where does it \nimply that? That is like my standing up and saying: I am very surprised \nmy friends who oppose this treaty want to go to nuclear war; I am very \nsurprised they are advocating nuclear war. That would be equally as \nunfounded and outrageous a statement as the assertion this treaty is \nunilateral disarmament.\n  I will repeat this time and again, and I will yield the floor in a \nmoment. My problem is, we have a President of the United States of \nAmerica who has sent a formal message to the Republican leader asking \nthat a vote on this treaty\n\n[[Page S12350]]\n\nbe delayed. Apparently, there is a consensus on the other side, thus \nfar at least, not to allow it to be delayed. This is the total \npoliticization of a national security debate. Could anyone have \nimagined before this came up, if a President of the United States of \nany party said: This issue, which is of the gravest consequence to the \nUnited States of America, I respectfully ask that you delay a vote on \nit, could anyone have imagined anything other than a response that \nsays: Mr. President, we will concur with the delay, unless it was for \nstark political reasons? I can't fathom this one. I can't fathom this. \nI wasn't sure the President should have sent the letter in the first \nplace.\n\n  If this treaty is defeated and India and Pakistan test, we are going \nto find ourselves in the ugliest political brawl we have seen in this \nplace since Newt Gingrich left the House. You are going to have \nDemocrats standing up on the floor saying: The reason why India and \nPakistan have tested is because the Republicans defeated this treaty \nand gave a green light. That is not a provable assertion, but mark my \nwords, we are going to hear it. Then the response is going to be even \nmore political.\n  We ought to take a deep breath. My mom always said, when you lose \nyour temper, take a deep breath, count to 10. Not that I have ever lost \nmy temper in my life. You can tell I am not at all passionate about any \nof these issues. But let us count to 10. The President of the United \nStates has asked this treaty vote be delayed. It seems to me it is \ncommon courtesy and totally consistent with national interests to grant \nthat request.\n  I will speak to other aspects of this. Let me conclude by saying two \nthings: One, to move to a very small tactical nuke on the part of the \nRussians is an absolute outward admission that they lack the capability \nin their minds for fighting the conventional war. Twenty years ago, we \nwould have paid billions of dollars, if the Russians had come to us--I \nsay to my friend from Massachusetts who knows a great deal about this--\nwe would have been prepared to vote to pay them $10-, $20 billion if \nthey would stop developing intercontinental range missiles that had the \ncapacity to penetrate our airspace and in all probability hit hardened \ntargets here. If they had said to us, we won't do that but we are going \nto build a very small tactical nuke, we would have paid them to do \nthat. Now we hear on this side, if we pass this treaty, they are going \nto build tactical nuclear weapons that are very small, smaller than the \n10,000 they now have and are able to have and legally can have. That is \na very bad thing. That is why we should reject this treaty. So we \nencourage the Chinese to go from 18 to 800 or 8,000 nuclear weapons \nthat have MIRV capability and are thermonuclear in capacity. That is \nwonderful reasoning.\n  There are legitimate arguments against this treaty, which I believe \ndo not rise to the level of being against a treaty, but I haven't heard \nthem made this morning, with all due respect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want 30 seconds to respond to the challenge \nof my friend from Delaware with respect to unilateral disarmament. I \nthink the point the Senator from Kentucky was making was that the \nUnited States will consider itself bound to the zero-yield standard. We \nwill abide. But we know that certain other countries don't see the \ntreaty that way, don't interpret the language that way. We suspect they \nhave reason to and probably will be conducting so-called hybrid nuclear \ntests and, second, couldn't verify whether those kinds of tests are \nconducted. As a result, the United States would not be conducting any \nkind of nuclear tests, whereas other countries would have the \ncapability and, indeed, the motivation to do so.\n  I believe that is what the Senator was talking about when he talked \nabout the concept of unilateral disarmament.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will take a minute to respond. I \nunderstand the point made. We have 6,000 intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles that are on line right now. The Russians have a similar \nnumber. After you get by that, the numbers drop off precipitously. \nChina is down in the teens. This unilateral disarmament notion or, as \nexplained by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, I understand his \npoint, but what are we doing? Are we going to give up? Are we freezing \nin place the fact that we stay at 6,000, and if they take the worst \ncase of a stockpile that is in atrophy versus the dozen or more that \nthe Chinese have? I mean, come on. Come on. You know, if you told me \nthe Chinese had 6,000 nuclear weapons, MIRV capability, thermonuclear \nyield, or if you told me the Koreans and Libyans had that and the \nRussians had that, then you would have an argument. After the Soviet \nUnion and then our allies, it drops off precipitously into double \ndigits, max--max.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Delaware \nfor his terrific leadership on this issue over the last few days, and \nfor a long period of time.\n  Let me quickly address, if I may, one point. The Senator from \nDelaware a few moments ago referred to the strange dynamic that has set \nin here in the Senate. I just want to underscore that, if I may, for a \nmoment.\n  I grew up, as many of us did, looking at the Senate with a sense of \ngreat respect and awe for the capacity of the Senate to come together \naround the most significant national security issues that faced the \ncountry. I think all of us always looked at this institution as the \nplace that, hopefully, could break through the emotions and find the \nmost common sense solution that is in the interests of the American \npeople.\n  Some of the great history of the Senate has been written about those \nmoments where Senators crossed the aisle and found commonality in \nrepresenting the interests of the Nation. I must say that in the 15 \nyears I have been privileged now to serve here, representing \nMassachusetts, I have never seen the Senate as personally and \nideologically and politically divided and willing to subvert what we \nmost easily can define as the common national interest for those pure \nideological or political reasons. And I don't think that is mere \nrhetoric when I say that.\n  I noticed when Presidents Reagan and Bush were in office, there was a \nconsiderable thirst on the other side of the aisle for adventures in \nGranada, Panama, and Somalia, and the obvious need to respond to the \nthreat in Iraq and the Middle East. But suddenly, with President \nClinton, we saw those very people who were prepared to support those \nefforts, even in a Granada or in a Panama, suddenly people argued that \nKosovo didn't have any meaning, Bosnia didn't have meaning, and even \nHaiti, where there was an incredible influx of refugees and chaos right \noff our shore, failed to elicit the same kind of responsible \ninternational reaction as we had seen in those prior years. Now, \nregrettably, this treaty finds itself being tossed around as the same \nkind of ``political football,'' to a certain degree. And I think that \nis unfortunate, and it certainly does not serve the best interests of \nthe Nation.\n  Mr. President, preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons is one \nof the most important issues facing the United States today. Since the \nend of the Cold War, we have made great strides in reducing the danger \nto the American people of the vast nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet \nUnion. But the nuclear danger persists, and the job of nuclear arms \ncontrol is far from finished. Multiple nuclear tests detonated by India \nand Pakistan emphasize the need for greater U.S. leadership on this \ncritical issue--not less.\n\n  In the last week, we have been told by critics of the CTBT that, for \na variety of reasons, it will increase, rather than reduce the danger \nfrom nuclear proliferation. I believe that a careful examination of the \ncriticism of this treaty will show that, on balance, it will enhance--\nnot undermine--U.S. national security interests.\n  First, critics argue that, in their desire to conclude a \ncomprehensive test ban, the Clinton administration made key concessions \nresulting in a flawed Treaty that is worse than no Treaty at all. Let \nme say at the beginning that I believe the CTBT is far from perfect. I \nam not going to argue with my colleagues on the other side that you \ncan't find a legitimate point of disagreement about the Treaty. I'm not\n\n[[Page S12351]]\n\ngoing to argue with those who don't like the way a particular \ncompromise was arrived at in the treaty, or that think a particular \nprinciple might have been fought for harder and the absence of victory \non that particular principle somehow weakens the overall implementation \nof the Treaty.\n  The negotiating record--which has been subject to great scrutiny in \nrecent days--reflects as many compromises from the original U.S. \nposition as triumphs in achieving our objectives. There are legitimate \nreasons for concern that we did not achieve all of the original goals \nof the United States in negotiating this Treaty. I certainly take to \nheart Secretary Weinberger's admonition that you should not want the \nend goal so much that you give up certain substance in arriving at that \nend goal. I think that is a laudable and very important principle \naround which one ought to negotiate.\n  But my colleagues in this body understand better than most the \nnecessity of compromise in finding pragmatic solutions to the many \ndifficult problems we face. And the compromises we agreed to in the \nCTBT will allow us to achieve the nonproliferation goals we seek.\n  What has often been lost throughout this debate is that the United \nStates enjoys a tremendous technological advantage over the other \nnuclear powers in both the sophistication of our weapons and our \nability to maintain them reliably. The Administration and the Congress \ninitially agreed to seek a test ban that would permit only the lowest-\nyield nuclear tests, which was soundly rejected by our negotiating \npartners because it would essentially ensure that only the United \nStates, with the technical capacity the others lack to conduct those \nlow-yield tests, would be permitted to continue testing its nuclear \nstockpile.\n  As Ambassador Stephen Ledogar--the head of the U.S. negotiating \nteam--testified before the Foreign Relations Committee last Thursday, \nthe other four nuclear powers argued that they needed a higher \nthreshold in order to gain any useful data. Russia argued that, if a \ntesting threshold were to be established for the five nuclear powers, \nit should allow for nuclear yields of up to ten tons of TNT equivalent, \nhardly a level that constituted an effective testing restriction.\n  Our negotiators quickly rejected that idea, and President Clinton \ndecided the best way to resolve the impasse and protect U.S. interests \nwould be to pursue a policy of zero-yield--a ban should be a ban. The \nRussians were not happy with this proposal, but eventually were \npersuaded to accept a total ban on any nuclear test that produced any \nnuclear yield.\n\n  Clearly, the United States would have been better off if we had been \nable to negotiate a test ban that allowed us to continue testing. But \nit is ridiculous to argue that, because the CTBT does not protect the \nU.S. advantage it represents a dangerous capitulation on our part. To \nimplement and verify a zero-yield test ban, we need not be worried \nabout distinguishing between a low-yield test and a medium-yield test \nto determine if the Treaty has been violated. Any test of any yield is \na violation. In this regard, the Treaty's strength is in its \nsimplicity.\n  Second, critics argue that we shouldn't ratify the CTBT because we \ncan't verify compliance. There has never been an arms control treaty \nthat is 100% verifiable, and the CTBT is no exception. We will not be \nable to detect nuclear tests down to the most minute level of nuclear \nyield. But we will be able to verify that the Test Ban is accomplishing \nwhat it is meant to accomplish: an end to nuclear testing that advances \nthe sophistication of current nuclear stockpiles or the development of \nnew nuclear stockpiles.\n  The key to a successful verification system is that a potential \nviolator must believe that the risk of getting caught is greater than \nthe benefit of the violation. The lower the yield of the nuclear test, \nthe smaller the chance of detection by seismic means. But at the same \ntime, the amount of useful information a nation would get by conducting \na low-yield clandestine test would be limited. As a result, a potential \nviolator would likely decide that the risk of getting caught is greater \nthan the benefit of conducting the test. In addition, clandestine \ntesting will not allow any developing weapons program to approach \ncurrent U.S. capabilities.\n  For those who are concerned about the danger from low-yield nuclear \ntesting, I would also argue that defeating this treaty will make it \nmore difficult, not less, for the United States to detect those tests \nby denying us the benefits of the International Monitoring System that \nwill verify the CTBT. The International Monitoring System will include \n50 primary seismic monitoring stations and an auxiliary network of 120 \nstations, 80 radionuclide stations for atmospheric measurements, 11 \nhydroacoustic stations to detect underwater signals, and infrasound \nmonitoring as well. This system will be augmented by the very powerful \nnational intelligence-gathering technologies currently operated by the \nU.S. and others.\n  The CTBT also allows any state party to request an on-site inspection \nof a questionable seismic event. The Treaty calls for on-site \ninspection requests to be submitted to the Executive Council of the \nCTBT Organization--the body charged with implementing the Treaty--along \nwith supporting data, collected either from the monitoring and data \nmechanisms established under the Treaty or from national technical \nmeans. The Executive Council will have representatives from every \nregion, and nations within each region will rotate membership on the \nExecutive Council on a set schedule. The United States has reached \nagreement with the nations in our region that we will always be one of \nthe 10 nations representing our region, so we will always have a vote \non the Executive Council.\n\n  Thirty of the 50 members of the Executive Council must approve an on-\nsite inspection request. Critics have argued that it will be very \ndifficult for the United States to garner the support of 30 nations to \nallow for an on-site inspection. They argue that our traditional \nadversaries will use the Executive Council to block inspections that \nare necessary to protecting the U.S. national interest.\n  It is true that countries such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq and their \nfew supporters can be counted on to block U.S. and other requests for \non-site inspections. However, most of the nations of the world have no \ninterest either in pursuing nuclear weapons or allowing their neighbors \nto pursue them unchecked, which is why this Treaty enjoys such strong \nsupport throughout the international community.\n  Rogue nations would have to find support among more than 40 percent \nof the Executive Council to block our request for an on-site \ninspection. But it is unlikely that the United States would not be able \nto persuade at least 30 members of the merits and importance of our \ninspection request.\n  The CTBT will give us access to tools we otherwise would not have for \nmonitoring nuclear tests, and an option for on-site inspection of \nseismic events that we do not fully understand. Defeating the treaty \nwould deny our intelligence community the additional benefits of those \nadditional tools.\n  Third, critics argue that the CTBT will not end nuclear \nproliferation, because key countries of proliferation concern will not \nsign or ratify. This is an important argument, because it goes to \nwhether this Treaty can accomplish the fundamental purpose for which it \nis designed--stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  It is true that countries will halt nuclear testing, or not, based on \na calculation of their own national interest. But by creating an \ninternational norm against nuclear testing, the CTBT will add a \npowerful factor in a rogue nation's assessment of whether its national \ninterest will be helped or harmed by the conduct of a nuclear weapon. A \nnation that chooses to test will face considerable costs to its \npolitical, economic and security interests. U.S. ratification of the \nCTBT will lay the basis for universal enforcement of the Treaty, even \nagainst the few nations that may not sign.\n  The CTBT is a critical component of broader U.S. strategy on nuclear \nnon-proliferation, which has the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) \nat its core. In 1995, states parties to the NPT agreed to extend that \nTreaty indefinitely, in large part based on the commitment of the \ndeclared nuclear weapons states to conclude a CTBT. The failure of the \nUnited States to ratify\n\n[[Page S12352]]\n\nthe CTBT will seriously undercut our ability to continue our critical \nleadership role in the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.\n  Formal entry-into-force of the Treaty requires ratification by the 44 \ncountries that have nuclear power reactors or nuclear research reactors \nand are members of the Conference on Disarmament. And in my mind, it is \naltogether appropriate that a treaty banning the testing of nuclear \nweapons requires the participation of all the nuclear-capable states \nbefore it can enter into force. Of those 44, 41 have signed the CTBT, \nand 23 have ratified. All of our allies have signed the Treaty. Russia \nand China have signed the Treaty. Only India, Pakistan and North Korea \nhave not signed.\n\n  Now, some have argued that the United States should be in no hurry to \nratify the Treaty, that we should wait until Russia, China, India, \nPakistan and North Korea have ratified. They worry that the United \nStates will forfeit its ability to conduct nuclear tests with no \nguarantee that the countries we are most concerned about will make the \nsame commitment. But the United States has already concluded that we do \nnot need to conduct nuclear tests to maintain our vast nuclear \nsuperiority.\n  No one on the other side of the aisle is arguing we should go out and \ntest tomorrow. Why? Because we don't need to test tomorrow. We don't \nneed to test next year. We don't need to test for the foreseeable \nfuture, according to most scientists in this country, because we don't \ntest the nuclear explosion itself for the purpose of safety and for \nmaking judgments about the mechanics of both the electrical and \nmechanical parts of a nuclear warhead.\n  The CTBT binds us to a decision we have already made, because it is \nin our national interests to stop testing. And if, at some point down \nthe line, it becomes necessary to resume testing to preserve the \nreliability of our nuclear deterrent, we can withdraw from the Treaty \nto do so.\n  Clearly, we want countries like India and Pakistan to ratify the \nTreaty and commit themselves to refraining from nuclear testing. Aren't \nwe more likely to convince them to do this if we ourselves have already \nratified the Treaty? As Secretary Albright correctly pointed out on \nThursday, waiting is not a strategy. During the debates on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, there were those who advocated taking this passive \napproach to protecting our interests. But in fact, after the United \nStates ratified the CWC, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and Cuba \nfollowed our lead. The best chance for achieving the nonproliferation \ngoals of the CTBT is for the United States to lead. If the Senate were \nto reject the Treaty, international support for the test ban would be \ngravely undermined, and countries like India and Pakistan would have no \nreason to refrain from continued testing.\n  Aren't we better off with a treaty that gives us the capacity to \nmonitor, the capacity to continue to show leadership with India and \nPakistan, the capacity to set up a process with China before the \nChinese test in a way that gives them the ability to translate the \ninformation stolen--referred to in the Cox commission report--into a \nreal threat to the United States?\n  That seems to me to be a very simple proposition. The Cox Report, and \nothers, all acknowledge that at this point in time China has not \ncreated a new weapon or changed its nuclear capacity, using our \ninformation. And we know that, in order to do so, using on our \ninformation, they have to test. China has signed the treaty, and is \nprepared to adopt the restraints of this treaty. Those who argue that \nwe are better off allowing China the window to go out and test and now \nprofit from what it has stolen elude all common sense, in my judgment. \nHow would the United States be better off with a China that is allowed \nto test and translate the stolen information into a better weapons \nsystem? That is not answered on the floor of the Senate. But some argue \nthat that is the way they would like to proceed.\n\n  U.S. ratification of the CTBT won't end nuclear proliferation, but \nU.S. rejection of the Treaty undermine the credibility of U.S. \nleadership on nonproliferation, which will jeopardize U.S. work to \nprevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, to eliminate \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and to block the sale of sensitive \ntechnologies that could contribute to proliferation.\n  Finally, critics argue that the United States will not be able to \nmaintain a reliable nuclear deterrent without nuclear tests. I take \nvery seriously the argument that, without nuclear testing, the \ncredibility of the U.S. nuclear deterrent will be undermined. The \nsecurity of the American people--and the security of our friends and \nallies around the world--depends on maintaining the credible perception \nthat an act of aggression against us will be met with an overwhelming \nand devastating response. If I thought for a minute that U.S. \nratification of the CTBT would undermine this deterrent, I would not--I \ncould not--support it.\n  In fact, the United States has today and will continue to have in the \nfuture high confidence in the safety, reliability and effectiveness of \nour nuclear stockpile. This confidence is based on over 50 years of \nexperience and analysis of over 1,000 nuclear tests, the most in the \nworld.\n  Most of the nuclear tests the United States has conducted have been \nto develop new nuclear weapons; for the most part, we use non-nuclear \ntests to ensure the continued reliability of our nuclear arsenal.\n  This is a key point--even with no test ban, the United States would \nnot rely primarily on detonating nuclear explosions to ensure the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. Most of the problems \nassociated with aging nuclear weapons will relate to the many \nmechanical and electrical components of the warhead, and the CTBT does \nnot restrict testing on these non-nuclear components. Moreover, we have \nalready proven that we can make modifications to existing designs \nwithout nuclear testing. In 1998, we certified the reliability of the \nB-61 Mod 11, which replaced an older weapon in the stockpile, without \nconducting a nuclear test.\n  Looking to the future, the center of U.S. efforts to maintain our \nnuclear stockpile is the Science Based Stockpile Stewardship program, \ninitiated by President Clinton in 1992. This 10 year, $45 billion \nprogram has four major objectives: to maintain a safe and reliable \nstockpile as nuclear weapons age; to maintain and enhance capability to \nreplace and certify nuclear weapons components; to train new weapon \nscientists; and to maintain and further develop an operational \nmanufacturing capability.\n  And it is already working. Since our last test in 1992, the \nSecretaries of Defense and Energy and the Commander-in-Chief of \nStrategic Command have certified 3 times (and are about to certify for \nthe fourth time) that the U.S. nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable. \nIt is only in the distant future--2010 perhaps, but we don't know the \nanswer to this yet--that conceivably the physics package of a nuclear \nweapon might provide the level of deterioration that might not be able \nto be replaced with totally new parts and therefore might somehow \nlessen our nuclear deterrent capacity. To enable us to respond to such \na situation, President Clinton has established six Safeguards that \ndefine the conditions under which the U.S. will remain a party to the \nCTBT.\n\n  Presidential Safeguards A through F, as they are known, outline the \nU.S. commitment to maintaining a science-based stockpile stewardship \nprogram to insure a high degree of confidence in the reliability of the \nU.S. nuclear stockpile. The final safeguard, Safeguard F, states U.S. \npolicy--as embodied in the official negotiating record of the CTBT--\nthat, if the President is advised that the safety or reliability of the \nU.S. nuclear stockpile can no longer be certified, the President, in \nconsultation with the Congress, will withdraw from the CTBT under the \n``supreme national interests'' clause of the Treaty.\n  Now, critics of this Treaty have suggested that a future President, \nupon learning from his Secretaries of Defense and Energy that the \nnuclear stockpile can not be certified, and upon confronting all the \nscientific data that tells him our nuclear deterrent is eroding, will \nsomehow fail to act--fail to invoke the ``supreme national interest'' \nclause--and withdraw the United States from the Treaty. I ask my \ncolleagues, Is there one among us who, when confronted with this \ninformation, would hesitate to act? When the Congress is informed of \nthe status of the\n\n[[Page S12353]]\n\nnuclear arsenal--and those reports are given in full to the Congress--\nis there anyone who doubts that the Congress would immediately demand \nthat the White House take action to protect our nuclear deterrent?\n  Surely, the critics of this Treaty who doubt that a President could \nfind the political will to withdraw the United States from the CTBT \nwhen our ``supreme national interests'' are at stake aren't suggesting \nthat there is a confluence of political factors that could possibly \nplace the sanctity of a treaty above the sanctity of the lives of the \nAmerican people. No one can tell me that any President of the United \nStates is going to diminish the real national security interests of \nthis country against some desire to keep a treaty in effect for the \nsake of having a treaty if, indeed, doing so will threaten the real \ninterests of this Nation.\n  U.S. ratification of, and adherence to, the CTBT will not jeopardize \nour nuclear deterrent, because the United States does not today, and \nwill not tomorrow, rely on nuclear explosions to ensure the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear stockpile. We have embarked on a high-tech, \nscience-based Stockpile Stewardship Program that will allow the United \nStates to maintain the superiority of its nuclear arsenal. And in the \nevent that we can not certify the reliability of our nuclear deterrent, \nwe have given notice to our negotiating partners that we will not \nadhere to the CTBT at the expense of our supreme national interests.\n  So, in effect, we are talking about what we could achieve by passing \nthis treaty and showing leadership on the subject of implementing an \ninternational regime of monitoring and of nonproliferation, versus \ncontinuing the completely uncontrolled capacity of nations to provide a \ntrue threat to the United States.\n  Mr. President, critics of this Treaty argue that the United States \ntoday faces too many uncertainties in the realm of nonproliferation to \ncommit ourselves to a leadership position on the CTBT. I can not speak \nto those uncertainties, but of the following, I am absolutely certain: \nif the Senate rejects the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, there will be \nmore nuclear tests conducted around the world, not fewer, and we will \nbe no better equipped than we are today to detect and monitor those \ntests; the U.S. nuclear arsenal will not be made more reliable--and \nother nuclear nations will have the freedom to conduct the necessary \ntests to bring their weapons on a technological par with our own, \nundermining the strength of our nuclear deterrent; and finally, the \nAmerican people will be more vulnerable, not less, to the nuclear \ndanger, because we will have undercut more than 30 years of work to \nbuild and fortify international norms on nuclear nonproliferation.\n  The Senate has before it today an opportunity to send a signal to the \nworld that the United States will continue to lead on international \nefforts to reduce the nuclear danger. We also face the prospect of \nacting too soon, after too little time for deliberation, and sending a \nsignal that the United States can no longer be counted on to stand \nagainst the forces of nuclear proliferation.\n  It seems to me that when the President of the United States makes a \nrequest in the interest of our Nation to the Senate to delay a vote, it \nis only politics that would drive us to have that vote notwithstanding \nthat request.\n  My plea would be to my colleagues in the Senate that we find the \ncapacity to cool down a little bit, to have a vote that delays the \nconsideration of this treaty so that we may proceed to answer properly \neach of the questions raised by those who oppose it, and, if need be, \nmake changes that would not send the message that the United States of \nAmerica is rejecting outright this opportunity to embrace a policy that \nfrom Eisenhower on we have fought to try to adopt.\n  I hope that the leadership of the Senate on both sides of the aisle \ncan be prevailed upon to prevent a tragic misstep that I fear will have \ngrave consequences for the strategic interests of the United States and \nour friends and allies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry, please. Somewhere \ndown the line we are going to find it wise to yield back time. That \nwould not forbid a Senator on this side from suggesting the absence of \na quorum or any other routine motion of the Senate. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not correct. The Senator would have to \nhave debatable time left or there would have to be a nondebatable \nmotion. There would have to be debatable time left or there would have \nto be a nondebatable motion before a Senator would be able to suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well. I thank the Chair for the information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues on the Democratic \nside who want to speak on this treaty, if I am not mistaken, there is \nless than 1 hour--approximately 1 hour--left under the control of the \nSenator from Delaware, and 13 Members wish to speak to it; and, \nfurther, if my Republican colleagues conclude that they wish to yield \nback their time, the time is going rapidly as we approach this vote. I \nurge Senators, if they wish to speak, to be prepared, as my friend from \nthe State of Connecticut is, to speak for 5 minutes.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Delaware.\n  As I have listened to my colleagues during this debate, I feel as if \nthe Senate has backed itself at least into a procedural corner in the \nmidst of a policy disagreement.\n  This is not the first time this has happened in the history of the \nSenate--not even in the 10\\1/2\\ years I have been here. But this is one \nof the most consequential times we have done so. For it seems to be a \ncombination of reasons that are part ideological, part partisan, and \npart just plain personal. I hope we can find a way to work ourselves \nout of this corner because the stakes here are high.\n  As the debate has been going on, I have been thinking about the two \nbig debates that have occurred here in the decade that I have been \nprivileged to serve in this body. One was the gulf war debate and the \nother was the Middle East peace accords, the Oslo accords.\n  I think of the gulf war debate because I remember as President Bush \ndispatched a half million troops to the gulf that I was dismayed at how \nthe reaction to that act by President Bush was dividing along partisan \nlines. It didn't seem like a partisan question to me. People could have \ngood faith opinions on both sides, but the opinions were not based on \nparty affiliation.\n  I have the same feeling as I listen to this debate, and watch the \nlines harden. Something unusual and unsettling has happened to our \npolitics when party lines divide us so clearly and totally on a matter \nof national security. That is not the way it used to be in the Senate. \nAnd that is not the way it ought to be.\n  The same is true of the procedural dilemma to which we have come. We \nhave a President--and those of us who support this treaty--\nacknowledging that the votes are not there to ratify it now. That says \nthat the opponents of the treaty have won for now.\n  So why push for the vote? If the President of the United States has \nasked that it be delayed because of his fear of the consequences of a \nvote failing to ratify on nuclear proliferation, this is not political. \nThis goes to the heart of our security and the hopes and fears we have \nfor our future and our children's future.\n  But I will say if there is one thing, in my opinion, that would be \nworse than going ahead and voting, even though we know those who oppose \nratification of the treaty have won. That would be for us as a majority \nto voluntarily say that we will prohibit the President or ourselves \nfrom raising the question of this critical and progressive treaty again \nfor the next year and a half. I think to do that would send an even \nworse signal to India, to Pakistan, to China, and to Russia.\n  Let's keep the hope of a more secure world alive. Let's acknowledge \nthat we have a common goal.\n  Is anybody for nuclear proliferation? Don't we all agree that the \natmosphere\n\n[[Page S12354]]\n\nis cleaner and the likelihood of nuclear proliferation less if nations \ncan't test? Can't we find a way across party lines to do what we have \ndone with other treaties--to adopt reservations or safeguards or \nconditions which allow enough of us to come together to ratify this \ntreaty? Why are we heading toward a wall from which there will be no \ngood return and no good result?\n  I have also been thinking of the Middle East peace accords and the \nOslo accords because I remember what Prime Minister Rabin said.\n       If you are strong you can take risks for peace.\n\n  We are the strongest nation today in the history of the world. When \nit comes to strategic nuclear weapons, we are dominant. We have more \nthan 6,000. If, tragically, for whatever reason, a few of them don't \nwork we have such--in the marvelous term of the Pentagon--\n``redundancy'' that we have thousands of others that we can rely on in \nthe dreadful occasion that we might need to use them.\n  This treaty promises to freeze our advantage in nuclear weapons. \nSince we are the strongest nation in history and this treaty may well \nmake us more dominant in the crucial, terrible arena of nuclear \nweapons, why would we not want to take the risk of ratifying this \ntreaty? It is, in my opinion, a very small risk for increasing peace \nand security for all--for our children, for our grandchildren. If we \ndecide that testing is once again required by the United States in \npursuit of our national interests, that option is protected. The treaty \nlanguage is very clear: We can--and I am sure we will--withdraw.\n  My appeal in closing is to say, Can't we find a way to come back to \nsome sense of common purpose and shared vision of a future? Both sides \nhave said on the floor that nuclear proliferation is one of the great \nthreats to our future. We are hurtling down a path, as this dreadful \npower spreads to other countries of the world, many of them rogue \nnations, where we cannot rely on the bizarre system of mutual assured \ndestruction that saved the United States from nuclear war during the \ncold war. If an accident becomes more likely, the consequences will be \ndreadful. Can't we find a way to avoid good old-fashioned gridlock, \nwhich is survivable on most occasions in this Senate, but I think \npotentially devastating on this occasion?\n  I appeal to my colleagues on the other side, whether there is or is \nnot a vote now on this treaty, let's get together and figure a way we \ncan sit, study the matter, talk to people in the Pentagon and people in \nallied countries, and see if we cannot find a way to agree on enough \nreservations, safeguards, and conditions to come back, hopefully next \nyear, and ratify this treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: If we go into a quorum call at this \npoint, the time is taken out equally from the opponents and proponents; \nis that right or wrong?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It takes unanimous consent to be charged \nequally. Otherwise, the time will be charged against the side which \nsuggests the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this may be one of the most important \ndebates the Senate will have in this recent time. In my view, the \nratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is the single most \nimportant step we can take today to reduce the danger of nuclear war. \nSurely we are in no position to hold a premature vote today or tomorrow \non this.\n  After 2 years of irresponsible stonewalling, the Senate has finally \nbegun a serious debate on this treaty. This debate should be the \nbeginning--not the end--of a more extensive and thoughtful discussion \nof this extremely important issue. The stakes involved in whether to \nratify or reject this treaty are clear. Our decision will reverberate \nthroughout the world, and could very well determine the future of \ninternational nuclear weapons proliferation for years to come.\n  We have a unique opportunity to help end nuclear testing once and for \nall. The United States is the world's premiere nuclear power. The \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty locks us into that position. No other \nnations have the capability to assure that their nuclear arsenals are \nsafe and reliable without testing. We have that capability now, and the \nprospects are excellent that we can retain that capability in the \nfuture.\n  Over the past 40 years, we have conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests. \nWe currently have extensive data available to us from these tests--data \nthat would provide us with an inherent advantage under the Treaty. As \nHans A. Bethe, the Nobel Prize winning physicist and former Director of \nthe Theoretical Division at Los Alamos Laboratory, stated in an October \n3 letter to President Clinton,\n\n       Every thinking person should realize that this treaty is \n     uniquely in favor of the United States. We have a substantial \n     lead in atomic weapons technology over all other countries. \n     We have tested weapons of all sizes and shapes suitable for \n     military purposes. We have no interest in and no need for \n     further development through testing. Other existing nuclear \n     powers would need tests to make up this technological gap. \n     And even more importantly, a test ban would make it \n     essentially impossible for new nuclear powers to emerge.\n  As the foremost nuclear power, other nations look to us for \ninternational leadership. We led the negotiations for this treaty. We \nwere the first of the declared nuclear powers to sign the Treaty. Yet, \nnow, because of our inaction and irresponsibility, we have made it \nnecessary for the leaders of three of our closest allies to plead with \nus not to defeat the Treaty.\n  These three leaders--Prime Minister Chirac of France, Prime Minister \nBlair of Britain, and Chancellor Schroeder of Germany--wrote in an OpEd \narticle in the New York Times last Friday that, ``Failure to ratify the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty will be a failure in our struggle against \nproliferation. The stabilizing effect of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, \nextended in 1995, would be undermined. Disarmament negotiations would \nsuffer.'' They also go on to say that, ``Rejection of the treaty in the \nSenate would remove the pressure from other states still hesitating \nabout whether to ratify it. Rejection would give great encouragement to \nproliferators. Rejection would also expose a fundamental divergence \nwithin NATO.''\n  Our relationship with our most valuable allies is on the line. It \nwould be the height of irresponsibility for the United States Senate to \nsend the world a message that we don't care if other nations test \nnuclear weapons, or develop their own nuclear arsenals. Surely, the \nrisks of nuclear proliferation are too great for us to send a message \nlike that.\n  The United States stopped conducting nuclear tests in 1992. Doing all \nwe can to see that other nations follow suit is critical for our \nnational security. Russia and China have both indicated that they are \nprepared to ratify the Treaty if the U.S. ratifies it. If the Senate \nfails to ratify it, the likely result is a dangerous new spiral of \nnuclear testing and nuclear proliferation.\n  Many of my colleagues have spoken about the fact that there is no \nguarantee about this Treaty. I argue that there is one guarantee--if we \nfail to ratify the Treaty, the consequences are grave, and could be \ncatastrophic for our country and for all nations.\n  Last week, we held hearings in the Armed Services Committee on the \nTreaty, and I commend the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of \nthat Committee for taking the lead on this extremely important issue. \nWe listened to expert witnesses on both sides of the aisle, as they \npresented testimony on the Treaty and the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram.\n  General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified \nthat it was the unanimous conclusion of all of the Joint Chiefs, that \nthe Treaty is in our national interest. General Shelton said, ``The \nCTBT will help limit the development of more advanced and destructive \nweapons and inhibit the ability of more countries to acquire nuclear \nweapons. In short, the world will be a safer place with the treaty than \nwithout it, and it is in our national security interests to ratify the \nCTBT.''\n  Some of my colleagues have referred to the Treaty as ``unilateral \ndisarmament.'' This characterization is grossly inaccurate, both in \npolicy and in practice. A key element of our adherence to the Treaty, \nwith the Administration's safeguards, is the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram.\n\n[[Page S12355]]\n\n  Last Thursday, in the Armed Services Committee, each of the directors \nof our nuclear labs testified about that program. John Browne, the \ndirector of Los Alamos National Laboratory, said, ``Through the \nStockpile Stewardship program, we intend to demonstrate a technical \nexcellence in weapons-relevant science and engineering that will \nproject confidence in our nuclear capability. This technical excellence \nwill be evident in our unclassified publications and presentations at \nscientific conferences. Other countries will see these accomplishments \nand will understand their connection to the quality of our weapons \nprograms.'' With the Stockpile Stewardship Program, we will still be \nable to maintain a powerful nuclear deterrent.\n  Critics argue that the Treaty's not 100 percent verifiable. In \nreality, the Treaty enhances our current ability to monitor nuclear \ntesting worldwide. It establishes an International Monitoring System, \nwhich creates a global network of 321 testing monitors. We would get \nall of the benefits of this larger system and only have to pay 25 \npercent of its total cost. The Treaty also establishes an on-site \ninspection system. Perhaps most important, it will hold other nations \naccountable for their actions, and require them to provide explanations \nfor suspicious conduct.\n  We also have a safety valve in the Treaty--Safeguard F. The \nAdministration didn't send this Treaty to the Senate as a stand-alone \ndocument. They sent it here with six Safeguards under which, and only \nunder which, the United States will adhere to the Treaty.\n  As Safeguard F states, adherence to the Treaty is explicitly \nconditioned on:\n\n       . . . the understanding that if the President of the United \n     States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of Energy that a high level of confidence in the \n     safety or reliability of our nuclear weapons can no longer be \n     certified, the President, in consultation with Congress, can \n     withdraw from the Treaty.\n\n  The importance of this safeguard cannot be overstated. It ensures \nthat we will be able to do what is necessary to maintain our nuclear \narsenal.\n  President Kennedy, in his address to American University on June 10, \n1963, spoke about the issue of verification while discussing the \nLimited Test Ban Treaty. He said,\n\n       No treaty, however much it may be to the advantage of all, \n     however tightly it may be worded, can provide absolute \n     security against the risks of deception and evasion. But it \n     can--if it is sufficiently effective in its enforcement and \n     if it is sufficiently in the interests of its signers--offer \n     far more security and far fewer risks than an unabated, \n     uncontrolled, unpredictable arms race.\n\n  These words still hold true today. The risks posed by ratification of \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty pale in comparison to the risks posed \nif we reject it. We have the opportunity, with this treaty, to open the \ndoor to a world without nuclear testing--a world that will be far safer \nfrom the danger of nuclear war.\n  Voting on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is one of the most \nimportant decisions that many of us will ever make. This vote holds \nprofound implications not only for our generation, but for all the \ngenerations in the future. It makes no sense to risk a premature vote \nnow that could result in rejection of the Treaty. As the poet Robert \nFrost pointed out, ``Two roads diverged in a wood''--and the one we \ntake may well make all the difference between peace and nuclear war.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield it back to Senator \nBiden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The argument has been made that the United States will not be able to \nmodernize its deterrent arsenal to meet new threats or encounter new \ntechnologies under the Strategic Stockpile Stewardship Program, and \nthat is why some of my colleagues are saying we cannot go ahead with \nthis treaty.\n  I want to make it clear, the test ban treaty does not prevent us from \nadapting most operational characteristics of a nuclear weapons system \nto changing military missions, should we determine we have to do that. \nMany important parts of a nuclear weapon can confidently be developed, \ntested, and integrated into nuclear weapons without any nuclear tests \nbecause they do not involve changes in the primary or secondary \ncomponents of the warhead; that is, the so-called physics package.\n  Dr. Paul Robinson, the Director of the Sandia National Laboratory, \ntold the Armed Services Committee on Thursday night:\n\n       Adapting deployed nuclear designs to new delivery systems, \n     or even other delivery modes, is not constrained by the \n     elimination of nuclear yield testing.\n\n  Let me put this in ordinary English. We keep being told here what has \nhappened is, if we sign on to this treaty without this Stockpile \nStewardship Program being fully completed, we are going to put \nourselves at great disadvantage, amounting to nuclear disarmament; we \nwill not be able to modernize our systems, and our systems are going to \natrophy.\n  Dr. Robinson, the Director of Sandia, went on to describe a prominent \nsuccess in the Stockpile Stewardship Program that is working now. We \nhave nine deployed systems, nine different kinds of nuclear bombs. One \nof them is the B61 Mod-7 strategic bomb. That was adapted without any \nnuclear tests.\n  I have a photograph of that I will hold up now. That is a B-1 bomber. \nThat red missile that is being dropped out of the belly of that bomber \nis a change in the B61 Mod-7 to a B61 Mod-11, in response to a \ndifferent requirement.\n  What was the different requirement? The military said they needed a \nnuclear weapon that could destroy targets that were buried very deeply \nin the ground, and that Mod-7 version of the B61 nuclear warhead could \nnot do that. So without any nuclear test, they tested a new system. It \nis called the Mod-11. That can penetrate the Earth deeply and destroy \ndeeply buried targets.\n  This picture illustrates an important fact. You can test nearly \neverything in a nuclear weapon so long as you do not put enough nuclear \nmaterial in it to cause an uncontrolled chain reaction. We did not set \noff this bomb, but we did test the bomb. You can take the plutonium out \nof the bomb, and put uranium in the bomb, and you can test it. It just \ndoesn't set off this uncontrolled chain reaction. So this idea that we \ncannot change anything in our arsenal if we sign on to this is simply \nnot correct.\n  By the way, the JASON Group, which is the most prestigious group of \nnuclear scientists in the United States of America, studied this, and \nthey said the Strategic Stockpile Stewardship Program can maintain all \nof our systems. One particular member of that group, testifying before \nthe committee, Dr. Garwin, points out that we can even exchange entire \nphysics packages; that is the plutonium and that secondary package, \nthat device that explodes it, that blows up. In my visual image of it, \nthe best way to explain it, as I was trying to explain it to my \ndaughter who is a freshman in college, what happens is you get this \nplutonium, and you have to have something to ignite it, set it off. So \nthere is a secondary explosion that takes place, and it shoots all \nthese rods into this plutonium at incredible speeds.\n  I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  What happens is it detonates the weapon, this chain reaction starts, \nand you have a thermonuclear explosion.\n  The question has been raised whether or not, if we figured out that \nthis plutonium was no longer either stable or functional or was not \nreliable, could you take out of the warhead the thing that makes it go \nboom, the thing that causes the chain reaction, the thermonuclear \nexplosion, and put a new package in? Dr. Garwin says you sure can do \nthat, without testing, without nuclear tests.\n  This year, the first W-87--that is another warhead--life extension \nunit was assembled in February for the Air Force at the Y12 plant in \nOak Ridge. It met the first production milestone for the W-87 life \nextension.\n  These are major milestones and successes in the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram. I might add, as my friend from Massachusetts knows, nobody is \nsuggesting we start to test now--nobody that I am aware of. I should \nnot say nobody. Nobody I am aware of. There may be somebody suggesting \nit.\n  Preservation of the option of modernizing U.S. nuclear weapons to \ncounter emerging defensive technologies, the phrase you hear, does not \nrequire ongoing nuclear testing. The most likely\n\n[[Page S12356]]\n\ncountermeasures would involve changes to the missile and its reentry \nsystem, not to the nuclear explosive.\n  It is a red herring to suggest if we sign on to this treaty, we are \nlocking ourselves into a system that is decaying and moving into \natrophy and we are going to find ourselves some day essentially \nunilaterally disarmed. That is a specious argument.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There were some questions raised in the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield time to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What assurances will we have that there will be \ncontinued funding for the Stockpile Stewardship Program? I imagine that \nthe Senator agrees, if this is indeed a concern, that we would be glad \nto make funding for the Stockpile Stewardship Program mandatory. And, I \ndoubt that there would be any hesitancy, on the part of our colleagues, \nto get broad support for this in the Senate, if that was what was \nneeded so that ensuring funding for this important program wasn't an \nissue or a question.\n  Many of the witnesses at the hearings said: ``How do we know there \nwill be continued funding? They may very well cut back that program.'' \nIs this another area about which the Senator is concerned, that we \ndon't know whether, year-to-year, the funds will be available for the \nStockpile Stewardship Program.\n  Can he give us some insight about his own thinking on how we can give \nassurances to the lab directors that there will be adequate funding for \nthat program in the future?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator, as usual, puts his finger on one of the \nincredible flaws in our opponents' reasoning. They engage in circular \nreasoning. It goes like this: Without spending money on the Stockpile \nStewardship Program, roughly $4.5 billion a year for 10 years, we will \nnot be able to attain, when the shelf life of these weapons is reached \n10 years out or more, a degree of certainty that they are reliable and \nsafe.\n  You say: OK, we will fund it; we are for it, and the President sends \nup that number.\n  Then they say: But we have a problem. Our Republican friends in the \nHouse won't vote for that much money, and we had to fight too hard to \nget it and they probably won't do it next year. The reason why, they go \non to say, I am against this, although I think if we funded it, it \nwould work and it would make sense, is my Republican colleagues in the \nHouse probably won't fund it; therefore, I can't be for this treaty \nbecause you guys are not funding the stockpile.\n  I find that absolutely fascinating, but it is the circular reasoning \nwhich is being engaged. It strings together a group of non sequiturs \nthat end up leading to a conclusion that makes no sense.\n  The Senator has been here longer than I. Can he imagine, if we vote \nthis treaty down and other nations begin to test, and those who voted \nit down are saying, by doing that, we think the United States should be \nable to test, can you imagine this or future Congresses coming up with \n$45 billion to perfect a Stockpile Stewardship Program which purpose \nand design is to avoid nuclear testing, to spend $45 billion for the \nredundancy? Can the Senator imagine us doing that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I certainly cannot. The Senator has put his finger on \none of the many reasons for supporting the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram which is to give the necessary assurances that funding for \nmaintaining our weapons stockpile will be there year after year. This \nwas something I noted was a concern during the course of our hearings--\nthis question about the need for adequate funding. And, the Senator has \nresponded to that concern. There is broad support, certainly on our \nside or for those who support this treaty, for giving the assurance \nthat funding would be there. It is just one more of the arguments made \nby those who oppose this treaty that has now been rebutted. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator for his response. I will raise this \nwhen we get to the amendments. I wish to point out there is one other \nultimate safeguard. The ultimate safeguard is in the amendment, our \nlast provision, which says, if, in fact, we do not fund the stockpile \nand that causes the laboratory Directors to say, ``We cannot certify,'' \nand that means the Secretary of Energy says, ``We cannot certify,'' the \nPresident of the United States, upon that determination, must withdraw \nfrom the treaty and allow us to begin to test. I am amazed at the \narguments that are being made on the other side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield on that question, so the \namendment makes a change to the safeguards and makes this a mandatory \nrequirement on the President to exercise the Supreme National Interest \nif the stockpile cannot be certified?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And, that is the measure that is going to be advanced by \nthe leadership, yourself included, to be a part of the Resolution of \nRatification?\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct. By the way, it is much stronger than any \nPresident wants. It is section (E) of the amendment we sent. I will \nread it to the Senator:\n\n       Withdrawal from Treaty.--If the President determines that \n     nuclear testing is necessary--\n\n  The antecedent to that is the lab Directors say it--\n\n     to assure, with a high degree of confidence, the safety and \n     reliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile, \n     the President shall consult promptly with the Senate and \n     withdraw from the Treaty pursuant to Article IX (2) of the \n     Treaty in order to conduct whatever testing might be \n     required.\n\n  It is pretty strong.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. It is about as clear as can be. I \nsee our ranking member of the Armed Services Committee ready to speak, \nbut I welcome again the comments of the Senator from Delaware about the \nrisks to our international position if we fail to ratify or defeat the \nCTBT in terms of security and stability around the world and the \ncontinued possibility of nuclear testing over time.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am pleased that we \nheld narrowly focused hearings on the many national security \nimplications of this treaty. It is important that we narrowly focused \nour attention on our own national security issues. But, these broader \ninternational security issues are powerful, and in rereviewing and \nreading again the letters, statements, and editorials sent in \nopposition to the Treaty, I think the importance of the broader \ninternational security issues, of further testing by other countries, \nand what the implications are going to be has been missed. I know the \nSenator addressed those, but I hope before we get into the final hours \nof this debate the Senator from Delaware will review that for the \nbenefit of the membership.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, this \nis another part of the circular reasoning. What I heard this morning on \nthe floor and heard all day on Friday went like this: Without us being \nable to test, our 6,000 strategic nuclear weapons are going to become \nunreliable--which is ridiculous in my view. I strike the word \n``ridiculous.'' Which is highly unlikely. I am trying to be polite. It \nis hard.\n  Then they say because it is going to become unreliable, two things \nare going to happen. One is that our allies are going to conclude that \nour deterrent is no longer credible and, therefore, they are going to \nlose faith in us. What they are then going to do is decide--Japan and \nGermany, which are nonnuclear powers--to become nuclear powers, and we \nare going to be escalating the arms race by passing this treaty.\n  The same day in an unprecedented move, to the best of my knowledge, \nthe leader of Germany, the leader of France, and the leader of Great \nBritain sent an open letter to the Senate saying: We, Germany, Japan, \nand France, have ratified this treaty. We strongly urge you, the \nSenate, to ratify this treaty in the interest of your country as well \nas ours.\n  One of those signatories was the Chancellor of Germany, the very \ncountry my friends on the other side say, if we pass this treaty, \nGermany will go nuclear. I guarantee--I cannot guarantee anything. I \nwill bet--I guess I am betting my career on this one--I will bet you \nanything that if we turn down\n\n[[Page S12357]]\n\nthis treaty and it is clear that it cannot be revived, within a decade \nGermany and Japan are likely to be nuclear powers, particularly Japan, \nbecause what is going to happen is, India and Pakistan are going to \ncontinue testing. They will not sign this treaty. They say they will \nsign it now if we do. They will not sign the treaty. As India tests \nmore and they move to deployment, China will test more.\n  China will test in order to determine whether or not they can build \nsmaller, lighter thermonuclear devices where multiple numbers can be \nput on missiles. They will move from 18 nuclear weapons to God knows \nhow many. Then Japan, sitting there in the midst of that region, is \ngoing to say, mark my words: We, Japan, have no choice but to become a \nnuclear power.\n  We have spent 50 years of our strategic and foreign policy \ninitiatives to make sure that does not happen. But that is what will \nhappen. So now, at the end of the day, are we likely to be more secure \n15 years from now with the scenario I paint? Which is more likely? Is \nit more likely that turning down this treaty is going to turn Japan and \nGermany into nuclear powers, increase the total nuclear capacity of \nChina, and move India and Pakistan further along the nuclear collision \npath? Is that more likely?\n  Or is it more likely--which is their worst case scenario--that what \nis going to happen is we are not going to fund the stockpile, we are \nnot going to be able, in 10 years, to count on the reliability of our \nweapons, the weapons lab Directors are going to come to the Secretary \nof Energy, the Secretary of Defense and say, we can't certify any more \nMessieurs Secretaries, and they go to the President of the United \nStates and say, we can't certify, and the President is going to say, \noh, that is OK; don't worry about it. We are going to be bound by the \ntreaty.\n  Which is a more likely scenario? What do you think? Which is more \nlikely, that even if the stockpile degrades, any country, from China to \nour allies, is going to say, gee, their B-60 M-11 may not function as \nthey thought it would, and maybe they will only be able to fire off \n4,900 strategic hydrogen bombs. Maybe they will only be able to do \nthat; therefore, they have lost their deterrent capacity. They no \nlonger have credibility.\n  That is what you have to accept. You have to accept those kinds of \narguments to sign on to the notion that most of our Republican friends \nare arguing.\n  Which is the more likely scenario? I would respectfully suggest that \n85 percent or 80 percent of the American people are right. They figured \nit out. They figured it out.\n  So I hope I have responded, in part at least, to the Senator's \nquestion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. You did. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield to the ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Delaware. I thank him also for \nthe leadership he has shown, both on the floor and off the floor, in \ntrying to bring this treaty to hearings before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, so that the full Senate could look at the pros and cons of \nthis in a deliberative way.\n  I start with a reference that Senator Biden made to three of our good \nallies--France, Germany, and Great Britain. The chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee is here and perhaps he will recollect otherwise; \nand I would trust his recollection on this, if he does--but I cannot \nremember when three of our closest allies' leaders have addressed a \ndirect plea to the Senate. At least in the 20 years I have been here, I \ndo not remember a letter coming in from the Chancellor of Germany and \nthe President of France, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain \npleading with us to ratify a treaty. That is how serious the stakes are \nin this debate.\n  The world is looking to the Senate. Sometimes we say that and believe \nit is true; but in this case we say it and know it is true. Because the \nworld has signed on both to a nonproliferation treaty and to a \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  There are a few exceptions, obviously. There are some states which \nwill not sign any such treaty. But except for a few rogue nations, the \nworld has signed on to a nonproliferation treaty and a Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. The world is looking at us, expecting our leadership.\n  Even though the world is looking to us to ratify, that does not mean \nwe should ratify this treaty if it makes us less secure. We should do \nwhat is in our security interests. But unless all of our allies and the \nrest of the world are wrong, the world will be a much more secure place \nif we stop testing nuclear weapons and if other countries stop testing \nnuclear weapons as well.\n  How do we tell India ``don't test'', if we ourselves want to test? \nHow do we tell Pakistan, ``don't test; for God's sake, for your \nsecurity and the world, don't test'', if we say, oh, but we want to \ncontinue to test?\n  What does that do to our argument? I would suggest it destroys it. It \ndestroys our standing to try to persuade countries that want to become \nnuclear powers, that want to add to their inventories, that want to \nimprove their inventories--it wipes out our standing to make the \nargument, if we say everybody else ought to stop testing but us.\n  We are the only superpower in this world. That gives us certain \nresponsibilities. But one of those responsibilities is that we should \nbe not just a superpower, but we should be superwise as well. We should \nrealize that we are not always going to be the world's only \nsuperpower--nuclear or otherwise. We should behave with the realization \nthat our actions today are going to affect the rest of the world, \nincluding the direction they go in terms of nonproliferation.\n  As I said, I would not care if every country in the world signed or \nratified this treaty if it was not in our security interests. I think \nwe ought to listen, we ought to understand what the rest of the world \nis saying to us, we ought to remember our own commitments. We signed up \nto the indefinite extension of the nonproliferation treaty, and made a \ncommitment to the world to conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty. We \nshould remember our own commitments. We should consider what our allies \nand the rest of the world are saying to us. But if it were not in our \nown security interest, I would not recommend that we ratify the treaty.\n\n  But we should surely listen to our top military leaders as to what \nthey recommend to this Senate? What does the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff recommend strongly to the Senate? He says:\n\n       The test ban treaty will help limit the development of more \n     advanced and destructive weapons and inhibit the ability of \n     more countries to acquire nuclear weapons. It is true that \n     the treaty cannot prevent proliferation or reduce current \n     inventories, but it can restrict nuclear weapons progress and \n     reduce the risk of proliferation.\n\n  General Shelton said:\n\n       In short, the world will be a safer place with the treaty \n     than without it. And it is in our national security interest \n     to ratify the CTBT.\n\n  Secretary Cohen said the following:\n\n       By banning nuclear explosive testing, the treaty removes a \n     key tool that a proliferator would need in order to acquire \n     high confidence in its nuclear weapons designs.\n\n  Secretary Cohen said:\n\n       Furthermore, the treaty helps make it more difficult for \n     Russia, China, India, and Pakistan to improve existing types \n     of nuclear weapons and to develop advanced new types of \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  Secretary Cohen said:\n\n       In this way, the treaty contributes to the reduction of the \n     global nuclear threat. Thus, while the treaty cannot prevent \n     proliferation or reduce the current nuclear threat, it can \n     make more difficult the development of advanced new types of \n     nuclear weapons and thereby help cap the nuclear threat.\n\n  What the three world leaders, to whom I referred before and to whom \nSenator Biden referred earlier, said in their article and in their \nletter to us was the following:\n\n       Rejection of the treaty in the Senate would remove the \n     pressure from other states still hesitating about whether to \n     ratify it. Rejection would give great encouragement to \n     proliferators. Rejection would also expose a fundamental \n     divergence within NATO. The United States and its allies have \n     worked side by side for a comprehensive test ban since the \n     days of President Eisenhower. This goal is now within our \n     grasp. Our security is involved as well as America's. For the \n     security of the world we will leave to our children, we urge \n     the U.S. Senate to ratify the treaty. We\n\n[[Page S12358]]\n\n     have President Chirac, Prime Minister Blair, Chancellor \n     Schroeder of Germany, from their perspective, pleading \n     with us to ratify this treaty. We have our top military \n     leadership, uniformed and civilian, urging us to ratify \n     this treaty. That is the kind of assessment which has been \n     made of the value of this treaty. That is the kind of \n     analysis which has been made.\n\n  We should think carefully before we reject it; before we defeat a \ntreaty that is aimed at reducing the proliferation of nuclear weapons \nin the world; before we give up our leadership in the fight against \nproliferation; and our efforts to go after proliferators. We keep \nsaying the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the greatest \nthreat this Nation faces; our military leaders tell us this treaty is \nan important step in the fight against proliferation. Before we give up \nthat leadership and defeat a treaty which is adding momentum to the \nbattle against proliferators, we surely should stop and assess what it \nis this Senate is about to do.\n  It has been argued that we need testing for the safety of our \nstockpile. The answer is that the stewards of the stockpile, the lab \nDirectors, for the last 7 years have been certifying safety and \nreliability of the stockpile based not on testing, which we have given \nup for 7 years already, but based on a Stockpile Stewardship Program \nwhich has allowed them to certify with a high degree of confidence that \nour stockpile is safe and reliable, without one test in the last 7 \nyears.\n  Will they be able to do that forever? They think they can, but they \nare not sure. They told us they believe they will be able to continue \nto certify the safety and reliability of our stockpile without testing. \nThey have also told us something else. Here I want to read a letter \nfrom them because there has been such a misunderstanding about what \nthese three lab Directors have told us at our hearing. After the \nhearing, they wrote a joint statement from which I want to read:\n\n       While there can never be a guarantee that the stockpile \n     will remain safe and reliable indefinitely without nuclear \n     testing, we have stated that we are confident that a fully \n     supported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will \n     enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent \n     without nuclear testing. If that turns out not to be the \n     case, Safeguard F--which is a condition for entry into the \n     Test Ban Treat by the U.S.--provides for the President, in \n     consultation with Congress, to withdraw from the treaty under \n     the standard ``supreme national interest'' clause in order to \n     conduct whatever testing might be required.\n\n  People can quote different parts of the lab Directors' testimony. I \nwas there for it. The bottom line is, while they cannot guarantee that \nthe Stockpile Stewardship Program will always allow them to certify \nsafety and reliability, they believe it will be able to do so, and \ntherefore they are, in the words of one of them, ``signed onto'' this \ntreaty. That is because if they can't certify the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear stockpile in some future year they have the \nassurance in safeguard F, by which we can withdraw from the treaty if \nwe need to conduct a nuclear test. We have incorporated that safeguard \nand, indeed, strengthened it in the amendment to this resolution, that \nwe will withdraw from this treaty and begin nuclear testing again if \nnecessary. We do not want our stockpile to be unsafe or unreliable. \nNobody does--none of us.\n  The question then is, Can we join the rest of the world, at least the \ncivilized world, in a comprehensive test ban to fight the proliferation \nof nuclear weapons, and at the same time assure ourselves that if we \nneed to test again, we will be able to do so by notifying the rest of \nthe civilized world in advance that we retain the right to withdraw \nfrom the treaty and test if our security requires it? In other words, \nin the event the day comes when testing is needed to certify safety and \nreliability, we are putting the world on notice now that we intend to \nexercise that withdrawal clause.\n\n  Could somebody cheat? That is the other argument which has been used, \nthat somebody could cheat at a very low level of testing, that somebody \nmight be able to get away with it, that our seismic detection \ncapability is not such that we would be certain we would catch a very \nlow level test.\n  This is what Secretary Cohen says about the cheating question:\n\n       Is it possible for states to cheat on the treaty without \n     being detected? The answer is yes. We would not be able to \n     detect every evasively conducted nuclear test. And from a \n     national security perspective, we do not need to. But I \n     believe that the United States will be able to detect a level \n     of testing, the yield and number of tests, by which a state \n     could undermine the U.S. nuclear deterrent.\n\n  So the Secretary of Defense is testifying that militarily significant \ncheating would be caught, that a low-level test by a power would be \ntaking a huge risk in cheating, because there are other means besides \nseismic detection to get evidence of a cheating. But most importantly, \nif a signatory to this treaty decided to cheat and take that risk, they \ncould not undermine our nuclear deterrent. It would not be a militarily \nsignificant cheating that could occur without our knowing it \nseismically. We would not have to rely on other means in order to \ndiscover a militarily significant act of cheating. Plus, General \nShelton and Secretary Cohen have both told us that the treaty, if it \ncomes into effect, will increase our ability to observe and monitor \ntests because it will create over 300 additional monitoring stations in \n90 countries specifically in order to detect nuclear testing.\n  I will conclude with two points. One, this Senate is not ready to \nratify this treaty. Indeed, maybe it never will ratify the treaty. But \nit is clear now that this Senate will not ratify the treaty at this \ntime. I believe at a minimum we should do no damage, do no harm.\n  There are many of us who have not focused adequately on these issues, \nby the way. This has been a very truncated period of time for \nconsideration, with very few hearings focused directly on the treaty. I \nknow we had three hearings in the Armed Services Committee, and there \nwas one in Foreign Relations last week that focused directly on this \ntreaty.\n  We are here under a unanimous consent agreement which allows only one \namendment by the majority leader and one by the Democratic leader to \nthis treaty, an unusual restriction for consideration and deliberation \nof a treaty. No other amendments are in order; no other restrictions, \nconditions on a resolution of ratification, but the one. So we are here \nin a very restricted circumstance and a very short time limit. It is \nnot a deliberative way to address a treaty. This Senate should do \nbetter.\n  At a minimum, my plea is, do no harm. Do no harm to the cause of \nantiproliferation. The way to avoid doing harm, regardless of where \npeople think they are on the merits of the treaty, is to delay \nconsideration of this treaty.\n  My final point has to do with the delay issue. There is a precedent \nfor delaying a vote on a treaty even though a vote had actually been \nscheduled. The precedent is the most recent arms control treaty we \nlooked at, I believe, which is the Chemical Weapons Convention. There \nwas a vote actually scheduled on the Chemical Weapons Convention. There \nwas a vote that was scheduled on the Chemical Weapons Convention for \nSeptember 12, 1996. Shortly before that vote, Senator Dole, who was \nthen a candidate for President, announced his opposition to the \nChemical Weapons Convention. It was decided on the 12th, which I \nbelieve was the actual day scheduled by unanimous consent for a vote on \nthe convention, it was decided to vitiate that unanimous consent \nagreement and to delay the vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. A \nvote was set, by unanimous consent agreement, but given the opposition \nof one of the Presidential candidates--similar to what we have going on \nnow, by the way, where we have opposing positions taken by Presidential \ncandidates of both parties--it was decided then that it was the wiser \ncourse for the Senate to delay the vote on the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n\n  I said before on this floor last week that I think we are in an \nanalogous situation to what occurred back in September of 1996. I raise \nit again for a very specific point. At that time, there were no \nconditions attached to the decision to delay the vote. The Senate \nagreed to vitiate the unanimous consent agreement, to delay the vote; \nbut there was no requirement, no condition attached as to when it would \nbe brought up or not brought up. It was simply to vitiate. People \ndecided--we decided in this body--that it was a wiser course of action \nnot to proceed under the circumstances--one similar to what exists now, \nbut there are different circumstances now that are, I think, additional \nreasons not to vote at\n\n[[Page S12359]]\n\nthis time, including the very narrow UC under which we are operating, \nwith the strict consideration of a total of two amendments.\n  I suggest we look back--and we are going to do what each of us always \ndoes, which is follow our own consciences as to what is best for this \nNation. In my judgment, ratification is best, but, clearly, that is not \nwhere the Senate is now. I hope there is a majority of us who believe, \nfor various reasons, the better course of wisdom is that we not proceed \nto defeat this treaty at this time--whether it is because that defeat \nwould constitute a blow to our leadership in the battle against \nproliferation in this world, as three major allies have told us, or \nwhether it is because this institution has not had adequate time yet to \nfully understand and consider and deliberate over this very complicated \ntreaty; for whatever reason--and many exist--I hope we will delay this \nvote. I cannot foresee a circumstance, as I have told my good friend \nfrom Virginia, where I would want to see this treaty brought up next \nyear, given the fact that the election is at the end of next year. \nHowever, I can't preclude any circumstance from existing. I can't \npredict every world circumstance that would exist, where I would be \ncomfortable saying we should under no circumstances consider this \ntreaty, no matter what happens.\n  But I can, in good conscience, say I can't foresee any such \ncircumstances because I can't. Will the world situation change? Will \nIndia and Pakistan begin testing because we fail to ratify? Will that \nthen lead to China to begin their testing again? Will that have an \nimpact on Russia? Will the political situation change in the United \nStates where candidates of both parties will possibly decide that this \ntreaty is in our best interest? Can I foresee any of that happening? \nNo. Do I believe any of that will happen? No. But it could.\n  Circumstances can change. So I would not want to see us saying there \nare no circumstances under which anybody could even raise the question \nof consideration of this treaty next year. It is a very straightforward \nstatement and, again, I conclude by saying, personally, I hope we delay \nthe vote. Personally, I can foresee no circumstances under which this \nshould be brought up next year. We should wait until after the \nPresidential elections, in the absence of some unforeseeable \ncircumstance. But I hope that is what the Senate, in its deliberative \nwisdom, decides to do.\n  At this time, I have been authorized to yield 5 minutes to Senator \nDorgan. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, who will acquire nuclear weapons in the \nmonths and years ahead? Which countries? Which groups? Which \nindividuals, perhaps, will acquire nuclear weapons? Many would like to \nacquire nuclear weapons. Terrorist groups would like access to nuclear \nweapons. Rogue countries would like access to nuclear weapons.\n  The cold war is over, the Soviet Union is gone, the Ukraine is \nnuclear free; the two nuclear superpowers are Russia and the United \nStates. Between us, we have 30,000 nuclear weapons. What responsibility \ndo we have as a country to try to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons \nto other countries and to reduce the nuclear weapons that now exist? \nWell, we have a lot of responsibility. It is our requirement as a \ncountry to exercise the moral leadership in the world, to reduce the \ndangers of nuclear war, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  Some have never supported any arms control agreements. I respect \nthat. They have a right to do that. I don't agree with it. I think it \nis wrong. Nonetheless, there are those who have never supported any \narms control agreements. Yet, arms control agreements work. We know \nthey work.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show a piece of a Russian Backfire bomber \nwing on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is a piece of a wing sawed off of a Russian Backfire \nbomber. This bomber wasn't brought down from the skies with hostile \nfire. This bomber wasn't destroyed because of conflict. This piece of \nwing came from a Russian bomber because this country and the Russians \nhave an agreement to reduce the number of bombers, missiles, and \nsubmarines in our arsenal, and reduce the number of nuclear warheads.\n  This other item is copper wiring, ground up from a Russian submarine \nthat used to carry missiles with nuclear warheads aimed at the United \nStates of America. Did we sink that submarine in hostile waters? No, it \nwas destroyed and the wiring ground up by the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program, under which the United States assists in the \ndestruction of bombers, missiles, and warheads in Russia. We bring down \nthe number of weapons in our stockpile; they bring down the weapons in \ntheirs. The delivery systems are brought down as well.\n  Does arms control work? Of course, it works. We know it works. That \nis why I am able to hold the part of a Russian bomber here in the U.S. \nSenate. Of course, it works. There are some who have never supported \nany of this. They have that right. But, in my judgment, the decision \nnot to support aggressive arms control efforts is inappropriate and \nwrong.\n  Now we are debating the issue of whether we will have a Comprehensive \nNuclear Test-Ban Treaty--something that was aspired to by President \nEisenhower nearly 40 years ago. A Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty \nwas something that President Eisenhower lamented he was not able to \naccomplish. Forty years later--after years of negotiation--2 years ago, \nit was sent to the Senate, signed by the President, and asked to be \nratified in the Senate. It was sent to the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I know there have been debates about it, but there was not \none hearing in that Foreign Relations Committee in 2 years on the CTBT. \nAnd then, with 10 days' notice, it is brought to the floor of the \nSenate for a vote. Some say, well, that is fine. That is a \nconsideration. That is not thoughtful consideration; that is a \nthoughtless way to handle this issue.\n  This is a serious issue, a big issue, an issue with great \nconsequence. Ten days, no comprehensive hearings--that is a thoughtless \nway to handle this issue. India and Pakistan have detonated nuclear \nweapons literally under each other's chin. They don't like each other. \nThat is an ominous development for the world. The question of whether \nit could result in a nuclear exchange or a nuclear war is a very real \nquestion. Can we as a country intervene to say, do not explode these \nnuclear weapons, do not test nuclear weapons? Do we have the ability to \nsay to India and Pakistan that this is a dangerous step?\n  Mr. President, we had better have that resolve. That resolve must \ncome from us.\n  I have heard a lot of reasons on the Senate floor why this should not \nbe ratified all from the same folks who have never supported \nratification of any treaty that would lead in the direction of arms \ncontrol. All of the arguments I have heard, in my judgment, are not \nrelevant to this treaty. It is proposed that somehow this treaty would \nweaken our country.\n  Here is what would happen when this treaty is ratified. The number of \nmonitoring stations across the world will go to well over 300. We will \nsubstantially enhance our capability to monitor whether anyone explodes \na nuclear weapon.\n  Here is what we have now. Here is what they will have if the CTBT \nenters into force.\n  How on Earth can anyone credibly argue that this doesn't strengthen \nour ability to detect nuclear explosions anywhere on the Earth? It is \nan absurd argument to suggest that somehow ratifying this treaty will \nweaken our country.\n  The last four Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all the senior \nmilitary leadership now serving in this country, including Gen. Colin \nPowell, and previously retired Joint Chiefs of Staff support this \ntreaty. Would they do so because they want to weaken this country? Of \ncourse not. They support this treaty because they know and we know this \ntreaty will strengthen this country. It will strengthen our resolve to \ntry to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. The Joint Chiefs of Staff \nsay in a very real sense that one of the best ways to protect our \ntroops and our interests is to promote arms control, in both the \nconventional and nuclear realms, arms control can reduce the chances of \nconflict.\n\n[[Page S12360]]\n\n  Gen. Omar Bradley said, ``We wage war like physical giants and seek \npeace like ethical infants.''\n  There is not nearly the appetite that, in my judgment, must exist in \nthis country--and especially in this Senate--to stand up for important \nsignificant issues--serious issues. That is what we have here.\n  The military leaders say this treaty is in this country's security \ninterest. The scientists, 32 Nobel laureates, the chemists, physicists, \nsupport ratification. Dr. Garwin, who I was out on the steps of the \nCapitol with last week, who worked on the first nuclear bomb in this \ncountry, says this treaty is in this country's interest. We can \nsafeguard this country's nuclear stockpile, the scientists say; we can \ndo that, they say. And the detractors say, no, you can't. These \ndetractors--let me talk for a minute about this.\n  National missile defense: They say: Let's deploy a national missile \ndefense system right this minute. The Pentagon and the scientists say \nwe can't, we don't have the capability. Our friends say: No. We don't \nagree with you. You can and you have the capability. They say: We \ndemand you do it, and we want you to deploy it.\n  On the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, the detractors say: \nWell, it would weaken this country because we can't detect nuclear \ntests and we can't maintain our stockpile. And the military leaders and \nthe scientists say: You are wrong. We can safeguard our stockpiles. We \ncan detect nuclear explosions.\n  This selective choosing of when you are willing to support the \njudgment of the best scientists in this country or the military leaders \nof this country is very interesting.\n  Last week, Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, and Gerhard Schroeder, the \nleaders of England, France, and Germany, sent an op-ed piece to the New \nYork Times asking this country to ratify this treaty. That ought not be \nthe position this country is in. This country ought to be a leader on \nthis issue. Now, we are being asked by our allies to please lead. We \nought not have to be asked to provide leadership to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons. What are we thinking of?\n  Last week, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee referenced \ncomments from the Governor of my State on the floor of the Senate, \nsaying he is worried that the nuclear stockpile is not safe and \npointing out that we have nuclear weapons in our State.\n  It is an interesting and brand new argument that I hear. I have not \nheard anyone stand on the floor of the Senate in recent months saying \nwe have a real problem with the safety of the nuclear stockpile. This \nis just a straw man. That is what this is.\n  I know the majority leader thought it was probably an interesting \nstrategy to bring up the treaty without comprehensive hearings, without \ncomprehensive discussions and debate, and without much of an \nopportunity for the American people to be involved in the debate on a \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, and then say we want to vote on \nit. We are going to kill this thing.\n  You know those who think that way I guess can grin all the way to the \nvote tally. But there won't be smiles on the faces of those around the \nworld who rely on this country to be a leader in stopping the spread of \nnuclear weapons. This country has a greater responsibility in this \narea, and we can exercise that responsibility by voting to ratify this \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: How much time is under the control \nof the Senator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Is there time on the amendment once the amendment is \ncalled up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 4 hours equally divided on each \nof the two amendments that may be called up.\n  Mr. BIDEN. One last parliamentary inquiry. Am I able to call up the \nDemocratic leader's amendment now, and would the time begin to run on \nthat amendment now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2291\n\n(Purpose: To condition the advice and consent of the Senate on the six \n                 safeguards proposed by the President)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Democratic leader, I call \nup amendment No. 2291.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), for Mr. Daschle, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2291.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolved clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS.\n\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, opened for signature \n     and signed by the United States at New York on September 24, \n     1996, including the following annexes and associated \n     documents, all such documents being integral parts of and \n     collectively referred to in this resolution as the \n     ``Treaty,'' (contained in Senate Treaty document 105-28), \n     subject to the conditions in section 2:\n       (1) Annex 1 to the Treaty entitled ``List of States \n     Pursuant to Article II, Paragraph 28''.\n       (2) Annex 2 to the Treaty entitled ``List of States \n     Pursuant to Article XIV''.\n       (3) Protocol to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.\n       (4) Annex 1 to the Protocol.\n       (5) Annex 2 to the Protocol.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONDITIONS.\n\n       The advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of \n     the Treaty is subject to the following conditions, which \n     shall be binding upon the President:\n       (1) Stockpile Stewardship Program.--The United States shall \n     conduct a science-based Stockpile Stewardship program to \n     ensure that a high level of confidence in the safety and \n     reliability of nuclear weapons in the active stockpile is \n     maintained, including the conduct of a broad range of \n     effective and continuing experimental programs.\n       (2) Nuclear laboratory facilities and programs.--The United \n     States shall maintain modern nuclear laboratory facilities \n     and programs in theoretical and exploratory nuclear \n     technology that are designed to attract, retain, and ensure \n     the continued application of human scientific resources to \n     those programs on which continued progress in nuclear \n     technology depends.\n       (3) Maintenance of nuclear testing capability.--The United \n     States shall maintain the basic capability to resume nuclear \n     test activities prohibited by the Treaty in the event that \n     the United States ceases to be obligated to adhere to the \n     Treaty.\n       (4) Continuation of a comprehensive research and \n     development program.--The United States shall continue its \n     comprehensive research and development program to improve its \n     capabilities and operations for monitoring the Treaty.\n       (5) Intelligence gathering and analytical capabilities.--\n     The United States shall continue its development of a broad \n     range of intelligence gathering and analytical capabilities \n     and operations to ensure accurate and comprehensive \n     information on worldwide nuclear arsenals, nuclear weapons \n     development programs, and related nuclear programs.\n       (6) Withdrawal under the ``supreme interests'' clause.--\n       (A) Safety and reliability of the u.s. nuclear deterrent; \n     policy.--The United States--\n       (i) regards continued high confidence in the safety and \n     reliability of its nuclear weapons stockpile as a matter \n     affecting the supreme interests of the United States; and\n       (ii) will regard any events calling that confidence into \n     question as ``extraordinary events related to the subject \n     matter of the Treaty'' under Article IX(2) of the Treaty.\n       (B) Certification by secretary of defense and secretary of \n     energy.--Not later than December 31 of each year, the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy, after \n     receiving the advice of--\n       (i) the Nuclear Weapons Council (comprised of \n     representatives of the Department of Defense, the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, and the Department of Energy),\n       (ii) the Directors of the nuclear weapons laboratories of \n     the Department of Energy, and\n       (iii) the Commander of the United States Strategic Command, \n     shall certify to the President whether the United States \n     nuclear weapons stockpile and all critical elements thereof \n     are, to a high degree of confidence, safe and reliable. Such \n     certification shall be forwarded by the President to Congress \n     not later than 30 days after submission to the President.\n       (C) Recommendation whether to resume nuclear testing.--If, \n     in any calendar year, the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of Energy cannot make the certification required by \n     subparagraph (B), then the Secretaries shall recommend to the \n     President whether, in their opinion (with the advice of the \n     Nuclear Weapons Council, the Directors of the nuclear weapons \n     laboratories of the Department of Energy, and the Commander \n     of the United States Strategic Command),\n\n[[Page S12361]]\n\n     nuclear testing is necessary to assure, with a high degree of \n     confidence, the safety and reliability of the United States \n     nuclear weapons stockpile.\n       (D) Written certification; minority views.--In making the \n     certification under subparagraph (B) and the recommendations \n     under subparagraph (C), the Secretaries shall state the \n     reasons for their conclusions, and the views of the Nuclear \n     Weapons Council, the Directors of the nuclear weapons \n     laboratories of the Department of Energy, and the Commander \n     of the United States Strategic Command, and shall provide any \n     minority views.\n       (E) Withdrawal from the treaty.--If the President \n     determines that nuclear testing is necessary to assure, with \n     a high degree of confidence, the safety and reliability of \n     the United States nuclear weapons stockpile, the President \n     shall consult promptly with the Senate and withdraw from the \n     Treaty pursuant to Article IX(2) of the Treaty in order to \n     conduct whatever testing might be required.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, to put this in context, one of the \nunfortunate ways in which this debate has developed, in my view, on \nthis very important treaty is that the President of the United States \nwhen he put his signature on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty \nattached to it a number of conditions when he referred the treaty to \nthe Senate. He sent up, along with the treaty, a total of six \nconditions that he said he wanted added to the treaty before we \nratified the treaty.\n  As we all know, in previous arms control agreements, it has been our \npractice in the Senate to add conditions to treaties. When it was \nagreed that we were given essentially an ultimatum that if we wanted to \ndebate this treaty at all, we had to agree to the following time \nconstraints.\n  I was under the impression that the starting point for this debate \nwould be what the President said he wanted, which was he wanted us to \nratify the treaty itself and the six conditions. I found out later it \nwas only the treaty.\n  Although we were entitled to an amendment on each side, the \nDemocratic side, or in this case the Democratic leader's amendment \nwould have to be what the President said he wanted as part of the \npackage to begin with in order to be for the treaty.\n  Usually what has happened, as the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee knows, we debated at length, for instance the treaty on the \nChemical Weapons Convention we had extensive hearings in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. The outcome of those hearings was that we voted \non, or agreed upon, or we negotiated a number of conditions. There were \n28 conditions before we brought it to the Senate floor.\n  That is the usual process. But since we didn't have the first formal \nhearing on this treaty until after it was discharged--that is a fancy \nword for saying we no longer had any jurisdiction--and it was sent to \nthe floor, here we are in the dubious position of having to use 2 hours \non the one amendment we have available to us, an amendment to ask that \nthe President's whole package be considered. That is where we are.\n  The amendment that has been submitted by the Democratic leader \ncontains six conditions that corresponded to the six conditions that \nthe President of the United States said were needed in order for him to \nbe secure with the Senate ratifying this treaty. These conditions were \ndeveloped in 1995 before the United States signed the treaty. They were \ncritical to the decision by the executive branch to seek the test ban \ntreaty in which the standard would be a zero yield; that is, zero yield \nresulting from an uncontrolled chain react--a nuclear explosion.\n\n  We in turn think it is critical that in providing the advice and \nconsent to this treaty, the Senate codify these six safeguards that the \nPresident of the United States said were conditions to the Resolution \nof Ratification. Let me explain why.\n  The safeguards were announced by President Clinton in August of 1995. \nThey were merely statements of policy by the President, and there is no \nway for President Clinton to bind future Presidents with such \nstatements. However, we can.\n  Conditions in a Resolution of Ratification, by contrast--which is \nwhat I am proposing now--are binding upon all future Presidents. \nTherefore, approval of these conditions will lock them in for all time, \nso that any future President or future Congress, long after we are \ngone, will understand that these safeguards are essential to our \ncontinued participation in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Administration witnesses who testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee and the Foreign Relations Committee underscored the \nimportance of these safeguards during the Senate hearings last week. I \nsuspect that is why our Republican friends didn't allow Members to \nbring these up as part of the original instruments. So we started off \nas we would had it come out of committee, with the actual treaty, plus \nthe conditions attached. I expect the reason they didn't want this side \nto do that is it would strengthen the hands of those who were for the \ntreaty.\n  I understand the tactical move, but I think it is unfortunate \nbecause, as we all know, the witnesses who testified from the \nadministration, others from the laboratories, and others who were with \nthe laboratories and were in former administrations, all those people \nwho testified underscored the importance of these safeguards. In other \nwords, they didn't want the treaty without these safeguards.\n  During the testimony before the Armed Services Committee, Dr. Paul \nRobinson, Director of Sandia Laboratory, testified:\n\n       The President's six safeguards should be formalized in the \n     resolution of ratification.\n\n  General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated:\n\n       The Joint Chiefs support ratification of CTBT with the \n     safeguards package.\n\n  Of the six conditions, the first, the third, and the last are \ninterrelated and probably the most important. The first condition \nrelates to the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Anyone who has listened \nto this debate now understands what that is. The Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram will be essential to ensuring the safety and reliability of our \nnuclear weapons in the future. It requires this condition: That the \nUnited States shall conduct a science-based Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram to ensure a high level of confidence in the safety and the \nreliability of nuclear weapons in our active stockpile.\n  As we have all heard over the course of this debate, this Stockpile \nStewardship Program is a 10-year, $45 billion, or $4.5 billion-a-year, \nproject that is designed to maintain the nuclear stockpile, and it will \ninvolve cutting-edge science, as it already has. It is already \nunderway, and the Directors of the three National Laboratories have \ntestified they believe they can maintain the stockpile of our nuclear \nweapons if the funding is provided.\n\n  Already there have been difficulties, particularly in the other body, \nin securing this level of funding. This first condition our amendment \ncontains will assure that the funding will be there. The third \ncondition which is in the amendment before the Senate requires that the \nUnited States ``maintain the basic capability to resume nuclear test \nactivities prohibited by the treaty in the event that the United States \nceases to be obliged to adhere to the committee.'' That means countries \nhave to have a place to test the weapons underground.\n  We could let our underground test facilities go to seed and not \nmaintain them, so that when the time came that we ever did have to pull \nout of this treaty, we would not be prepared to be able to resume \ntesting. So we say as a further safeguard against the remote \npossibility that we will not be able to, through the Stockpile \nStewardship Program, guarantee the reliability and safety of our \nweapons, a condition of the United States staying in this treaty is \nthat the Congress appropriate the money and the President and future \nPresidents use the money to maintain the facilities necessary to be \nable to resume this testing if that event occurs.\n  The effort to maintain this capacity is also well underway, I might \nadd. It is also tied to the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Subcritical \nexperiments--and we use certain phrases so much around here, sometimes \nit is easy to forget that most Members don't have nuclear weapons as \ntheir primary responsibility, and people listening on C-SPAN or the \npress aren't--although many are--required to spend time to know what \ncertain phrases mean. A subcritical experiment means a country can set \noff an explosion that doesn't start a chain reaction. It only becomes \ncritical when there is a chain reaction, which makes it a nuclear \nexplosion. Subcritical means before the rods go banging\n\n[[Page S12362]]\n\ninto the plutonium and something is started. That is a chain reaction.\n  The subcritical experiments at the Nevada Test Site, which are a \nvital part of our stockpile stewardship, also enable test site \npersonnel to keep and hone their skills and practice the procedures for \nactual nuclear weapons tests. Translated, that means we have \nspecialized scientists who in the past have participated in the over \n1,000 nuclear detonations we have used over the history of our program, \nand that without having detonated a nuclear explosion since 1992, these \nskilled scientists still keep their skills honed by going into this \ntest site facility and doing subcritical tests; for example, using \nuranium instead of plutonium or performing other tests that don't \nrequire a nuclear explosion.\n  We are not only maintaining the capability of being able to do a \nnuclear explosion; we are maintaining the necessary personnel. The fact \nthat subcritical experiments are scientifically valid and challenging \nalso serves to make work at the test site worthwhile and attractive to \nskilled personnel.\n  The reason I bother to mention that, in an argument against the \ntreaty by one of the scientists who testified, I think before Senator \nHelms' and my committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, he said: We \nreally like to make things go boom. He said: I'm a scientist; I like to \nmake them go to the end of the experiment. I like to conduct them that \nway. But I can do it without making them go boom.\n\n  What people worry about now, if you are not going to ``make 'em go \nboom,'' if you are not going to explode them, some will say scientists \nwon't want to be involved in that; it is not as exciting as if they \ncould actually test. That is an argument that says we will lose a whole \ngeneration of nuclear scientists who know how to conduct these tests \nand know how to read them.\n  Other scientists come along and, with the laboratories, say: No, no, \nno; we can keep all the interest we need to keep in a group of young \nscientists who will replace the aging scientific community who have \nbeen performing the tests because we will do what we call subcritical \ntests at the sites where we used to do the critical tests.\n  Part of the agreement, part of the understanding, the requirement, is \nthese facilities have to be maintained as opposed to saying we have a \ntreaty now, we will not do nuclear explosions, so why spend the money \non maintaining these facilities?\n  The answer is: To keep scientists interested and to bring a whole new \nnext generation of brain power into this area so they will have \nsomething they believe is worthwhile to do, as opposed to them going \nout and inventing new widgets, or deciding they are going to develop a \ncommercial product or something. That is one of the legitimate \nconcerns.\n  The second concern has been: Once you pass this treaty, you know what \nyou are going to do; you are going to stop funding the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars it takes over time to maintain this place to be \nable to explode a nuclear weapon if we need to.\n  We said: Do not worry about that; we are going to pass a treaty, and \nwe commit to spend money to continue to do it. If we do not, it is a \ncondition not met and the President can leave the treaty. That is the \nthird condition.\n  The sixth condition is a failsafe mechanism, available to future \nPresidents in case the critics of the stockpile program turn out to be \nright. Again, I might point out the critics of the stockpile program, \nincluding my good friend, and he is my good friend, are the very ones \nwho have great faith in the Star Wars notion, great faith in the \nability to put this nuclear umbrella over the United States so not a \nsingle nuclear weapon could penetrate and blow up and kill 5, 10, 20 \nmillion Americans. They have faith in that scientific capability, \nwhether it is laser-based space weapons or whether it is land-based \nsystems. But they do not have faith in the ability to be able to test a \nweapon that has not been exploded.\n  I understand that. It is a bit of a non sequitur for me to suggest \nyou can have faith in one and not the other. I point out, as a \nnonscientist, as a plain old lawyer, it seems to me it takes a lot more \nto guarantee if somebody flies 2, 10, 20, 50, 100 nuclear weapons at \nthe United States, you will be able to pick them all out of the sky \nbefore they blow up and America will be held harmless, than it would be \nto determine the reliability of this bomb you take out of a missile, \nsit on a table at a test site, and test whether or not it still works \nor not without exploding it. One seems more complicated than the other \nto me. But maybe not. At any rate, after spending $45 billion and all \nthis scientific know-how, we have to continue to be able to guarantee \nthe reliability of our weapons. We have a sixth condition.\n\n  Article IX of the treaty, I remind everyone, contains a standard \nwithdrawal clause. I am talking not about the condition; I am talking \nabout the treaty itself now. Article IX has a standard withdrawal \nclause, permitting any party who signs the treaty the right to withdraw \n6 months after giving notice; that is, start testing.\n  We could ratify this tomorrow. We still have to wait for another 23 \nnations to ratify it, but we could reach the critical mass--no pun \nintended--where enough nations sign and the treaty is in effect, and 6 \nmonths after that the President of the United States says: I no longer \nthink this is in the national interest of the United States of America. \nI am notifying you within 6 months we are going to start testing \nnuclear weapons and withdraw. That is what this article IX does.\n  But what we do is, if the President--and this is a quote:\n\n       . . . decides that extraordinary events related to the \n     subject matter of the treaty have jeopardized its supreme \n     interests[,]\n\n--he can withdraw from the treaty.\n  Every year pursuant to the safeguard--I am back on the safeguards \nnow--every year, we are saying, if this amendment is adopted, pursuant \nto safeguard 6, the National Laboratories' Directors at Las Alamos, \nSandia and Lawrence Livermore, all three of them have to go to the \nSecretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy and certify that the \nStockpile Stewardship Program is still working and they, the scientists \nat our three National Laboratories say: We certify the reliability and \nsafety of our nuclear weapons.\n  The President, then, certifies to the Congress that there is a high \ndegree of confidence in a safe and reliable stockpile.\n  If any one of those National Laboratory Directors--and there is a \nredundancy in what they check. By the way, do you know how it works \nnow? The way it works now, we have nine deployed systems, nine \ndifferent types of hydrogen bombs located in the bellies of airplanes, \non cruise missiles, in the bellies of submarines, on longer range \nmissiles, or in a silo somewhere in the United States of America. Every \nyear these National Laboratory Directors go out and get 11 of these \nwarheads from each of those nine deployed systems. They take them back \nto the laboratories and they dissect them, they open them up, they look \nat them--to overstate it--to see if there is any little corrosion there \nin the firing pin, that sort of thing. It is much more complicated, but \nthey check it out.\n  They take one of them and they dissect it, similar to what a medical \nstudent does with a cadaver. They bring in 11 people, 10 of whom they \ngive a thorough physical, the 11th they kill, cut up, and see if \neverything is working when they look inside. They do that now, and \nthere is redundancy in the system. The three laboratories do that.\n\n  Then they have to go to the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of \nDefense and say: We can certify that our arsenal out there is reliable \nand safe.\n  But, if, under our condition 6, any one of those lab Directors says, \n``No, I don't think I can certify this year, I don't think I can do \nthat,'' then the Secretary of Energy has to be told that, and the \nSecretary of Energy, who is their immediate boss, has to then tell the \nPresident: No, no, we can't certify, Mr. President. And under No. 6, \nsafeguard No. 6, the President shall consult with us and must withdraw \nfrom the treaty.\n  Let me read the exact language. It says this under E, page 5 of the \namendment, ``Withdrawal from the treaty.'' ``If the President \ndetermines,'' and I just explained how he determines--if it is sent to \nhim by the lab Directors and the Secretaries of Energy and Defense who \nsay we can't certify:\n\n       . . . if the President determines that nuclear testing is \n     necessary to assure with a high degree of confidence the \n     safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons\n\n[[Page S12363]]\n\n     stockpile, the President shall consult promptly with the \n     Senate and withdraw from the treaty pursuant to article IX.\n\n  He doesn't have a choice. He has to withdraw. That is the ultimate \nsafeguard.\n  So for those over there who say if it turns out this Stockpile \nStewardship Program doesn't work, they have to assume one of two things \nif that conclusion is reached. They have to assume the lab Directors \nare going to lie and they are going to lie to the Secretary of Energy. \nThey are going to say: We can't verify this, we can't certify it, but \nwe are going to do it anyway. They then have to assume the Secretary of \nDefense and the Secretary of Energy will say: Although we know we can't \ncertify, we are going to lie to the President, and we are going to tell \nthe President our nuclear stockpile is no longer reliable, but don't \nsay anything, Mr. President.\n  And they have to assume, then, that the President, knowing that this \nstockpile is no longer reliable, would look at the U.S. Congress and \nsay: I, President Whomever, next President, certify that we can rely on \nour stockpile.\n  They either have to assume that or they have to assume their concern \nabout our stockpile is not a problem because the moment the President \nis told that, he has to call us and tell us and withdraw from the \ntreaty, which means he can begin nuclear testing.\n  Remember condition 3. We said you have to keep those big old places \nwhere they do the nuclear tests up to date. So he can begin to test.\n  So what is the big deal? What are we worried about, unless you assume \nfuture Presidents are going to lie to the American people, they are \ngoing to lie, they are going to say we can rely on this when we cannot?\n  At the end of the process, if the President determines resumption of \ntesting is necessary, then he has to start testing. That is what \nsection 6 says. So we put the world on notice that we have a program in \nplace to maintain a reliable stockpile.\n  If that does not work and we need to test, we put the world on notice \nas well today that we will and are prepared, politically and in \npractical terms, to withdraw from this treaty. I should emphasize that \nthe certification process, as I have said, is extremely rigorous: For 3 \nyears running, the lab Directors have certified to the safety and \nreliability of our stockpile, but only after detailed review by \nthousands of people at our labs.\n  The other three conditions involve the need to maintain several key \nelements of our national infrastructure. They require us to maintain \nmodern nuclear laboratory facilities and programs in theoretical and \nexploratory nuclear technology and infrastructure of equipment and \npersonnel, if you will--that is required--the continuation of a robust \nresearch and development program for monitoring, and, finally, our \namendment requires the development of a broad range of intelligence \ngathering and analytical capabilities and operations to ensure accurate \ninformation about nuclear programs around the world.\n  These six conditions should have been part of the treaty anyway, but \nthey would not let us add them. We are going to add them now, with the \ngrace of God and goodwill of our neighbors and 51 votes. These six \nconditions are essential to ratification of the treaty. If you do not \nwant this treaty to work, then you will vote against this amendment.\n  I acknowledge if these safeguards are not there, nobody wants the \ntreaty. The President does not want the treaty. The lab Directors do \nnot want the treaty. No one wants the treaty. There may be others that \nwould be useful to add or even necessary for ratification of the \ntreaty, but the leadership has said we can only have one amendment.\n  They will recall that my own resolution, which led to this process, \nproposed only hearings and final adoption by March 31 of next year. I \nwant to put that in focus. I see others want to speak, so I will yield, \nbut I want to make it clear it has been said time and again on the \nfloor by the leader himself--and I am sure he unintentionally \nmisspoke--he said he received a letter from 45 Democratic Senators \nsaying they wanted a vote.\n  Mr. HELMS. I don't want the Senator to yield at an improper time----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will finish this one point, and I will be delighted to \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I have been following the amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I know the Senator has, and I appreciate that. I \nappreciate the respect he has shown for the efforts I have been making, \nnotwithstanding we disagree on this considerably.\n  I want to make this closing point at this moment, and that is, it has \nbeen said by the Republican leader, Senator Lott, that 45 Senators \ndemanded a vote on this treaty now. But 45 Senators signed a letter, \nincluding me. It was a Biden resolution--one that was about to be voted \non when we were on another piece of legislation--that we have extensive \nhearings this year and that final action not occur until the end of \nMarch of next year, so everybody could have a chance to go through all \nof these hearings, so everybody could have a chance to debate what we \nare talking about at much greater length than today.\n  There has not been the bipartisan negotiation on conditions to this \nResolution of Ratification that usually occurs during consideration of \ntreaties.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from North Carolina is seeking \nrecognition. I will be delighted to yield the floor to him.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be delighted to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator on the explanation \nof his amendment. I have been following him as he has been going along. \nWe are far from being opposed to the amendment. We do not have any \nproblem with the safeguards.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment No. \n2291 be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \nobviously do not want to object to my own amendment--we do have a time \nproblem. I would be delighted to do that if the Senator would allow the \nremainder of the time on this amendment to be used on the Resolution of \nRatification, so we do not use up--I have a number of Senators who wish \nto speak. That means I will only have 20 minutes left to debate this \nentire issue. I will be delighted to have it accepted. I probably have \nabout an hour or 20 minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes left on the \namendment; is that correct?\n  Parliamentary inquiry: How much time is left on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ninety-one minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the Senator's \nunanimous consent request be agreed to, with the condition that the \nremaining 91 minutes and the 2 hours remaining on the side of the \nRepublican leadership be added to the time remaining on the Resolution \nof Ratification.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have no objection to the unanimous consent request. I \nthank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request of the \nSenator from North Carolina with the proposed modification?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2291) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we have been going back and forth. Senator \nSarbanes is seeking recognition, but I see our friend Senator Brownback \nis here. It is his turn if he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am willing to yield to Senator Sarbanes if he wishes \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Ten or 12 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. The amendment was \nadopted; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. There was a motion to reconsider made as part of the \nunanimous consent agreement and the motion to table.\n\n[[Page S12364]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test-Ban Treaty, the CTBT, to which the Senate has been asked \nto give its advice and consent. This is a landmark agreement that will \nhelp stem the tide of nuclear proliferation and reduce the risk of \nnuclear confrontation. In my view, it is a treaty that, on balance, \nwill serve U.S. interests and strengthen U.S. security.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a product of nearly 40 years of \nlabor. The idea was first endorsed in 1958 by President Eisenhower, who \nrecognized that the most effective way of controlling the development \nand spread of nuclear weapons was to ban their testing.\n  In 1963, the United States took the first step toward this end by \nsigning and ratifying the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which prohibits \nnuclear explosions in the atmosphere, outer space, and under water.\n  Further limitations were established through the Threshold Test Ban \nTreaty, signed in 1974, and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty, \nsigned in 1976. Under those treaties, the United States and the Soviet \nUnion agreed to halt underground explosions larger than 150 kilotons.\n  When the cold war came to an end, sentiment began to build for a \ncomprehensive ban on nuclear testing. President Bush signed legislation \nestablishing a moratorium on such testing that was joined by France and \nRussia and continues to this day.\n  In January 1994, the Geneva Conference on Disarmament began \nnegotiations on a treaty to forbid all nuclear explosions. An agreement \nwas concluded in August of 1996, and the following month, President \nClinton became the first world leader to sign the new treaty. It was \nsubmitted to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification just \nover 2 years ago, on September 24, 1997.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is relatively simple and \nstraightforward.\n  First, it prohibits all explosions of nuclear devices. It does not \nban the development or production of nuclear materials, nor does it \naffect activities to maintain a secure and reliable stockpile. By \nestablishing a zero threshold on nuclear yield that affects all \ncountries equally, the treaty draws a clear and consistent line between \nwhat is permitted and what is not.\n  Second, the treaty sets up a regime of verification and inspections, \nconsultation and clarification, and confidence-building measures. An \nInternational Monitoring System of 321 monitoring facilities is to be \nestablished, and all data will be stored, analyzed, and disseminated by \nan International Data Center. In addition, information that the United \nStates obtains through its own intelligence can be used as the basis \nfor a short-notice, on-site inspection request.\n  Let me emphasize that. Information that the United States obtains \nthrough its own intelligence can be used as the basis for a short-\nnotice, on-site inspection request.\n  Third, the treaty creates an organization to ensure proper \nimplementation and compliance, and to provide a forum for consultation \nand cooperation among States Parties. The new body will have a \nTechnical Secretariat responsible for day-to-day management and \nsupervision of the monitoring and data-collection operations, as well \nas a 51-Member Executive Council, on which the United States would have \na seat. Both the Technical Secretariat and the Executive Council are to \nbe overseen by a Conference of States Parties, which will meet at least \nannually.\n  Finally, the treaty provides for measures to redress a situation and \nensure compliance, including sanctions, and for settlement of disputes. \nViolations may result in restriction or suspension of rights and \nprivileges under the treaty, as well as the recommendation of \ncollective measures against the offending party and the referral of \ninformation and conclusions to the United Nations.\n  As Stephen Ledogar, who was the Chief Negotiator of the treaty for \nthe U.S., testified before the Foreign Relations Committee, the United \nStates objected to the inclusion of specific sanctions because of \nconcerns about appointing an international organization ``to be not \njust the investigator and special prosecutor, but also the judge, jury, \nand jailer.'' He explained, ``we reserve for a higher body, the United \nNations Security Council in which we have a veto, the authority to levy \nsanctions or other measures.''\n  The CTBT, which has been signed by some 154 countries and ratified by \n48, has drawn broad support not only from among the American \npopulation, but from key U.S. military and intelligence officials and \nfrom our key allies.\n  It has been endorsed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGen. Hugh Shelton, as well as former Chairmen Gen. John Shalikashvili, \nGen. Colin Powell, Gen. David Jones, and Adm. William Crowe, and the \ndirectors of all three national laboratories that conduct nuclear \nweapons research and testing.\n  NATO's Defense Planning Committee and Nuclear Planning Group called \nfor ratification and entry into force ``as soon as possible.'' Thirty-\ntwo Nobel laureates in physics have written to the Senate stating that \n``it is imperative that the CTBT be ratified,'' and noting that ``fully \ninformed technical studies have concluded that continued nuclear \ntesting is not required to retain confidence in the safety, reliability \nand performance of nuclear weapons in the United States' stockpile, \nprovided science and technology programs necessary for stockpile \nstewardship are maintained.''\n  Despite the importance of the CTBT for U.S. national security, formal \nconsideration of the treaty has not taken place over the last 2 years. \nNow we are suddenly called upon to register a judgment without the \nbenefit of proper hearings and committee debate. While I have come to \nthe conclusion that the merits of this treaty outweigh its risks, and \nthat it is therefore deserving of Senate advice and consent to \nratification, I do regret that an issue of such significance should be \ntaken up without the normal course of hearings and proceedings leading \nup to the consideration of a measure of this magnitude.\n  Let me outline a few of the reasons why I support this treaty. First, \nit will help reduce threats to U.S. national security. A complete ban \non testing makes it harder for countries already possessing nuclear \nweapons to develop and deploy more sophisticated new designs, and for \nthose seeking nuclear capability to initiate a nuclear weapons program. \nAs we know, relatively simple bombs can be built without testing, but \ncreating smaller, lighter weapons that are easier to transport and \nconceal and that require less nuclear material is difficult without \nexplosive tests.\n  With a global ban in place, a nation intent on conducting tests would \ntake on the burdens not only of increased expenses and technical \ndangers, but also the risk of detection and imposition of international \nsanctions. In a very real sense, the CTBT locks in U.S. nuclear \nsuperiority while preventing reignition of arms races that constitute \nserious threats to our national security.\n  The CTBT also promotes U.S. security by strengthening the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT, which entered into force in 1970 and \nwas extended indefinitely in 1995. The NPT is the bedrock of \ninternational arms control policy, representing a bargain in which non-\nnuclear weapons states promised to foreswear the acquisition of nuclear \nweapons and accede to a permanent inspection regime so long as the \nnuclear powers agreed to reduce their arsenals. In order to gain \napproval for permanent extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, the five declared nuclear powers promised to negotiate and \nratify a test ban treaty.\n  The CTBT further advances U.S. interests by providing additional \ntools to enhance our current monitoring and detection capability. The \nInternational Monitoring System will record data from 321 sensor \nstations--262 beyond what the United States possesses today.\n  The new facilities include 31 primary and 116 auxiliary seismic \nmonitoring stations, 57 radionuclide stations to pick up traces of \nradioactivity, 8 hydroacoustic stations to detect explosions on or in \nthe oceans, and 50 infrasound stations to detect sound pressure waves \nin the atmosphere. Thirty-one of the new or upgraded monitoring \nstations are in Russia, 11 in China, and 17 in the Middle East, all\n\n[[Page S12365]]\n\nareas of critical importance to the United States.\n  And one of the burden-sharing advantages of the treaty is that the \nUnited States will have access to 100 percent of the information \ngenerated by these 321 sensor stations but will pay only 25 percent of \nthe bill for obtaining it.\n  Since the United States has not conducted a nuclear explosion in 7 \nyears, and is unlikely to test with or without this treaty, the major \neffect of the CTBT is to hold other countries to a similar standard. It \nincludes surveillance to identify warhead problems, assessment to \ndetermine effects on performance, replacement of defective parts, and \ncertification of remanufactured warheads. Our policy is to ensure \ntritium availability and retain the ability to conduct nuclear tests in \nthe future, should withdrawal from the test ban regime be required.\n\n  Thus, under the treaty, the United States will be able to depend on \nits nuclear deterrent capability, while other nations will find it much \nmore difficult to build weapons with the degree of confidence that \nwould be needed to constitute an offensive military threat. Any country \nthat should test would find itself the subject of international \nresponse; whereas in the absence of a treaty, such behavior carries no \npenalty.\n  It has been suggested that the United States should wait until more \nof the nuclear capable countries--whose ratification is essential for \nthe treaty to go into effect--have ratified before moving forward on \nthe treaty ourselves. Yet what incentive have the countries with only \npeaceful nuclear reactors to proceed, when the one country with the \ngreatest number of deployed strategic warheads is unwilling to do so?\n  Just as with the Chemical Weapons Convention, where U.S. approval \nfacilitated ratification by Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran, U.S. \nratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will create increased \nmomentum and pressure for others to come along. The treaty cannot enter \ninto force without us, but it needs our support to convince others to \njoin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Indeed, all of our major allies have weighed in with \ntheir strong support for this treaty, which is particularly significant \nsince they rely on our nuclear deterrent for their own defense.\n  An article in the Washington Post on October 8 reported that:\n\n       The world's major powers, including America's closest \n     allies, warned the United States today that failure to ratify \n     the multinational nuclear test ban treaty would send a \n     dangerous signal that could encourage other countries to \n     spurn arms control commitments.\n\n  German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer was quoted as saying:\n\n       What is at stake is not just the pros and cons of the test \n     ban treaty, but the future of multilateral arms control.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of that article be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Perhaps as compelling as the case in favor of the \ntreaty are the potential consequences of a negative vote. Senate \nrejection of the treaty could severely weaken the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, for which a review conference is scheduled next \nApril.\n  It is entirely possible, as the Washington Post reported, that ``some \nnonnuclear countries might regard failure to ratify the treaty as a \nbroken promise that would relieve them of the obligation to comply with \nkey parts'' of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Such a result \nwould not only undercut U.S. leadership and credibility on \nnonproliferation, threatening our policy objectives in Iraq and North \nKorea, among other places, but could increase the likelihood of resumed \ntesting and aggravate the situation in South Asia.\n  Resumed testing would not only threaten regional security and U.S. \nstrategic interests but could pose new challenges to public health and \nthe natural environment. According to the Energy Department, more than \none out of seven underground U.S. nuclear tests since 1963 vented \nradioactive gases into the atmosphere, and the problem will obviously \nbe much worse in countries that do not take or cannot afford the same \nlevel of environmental protections.\n\n  Some have objected that the treaty will be difficult to verify, that \nit will prevent the United States from maintaining a safe and reliable \nnuclear arsenal. While no treaty is completely verifiable, I believe \nthe CTBT will increase, rather than decrease, our ability to monitor \nthe development of nuclear weapons and preserve, not forfeit, our \nnuclear superiority.\n  In his statement before the Armed Services Committee on October 6, \nSecretary of Defense William Cohen addressed this point at length. I \nwill quote the Secretary because I think his observations are extremely \nimportant.\n\n       CTBT evasion is not easy; it would require significant \n     efforts in terms of expertise, preparations and resources. In \n     the end, the testing party has no guarantees that its \n     preparation or its nuclear test will escape detection and \n     possible on-site inspection, despite its best efforts. In \n     addition, detection capability varies according to the \n     location of the clandestine test and the evasion measures \n     employed; a potential evader may not understand the full U.S. \n     monitoring capability, thus adding to his uncertainty. \n     Further, detection of a nuclear explosion conducted in \n     violation of the CTBT, would be a very serious matter with \n     significant political consequences. . . . Under CTBT, I \n     believe the U.S. will have available sufficient resources to \n     deter or detect, with confidence, the level of clandestine \n     nuclear testing that could undermine the U.S. nuclear \n     deterrent and take timely and effective counteraction to \n     redress the effects of any such testing.\n\n  I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Moreover, to the extent Members are concerned with the \nadequacy of procedures for onsite inspections, I would remind them \nthat, as with the Chemical Weapons Convention, these procedures were \ncrafted with an eye not only to gaining access to other countries' \nfacilities, but also to guarding against overly intrusive inspections \nwithin the United States. The lead U.S. treaty negotiator, Stephen \nLedogar, explained to the committee how those procedures were \ndeveloped:\n\n       This Treaty provides for on-site inspections on request by \n     any Treaty party and with the approval of the Executive \n     Council. No state can refuse an inspection. The U.S. position \n     from the start was that on-site inspections were critical to \n     provide us with added confidence that we could detect \n     violations. And, if inspections were to be effective, they \n     had to be conducted absolutely as quickly as possible after a \n     suspicion arose, using a range of techniques with as few \n     restrictions as possible. However, the U.S. also had to be \n     concerned with its defensive posture, as well as an offensive \n     one. It was necessary to ensure that sensitive national \n     security information would be protected in the event of an \n     inspection on U.S. territory. The U.S. crafted a complicated, \n     highly detailed, proposal that balanced our offensive and \n     defensive needs. There was resistance from some of our \n     negotiating partners. However, by the time we were through, \n     the Treaty read pretty much like the original U.S. paper put \n     together jointly by the Departments of Defense, Energy, and \n     State, the Intelligence Community, and the then-existing Arms \n     Control Agency.\n\n  With regard to the security of our nuclear arsenal, the President has \nproposed six safeguards which will define the conditions under which \nthe United States enters into the CTBT, and which, as I understand it, \nhave been incorporated into the Resolution of Ratification. I ask the \nranking member, these have now been adopted; is that correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct, with some modifications making them even \nstronger.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And those dealt with the conduct of the Stockpile \nStewardship Program, the maintenance of modern nuclear laboratory \nfacilities, the maintenance of a basic capability to resume testing, \nshould it become necessary, the continuation of a comprehensive \nresearch and development program to improve our monitoring \ncapabilities, the continued development of a broad range of \nintelligence gathering, and the ability to withdraw from the CTBT if \nthe safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon type critical to our \nnuclear deterrent could no longer be certified.\n  I believe these safeguards will ensure that U.S. national security \ninterests can be met within the context of the treaty.\n  Mr. President, I support ratification, but there do not appear to be \nenough\n\n[[Page S12366]]\n\nvotes to approve it. The President, in his letter requesting that \naction be delayed, stated that\n\n       . . . proceeding to a vote under these circumstances would \n     severely harm the national security of the United States, \n     damage our relationship with our allies, and undermine our \n     historic leadership over 40 years, through administrations \n     Republican and Democratic, in reducing the nuclear threat.\n\n  I agree with the President's assessment. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to join in voting to postpone consideration of the treaty \nwhile we undertake to build the necessary understanding and political \nsupport that will lead to its ultimate ratification.\n  If we cannot approve the treaty, ratify it, then surely we should \ndelay its consideration, postpone its consideration while we continue \nto explore the matter further, rather than, in my judgment, doing the \ngrave harm that would come to the national security, as the President \nhas outlined.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two editorials from the New York Times \nin support of the treaty be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 12, 1999]\n\n                    Fighting for the Test Ban Treaty\n\n       Despite the important contribution it would make to a safer \n     world, the nuclear Test Ban Treaty stands virtually no chance \n     of mustering enough support to win Senate ratification this \n     week. Allowing it to be voted down would deal a damaging blow \n     to America's foreign policy and military security. The wiser \n     course is to delay Senate action for at least a few months, \n     as President Clinton requested yesterday, giving the White \n     House more time to overcome the arguments of treaty critics.\n       But Republican senators are recklessly insisting on an \n     immediate vote unless Mr. Clinton agrees to withdraw the \n     treaty for the rest of his term. That is something he should \n     avoid, because it would signal to the rest of the world that \n     the White House, not just the Senate, is edging away from the \n     Test Ban Treaty.\n       Mr. Clinton refuses to be bound by such conditions. \n     Nevertheless some Senate treaty supporters, including Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan of New York, are trying to put together a \n     deal under which Mr. Clinton would not give up on the treaty, \n     while Senate Democrats would refrain from pushing it in this \n     Congress. The White House suggests it could accept such an \n     arrangement.\n       The message that Washington sends to the world matters a \n     lot. One audience consists of countries like India and \n     Pakistan, which are still trying to decide whether to sign \n     the treaty and would be unlikely to do so if the Clinton \n     White House gave up on eventual Senate ratification. For \n     these countries to remain outside the test ban would \n     encourage a dangerous nuclear arms race in south Asia that \n     could easily draw in nearby countries like Iran and China. It \n     could also fuel the ambitions of other intermediate powers, \n     like Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, to join an expanding nuclear \n     club.\n       Another group of countries includes established nuclear \n     nations such as China and Russia. Like Washington, Beijing \n     and Moscow have signed the treaty but not yet ratified it, \n     and are observing a voluntary moratorium on nuclear tests.\n       As long as Mr. Clinton continues to campaign for the Test \n     Ban Treaty and there remains a reasonable chance that \n     Washington will someday ratify it, these countries are likely \n     to refrain from further testing. But if hopes for eventual \n     American ratification recede, China or Russia might be \n     tempted to test again in an effort to improve their bomb \n     designs and narrow America's present lead in nuclear weapons \n     technology.\n       These considerations argue strongly for delaying the vote \n     rather than giving up on it for this Congress. The treaty is \n     backed by America's military leaders, public opinion and \n     Washington's main allies. Good answers are available to the \n     objections so far raised by Senate critics. True, the \n     election-year political calculus is not favorable, and \n     ultimately it may be necessary to wait until a new President \n     and a new Senate take office early in 2001. But American \n     interests are best protected if in the interim Washington \n     does not disavow the treaty.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 8, 1999]\n\n                   Keeping the Test Ban Treaty Alive\n\n       If the nuclear Test Ban Treaty fails to win ratification \n     next week, as it probably will, Senate Republicans will \n     deserve much of the blame. The Republican leadership has \n     behaved in a narrowly partisan fashion that paid little heed \n     to America's international interests and trivialized the \n     Senate's constitutional role in evaluating treaties. But the \n     White House failed to put together a coherent strategy for \n     assembling the needed two-thirds Senate majority, and then \n     allowed itself to be outmaneuvered into a compressed \n     timetable that left too little time for an intensive lobbying \n     campaign.\n       The resulting failure will weaken American security. India \n     and Pakistan will be more likely to develop their nuclear \n     arsenals and China will be increasingly tempted to resume \n     testing to exploit new weapons designs, some of which may \n     have been stolen from the United States. The goal now should \n     be to try to limit the damage by keeping open the possibility \n     that the Senate can be persuaded to ratify the treaty in the \n     months to come.\n       To that end, the White House must reject the terms the \n     Republicans now offer for canceling next week's vote. These \n     include the outrageous requirement that President Clinton not \n     seek ratification during his remaining 15 months in office. \n     That would make things worse than they already are, leaving \n     other countries wondering whether Mr. Clinton has abandoned \n     the treaty he signed three years ago. Unless the Republicans \n     agree to a postponement without this timetable, the White \n     House should let the Senate proceed toward a vote next week--\n     trying, between now and then, to win as many extra Republican \n     votes as possible. If that effort falls short, Mr. Clinton \n     should concentrate his Presidential energies on building \n     enough support to justify a new ratification effort as soon \n     as possible.\n       Republican senators have raised several arguments against \n     the treaty, most of which evaporate on close inspection. Some \n     doubt whether American intelligence agencies can detect very-\n     low-yield nuclear tests. Others worry that America's nuclear \n     stockpile might deteriorate without testing. Some mistakenly \n     believe that missile defenses will make arms control treaties \n     unnecessary.\n       The Administration has answered these objections \n     convincingly. Approving the treaty would speed creation of a \n     stronger worldwide monitoring system. Despite doubts \n     expressed yesterday by the heads of America's nuclear labs, \n     Washington's stockpile stewardship program, based on computer \n     simulations, can keep existing weapons reliable and nurture \n     the scientific skills that could create new ones if the \n     treaty ever broke down. Missile defense can at best \n     supplement arms control, not replace it.\n       There is every reason for Republicans of conscience to vote \n     for this treaty, but little chance that they will. Mr. \n     Clinton's challenge now will be to sway enough Senate votes \n     to make ratification possible before he leaves the White \n     House.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 8, 1999]\n\n               U.S. Allies Urge Senate To Ratify Test Ban\n\n                         (By William Drozdlak)\n\n       VIENNA, Oct. 7--The world's major powers, including \n     America's closest allies, warned the United States today that \n     failure to ratify the multinational nuclear test ban treaty \n     would send a dangerous signal that could encourage other \n     countries to spurn arms control commitments.\n       With the Senate scheduled to begin debating the treaty \n     Friday, envoys from nearly 100 nations at a conference here, \n     including Russia, China, Britain and Germany, expressed alarm \n     that the United States appears to be on the brink of \n     rejecting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The pact, which \n     President Clinton signed in 1996, would prohibit nuclear test \n     explosions world-wide.\n       Diplomats said British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French \n     President Jacques Chirac will soon make rare personal appeals \n     to the United States to approve the accord, prior to a \n     possible Senate vote next week.\n       In Washington, it was unclear if a compromise would be \n     reached to postpone a vote on the treaty. Both sides agree \n     that the pact will be defeated if it comes to a vote on \n     Tuesday or Wednesday as scheduled. In the latest blow to the \n     accord's prospects, Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), an \n     influential arms control advocate, declared his opposition.\n       Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) was sticking to his \n     position late today that a vote can be delayed only if the \n     Clinton administration promises not to try to revive the \n     treaty before the president leaves office. The White House \n     has rejected that proposal, and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-\n     Del.), the ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations \n     Committee, said he is ``not hopeful'' that the vote could be \n     postponed.\n       Here in Vienna, diplomats said that Blair and Chirac will \n     urge American treaty opponents to forgo partisan politics and \n     weigh the damaging impact a negative vote would have on U.S. \n     leadership in the effort to halt the spread of weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       There was particular concern here that some non-nuclear \n     countries would regard failure to ratify the treaty as a \n     broken promise that would relieve them of the obligation to \n     comply with key parts of another accord, the Nuclear Non-\n     proliferation treaty. That pact is considered the linchpin of \n     international efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.\n       International anxiety also has been compounded by new \n     worries over U.S. efforts to escape constraints imposed by \n     the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which limits the \n     ability of the United States to build systems to defend \n     against missile attack.\n       Russia and China say it would destabilize the strategic \n     balance if the United States built a missile defense system, \n     because Washington could be tempted to attack others if it \n     felt invulnerable to retaliation. That could trigger a new \n     arms race as other nations sought ways to overwhelm missile \n     defenses.\n       Many nations are surprised by the Senate's hesitation to \n     approve the test ban treaty, in part because the accord is \n     widely regarded\n\n[[Page S12367]]\n\n     abroad as locking in American nuclear superiority. Until \n     recently, the treaty had gained strong momentum as the \n     ratification process moved ahead and a world-wide sensor \n     system was deployed to detect even the tiniest indication of \n     a nuclear explosion.\n       More than half of the 44 nations with nuclear facilities \n     whose ratification is necessary for the treaty to take effect \n     have already done so. U.S. approval is deemed critical to \n     persuade other nations, including Russia and China, to \n     ratify. Even more important, India and Pakistan, who pledged \n     to sign the test ban treaty under enormous international \n     pressure, are said to be awaiting Senate action before making \n     their final decision.\n       ``It would be a highly dangerous step for the Senate to \n     reject this treaty,'' said Peter Hain, Britain's minister of \n     state for foreign affairs. ``If the test ban treaty starts to \n     unravel, all sorts of undesirable things could happen. It \n     would send the worst possible signal to the rest of the world \n     by giving a green light to many countries to walk away from \n     promises not to develop nuclear arsenals.'' Hain and other \n     delegates here spoke at a long-planned conference organized \n     to discuss how to put the test ban treaty into effect.\n       German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said the rest of \n     the world would be watching the Senate test ban vote closely \n     because of its possible effect in eroding support for the \n     non-proliferation treaty. ``What is at stake is not just the \n     pros and cons of the test ban treaty, but the future of \n     multilateral arms control,'' Fischer said.\n       Diplomats fear that a failure to put the test ban treaty \n     into effect soon would discourage some ``threshold'' \n     countries--those close to developing nuclear weapons--from \n     cooperating with intrusive inspections under the non-\n     proliferation treaty. Such inspections are designed to \n     prevent them from cheating and secretly developing nuclear \n     weapons.\n       Jayantha Dhanapala, the U.N. undersecretary for disarmament \n     affairs, said many countries agreed to a permanent inspection \n     regime four years ago only on the basis of a written \n     guarantee by the nuclear powers to negotiate and ratify a \n     worldwide test ban as one of several key steps toward nuclear \n     disarmament.\n       In a grand diplomatic bargain struck in 1995, the \n     inspection program was made permanent for some 175 nations \n     that have promised to forswear nuclear weapons. In exchange, \n     the powers--the United States, France, Britain, Russia and \n     China--pledged to reduce nuclear arsenals and approve a \n     treaty that would ban test explosions that help upgrade their \n     weapons.\n       ``If the Senate rejects ratification, it would send a very \n     negative signal that will act as a brake on the momentum we \n     have achieved to control the nuclear threat, because some \n     countries would see this vote as a betrayal of a promise,'' \n     Dhanapala said.\n       The head of the U.S. delegation, Ambassador John B. Ritch \n     III, said a main theme of the Vienna conference has been \n     international alarm over isolationist thinking that has \n     spurred Senate opposition to the treaty. He said foreign \n     delegates found it difficult to understand how the Senate \n     could consider backtracking from a ban on nuclear explosions \n     even though polls show as much as 80 percent of the American \n     public support the treaty.\n       China's representative here said that U.S. failure to \n     ratify the test ban treaty would be ``a very negative \n     development'' and joined others in expressing concern that \n     the United States is shunning its obligations on global arms \n     control.\n       ``I don't like to talk about any country exercising world \n     leadership, but in this case we see that the United States \n     must play a special role,'' Sha Zukang, China's top arms \n     control official, said in an interview. Sha added that China \n     is even more alarmed by U.S. efforts to develop a regional \n     missile defense system than by the Senate's reluctance to \n     approve the test ban treaty.\n       Boris Kvok, Russia's deputy chief of disarmament issues, \n     said the U.S. decision on the test ban treaty would not \n     affect the deliberations of Russia's parliament on the pact \n     or alter his country's test moratorium. ``But if the U.S. \n     moves ahead with ballistic missile defense, it would be a \n     disaster for strategic stability in Europe and the world. And \n     we would have to start developing new weapons to correct this \n     imbalance,'' Kvok said.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 10 minutes to \nspeak on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. President, there have been a number of arguments put forward \nagainst and for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We have heard, most \nrecently, arguments for ratification of the treaty. I join my colleague \nfrom Maryland in noting that I think there would be a wide basis of \nsupport saying we should not bring it up at this time. But neither \nshould we bring it up next year. I know a number of my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle would say it would be a good thing if we could \nagree not to go ahead and go forward with a vote now, but not to do \nthat during this session of Congress, either the rest of this year or \nnext year, so we won't constantly be going back and visiting this issue \nduring this Congress. We have it on the floor and it is time to discuss \nit. I think people can agree that we won't hear it again this Congress, \nand we can move forward with that discussion and have this debate and \nnot proceed to a vote if people think that would do more harm than \ngood.\n  I want to address a number of arguments put forward by the President \nand by others on this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I note the \nPresident stated in his weekly radio address that every President since \nEisenhower--a Kansan--has supported this treaty. The reality of this is \nactually that no previous administration, either Republican or \nDemocrat, has ever supported the zero-yield test ban now in this treaty \nbefore the Senate. Eisenhower insisted that nuclear tests with a \nseismic magnitude of less than 4.75 be permitted. Kennedy terminated a \n3-year moratorium on nuclear tests, declaring that ``never again'' \nwould the United States make such a mistake. He then embarked upon the \nmost aggressive series of nuclear tests in the history of the weapons \nprogram. Carter, Reagan, and Bush all opposed a zero-yield test ban \nwhile in office. Even the present administration initially opposed a \npermanent zero-yield test ban before signing onto the CTBT.\n  It has been claimed that the CTBT hasn't been given enough Senate \nfloor time. The unanimous-consent agreement provides for 22 hours of \ndebate on the CTBT. By contrast, the START treaty had 9.5 hours; START \nII had 6 hours; the Chemical Weapons Convention had 18 hours. We are \ngoing to put a lot of time in on this. The White House insisted for 2 \nyears that the Senate vote on the CTBT, using terms such as ``now,'' \n``immediately,'' ``right away.'' Now when we are ready to vote, they \ndon't seem to be willing to enter into that debate and vote.\n  Another thing the President said in his news conference in Canada was \nthis was being ``politically motivated.'' I reject that, Mr. President. \nYou do not consider items such as this with any consideration for \npolitical motivation. This is nuclear testing we are talking about. \nThis is a critical issue to the world--to my four children. That is \nsomething you don't interject any bit of politics into. I reject that \nnotion altogether.\n  There are a couple of other arguments bantered about quite a bit--one \nthat I have taken most note of because it causes me the most pause to \nthink is what would other countries think if we voted down the treaty? \nWould that cause more proliferation? I cannot read the minds of the \nleaders in China, Russia, Pakistan, or India, but there are people with \na great deal of wisdom and experience who did hazard a guess in that \narea and have put forward thoughtful statements. One was put forward by \nformer Secretaries of Defense Weinberger, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Laird, \nCarlucci, and Schlesinger. All of them signed this quote:\n\n       We also do not believe the CTBT will do much to prevent the \n     spread of nuclear weapons.\n\n  Now, you have six former Secretaries of Defense saying that.\n\n       The motivation of rogue nations like North Korea and Iraq \n     to acquire nuclear weapons will not be affected by whether \n     the U.S. tests. Similarly, the possession of nuclear weapons \n     by nations like India, Pakistan, and Israel depends on the \n     security environment in their region, not by whether or not \n     the U.S. tests. If confidence in the U.S. nuclear deterrent \n     were to decline, countries that have relied on our protection \n     could well feel compelled to seek nuclear capabilities of \n     their own. Thus, ironically, the CTBT might cause additional \n     nations to seek nuclear weapons.\n\n  That was a quote from the six former Defense Secretaries--Weinberger, \nCheney, Rumsfeld, Laird, Carlucci, and Schlesinger.\n  This is a quote from General Vessey, former Chairman of the Joint \nChief of Staff:\n\n       Supporters of the CTBT argue that it reduces the chances \n     for nuclear proliferation. I applaud efforts to reduce the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons, but I do not believe that \n     the test ban will reduce the ability of rogue states to \n     acquire nuclear weapons in sufficient quantities to upset \n     regional security in various parts of the world. ``Gun-type'' \n     nuclear weapons can be built with assurance they'll work \n     without testing. The Indian and\n\n[[Page S12368]]\n\n     Pakistani ``tests'' apparently show that there is adequate \n     knowledge available to build implosion type weapons with \n     reasonable assurance that they will work. The India/Pakistan \n     explosions have been called ``tests,'' but I believe it to be \n     more accurate to call them ``demonstrations,'' more for \n     political purposes than for scientific testing.\n\n  A letter signed by John Deutch, Henry Kissinger, and Brent Scowcroft \nsays:\n\n       Supporters of the CTBT claim that it will make a major \n     contribution to limiting the spread of nuclear weapons.\n\n  It is the same argument we hear time and time again, which I wish to \nbe true because I want this to be a nuclear-free world. They say:\n\n       This cannot be true if key countries of proliferation \n     concern do not agree to accede to the treaty. To date, \n     several of these countries, including India, Pakistan, North \n     Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, have not signed and ratified \n     the treaty. Many of these countries may never join the CTBT \n     regime, and ratification by the United States, early or late, \n     is unlikely to have any impact on their decisions in this \n     regard. For example, no serious person should believe that \n     rogue nations like Iran or Iraq will give up efforts to \n     acquire nuclear weapons if only the U.S. signs the CTBT.\n\n  If you think about that, they are not going to respond to what we do.\n  This is a letter from Edward Teller to Senator Helms. He says this in \nthe letter, dated February 4, 1998:\n\n       The point I must make is that, in the long run, knowledge \n     and ability to produce nuclear weapons will be widely \n     available. To believe that, in the long run, proliferation \n     of nuclear weapons is avoidable is wishful thinking and \n     dangerous. It is the more dangerous because it is a point \n     of view that the public is eager to accept. Thus, \n     politicians are tempted to gain popularity by supporting \n     false hopes.\n\n  This is a former Assistant Director, ACDA, Fred Eimer. He says this:\n\n       In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the proposed treaty will put \n     our nuclear deterrent at risk without significant arms \n     control or nonproliferation benefits. Other nations will be \n     able to conduct militarily significant nuclear tests well \n     below the verification threshold of the Treaty's monitoring \n     system, and our own unilateral capability.\n\n  I make these statements simply because this is a big issue. It is an \nimportant issue, and a lot of people have thought a great deal about \nit. I think it to be an inappropriate time to enter into such a treaty \nthat would so limit the United States, given all the great concerns and \ntesting and things going on around the world.\n  I want to give some final quotes of former Directors of the National \nWeapons Laboratories. They also oppose the CTBT.\n  Roger Batzel, Director Emeritus, sent this letter on October 5:\n\n       I urge you to oppose the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. No \n     previous administration, either Democrat or Republican, ever \n     supported the unverifiable, zero yield, indefinite duration \n     CTBT now before the Senate. The reason for this is simple. \n     Under a long-duration test ban, confidence in the nuclear \n     stockpile will erode for a variety of reasons. I don't think \n     it can be put forward any clearer than that. This is a key \n     part of our deterrence. We simply cannot go ahead and enter \n     into this treaty at this time at our own great loss and our \n     own great peril.\n\n  I note again for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that a \nnumber of us are very willing and interested that this not go forward \nfor a vote. We don't want it to go forward for a vote in this session \nof Congress, either this year or next year.\n  The notion that it would be pulled down now, then somehow come back \nnext year during the middle of a Presidential election, and be used as \nsome sort of political tool at that time seems to many of us to be far \nmore frightening, with what might happen in the political debate, with \nthe atmosphere and the use of this treaty in its discussions for \npolitical purposes.\n  That is why we continue to support not voting on this now. Let's also \nagree that we will not do it during this session of Congress.\n  I have used up my allotted period of time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I know that earlier the Democratic side \nproposed an amendment which was accepted by this side. I did want to \nspeak to that for just a moment because I don't believe anyone should \nsuffer any illusions that the so-called safeguards that are part of \nthis amendment are going to in any way enhance the treaty and make it \nmore palatable. We accepted it because it is what is being done anyway. \nIt wouldn't have to be added to the treaty. The President theoretically \nis pursuing these things. He should pursue them. But they are not going \nto make the treaty any better or worse.\n  For example, the first item is the Stockpile Stewardship Program. It \nhas been assumed all along that there would be a Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram. We don't have to amend this in order to achieve that.\n  The problem is, the Stockpile Stewardship Program is very troublesome \neven if you assume there would be assurance at the end of the day that \nit could do the job it was designed to do because some people are \nassuming that design is a total replacement of testing. It was never \ndesigned to totally replace testing but merely to give us a greater \ndegree of confidence in the reliability and safety of our nuclear \nweapons, not that it could totally replace testing.\n  But even if you laid that aside, the notion was that the Stockpile \nStewardship Program would be ready in a decade. This was announced \nabout 3 years ago. Now we are being told it will be ready by the year \n2010.\n  There are slips along the way that suggest problems with the \nStockpile Stewardship Program. It is behind budget. We haven't been \nbudgeting the amount of money that was indicated as necessary to \nmaintain it--the $4.5 billion a year. We have also not indexed for \ninflation. So each year that we supply the $4 billion or so, we are \ngetting further behind because we are not indexing that to inflation.\n  We have also included other programs within the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram that were never intended to be funded out of it, such as the \ntritium production facility for our nuclear weapons. That was to be a \nseparate area of funding. This administration has folded that into the \nStockpile Stewardship Program, with the result that even more of the \nmoney necessary for the ASCI Program and other key parts of the \nStockpile Stewardship Program will be shorted if we have to spend that \nmoney for tritium.\n  In addition to that, let me quote a letter I received from the former \nDirector of one of our National Laboratories. This is a letter sent to \nme in September of this year from John Nuckolls who is the former \nDirector at Livermore. Here is what he said:\n\n       A post-CTBT or other funding reduction would increase the \n     uncertainty in long-term stockpile reliability. Current and \n     projected funding is inadequate. Substantial additional \n     funding is needed for SSP experimental efforts including \n     construction of an advanced hydro facility.\n\n  I also note that the so-called ignition facility, which is planned as \na part of this, is also behind schedule and over budget.\n  As Mr. Nuckolls pointed out, we are already behind. We are getting \nfurther behind, and I don't think anyone should put that much reliance \nas a result in the Stockpile Stewardship Program.\n  Another safeguard is the nuclear laboratory facilities and programs. \nOf course, we are going to maintain our nuclear laboratories and \nfacilities. I don't think anybody would ever assume we were not going \nto do that. So this adds nothing to the treaty. The question is, Can \nyou maintain these without nuclear testing? It turns out it is much \nmore difficult to do so.\n\n  Again, quoting from Mr. Nuckolls' letter to me, I will quote the \nfirst part of his answer:\n\n       In an extended duration nuclear test ban, confidence in the \n     stockpile would be adversely affected by loss of all nuclear \n     test trained and validated expert personnel, major gaps in \n     our scientific understanding of nuclear explosives, nuclear \n     and chemical decay of warheads, accidents and inadequate \n     funding of the Stockpile Stewardship Program.\n       All nuclear test trained/validated expert personnel would \n     eventually be lost. Training of the replacement workforce \n     would be seriously handicapped without nuclear testing, and \n     expert judgment could not be fully validated. A serious \n     degradation of U.S. capabilities to find and fix stockpile \n     problems, and to design and build new nuclear weapons would \n     be unavoidable.\n\n  In other words, what is perceived as a good thing--these nuclear \nlaboratory facilities and programs--is actually being allowed to \ndeteriorate without testing. We simply won't have the people available \nin order to maintain those facilities and to be prepared to do the \nthings he says are necessary to be done. A serious degradation of U.S. \ncapabilities would be unavoidable.\n\n[[Page S12369]]\n\n  We are not talking about something hypothetical and unimportant. We \nare talking about the U.S. nuclear stockpile. This is the person who \nused to run this National Laboratory. He is telling us we had better be \ncareful putting our reliance on that program.\n  The third of the so-called safeguards is the maintenance of nuclear \ntesting capability. That is fine, except that we are not doing it. This \nPresident should be doing it. He claims to be doing it. But it is not \nbeing done. We now know it would take 2 or 3 years to get back to the \npoint where we could test.\n  I again quote from Mr. Nuckolls' letter:\n\n       In an extended duration nuclear test ban, the nuclear test \n     site infrastructure is likely to decay or become obsolete. \n     Nuclear test experienced personnel would be lost. A series of \n     nuclear tests to diagnose complex reliability problems and to \n     certify a fix, or to develop new weapons could take several \n     years. . . .\n       Nuclear testing has been essential to the discovery and \n     resolution of many problems in the stockpile.\n\n  The point he is making is that you can't just say you are going to be \nable to resume testing unless you take active and take serious steps to \nmaintain that readiness. We are not doing it. And he says in a test ban \nof this kind, we would not be able to do it.\n  The fourth item is the continued comprehensive research and \ndevelopment program. Of course, we are going to be doing that. \nIntelligence gatherings, analytical capabilities--we will do the best \nwe can on that, although, as has been pointed out, it is inadequate.\n  Senator Richard Lugar, an arms control advocate and an expert in this \nbody, has concluded reluctantly that this treaty is not verifiable and \nenforceable and, as a matter of fact, it cannot be made so.\n  Let me quote from the Washington Times of today because it talks \nabout how we negotiated this treaty and how we negotiated the \nprovisions for verification and enforcement. Let me read from the story \nwhich is headlined, ``Moscow, Beijing balk at monitors. Testing sites \nnot included in nuke treaty.'' I am quoting now:\n       Russia and China refused to permit seismic monitoring near \n     their nuclear weapons test sites that could have resolved \n     some verification problems now troubling the Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty, according to U.S. government officials.\n       Clinton administration officials and congressional aides \n     said the failure of U.S. negotiators to win the cooperation \n     of Moscow and Beijing was a ``negotiating failure'' that \n     undermined the treaty. It also is a key reason U.S. \n     intelligence agencies said both nations could conduct hidden \n     nuclear tests without detection.\n\n  Before I finish this quotation, let me point out why this is \nimportant.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, from what document is he \nreading?\n  Mr. KYL. The Washington Times, Tuesday, October 12.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that The Washington Times \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Moscow, Beijing Balk at Monitors\n\n                            (By Bill Gertz)\n\n       Russia and China refused to permit seismic monitoring near \n     their nuclear weapons test sites that could have resolved \n     some verification problems now troubling the Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty, according to U.S. government officials.\n       Clinton administration officials and congressional aides \n     said the failure of U.S. negotiators to win the cooperation \n     of Moscow and Beijing was a ``negotiating failure'' that \n     undermined the treaty. It also is a key reason U.S. \n     intelligence agencies said both nations could conduct hidden \n     nuclear tests without detection.\n       The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity \n     because of sensitive intelligence issues, said the treaty's \n     international monitoring system that includes 50 ``primary'' \n     seismic stations and 120 ``auxiliary'' seismic stations does \n     not include stations close to China's remote northwestern Lop \n     Nur testing site in Xinjiang province, or Russia's arctic \n     Novaya Zemlya.\n       U.S. intelligence agencies suspect the two locations were \n     used recently for small nuclear test blasts.\n       China's test on June 12 may have been part of efforts by \n     Beijing to build smaller warheads for its short-range \n     missiles, or multiple warheads for its intercontinental \n     ballistic missiles (ICBMs), U.S. intelligence officials said.\n       Two suspected nuclear tests detected near Novaya Zemlya on \n     Sept. 8 and Sept. 23 are believed to be part of Russia's \n     secret nuclear testing program.\n       U.S. intelligence agencies reported recently to policy-\n     makers and members of Congress that Russia and China are the \n     two nations are most interested and capable of conducting \n     covert tests. ``Both have locations where they could conduct \n     secret tests that would not be detected,'' said one \n     intelligence official.\n       The official said that during treaty negotiations from 1994 \n     to 1996 at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, U.S. \n     negotiators failed to press for Russian and Chinese agreement \n     to tougher monitoring provisions in the treaty that would \n     satisfy the concerns of U.S. spy agencies about cheating.\n       According to the official, ``if Russia had been convinced \n     to have one facility at Novaya Zemlya and China agreed to \n     have one near Lop Nur, the level of verification would have \n     improved greatly.''\n       Russia and China also blocked a treaty provision that would \n     have required treaty signatories to allow small explosive \n     tests that would have ``calibrated'' regional seismic \n     stations so they accurately measure underground blasts, the \n     officials said.\n       Without the calibration, the regional stations will provide \n     misleading or confusing data that undermines more accurate \n     data provided by primary stations, they said.\n       A National Intelligence Estimate, the consensus judgment of \n     all U.S. intelligence agencies, presented a finding in 1997 \n     that said verifying the test-ban treaty will be difficult.\n       That estimate is currently being revised and is expected to \n     conclude that because of the lack of verification and the \n     possibility that states could conduct secret tests without \n     detection, the treaty is even more difficult to verify, said \n     officials close to the intelligence community.\n       Under the treaty, Russia will have six primary seismic \n     stations and 13 secondary stations; China will have two \n     primary seismic posts and four secondary facilities.\n       None of these stations, however, is located close enough to \n     the main Russian and Chinese testing facilities to be able to \n     detect tests conducted covertly inside underground caves, or \n     tests of very small nuclear blasts, the officials said.\n       By contrast, the United States has five primary seismic \n     monitoring facilities under the treaty, including one in \n     Nevada, where the main U.S. nuclear testing site is located. \n     It will also have 11 secondary sites.\n       Michael Pillsbury, a former acting director of the U.S. \n     Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said China would have \n     agreed to better seismic monitoring if Beijing were pushed \n     into it.\n       ``Chinese officials have told me that if the Clinton \n     administration had pushed harder they would have agreed to a \n     primary site near the test site,'' said Mr. Pillsbury, who \n     also took part in a recent Defense Science Task Force study \n     on nuclear weapons, ``but the Chinese had the impression the \n     Clinton administration didn't place as a high priority on \n     treaty verification as they did on maintaining good trade \n     relations.\n       A Senate defense specialist said Russia agreed to allow \n     more sensitive seismic monitors to be placed near Novaya \n     Zemlya, but only if the United States agreed to provide \n     Moscow with advanced computers and U.S. nuclear weapons \n     testing data. The administration refused.\n       On Russia, the aide said the administration faces a \n     dilemma. ``Either they accuse the Russians of violating the \n     treaty or concede the treaty cannot be verified,'' the aide \n     said.\n       U.S. intelligence agencies are now saying that ``you can \n     have militarily significant developments below the [seismic] \n     detection threshold,'' the aide said.\n       Administration officials have said verification is not as \n     important as promoting the agreement itself as a deterrent to \n     nuclear weapons proliferation.\n       ``The CIA has indicated that they cannot verify to a \n     hundred percent whether or not someone has conducted a \n     nuclear test,'' Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said \n     Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''\n       ``But we believe with this treaty, you're going to have at \n     least an additional 320 sites that will help monitor testing \n     around the world,'' he said. ``. . . We are satisfied we can \n     verify adequately, not a hundred percent, but satisfy \n     ourselves that there is no testing doing on that would put us \n     at any kind of a strategic disadvantage.''\n       Asked about the fact, that the United States cannot detect \n     unclear blasts below a few kiloton yield, Secretary of State \n     Madeleine K. Albright said: ``We can detect what we need \n     to.''\n       ``Those that are below a certain level, we do not think \n     would undercut our nuclear deterrent because they would be so \n     small that they would not affect our nuclear deterrent \n     capacity,'' Mrs. Albright said on ABC's ``This Week.''\n       A Pentagon official, however, said the Clinton \n     administration is supporting anti-nuclear-weapons activists \n     by supporting the test ban.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senate has a solemn obligation under our \nConstitution to be a backstop. We are not supposed to be a rubber stamp \nto treaties. If we were simply to rubber stamp whatever the President \nsent to us, our founding fathers wouldn't have provided a separate \nadvice and consent responsibility for the Senate. As a matter of fact, \nwe would be doing the Office of the Presidency a big favor by \nexercising that responsibility in a responsible way, saying that when \nwe find\n\n[[Page S12370]]\n\ntreaties that lack even minimal standards, then we need to say no, so \nthat our negotiators in the future will be able to negotiate stronger \nprovisions--provisions that we seek because we understand their \nimportance and necessity for sensible arms control.\n  If we simply ratify what is acknowledged to be a flawed treaty, then \nour negotiators are never going to be able to say no to bad terms and \nwe are always going to have to then go to the lowest common denominator \nin these treaties--treaties which then become bad for the United \nStates; treaties which are unverifiable and unenforceable. Those are \nconcepts that used to cause the Senate to say no, to say we won't \napprove a treaty that doesn't have good verification or enforcement \nprovisions. Those are minimally necessary for sensible treaties.\n  Our negotiators tried to avoid a zero-yield basis in this treaty but \nthey couldn't so they gave up. They tried to have a 10-year limit \nrather than having this treaty be in effect in perpetuity, but they \ncouldn't get it done. So in order to make a deal, they said: All right, \nwe will agree to something less. If they knew and if their counterparts \nunderstood that the Senate at that point would say: No, we are not \ngoing to ratify such a treaty, they would more likely have stood firm \nand been able to hold their ground.\n  The same thing is true with respect to these monitors. Administration \nofficials have tried to suggest that actually we will have a better \nchance of monitoring in the future than we do today, while many of the \nexperts have debunked that. The fact that the treaty calls for \nmonitoring sites around the world is irrelevant if the sites are not \nplaced in the positions that are best for detection of nuclear weapon \nexplosions. What this article is pointing out is that when the United \nStates tried to interpose that requirement on Russia and China, the \nRussians and Chinese said no, and we backed down. So now we don't have \nmonitoring stations in key locations in the world near the Chinese and \nRussian test sites that would enable the United States to understand \nwhether or not they have violated the treaty by engaging in nuclear \ntests.\n  Let me quote further from the article, while it points out that \nRussia and China will have some seismic stations:\n\n       None of these stations, however, is located close enough to \n     the main Russian and Chinese testing facilities to be able to \n     detect tests conducted covertly inside underground caves, or \n     tests of very small nuclear blasts, the official said.\n       By contrast, the United States has five primary seismic \n     monitoring facilities under the treaty, including one in \n     Nevada, where the main U.S. nuclear testing site is located. \n     It will also have 11 secondary sites.\n       Michael Pillsbury, a former acting director of the U.S. \n     Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said China would have \n     agreed to better seismic monitoring if Beijing were pushed \n     into it.\n       ``Chinese officials have told me that if the Clinton \n     administration had pushed harder they would have agreed to a \n     primary site near the test site,'' said Mr. Pillsbury, who \n     also took part in a recent Defense Science Task Force study \n     on nuclear weapons, ``but the Chinese had the impression the \n     Clinton administration didn't place as high a priority on \n     treaty verification as they did on maintaining good trade \n     relations.''\n       A Senate defense specialist said Russia agreed to allow \n     more sensitive seismic monitoring to be placed near Novaya \n     Zemlya, but only if the United States agreed to provide \n     Moscow with advanced computers and U.S. nuclear weapons \n     testing data. The administration refused.\n\n  I think the point of this article and the point of the testimony of \nseveral of the people who came before the committees was that the \npeople who negotiated this treaty gave up too soon on too many \nimportant provisions, and because they wanted a treaty more than they \nwere concerned about the specific provisions--such as verification and \nenforcement--they were willing to commit the United States to a series \nof obligations that will have a profound negative impact on our nuclear \nstockpile and yet do very little, if anything, to ensure that other \nnations in the world will not proliferate nuclear weapons.\n\n  The President has signed the treaty. That doesn't mean the United \nStates needs to ratify it. We should exercise our independent judgment, \nour constitutional prerogative, to provide, as I said, before the \nquality control. If we do that, this President and future Presidents' \nhands will be strengthened when they go to the negotiating sessions to \ntalk about such things as where to place the monitors. Maybe the \nChinese and the Russians and others at that time will understand they \nare not going to bamboozle our negotiators. Because the Senate provides \na backstop, we will say no. That is the way the Founding Fathers \nunderstood we could ensure that the United States did not take on \ninadequate or offensive international arms obligations or limitations.\n  I have mentioned all the safeguards but the last one. These \nsafeguards add nothing to the status quo. In fact, I hope they will be \nmore robustly pursued than this administration has pursued.\n  Last is the withdrawal under the supreme interest clause. Even this \nwas something that the administration sought to avoid when it \nnegotiated the treaty initially. The negotiators understood how very \ndifficult--in fact, how almost impossible--it is to invoke the supreme \ninterest clause. There are two reasons for that. They are very simple. \nFirst, if a country hasn't tested for a decade and all of a sudden this \nclause is invoked, that country is, in effect, telling all the rest of \nthe world, whoops, we have a problem; please excuse us while we test.\n  That is not a good message to send to the rest of the world. As \ndifficult as the political inability to invoke this clause, if we think \nit is hard now to reject this treaty--which most on this side believe \nshould be rejected--if we think it is difficult now because world \nopinion will react badly to a negative vote by the Senate, what do \nMembers think world opinion will be after the treaty has been in effect \nfor a decade and all of a sudden the United States tries to withdraw \nfrom it because we need to test?\n  That is real pressure. It is a virtual impossibility. In fact, \nPresident John F. Kennedy said exactly that in speaking about the \nmoratorium that he inherited from the Eisenhower administration. He \nsaid never again should we do that because it is not only difficult, it \nis impossible to go back to testing without political ramifications \nafter having had a moratorium condition.\n  The supreme interest clause is certainly something that would be part \nof any administration's options; whether or not it is added to the \ntreaty is irrelevant. The administration always has that option. It \nadds nothing.\n  The reason we were happy to accept the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Delaware is that it adds nothing to the treaty. We assume \nthose provisions would be extant and therefore there is no reason to \nobject to it. There is also no reason to celebrate because it adds \nnothing to what we already have.\n  As I said, unless we are a lot more serious about providing the \nfunding that is called for under the amendment and doing the science \nthat is required, we are going to find ourselves getting further and \nfurther behind, especially with respect to the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram.\n  I don't think we should say that the safeguard package has made the \ntreaty any better than it was to begin with.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nJohn H. Nuckolls.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             John H. Nuckolls,\n\n                                 Livermore, CA, September 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: This letter responds to your April 1, \n     1999 request for my answers to five questions concerning the \n     effects of a nuclear test ban on the reliability and safety \n     of the nuclear stockpile. My views do not represent LLNL.\n       1. To maintain confidence in the safety and reliability of \n     the U.S. nuclear stockpile in absence of nuclear testing, the \n     United States intends to rely on the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program to accomplish the goals previously achieved through \n     nuclear testing. Setting aside the controversial issue of \n     sustained funding for the Program, how confident should we be \n     that the Program will achieve its goals? In your answer, \n     please address not only the level of certainty we should have \n     regarding the Program's technical goals, but also the goal of \n     attracting and training nuclear weapons experts who could fix \n     problems that may develop in the existing stockpile or design \n     and build new nuclear weapons.\n       In an extended duration test ban, confidence in the \n     stockpile would be adversely affected by loss of all nuclear \n     test trained\n\n[[Page S12371]]\n\n     and validated expert personnel, major gaps in our scientific \n     understanding of nuclear explosives, nuclear and chemical \n     decay of warheads, accidents and inadequate funding of the \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP).\n       All nuclear test trained/validated personnel would \n     eventually be lost. Training of the replacement workforce \n     would be seriously handicapped without nuclear testing, and \n     expert judgment could not be fully validated. A serious \n     degradation of U.S. capabilities to find and fix stockpile \n     problems, and to design and build new nuclear weapons would \n     be unavoidable.\n       There are major gaps in our scientific understanding of \n     critically important processes essential to the operation of \n     nuclear explosives. These gaps create a serious vulnerability \n     to undetected problems. Uncertainties in performance margins \n     increase this vulnerability. Consequently, there will be a \n     growing uncertainty in long-term reliability.\n       It cannot be assured that the powerful computational and \n     experimental capabilities of the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program will increase confidence in reliability. Improved \n     understanding may reduce confidence in estimates of \n     performance margins and reliability if fixes and validation \n     are precluded by a CTBT.\n       Key components of nuclear warheads are ``aging'' by \n     radioactive decay and chemical decomposition and corrosion. \n     Periodic remanufacture is necessary, but may copy existing \n     defects and introduce additional defects. Some of the \n     remanufactured parts may differ significantly from the \n     original parts--due to loss of nuclear test validated \n     personnel who manufactured the original parts, the use of new \n     material and fabrication processes, and inadequate \n     specification of original parts. There are significant risks \n     of reducing stockpile reliability when remanufactured parts \n     are involved in warhead processes where there are major gaps \n     in our scientific understanding.\n       In spite of extraordinary efforts to prevent accidents, \n     sooner or later ``accidents will happen.'' Accidents (very \n     probably those of foreign nuclear forces) are likely to \n     generate requirements for incorporating modern damage \n     limitation technologies in our nuclear warhead systems which \n     lack these safety features. Without nuclear tests, confidence \n     in reliability would be substantially reduced by the \n     introduction of some safety technologies.\n       A post-CTBT or other funding reduction would increase the \n     uncertainty in long-term stockpile reliability. Current and \n     projected funding is inadequate. Substantial additional \n     funding is needed for SSP experimental efforts including \n     construction of an advanced hydro facility.\n       The uncertainty in long-term stockpile reliability may be \n     reduced somewhat by increasing performance margins. Depending \n     on national security requirements, operational measures may \n     be feasible which compensate for uncertain stockpile \n     reliability, e.g., limit arms control agreements so that \n     large and diverse reserves of warheads and delivery systems \n     can be maintained, use multiple independent forces on each \n     target and maximize use of shoot-look-shoot.\n       2. Certification of U.S. nuclear weapons, once achieved \n     through nuclear testing, is now accomplished through a \n     process of review by experts. How crucial is the nuclear \n     testing experience of those experts to their ability to \n     perform the certification task? What level of risk would you \n     associate with having a certification process in the future \n     that utilizes only individuals who have had no nuclear \n     testing experience?\n       Stockpile confidence would be reduced if certification were \n     performed by experts lacking nuclear test experience. The \n     level of risk would be high unless arms control agreements \n     were restrained, and substantially reserve forces maintained \n     so that the capabilities of our nuclear forces substantially \n     exceeded national security requirements.\n       3. Current U.S. plans are to maintain ``the basic \n     capability to resume nuclear test activities.'' In your view, \n     is it technically possible to maintain the nuclear test site, \n     together with the requisite skilled personnel, in a state \n     whereby nuclear testing can readily be resumed if needed? How \n     quickly do you believe that testing can be resumed?\n       In an extended duration nuclear test ban, the nuclear test \n     site infrastructure is likely to decay and become obsolete. \n     Nuclear test experienced personnel would be lost. A series of \n     nuclear tests to diagnose complex reliability problems and \n     certify a fix, or to develop new weapons could take several \n     years.\n       4. In your experience, how vital has nuclear testing been \n     to the discovery and resolution of problems with the U.S. \n     stockpile?\n       Nuclear testing has been essential to the discovery and \n     resolution of many problems in the stockpile.\n       5. Experts agree that nuclear testing can be conducted by \n     other nations at low yields without its being detected. If \n     other nuclear weapons states were to continue clandestine \n     nuclear testing at low levels, do you believe that they could \n     obtain significantly greater confidence in the reliability of \n     their nuclear arsenals?\n       With a series of clandestine nuclear tests, Russia could \n     increase confidence in the reliability of its nuclear \n     stockpile. Advanced low-yield nuclear weapons could also be \n     developed, e.g., tactical and BMD warheads.\n       China and other nations could improve their nuclear forces \n     by clandestine tests of nuclear weapons, including tests of \n     U.S. designs obtained through espionage? and Russian designs \n     obtained through various means?\n       A ``CTBT'' with clandestine nuclear tests would incentivize \n     and facilitate espionage. Achieving qualitative parity with a \n     static U.S. stockpile would be a powerful incentive. \n     Espionage is facilitated when U.S. progress is frozen, and \n     classified information is being concentrated and organized in \n     electronic systems.\n       These views are my own and do not represent LLNL.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                             John H. Nuckolls,\n\n                                          Director Emeritus, LLNL.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia would be next, \nbut he has kindly yielded to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  My friend from Arizona keeps saying the ``acknowledged flawed \ntreaty.'' It is not acknowledged to be flawed by 32 Nobel laureates in \nphysics. It is not acknowledged to be flawed by four of the last five \nChairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is not acknowledged to be \nflawed by the weapons lab Directors, et cetera.\n  I want to make it clear, he states some believe it is flawed. The \nmajority of the people who are in command and have been in command--the \nSecretaries of Defense who have been mentioned--if we balance it out, \nclearly think this is not a flawed treaty.\n  I yield on the Republican time to my friend from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there can be no question that this \ndebate and the vote which might occur are very significant and historic \nevents for the United States. I very much want to be in favor of the \ntreaty but I cannot favor the treaty because I believe essentially it \njeopardizes U.S. security.\n  I wish every Senator had the opportunities I have had for the last \n5\\1/2\\ years. I say that knowing full well my friend from Arizona, \nwhile he is not on the committee that funds the stockpile stewardship, \nis one of the rare exceptions in that he and a few other Senators have \nlearned and worked very diligently to understand what we have been \ndoing since we decided on behalf of the Senate in a Mark Hatfield \namendment that we would not test nuclear weapons.\n  What has been the U.S. response to our scientific and nuclear \ncommunity?\n  Essentially, what we have been busy doing can be encapsulated in the \nwords ``science-based stockpile stewardship.'' One might say, since \nthat pertains to the safety of the weapons system, what we used to do \ncould be called nuclear testing stockpile stewardship. That occurred \nsince the beginning of our nuclear weapons programs. The United States \nhad a formidable, perhaps the world's best, system of underground \ntesting.\n  Testing became very important to those laboratories--there are now \nthree that are principally called nuclear deterrent or stockpile \nstewardship laboratories. I am privileged to have two of them in my \nState. When I come to the floor, go to meetings, and talk about the \nfact this is an important program and these laboratories are important, \nit hardly ever comes into focus like it is today, like it was in our \nconference at noon, and like it has been for the last week as Senator \nJon Kyl and others have spoken to the fact that what the United States \nhas been trying to do is develop a science-based system. This system \nmeans supercomputer simulation and other techniques and skills to see \nwhat is going on in a nuclear weapon without any testing to assure the \nparts that might be wearing out are discernible and can be replaced and \nthat the weapon, indeed, is safe.\n  Frankly, if nothing else, I pray this debate will cause Senators and \nRepresentatives, in particular in the important committees of \njurisdiction, to understand the importance of this program if the \nUnited States continues on a path of no testing, for whatever period of \ntime--and who knows, we may do that in spite of this treaty not being \nratified by the United States. I do not want to engage in a maybe-and-\nmaybe-not discussion on that, but the United States is trying hard. \nNonetheless, my principal concerns about this Treaty--and there are \nmany--center around four reasons, and three of them have to do with \nscience-based stockpile stewardship.\n  First, the science-based stockpile stewardship is new; it is nascent; \nit is just starting. It is not finished. It has not been completed. It \nis not perfected. As a matter of fact, to the Senators who are on the \nfloor, probably some of\n\n[[Page S12372]]\n\nthe most profound testimony regarding America's stockpile of nuclear \nweapons occurred in the Armed Services Committee last week when sitting \nat the witness table was the Secretary of Energy, surrounded by the \nthree National Laboratory Directors.\n  It goes without saying that our country owes them a high degree of \ngratitude and thanks for what they do, for they oversee the safety of \nour weapons under this new approach which is very different for them, \nand that is, no testing; they must certify that everything is OK \nwithout testing. Scientists and physicists steeped in knowledge about \nnuclear weapons--one of them is a nuclear weapons expert of the highest \norder--testified, and I will quote in a while some of the difficulties \nthey see with reference to their responsibility.\n  Secondly, I do not know what to do about it, but the difficulty, as \nthey testified, in securing the funding they need without new mandates \nimposed upon them is very uncertain. The difficulty is real and it is \nuncertain as to whether they will continually over time get sufficient \nresources.\n  Third is, and I say this with a clear hope that the Secretary of \nEnergy and the President will listen, the unknown impact of the failure \non the part of this administration to proceed with reorganizing the \nDepartment of Energy on stewardship efforts. I do not want to belabor \nin this speech the efforts that many of us went to in streamlining \naccountability of the nuclear weapons programs within the Energy \nDepartment. We called it a semiautonomous agency--so that Department, \nwhich is in charge of the nuclear weapons, including the profound \nthings we are talking about with respect to their safety, will not be \nbogged down by rules, regulations, personnel, and other things from a \nDepartment as diverse as the Department of Energy.\n  As a matter of fact, the more I think about it, the more I am \nconvinced they should get on with doing what Congress told them to do \ninstead of this waffling out of it by putting Secretary Richardson in \ncharge of both the Energy Department and a new independent agency--\nwhich was supposed to be created so it would be semiautonomous, and he \nwill head them both under an interpretation that cannot be legal--just \nindicates to me that they are not quite willing in this Department of \nEnergy to face up to the serious problems of our nuclear stockpile and \nsuch things as science-based stockpile stewardship.\n  Lastly, and for many who talked on the floor, the most important \nissue is the ambiguities and threats to our international security at \nthe present time. I will talk about that a bit because some Senators \nare asking: How can you be against the treaty and at the same time say \nwe ought to put it off?\n  Let me repeat, my last concern is the ambiguities and threats to our \ninternational security at present.\n  I will proceed quickly with an elaboration.\n  When the United States declared a unilateral moratorium in 1992, the \nonus was on the scientists and National Laboratories to design and \nimplement a program that would ensure the safety, reliability, and \nperformance of our nuclear arsenal without testing. This is an onerous, \ncomplicated task that has yet to be fully implemented and validated, \nand I just stated that.\n  Science-based stockpile stewardship was designed to replace nuclear \ntests through increased understanding of the nuclear physics in \nconjunction with unprecedented simulation capabilities. This requires a \nlot of money. In fact, full implementation of the stewardship program \nis more expensive than reliance on nuclear tests, and I do not say this \nas an excuse for moving back to testing. The truth of the matter is it \nproves we are very willing to keep our stockpiles safe, reliable, and \nsound, even if it costs us more money, so long as we do not do \nunderground testing on the other side of the ledger.\n  There is no question that in addition, the validity of this approach \nremains unproven, and key facilities, such as the National Ignition \nFacility, are behind schedule and over budget, and it is supposed to be \none of the integral parts of being able to determine the stockpile \nconfidence.\n  This program will attempt to preserve the viability of existing \nweapons indefinitely. We no longer possess the production capabilities \nto replace the weapons, and maybe Senator Kyl has referred to that. We \nhave already gotten rid of our production facilities. Currently, seven \nhighly sophisticated warhead designs comprise our arsenal. Each weapon \ncontains thousands of components, all of which are subject to decay and \ncorrosion over time. Any small flaw in any individual component would \nrender the weapons ineffective. In addition, because we intend to \npreserve, rather than replace, these weapons with new designs, aging \neffects on these weapons remains to be seen.\n  I quote Dr. Paul Robinson of Sandia National Laboratory in his \ntestimony last week:\n\n       Confidence in the reliability and safety of the nuclear \n     weapons stockpile will eventually decline without nuclear \n     testing. . . . Whether the risk that will arise from this \n     decline in confidence will be acceptable or not is a policy \n     issue that must be considered in light of the benefits \n     expected to be realized [if you have a] test ban.\n\n  Are we ready today to accept a decline in confidence of our nuclear \ndeterrent? Can we today accurately weigh the benefits on either side of \nthe issue? I do not think so. On the other hand, we risk complete \ncollapse of ongoing disarmament initiatives by prematurely rejecting \nthis treaty. That is why I believe it is not inconsistent that I am not \nfor it, but I would not like it to be voted on.\n  There are substantial risks with unknown consequences. Success of the \nStockpile Stewardship Program requires recruiting the brightest young \nscientists. We have to begin to substitute for the older heads who know \neverything there is about it and contain all of the so-called corporate \nmemory with reference to the science testing and the like.\n  My colleagues all know that I have fought very hard to get the money \nfor the Stockpile Stewardship Program. We came perilously close this \nyear to having this part of our budget cut by as much as $1 billion by \nthe House. I think after weeks of saying we would not go to \nconference--it is not worth going to conference to fight--it was \nbelieved it would be better to stay at last year's level. They finally \ncame to the point where we have a Stockpile Stewardship Program funded, \nbut in an almost irreverent way.\n  Dr. Browne of Los Alamos said:\n\n       I am confident that a fully supported and sustained program \n     will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear \n     deterrent without nuclear testing. However, I am concerned \n     about several trends that are reducing my confidence level \n     each year. These include annual shortfalls in planned \n     budgets, increased numbers of findings in the stockpile that \n     need resolution, an augmented workload beyond our original \n     plans, and unfunded mandates that cut into the program.\n\n  It is pretty clear that it is not what they would like it to be.\n  He also said he was\n\n       concerned about other significant disturbances this year in \n     the stability of the support from the government, partially \n     in response to concerns about espionage. This has sent a \n     mixed message to the Laboratory that will make it more \n     difficult to carry out\n\nthe stewardship program. According to this good doctor who heads Los \nAlamos, the task of recruiting and training the requisite talent is \nhindered by the current security climate at the laboratories.\n  I strongly believe that the establishment of a semi-independent \nagency for nuclear weapons activities will significantly enhance \nefforts to ensure the success of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. At \nthe same time, this reorganization will require many months to \naccomplish. I ask my colleagues the following question: Should we make \nan international declaration regarding U.S. nuclear tests in the midst \nof a complete overhaul of the Department responsible for those weapons? \nI don't think so. Such an action would be premature.\n  Lastly, today we cannot clearly define the direction the world will \ntake on nuclear issues. This concern speaks both for and against the \ntreaty. Treaty proponents believe that U.S. ratification and the \ntreaty's entry into force will curb proliferation. This treaty, if \nfully implemented, would enhance our ability to detect nuclear tests \nand create a deterrent to nations that may aspire to possess nuclear \nweapons capabilities.\n  However, others say, without question, this treaty is not a silver \nbullet. The administration has touted it as such. This treaty is only \none measure of many that should comprise a solid nonproliferation \nagenda. For example,\n\n[[Page S12373]]\n\nthis treaty would be acceptable if accompanied by substantive bilateral \ncommitments with Russia and multilateral commitments among the declared \nnuclear powers. A framework for international disarmament, \nnonproliferation, and stability may very well include a Test Ban \nTreaty, but it should also be accompanied by binding commitments on \nfuture disarmament objectives, such as the Fissile Materials Cutoff \nRegime, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n  We have only one treaty--one facet of a complex picture--before us \ntoday. It may contribute to achieving other disarmament objectives, but \nwe are being asked to wager our nuclear deterrent on the hope that \nformal commitments from other nuclear powers and threshold states will \nbe forthcoming. We sign on the dotted line that we will not utilize \ntesting to maintain our stockpile, and we plead with the world to \nfollow suit.\n  Or we reject the Treaty now and eliminate others' potential \nhesitation regarding future tests.\n  Only 23 of the 44 nations required for the Treaty's entry into force \nhave ratified it. India, Pakistan, North Korea, Russia and China have \nnot ratified it. Neither India nor Pakistan have even signed the \ntreaty.\n  We should not rush to vote on this matter.\n  Regardless of the vote count, we risk either permanent damage to our \nnon-proliferation objectives or the safety and reliability of the U.S. \nnuclear arsenal. Continuing our moratorium on nuclear testing and not \nacting on this Treaty is the best course of action for now.\n  We have time. Time to observe international changes and formulate a \nnuclear posture suitable for a new era. Time to evaluate the future of \nour bilateral relations with Russia and China. And time to first ensure \nthe success of Stockpile Stewardship.\n  U.S. ratification would provide a positive signal and increase our \nleverage at the negotiating table in our pursuit of many non-\nproliferation objectives. If the Senate does not ratify this Treaty, \nwhich appears highly likely at the present, many of our current foreign \npolicy initiatives will unravel.\n  Most importantly, a negative vote on the CTBT will further erode the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT, itself. We secured indefinite \nextension of the NPT in 1995 by committing to lead negotiations, sign \nand ratify the Test Ban Treaty. There is an explicit link between our \nArticle VI commitments to disarm and the CTBT.\n  Many other steps could be taken to demonstrate a good faith effort \ntoward nuclear disarmament. The Test Ban Treaty is just one element of \na comprehensive strategy to reduce nuclear dangers. The U.S. and Russia \nhave already radically reduced stockpiles from their Cold War levels. \nProgress has been made in the negotiations for a fissile materials \ncutoff regime. Currently, all of the declared nuclear powers have a \nmoratorium on testing, and two of those, Britain and France, have \nsigned and ratified the Test Ban Treaty.\n  If the Senate votes against this Treaty, we will send the signal to \nthe world that the U.S. has no intent to make good on its earlier \ncommitments. START II will wither in the Duma; negotiations with Russia \non START III and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty will most likely \nfalter. We would most likely witness a rash of nuclear tests in \nresponse. Killing this Treaty would inevitably also impact upcoming \nelections in Russia. To the Russians our actions in Kosovo underscored \nNATO's willingness to engage in out-of-area operations, even in \nviolation of sovereignty. Anti-U.S. sentiments in Russia soared. Not \nonly would a down vote on this Treaty play into the hands of the \nCommunists and Nationalists, U.S. actions would essentially give Russia \nthe go-ahead to begin testing a new generation of tactical nuclear \nweapons to secure its border against NATO.\n  We risk little by postponing consideration of this Treaty. We put our \nmost vital security interests at stake by rushing to judgement on it.\n  In sum, defeat of this Treaty at this point will have a devastating \nimpact on numerous current foreign policy initiatives that are clearly \nin the U.S. national interest. We can anticipate an unraveling of \ninitiatives toward bilateral disarmament with Russia, and we will \nforfeit any remaining hope of preventing a nuclear arms race between \nIndia and Pakistan. We will open wide the door for China to proceed \nwith tests to validate any nuclear designs based on the alleged stolen \nW-88 blueprints.\n  At the same time, Stockpile Stewardship is as yet unproven. We still \ndo not fully understand the aging effects on our nuclear arsenal. Such \naging effects relate both to the components which comprise the nuclear \nweapons and the scientific experts who initially designed and tested \nthem. Also, as witnessed again this year, the budget for the full \nimplementation of Stockpile Stewardship is anything but secure. In \nlight of the current situation, ratification of this Treaty may put us \nat risk.\n  The timing of this debate is such that I have to weigh very carefully \nbetween the negative impact of this Treaty's possible defeat and the \nannual budgetary struggles for Stockpile Stewardship in combination \nwith the scientific community's own doubts about the Stockpile \nStewardship program.\n  We should maintain the moratorium on testing and postpone the vote on \nthis matter.\n  It is irresponsible and dangerous to proceed now with the debate and \nvote on this Treaty. We have nothing to lose by maintaining our current \nstatus of a unilateral moratorium and having signed but not yet \nratified the Test Ban Treaty. But we have everything to lose regardless \nof the outcome of this vote.\n  I thank the Senate for listening and the leadership for granting me \nthis time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 10 minutes to my friend from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. President, on balance I personally believe the arguments for \nratification of the CTBT are far more persuasive than the arguments \nagainst ratification. But I recognize the legitimacy of some of the \narguments made against ratification. I recognize the credibility of \nsome of those making those arguments. I respect the sincerity of \ncolleagues who believe that ratification would be a mistake.\n  Having said that, I will not repeat all of the reasons that I would \nvote for ratification, if we are, indeed, forced to go ahead with the \nvote scheduled for later this afternoon. I would simply appeal to \ncolleagues who oppose ratification not to let their feelings--their \npersonal feelings--toward our Commander in Chief or their desires for a \ndecisive political victory to weaken the role of the U.S. leadership in \nthe international community or encourage additional testing by nations \nthat might not otherwise do so, and thus make the world less secure and \nmore dangerous.\n  On the politics, opponents of ratification at this time have already \nwon. No one contends that 67 Senators are prepared to vote for \nratification. No one is suggesting that this President or any future \nPresident is going to bring the treaty up for ratification again unless \nand until they have those 67 votes.\n  I happen to be one of the 10 Senators who engaged in an extended \ndiscussion of this treaty with the President and his national security \nteam last Tuesday evening. Many others have been actively engaged in \nthe debate from the very beginning. As I recall, there were six \nRepublicans and four Democrats; and we were equally divided on the \nquestion of ratification.\n  I wish to commend all of the Senators involved in that process and \nthroughout, but particularly those Republicans who stated during that \nmeeting, very forcefully, why they oppose the treaty and why a \nratification vote would fail but nonetheless were willing to help find \na way to pull us back from the brink--for the good of the country and \nin the interest of a safer world.\n  In this instance, the President has acknowledged that if we go ahead \nwith the vote, he will lose. But he is asking us not to defeat our own \nnational interest as well by voting down this treaty.\n  The Senate, in pressing its case, however, for an up-or-down vote at \nthis point, in my judgment, injures the\n\n[[Page S12374]]\n\ncountry's ability to lead and strikes a blow at American leadership \naround the world. Far more is at stake than defeating the policy and \nagenda of this particular President. Make no mistake, allies, friends, \nand enemies would view the defeat of the CTBT as a green light for more \nnuclear testing and further development of nuclear weapons, either \nstrategic or tactical.\n  Defeat of the treaty will not be perceived as a signal of restraint. \nJust the opposite. Delay of consideration of the matter at least gives \nus the opportunity to address continuing concerns about monitoring and \nverification, as best we can, while delivering the message to other \nnations that we should proceed with yellow-light caution in regard to \ntesting and development of their programs.\n  I have carefully reviewed the intelligence community's analysis of \nour CTBT monitoring capabilities--including the 1997 national \nintelligence estimate and the updating of that document--and \nadmittedly, there are no absolutes when it comes to our ability to \ndetect and identify some tests at low yields with high confidence. The \nmore critical issue at hand, however, is the significance of possible \nevasion and the rationale that underlies such action and what it means \nfor the inherent advantage we currently maintain with our nuclear \narsenal.\n\n  I urge our colleagues to weigh very carefully the views of the \nintelligence community. The intelligence community believes we can \neffectively monitor the CTBT. We approved the Chemical Weapons \nConvention aware of the fact that denial and deception techniques would \nprevent us from confirming absolutely that production, development, and \nstockpiling were not going on. But as with the CTBT, we were able to \napproach the subject of monitoring with a high degree of confidence \nthat signatories were not violating the CWC. As a result, \nimplementation of that pact is contributing to our national security.\n  Senate hearings this past week suggest an emerging story at Novaya \nZemlya but not outright violations of CTBT provisions. Transparency is \nlacking there, and perhaps a delay in consideration of the treaty will \naid our efforts to sort out ongoing developments in this particular \nlocation. But defeating the CTBT on the concerns we have about this one \nsite would represent a failure to understand what is in our broad \nnational interest. Creating a normative global standard not to test \nwill do enormous good and will act as a powerful force to stop would-be \ncheaters in their tracks.\n  It is reasonably clear to our intelligence community that Russia and \nperhaps others would not necessarily make gains in their thermonuclear \nweapons program through an evasive low-yield testing program without \nrisking exposure of such tests to the international community. Given \nthat reality, it simply begs the question: Under what substantive \nrationale would Russia or another country proceed in light of the \noutcry and condemnation that would surely follow?\n  I believe this matter is ripe for an agreement we can negotiate among \nourselves in the Senate, through unanimous consent, that delays CTBT \nconsideration until the next Congress. I am prepared to support CTBT \nregardless of the political affiliation of the Commander in Chief. But \ndue to the untenable circumstances in which we now find ourselves, we \nshould honor the request of this Commander in Chief and delay a vote.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes to speak in \nopposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I also sat through a week of hearings last week. I also, as a member \nof the Armed Services Committee, had the opportunity to hear our \nintelligence community, to hear representatives from the Department of \nDefense, and to hear the Directors of our laboratories. I respectfully \nreached a different conclusion as to what the evidence is. In fact, in \nmy estimation, the evidence is strong enough to raise serious doubts \nabout the wisdom of ratifying this treaty. The evidence, I believe, \nindicates that in fact Russia is currently testing low-level nuclear \nweapons and is seeking to develop, from their own public statements and \nthe Russian media, a new type of tactical weapon, and there were \nsuspected Russian tests as recently as September 8, 1999, and September \n23, 1999.\n  I believe when we have these kinds of issues of the gravest weight to \nour Nation and to our Nation's security, when there are doubts about \nverification--and I think it is overwhelmingly clear from what I heard \nfrom the intelligence community--we cannot have assurance that we will \nbe able to verify a zero-yield treaty. That was very plain and very \nclear from the testimony we heard. Verification is not possible. \nTherefore, it is not in the best interests of our Nation to ratify this \ntreaty.\n  There are numerous reasons to oppose the treaty. We have heard many \nof them during the debate on the floor of the Senate. Many have been \ndiscussed very clearly. I will focus on one particular feature of this \nagreement which, in my view, is sufficient in and of itself to reject \nratification of this treaty. That is the issue of the treaty's \nduration.\n  This is an agreement of unlimited duration. It is an agreement that \nis in perpetuity. That means if it is ratified, the United States will \nbe committing itself forever not to conduct another nuclear test. It \nwould make us dependent upon, totally reliant upon, the Stockpile \nStewardship Program. From what we heard from the Directors of the labs \nlast week, the Stockpile Stewardship Program is, by all accounts, a \nwork in progress. Some said it would take 5 years to reach the point \nwhere we could have confidence in the program; some said 10. One said \nit would be as long as 15 to 20 years before we could know whether or \nnot this program was going to be of a sufficient confidence level that \nwe could count upon it without reliance upon tests.\n  There are two major questions about this program. One is, Will it \nwork? We are not going to know that for many years. Will it work \nsufficiently that we can rely upon high-speed computers and modeling \nand annual examinations without any kind of test to have the confidence \nthat they are reliant and safe and that, should they tragically ever \nneed to be used, we could count on them actually working?\n  The second very big issue is whether it will be funded adequately so \nthe program can be developed to that level of confidence. We have every \nindication that this will be an area in which Congress in the future \nwill seek to cut, an area in which there will not be the kind of \ncommitment, the kind of resources to ensure the development of this \nStockpile Stewardship Program to a point we can have absolute \nconfidence in it.\n  I want Members to think about the duration of this treaty--forever. \nAre we so confident today that we will never again need nuclear \ntesting, so certain that we are willing to deprive all future \nCommanders in Chief, all future military leaders, all future Congresses \nof the one means that can actually prove the safety and reliability of \nour nuclear deterrent? Are we that confident? I suggest we are not.\n  Proponents of the treaty will say that that is not the case, that \nthis commitment is not forever. They will point to the fact that the \ntreaty allows for withdrawal if our national interest requires it. \nProponents of the treaty promise that if we reach a point where the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent cannot be guaranteed \nwithout testing, then all we need to do is exercise our right to \nwithdraw and we would, at that point, resume testing.\n  This so-called ``supreme national interest'' clause, along with \nsafeguard F, in which President Clinton gives us his solemn word that \nhe will ``consider'' a resumption of testing if our deterrent cannot be \ncertified, is supposed to give us a sense of reassurance.\n  The fact is, this reassurance is a hollow promise. I think supporters \nof the treaty realize it. The fact is, if the critical moment arrives \nand there is irrefutable evidence that we must conduct nuclear testing \nto ensure our deterrent is safe, reliable, and credible, those same \ntreaty supporters will be shouting from the highest mountain that the \nvery act of withdrawing from this treaty would be too provocative to \never be\n\n[[Page S12375]]\n\njustified, that no narrow security need of the United States could ever \noverride the solemn commitment we made to the world in agreeing to be \nbound by this treaty.\n  If Members don't believe that will happen, they need only to look at \nour current difficulties with the 1972 ABM Treaty. I believe it \nprovides a chilling glimpse of our nuclear future should we ratify an \nill-conceived test ban at this time. As is the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, the ABM Treaty is of unlimited duration. There are many \nparallels. That is one of them. The ABM Treaty includes a provision \nallowing the United States to withdraw if our national interests so \ndemand, another very clear parallel and treaty obligations are more \nclearly mismatched than with the ABM Treaty today. It is very difficult \nto imagine a situation in which the national security interests we have \ncould be more clearly mismatched than with the ABM Treaty. Its \nsupporters insist, though, that withdrawal is not just ill advised, but \nsupporters would say it is unthinkable. The voices wailing loudest \nabout changing this obsolete agreement are the same ones urging us \ntoday to entangle ourselves in another treaty of unlimited duration.\n\n  Earlier, Senator Kyl rightly pointed out that the negotiators for \nthis treaty originally wanted a 10-year treaty. Previous Presidents \nwanted a treaty of limited duration, but we have before us one that \nwould lock us into a commitment in perpetuity.\n  Think of the ways in which the ABM Treaty is mismatched with our \nmodern security needs. Yet we confront our absolute unwillingness to \nconsider any option to withdraw. The treaty was conceived in a \nstrategic context utterly unlike today's, a bipolar world in which two \nsuperpowers were engaged in both a global rivalry and an accompanying \nbuildup in strategic nuclear forces. Now, today, is a totally different \ncontext and situation. One of those superpowers no longer exists at \nall. What remains of that superpower struggles to secure its own \nborders against poorly armed militants.\n  The arms race that supposedly justified the ABM Treaty's perverse \ndeification of vulnerability has not just halted, it has reversed, no \nthanks to arms control. Today, Russian nuclear forces are plummeting \ndue not to the START II agreement--which Russia has refused to ratify \nfor nearly 7 years--but to economic constraints and the end of the cold \nwar. In fact, their forces are falling far faster than treaties can \nkeep up with; arms control isn't ``controlling'' anything; economic and \nstrategic considerations are. Similar forces have led the United States \nto conclude that its forces can also be reduced. Thus, despite a \nstrategic environment completely different from the one that gave birth \nto the ABM Treaty, its supporters stubbornly insist we must remain a \nparty to it.\n  In 1972, only the Soviet Union had the capability to target the \nUnited States with long-range ballistic missiles. Today, numerous rogue \nstates are diligently working to acquire long-range missiles with which \nto coerce the United States or deter it from acting in its interests, \nand these weapons are so attractive precisely because we have no \ndefense against them; indeed, we are legally prohibited from defending \nagainst them by the ABM Treaty of 1972.\n  Technologically, too, the ABM Treaty is obsolete. The kinetic kill \nvehicle that destroyed an ICBM high over the Pacific Ocean on October 2 \nwas undreamed of in 1972. So was the idea of a 747 equipped with a \nmissile-killing laser, which is under construction now in Washington \nState, or space-based tracking satellites like SBIRS-Low, so precise \nthat they may make traditional ground-based radars superfluous in \nmissile defense. Yet this ABM Treaty, negotiated almost three decades \nago, stands in the way of many of these technological innovations that \ncould provide the United States with the protection it needs against \nthe world's new threats.\n  Now proponents of this new treaty will say we can always pull out, \nthat if situations and circumstances change, we can always invoke our \nnational security provision and we can withdraw from this treaty. If in \nthe future we find we must test in order to ensure the stability and \nreliability and safety of our nuclear deterrent, we can pull out and do \nthat. I suggest that that is not even a remote possibility. Once we \nmake this commitment, just as we did on the 1972 ABM Treaty, there will \nbe no withdrawing, there will not even be consideration of the \npossibility that it might be in our national interest to withdraw from \na treaty to which we have made a commitment.\n\n  These new threats today have led to a consensus that the United \nStates must deploy a national missile defense system and a recognition \nthat we are behind the curve in deploying one. The National Missile \nDefense Act, calling for deployment of such a system as soon as \ntechnologically feasible, passed this body by a vote of 97-3, with a \nsimilar ratio of support in the House.\n  Just as obvious as the need for this capability is the fact that the \nABM Treaty prohibits us from deploying the very system we voted to \ndeploy. But does anybody talk about withdrawing from the ABM Treaty \nbecause it is in our national security interests? Absolutely not. I \nsuggest we will be in the same kind of context should we ratify the \ntreaty that is before us today.\n  Clearly, the ABM Treaty must be amended or jettisoned. The Russians \nhave so far refused to consider amending it, so withdrawal is the most \nobvious course of action if United States security interests are to be \nserved.\n  Listen to the hue and cry at even the mention of such an option \ntoday. From Russia to China to France, and even to here on the floor of \nthe Senate, we have heard the cry that the United States cannot \nwithdraw from the ABM Treaty because it has become too important to the \nworld community. Those who see arms control as an end in itself oppose \neven the consideration of withdrawal, claiming passionately that the \nUnited States owes it to the world to remain vulnerable to missile \nattack. Our participation in this treaty transcends narrow U.S. \nsecurity interests, they claim; we have a higher obligation to the \ninternational community, they claim. After all, if the United States is \nprotected from attack, won't that just encourage others to build more \nmissiles in order to retain the ability to coerce us, thus threatening \nthe simplistic ideal of ``strategic stability''? That phrase, \ntranslated, means that citizens of the United States must be vulnerable \nto incineration or attack by biological weapons so other nations in the \nworld may do as they please.\n  Even though the ABM Treaty is hopelessly outdated--almost 30 years \nold--and prevents the United States from defending its citizens against \nthe new threats of the 21st century, supporters of arms control insist \nthat withdrawal is unthinkable. Its very existence is too important to \nbe overridden by the mere security interests of the United States.\n  Absurd as such a proposition sounds, it is the current policy of this \nadministration, and it is supported by the very same voices who now \nurge us to ratify this comprehensive test ban.\n  The Clinton administration has been reluctantly forced by the \nCongress into taking serious action on missile defenses--thankfully. It \nadmits that the system it needs to meet our security requirements \ncannot be deployed under the ABM Treaty. Yet so powerful are the voices \ncalling on the United States to subjugate its own security interests to \narms control that the administration is proposing changes to the ABM \nTreaty that, by its own admission, will not allow a missile defense \nsystem that will meet our requirements. It has declared what must be \ndone as ``too hard to do'' and intends to leave the mess it created for \nanother administration to clean up. All because arms control becomes an \nend in itself.\n\n  That sorry state of affairs is where we will end up if the Senate \nconsents to ratification of the CTBT. Those treaty supporters who are \nsaying now, ``Don't worry, there is an escape clause,'' will be the \nsame ones who, 5 or 10 years from now--when there is a problem with our \nstockpile and the National Ignition Facility is not finished and we \nfind out we overestimated our ability to simulate the workings of a \nnuclear weapon--will be saying we dare not withdraw from this treaty \nbecause we owe a higher debt to the international community. That is \nwhat we will hear.\n  I don't represent the international community; I represent the people \nof the State of Arkansas. Our decision here must serve the best \ninterests of\n\n[[Page S12376]]\n\nthe United States and its citizens. Our experience with the ABM Treaty \nis a perfect example of how arms control agreements assume an \nimportance far beyond their contribution to the security of our Nation. \nThe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty's unlimited duration is a virtual \nguarantee that this agreement will prevent us from conducting nuclear \ntesting long past the point at which we decide such testing is \nnecessary. As our ABM experience shows, we should take no comfort from \nthe presence of a so-called ``supreme national interest'' clause.\n  Now, should we just put it off or should we vote on it? I believe our \nresponsibility is not the world opinion. Our responsibility is, \nfrankly, not the public opinion polls of the United States. The \nAmerican people, as a whole, have not had the benefit of hearing the \nDirectors of our National Labs or the DOD come and testify before us as \nto the difficulties of verification and the difficulties of developing \nour Stockpile Stewardship Program. If it is a flawed treaty--and I \nbelieve it is--if it is a defective treaty--and I believe it is--if it \nis not in our national security interest--and I believe it is not--then \nwe should vote, and we should vote to defeat the treaty and not ratify \nit.\n  This is a treaty that I believe will not get better with age. It will \nnot get better by putting it on a shelf for consideration at some \nfuture date. I believe it is flawed. I believe it is defective. I \nbelieve it is not in our national security interest. I believe it is \nour constitutional responsibility not to put it off but to vote our \nconscience.\n  I urge the defeat of what I believe is a flawed treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes, and then I would \nbe happy to yield to the Senator.\n  I want my colleagues to note--they may not be aware of it, and I \nwasn't until a few minutes ago--as further consideration of how this \nmay or may not affect the events around the world there apparently has \nbeen a coup in Pakistan where the Sharif government fired their chief \nmilitary chief of staff when he was out of the country. He came back \nand decided he didn't like that. He surrounded the palace and \nsurrounded the Prime Minister's quarters. The word I received a few \nmoments ago--I suggest others check their own sources--was that there \nis going to be a civilian government installed that is not Sharif, and \nthat the military will do the installing. I cite that to indicate to \nyou how fluid world events are. We should be careful about what we are \ndoing.\n  I also point out that today before the Foreign Relations Committee, \nDr. William Perry, the President's Korean policy coordinator and former \nSecretary of Defense, testified that failure to ratify the CTBT will \ngive North Korea ``an obvious reason not to ratify the CTBT.''\n  Dr. Perry, the Secretary of Defense in President Clinton's first \nterm, endorsed ratification of the treaty. He said it serves well the \nsecurity interests of the United States.\n  I cite that only because it is current.\n  Lastly, I would say that listening with great interest to the last \nseveral speakers I find it again fascinating that this is a lot more \nthan about CTBT. It is about ABM. It is about what our nuclear strategy \nshould be.\n  My friend from Arkansas, as well as others who have spoken, has great \nfaith in our ability to erect a nuclear shield that can keep out \nincoming nuclear weapons in the scores, dozens, or potentially \nhundreds, which is a monumental feat, if it can be accomplished--we may \nbe able to accomplish it--but don't have the confidence that those same \nscientists could figure out a way to take a weapon off the nose of a \nmissile, look and determine whether or not it has deteriorated. I would \nsuggest one is considerably more difficult to do than the other. But it \nis a little bit about where you place your faith.\n  Lastly, I, point out for those who are talking about verification--my \nfriend from Arizona heard me say this time and again, and I would \nsuggest you all go back and look at, if you were here, how you voted on \nthe INF Treaty, the Reagan INF Treaty, or if you weren't here, what \nPresident Reagan said because many of my friends on the Republican side \nquote Ronald Reagan when he says ``trust but verify.'' Nobody can \nverify the INF Treaty. The intelligence community--and I will not read \nagain all of the detail; it is in the Record--indicated we could not \nverify the INF Treaty, and we said and the Reagan administration said \nand President Reagan said in his pushing the INF Treaty that no \nverification was possible completely. Yet with the fact that we didn't \neven know how many SS-20s they had, it was concluded that they could \nadapt those to longer range, interchange them with shorter-range \nmissiles and longer-range missiles, and hide them in silos. But my \nRepublican colleagues had no trouble ratifying that treaty, which was \nnot verifiable, or was considerably less verifiable than this treaty.\n\n  If you quote President Reagan, please quote him in the context that \nhe used the phrase ``trust but verify.'' And he defined what he meant \nby ``verify'' by his actions.\n  The military under President Reagan said the INF Treaty was \nverifiable to the extent that they could not do anything that would \nmaterially alter the military balance. No one argues that we cannot \nverify to the extent as well. But it seems as though we apply one \nstandard to Republican-sponsored treaties by Republican Presidents and \na different standard to a treaty proposed by a Democratic President. I \nfind that, as you might guess, fascinating. I will remind people of it \nnow and again and again and again. But I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think my colleague from New Hampshire \nwishes to speak. Let me take a minute before he does to respond to two \nthings that the Senator from Delaware said.\n  I find it interesting that North Korea would be used as the example \nof a country that will pursue nuclear weapons if we don't ratify the \ntest ban treaty, according to Secretary Perry.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is not what he said, if I may interrupt, if I could \nquote what he said.\n  Mr. KYL. Please do.\n  Mr. BIDEN. He said it will give North Korea ``an obvious reason not \nto ratify CTBT.'' He did not say it will give them reason to produce \nnuclear weapons.\n  Mr. KYL. I think that is a very important distinction. I thank my \ncolleague for making it because, clearly, North Korea is not going to \nbe persuaded to eschew nuclear weapons by the United States ratifying \nthe CTBT. North Korea will do whatever it wants to do regardless of \nwhat we do. That is pretty clear. To suggest that we need to ratify \nthis treaty in order to satisfy North Korea is absurd.\n  North Korea is a member of the nonproliferation treaty right now. By \ndefinition, North Korea is in violation of that treaty if it ever \ndecides to test a nuclear weapon because it would be affirming the fact \nthat it possesses a nuclear weapon which is in violation of the NPT. \nNorth Korea is not a country the behavior of which we can affect one \nway or the other by virtue of a moratorium on testing. If that were the \ncase, then North Korea would have long ago decided to forego the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons because the United States hasn't tested \nfor 8 years. Clearly, our actions have had no influence on North Korea, \nexcept to cause North Korea to blackmail the United States by \nthreatening to develop nuclear weapons and by threatening to develop \nmissiles unless we will pay them tribute. I don't think North Korea is \na very good example to be citing as a reason for the United States to \naffirm the CTBT.\n\n  Moreover, I remember this argument a couple of years ago when the \nchemical weapons treaty was being brought before the body. They said \nthis was the only way to get North Korea to sign up to the CWC, and we \ncertainly wanted North Korea to be a signatory to that treaty because \nthey might use chemical weapons someday. We ratified it. They still \nhaven't signed up--2 years later. I don't think North Korea is going to \ncare one way or the other whether the United States ratifies the CTBT.\n  To my friend's other point on the comparison between nuclear weapons \nand missile defense, I think it makes our point. Missile defenses can \nwork.\n\n[[Page S12377]]\n\n They are not easy to develop. We have seen several tests that failed \nwith the THAAD system. What it demonstrated to us was that testing is \nrequired to know that missile defense will work, just as the experts \nhave all indicated testing is the preferred method of knowing whether \nour nuclear weapons will work.\n  So I think it makes the point that either for missile defense or for \nnuclear weapons testing it is the best way to know whether it will \nwork. That is why we need to test both the missile defense systems that \nwe have in development right now, and that is why we need the option of \nbeing able to test our nuclear weapons as well.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I wish to respond, if I may. I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. KYL. We may put off the Senator from New Hampshire for a good \ntime.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I hope not.\n  My friend from Arizona, as I said, is one of the most skillful \ndebaters and lawyers in here. He never says anything that is not true. \nBut sometimes he says things that do not matter much to the argument.\n  For example, he said nuclear testing is the preferred method. It sure \nis. Flying home is a preferred method to get there. But I can get there \njust as easily and surely by taking the train. It is preferred to fly \nhome. I get home faster when I fly home. But the train gets me home. In \nfact, I can drive home. All three methods can verify for my wife that I \nhave come from Washington to my front door. They are all verifiable. \nThey all get the job done. It is the preferred method.\n  By the way, it is the preferred method to have underground testing. \nIt is the preferred method to have above-ground testing. That is the \npreferred method to make sure everything is working.\n  If I took the logic of his argument to its logical extension, I would \nsay, well, you know, my friend from Arizona wanting underground testing \nis, in fact, denying the scientists their total capacity to understand \nexactly what has happened by denying atmospheric testing. The preferred \nmethod is atmospheric testing. What difference does it make if we can \nguarantee the reliability of the weapon?\n\n  The question with regard to North Korea I pose this way: If we ratify \nthe treaty, and my friend from Arizona is correct that North Korea does \nnot, so what. There is no treaty. It does not go into force. They have \nto ratify the treaty for it to go into force. What is the problem? If a \ncountry is certain it will not matter, they are not going to ratify or \nabide. Then (a) they don't ratify, we are not in, we are not bound; (b) \nif they are in and they do a nuclear explosion underground, we are out, \naccording to the last paragraph of our amendment. The President has to \nget out of the treaty. Must--not may, must. These are what we used to \ncall in law school red herrings. They are effective but red herrings.\n  The last point, I heard people stand up on the floor and say: This \ncountry is already or is about to violate the NPT, the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, by exploding a nuclear weapon. Guess what. They \nare allowed, under the NPT, to blow up things: nuclear bombs, nuclear \nweapons, nuclear explosions. They don't call them ``weapons''; they say \nit is a nuclear explosion, as long as it is for peaceful means. How \ndoes one determine whether or not an underground test which has \nplutonium imploded and has set off a chain reaction was for peaceful, \nas opposed to nonpeaceful, means? That is a nuclear test.\n  We ought to get our facts straight. The distinctions make a \ndifference. It is true; it is hard to verify whether or not anybody \nviolated the NPT because if they are caught, that country says it was \nfor peaceful reasons, dealing with peaceful uses of their nuclear \ncapability.\n  I have heard a lot of non sequiturs today. My only point in raising \nNorth Korea was the idea that anybody who thinks we are going to be in \na position that if we turn this treaty down there is any possibility we \nwill stop testing anywhere in the world is kidding themselves.\n  I say to my colleagues, ask yourself the rhetorical question. Do you \nwant to be voting down a treaty on the day there is a coup in Pakistan. \nGood luck, folks. I am not suggesting that a vote one way or another is \ndispositive of what Pakistan would or wouldn't do. But I will \nrespectfully suggest we will be answering the rest of the year, the \nrest of the decade, whether or not what we did at that critical moment \nand what is going on between India and Pakistan and within Pakistan was \naffected by our actions.\n  I conclude by saying, in the middle of the Carter administration \nthere was a little debate about this notion of a neutron bomb. The \nAmerican Government put pressure on Helmut Schmidt, Chancellor of \nGermany at the time, to agree to deployment of the neutron bomb in \nEurope--a difficult position for him to take as a member of the SPD. He \nmade the decision, and then President Carter decided not to deploy the \nneutron bomb. I remember how upset the Chancellor of Germany was. The \nChancellor of Germany was not inclined to speak to the President of the \nUnited States.\n  I was like that little kid in the commercial with the cereal sitting \non the table. There are two 10-year-olds and a 6-year-old. The 10-year-\nold asks: Who eats that? Mom and dad. Is it any good? You try it. The \nother kid says: No, you try it. They both turn to the 6-year-old and \nsay: Mikey will try it.\n  I was ``Mikey.'' I got sent to Germany to meet with Schmidt, to sit \ndown at the little conference table in the Chancellor's office to \ndiscuss our relationship. I will never forget something Chancellor \nSchmidt said--and I will not violate any security issue; it is probably \nlong past a need to be secure--in frustration, while he was smoking his \n19th cigarette similar to Golda Meir, a chain-smoker, he pounded his \nhand on the table and said: You don't understand, Joe; when the United \nStates sneezes, Europe catches a cold. When the United States sneezes, \nEurope catches a cold.\n  When we act on gigantic big-ticket items such as a treaty affecting \nthe whole world and nuclear weapons, whether we intend it or not, the \nworld reacts. This is not a very prudent time to be voting on this \ntreaty, I respectfully suggest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from New Hampshire to \ndelay his remarks for a moment so I can make a point and perhaps ask \nSenator Biden, if he could answer a question regarding something he has \nsaid.\n  I think it is, first of all, dangerous to suggest that the Senate \ncannot do its business with respect to a treaty because a coup is \noccurring in another country. I fail to see, if the coup is occurring \ntoday and tomorrow, and we reject the CTBT, how anyone could argue our \naction precipitated this coup. Or somehow by failing to approve this \ntreaty we caused unrest in Pakistan.\n  I ask the Senator to answer that question on his own time. First, I \nmake another point. I wasn't trying to make a debater's point but \ntrying to be absolutely conservative in what I said a moment ago.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I never thought the Senator was liberal in what he said.\n  Mr. KYL. And I appreciate that more than you know.\n  When I say that testing was the preferred method, what the lab \nDirectors and former officials who have had responsibility for this \nhave said with these highly complex weapons is that testing is the \npreferred method.\n  They have also said in contradiction to the Senator from Delaware \nthat there is no certainty with respect to the other method, which is \nthe Stockpile Stewardship Program, which is not complete and has not \ngone into effect and cannot provide certainty, in any event.\n  Dr. John Foster, who chairs the congressional committee to assess the \nefficacy of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, said this in his \ntestimony last week:\n\n       I oppose ratification of the CTBT because without the \n     ability to perform nuclear weapons tests the reliability and \n     safety of our Stockpile Stewardship Program will degrade.\n\n  There is nobody who is more respected in this field than Dr. John \nFoster.\n  He further said the testing, which has been performed over the years, \n``has clearly shown our ability to calculate and simulate their \noperation is incomplete. Our understanding of their basic physics is \nseriously deficient. Hence, I can only answer that a ban on testing of \nour nuclear weapons can only have a negative impact on the reliability \nof the stockpile.''\n\n[[Page S12378]]\n\n  Dr. Robert Barker, former assistant to the Secretary of Defense for \nAtomic Energy, who reported the certification of the stockpile to three \nSecretaries of Defense, said:\n\n       Sustained nuclear testing is the only demonstrated way of \n     maintaining a safe and reliable deterrent. Our confidence in \n     the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons has already \n     declined since 1992, the year we deprived ourselves of the \n     nuclear testing tool. It should be of grave concern to us \n     that this degradation in confidence cannot be quantified.\n\n  The point is that the reason testing is preferred is because it is \nthe only demonstrable way of assuring ourselves of the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear stockpile. There could be, may be, in a \ndecade or so, some additional confidence or assurance through a \nsuccessful Stockpile Stewardship Program but we won't know that until \nthe time. Until then, that is why testing is the preferred method. It \nis the only way to assure the safety and reliability of our stockpile.\n  To respond to that and to respond to the first question I asked, I am \nhappy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will try to respond briefly.\n  No. 1, to suggest our actions would affect the international \ncommunity should not be taken in the context and consideration of what \nis happening in the international community is naive in the extreme. It \nis not suggesting anyone should dictate what we should or should not \ndo. It is suggesting that it makes sense to take into consideration \nwhat is happening around the world and what appropriate or \ninappropriate conclusion from our action will be drawn by other \ncountries. We have always done that in our undertakings around the \nworld. It is just responsible stewardship of our national security.\n\n  The suggestion was not that because there is a coup, failure to \nratify this treaty, turning it down or ratifying it would have affected \nthat coup. That is not the issue. The issue is there is a struggle \ntoday within Pakistan, evidenced by the coup, as there was within \nIndia, as evidenced by their recent elections, about what they should \ndo with their nuclear capacity, whether they should test further, \nenhance it, and deploy it, or whether or not they should refrain from \ntesting and sign the treaty.\n  The only point I am making is that our actions will impact upon that \ndebate within those countries. The debate happens to be taking place in \nthe context of a military coup right now in Pakistan. It took place in \nthe context of an election where the BJP won and made significant gains \nin India just last week, but it does impact upon that.\n  We lose any leverage we have to impose upon Pakistan, which still \nwants to deal with us, still relies upon us or interfaces with us in a \nnumber of areas in terms of food, trade, and aid all the way through to \nmilitary relationships. It does make a difference if we are able to say \nto them, I posit: We want you to refrain from testing and sign on to \nthis treaty if, in fact, we have done it. If we say: We want you to \nrefrain from testing and sign on to the treaty, but by the way, we \nalready have 6,000 of these little things and we are going to test \nourselves, it makes it very difficult to make that case.\n  Lastly, I say with regard to Pakistan, it is not so much what anyone \nwill be able to prove; it will be what will be asserted. We all know in \npolitics what is asserted is sometimes more important than what is \nprovable. It should not be, but it is. It does have ramifications \ndomestically and internationally, I suggest.\n  Also, with regard to this issue of the preferred versus the only \nmethod by which we can guarantee the reliability of our stockpile, \nnobody, including the present lab Directors, suggests that our present \nstockpile is, in fact, unreliable or not safe.\n  We have not tested since 1992. The issue is, and my colleague knows \nthis, the intersection--and it is clear if we do not test, if we do \nnothing to the stockpile, it will over time degrade, just like my \nfriend and I as we approach our older years, as a matter of medical \nfact, our memories fade. It is a medical fact.\n  To suggest that because our memories fade we should not listen to \nsomeone on the floor who is 8 years older than someone else would be \nviewed by everyone as mildly preposterous because when that older \nperson was younger, their memory may have been so far superior to the \nperson who is younger now that they still have a better memory. It does \nnot make a point. It is a distinction without a difference.\n  It is the same way with regard to our stockpile degrading. At what \npoint does the degradation occur that it is no longer reliable? I asked \nthat of Secretary Schlesinger. He said he thinks we are down from 99 \npercent to about 85 percent now, and he thinks there is no worry at \nthat 85-percent level. But what he worries about, and then he held up a \nlittle graph and the graph showed based on years and amount of \nreliability this curve going down like this, at the same time there was \na dotted line showing the Stockpile Stewardship Program and how that \nmirrored that ability to intersect with where we would intersect \nour confidence that our Stockpile Stewardship Program would be able to \nassure that the stockpile was reliable.\n\n  It comes around where the shelf life of these weapons occur about 10 \nyears out. Everyone has said that between now and then, the \noverwhelming body of opinion is, from the Jason Group to other leading \nscientists, including these 32 Nobel laureates in physics, the \nStockpile Stewardship Program is working now and will if we make the \ncommitment to intersect at a point where the shelf life begins to \nchange where it continues to guarantee.\n  We are never going to be in that line where it is so degraded that \nany lab Director will have to say: Mr. President, I cannot certify \nanymore.\n  But as a fail safe, no pun intended, for that possibility--that is \nwhy the amendment was just adopted--the amendment says in the last \nparagraph, if that happens and a lab Director tells the President that \nhas happened and it cannot certify in terms of reliability, the \nPresident must get out of the treaty.\n  It is true; we are stringing together a lot of true statements that \nare not particularly relevant to the question, and the question is: Is \nour stockpile now reliable and safe? Is it a deterrent still? Do other \npeople believe it? Is it a deterrent so that our allies believe it and \nthey do not go nuclear, such as Japan and Germany? And is it a \ndeterrent so that our potential enemies, such as China and Russia and \nothers, believe it so they will not try to do anything that will \njeopardize our security? That is the second question.\n  The third question is: Are we able to verify this?\n  My answer to all three of those questions is, yes, yes, yes. And the \nanswer of the overwhelming body of opinion is yes, yes, yes. But just \nin case it is no, the President has to get out. He has to get out. We \njust adopted a condition, so he has to get out.\n  By the way, I listened to people being quoted, like Edward Teller. \nGod love him. I had the great honor of debating him around the country \non four setup debates. It was intimidating because he would stand there \nwith those bushy eyelashes and say: My young friend from Delaware does \nnot know--here is the guy who invented the hydrogen bomb. What am I \ngoing to say? Yeah, right?\n  I would listen to him, and he would even get me thinking he was right \nfor a while. Then I would listen to what he said. Last night, I watched \na documentary that is 7 or 8--actually, it is older than that; it was \nPresident Reagan's last year--on the Star Wars notion. Dr. Teller was \nsitting there, a very distinguished man, saying things like--and I will \nget the exact quote for the Record tomorrow--but he said things like: \nWe must act now because the Russians are on the verge of having a \nmissile defense capability.\n  On the verge; they were on the verge of collapsing. He is never right \nabout his predictions, so far. But he did invent the hydrogen bomb. \nThat is a big deal. I cannot argue with that. As my mother would say, \njust because you can do one thing well does not mean you can do \neverything well. If I need to blow somebody up, I want him with me. If \nI need somebody to predict to me what is going to happen in terms of \nour interest, of our adversaries, or us, he ``ain't'' the guy I am \ngoing to because he has not been right.\n  Here we are, we are going to do this weight of authority--we all \nlearned, and, again, I am not kidding when I say this. Senator Kyl is \nnot only a first-rate lawyer, he has a first-rate mind.\n\n[[Page S12379]]\n\n We both went to undergraduate school and took courses in logic. We \nlearned about the 13 logical falacies. We engage in them all the time. \nOne is the appeal of authority. I will take my authority and trump your \nauthority. I have 32 Nobel laureates. Are you going to raise me with \nsix Secretaries of Defense? I have four of the last five Chairmen of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, with what are you going to raise me? This is \ncrazy.\n  What is true is that it is better to test if you want to know for \ncertain whether weapons are reliable. I hope if I acknowledge that, he \nwill acknowledge it is better not to test on one area: If you want to \ndiscourage others from testing. Just discourage. He does not have to \nagree that it would do everything, just discourage. It is better not to \ntest.\n  If you tell your kid he cannot smoke and you are standing there \nsmoking and saying: By the way, you can't smoke, it kind of undermines \nyour credibility.\n  On the other hand, if you do not smoke--like I don't--and say to your \nkid, you can't smoke, they may smoke anyway; but one thing is for \ncertain: If you are smoking--as my friend who is presiding would say in \na different context--you might lose your moral authority to make the \ncase.\n  I think we lose our moral authority to make the case internationally \nwhen we say: By the way, we are unquestionably the most powerful \nnuclear nation in the history of the world, and in relative terms we \nare far in excess of anyone else, including the former Soviets--now the \nRussians--that the Chinese are not, as they say where I come from, a \n``patch on our trousers,'' that the Libyans and others may be able to \nget themselves a Hiroshima bomb, but they are going to have to carry it \nin a suitcase--it ``ain't'' close.\n  But I tell you what: Because we worry about our reliability--even \nthough we are going to spend $45 billion, even though we have the best \nscientists in the world, the best scientists that we can attract from \nother parts of the world--we know we can put up a shield around America \nthat can stop 10, 20, 100, 1,000 hydrogen bombs from dropping on the \nUnited States--but we believe that we have to test our nuclear weapons \nnow or be able to test them in the near term in order to be able to \nassure that we are safe and secure and that you believe we are \ncredible.\n  I will end where I began this debate a long time ago. When the \nSenator from New Hampshire and I were college kids, you used to ride \nalong--he was heading off to Vietnam--and there used to be a bumper \nsticker which said: One hydrogen bomb can ruin your day. It just takes \none. One hydrogen bomb can ruin your day.\n  We are not talking about one hydrogen bomb. No one is doubting that \n1,000 people and 15 nations in the world can develop not a hydrogen \nbomb but a nuclear bomb like the one dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \nNo doubt about that. This is not going to stop that. This isn't going \nto guarantee that because you do not, everyone has to test that. They \ncan do that without testing. We dropped it without testing it. The \nsecond one we did not test. So they can test; they cannot test.\n  But, folks, this is high-stakes poker. All I am saying to you is, you \ntake the worst case scenario my friends lay out, that we have the \nstockpile, but we cannot guarantee it, and we cannot detect testing, \nand we have an escape clause--you get out of it because the treaty is \nnot working. That is their worst case scenario. The escape clause is we \nhave to get out because it says we must get out.\n  Let me tell you my worst case scenario. My worst case scenario is we, \nin fact, do not sign this treaty, and the Chinese decide all moral \nrestraints are off--even though they are not particularly a moral \ncountry--we can now, with impunity, go and test and not be buffeted by \nworld opinion in terms of affecting our trade or our commerce and the \nrest. We can go from 16, 18, 20--however many intercontinental \nballistic missiles they have--we can now test to build lighter, smaller \nones with that information we stole from the laboratories. We can now \nMIRV our missiles.\n  The Pakistanis and the Indians agree that: Look, what we have to do \nis now deploy nuclear weapons because the restraints are off.\n  I do not know what we do with that worst case scenario. There is \nnothing the President can say, such as: By the way, stop. Out. I want \nto pull out. You all can't do that. China, you can't do that. There is \nno way out of that one.\n\n  This is not like us making the mistake on a tax bill. This is not \nlike us making a mistake on a piece of welfare or social legislation. \nWe can correct that in a day. I have been here when we passed reforms \non health care that within 6 months we repealed because we thought it \nwas a mistake.\n  You cannot legislate on this floor of the Senate a course of action \nthat the world is engaged in, a road that has been been taken down away \nfrom nonproliferation to proliferation by a piece of legislation. I \ncannot guarantee the Presiding Officer that if this passes there will \nnot be more proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  But I am prepared to bet you anything, if we reject this treaty, \nthere will be significantly more proliferation of nuclear capability \nthan there was before because there would be no restraint whatsoever on \nthe one thing every nation has to do to become a nuclear power that is \nnot already a significant nuclear power--and that is to test.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me make a couple comments and then I \nwill yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Delaware making a slight concession, \nand asking for one in return. His concession, of course, is that it is \nbetter to test. I think we would all agree it is better to test. The \nquestion is whether or not there is an adequate substitute if we do not \ntest. And upon that the jury is still out.\n  He also asked the question: Isn't it also better not to test if we \ncan persuade others not to do so by our own willingness to forego \ntesting? I think that question has actually been answered because for 8 \nyears we have had a moratorium seeking to persuade others not to test. \nDuring that time, we know of at least five countries that have tested: \nFrance, China, Russia, Pakistan, and India. So it is clear that our \nforegoing testing has not created the norm against testing that \nproponents of the treaty would like to see.\n  It is also not better to forego testing in an effort to get others to \ndo so as well if, in fact, our own stockpile would be unduly \njeopardized as a result. On that, there has been a variety of expert \nopinion testifying this past week suggesting that the reason it is \nbetter to test is precisely because we cannot confirm the safety and \nreliability of our stockpile to an adequate degree of certainty without \nthat.\n  To the question of whether or not it is a fallacy of logic to quote \nexperts, I would simply suggest that while it may not be the most \npersuasive argument in the world to quote experts in support of your \nposition, it is at least some weight of evidence. Both sides have \nengaged in that. It is true that on many of these issues there are \nopinions on both sides of the issue.\n  Dr. Edward Teller certainly is an expert in nuclear weapons design \nand on many other matters that relate to it. But let's assume he does \nnot know what he is talking about here and go to people whose job it \nwas to verify a compliance with arms control treaties.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated \nOctober 1, 1999, from Fred Eimer, Former Assistant Director of ACDA, \nthe Arms Control Agency Verification and Implementation Office, to \nSenator Helms.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 1, 1999.\n     Senator Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to express my opposition to the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Numerous experts have \n     noted that this treaty raises serious questions regarding the \n     ability of the United States to maintain our nuclear \n     deterrent. I am particularly concerned, however, that the \n     United States will be disproportionately harmed by the test \n     ban. Other nations will be able to conduct militarily \n     significant nuclear test well below the verification \n     threshold of the Treaty's monitoring system, and our own \n     unilateral capability.\n       I have listened with concern to the various claims being \n     made regarding the CTBT's\n\n[[Page S12380]]\n\n     International Monitoring System (IMS). It is important to \n     note that the IMS will have serious limitations. While many \n     in the U.S. recognize the IMS' technical limitations, it is \n     being oversold internationally as a comprehensive, effective \n     monitoring regime.\n       Supporters of the CTBT have sought to divert attention from \n     the IMS' limitations by emphasizing that the United States \n     will have its own national technical means (NTM) of \n     verification and would have the right under the Treaty to \n     request an on-site inspection. The United States cannot take \n     comfort in these claims.\n       The U.S. has stated that an effective verification system \n     ``should be capable of identifying and attributing with high \n     confidence evasively conducted nuclear explosions of about a \n     few kilotons yield in broad areas of the globe''. That degree \n     of verifiability is a goal that is not achieved now, and it \n     is far from certain that it will be met in the foreseeable \n     future. It is very unlikely that the verification system will \n     provide evidence sufficient for U.S. or collective action \n     should tests of a few kilotons yield take place.\n       The capability of the U.S. and of the International \n     Monitoring System (IMS) to detect seismic signals of possible \n     nuclear test origin can be quantified. Charts can show what \n     that capability is for the U.S. network, the current IMS and \n     a possible future IMS for all areas of the world. Thousands \n     of seismic events will be detected yearly by these systems. \n     The verification task will be to determine which, if any, of \n     these signals can be identified as being from nuclear tests.\n       The large underground tests conducted in past decades were \n     easily verified as being of nuclear origin. However, \n     identification of possible future tests in the kiloton yield \n     range in violation of a CTBT will be a daunting task in most, \n     if not all instances.\n       The relationship between detection and identification \n     depends on a number of factors that will not be known. If \n     charts are produced that purport to show the identification \n     capability for areas of interest throughout the world, those \n     charts would be a result of subjective judgements that are \n     likely to of limited and uncertain dependability.\n       You may recall that over the decades of the TTBT that there \n     was much controversy about the yields of tests that were \n     deduced from seismic signal magnitudes. This was true even \n     though the Soviet test sites were studied more than almost \n     any other part of the world and the signals in question \n     came from relatively large tests.\n       It is certain that whatever the minimum detectable yield \n     capability is of a seismic network, the verification \n     capability, that is, the ability for identification is \n     substantially worse, by as much as a factor of ten or more in \n     some instances.\n       Furthermore, possible Treaty violators can take steps to \n     make detection and identification more difficult. For \n     example, the technique of ``decoupling'', that is, testing in \n     a sufficiently large cavity, can reduce the seismic magnitude \n     of a test. Every country of concern to the United States is \n     technically capable of decoupling at least its small nuclear \n     explosions.\n       While in the past primary reliance for obtaining \n     verification related intelligence was placed on systems that \n     collected photographic, seismic and other data, the CTBT's \n     verification system includes on-site inspection (OSI). I \n     believe that the value of OSI is very limited for the CTBT.\n       The CTBT's on-site inspection regime is unlikely to provide \n     evidence of noncompliance. However, it may permit a country \n     falsely accused of a CTBT violation to help clear its name. \n     Tests large enough to be unambiguously identified do not need \n     OSI. For small tests the location of the source of the \n     seismic signals would be so uncertain, that OSI would need to \n     cover an impractical large area. Furthermore, it is highly \n     dubious that the United States would get diplomatic approval \n     for an on-site inspection since the treaty has a ``red-\n     light'' requirement that 30 of 51 members must endorse such a \n     step. The CTBT's negotiating record makes clear that an OSI \n     request would be viewed as a hostile action.\n       Furthermore, the OSI regime associated with the Treaty has \n     a number of as yet unsettled procedural and implementation \n     issues. It is possible that some of these can be fixed. \n     However, OSI has very little to offer for confirming that a \n     nuclear test has been conducted, even if these issues are \n     resolved.\n       In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the proposed treaty will put \n     our nuclear deterrent at risk without significant arms \n     control or nonproliferation benefit. Other nations will be \n     able to conduct militarily significant nuclear test well \n     below the verification threshold of the Treaty's monitoring \n     system, and our own unilateral capability.\n           Best regards.\n\n                                                   Fred Eimer,\n\n                                  Former Assistant Director, ACDA,\n                                  Verification and Implementation.\n\n  Mr. KYL. In this letter he said:\n\n       Other nations will be able to conduct militarily \n     significant nuclear tests well below the verification \n     threshold of the Treaty's monitoring system, and our own \n     unilateral capability.\n\n  In other words, the treaty is not verifiable.\n  Testifying last week, one of the experts acknowledged by Senator \nBiden, Dr. Paul Robinson, who is the Director of the Sandia National \nLaboratories, said:\n\n       The treaty bans any ``nuclear explosion,'' but \n     unfortunately, compliance with the strict zero-yield \n     requirement is unverifiable.\n\n  Finally, the third and most prominent of all experts that I would \nlike to suggest we pay some attention to with respect to verification \nis our own colleague, Senator Richard Lugar from Indiana. I ask \nunanimous consent that his press release, dated October 7, 1999, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Lugar Opposes Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\n\n       Senator Dick Lugar, a senior member of the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee, Foreign Relations Committee and \n     National Security Working Group, released the following \n     statement today announcing his position on the Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty:\n       The Senate is poised to begin consideration of the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty under a unanimous consent \n     agreement that will provide for 14 hours of general debate, \n     debate on two amendments, and a final vote on ratification.\n       I regret that the Senate is taking up the treaty in an \n     abrupt and truncated manner that is so highly politicized. \n     Admittedly, the CTBT is not a new subject for the Senate. \n     Those of us who over the years have sat on the Foreign \n     Relations, Armed Services, or Intelligence Committees are \n     familiar with it. The Senate has held hearings and briefings \n     on the treaty in the past.\n       But for a treaty of this complexity and importance a more \n     sustained and focused effort is important. Senators must have \n     a sufficient opportunity to examine the treaty in detail, ask \n     questions of our military and the administration, consider \n     the possible implications, and debate at length in committee \n     and on the floor. Under the current agreement, a process that \n     normally would take many months has been reduced to a few \n     days. Many Senators know little about this treaty. Even for \n     those of us on national security committees, this has been an \n     issue floating on the periphery of our concerns.\n       Presidential leadership has been almost entirely absent on \n     the issue. Despite having several years to make a case for \n     ratification, the administration has declined to initiate the \n     type of advocacy campaign that should accompany any treaty of \n     this magnitude.\n       Nevertheless, the Senate has adopted an agreement on \n     procedure. So long as that agreement remains in force, \n     Senators must move forward as best they can to express their \n     views and reach informed conclusions about the treaty.\n       In anticipation of the general debate, I will state my \n     reasons for opposing ratification of the CTBT.\n       The goal of the CTBT is to ban all nuclear explosions \n     worldwide: I do not believe it can succeed. I have little \n     confidence that the verification and enforcement provisions \n     will dissuade other nations from nuclear testing. \n     Furthermore, I am concerned about our country's ability to \n     maintain the integrity and safety of our own nuclear arsenal \n     under the conditions of the treaty.\n       I am a strong advocate of effective and verifiable arms \n     control agreements. As a former Vice-Chairman of the Senate \n     Arms Control Observer Group and a member of the Foreign \n     Relations Committee, I have had the privilege of managing \n     Senate consideration of many arms control treaties and \n     agreements.\n       I fought for Senate consent to ratification of the INF \n     Treaty, which banned intermediate range nuclear weapons in \n     Europe; the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, which \n     created limits on the number of tanks, helicopters, and \n     armored personnel carriers in Europe; the START I Treaty, \n     which limited the United States and the Soviet Union to 6,500 \n     nuclear weapons; the START II Treaty, which limited the U.S. \n     and the former Soviet Union to 3,500 nuclear weapons; and the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention, which outlawed poison gas.\n       These treaties, while not ensuring U.S. security, have made \n     us safer. They have greatly reduced the amount of weaponry \n     threatening the United States, provided extensive \n     verification measures, and served as a powerful statement of \n     the intent of the United States to curtail the spread of \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       I understand the impulse of the proponents of the CTBT to \n     express U.S. leadership in another area of arms \n     control. Inevitably, arms control treaties are accompanied \n     by idealistic principles that envision a future in which \n     international norms prevail over the threat of conflict \n     between nations. However, while affirming our desire for \n     international peace and stability, the U.S. Senate is \n     charged with the constitutional responsibility of making \n     hard judgments about the likely outcomes of treaties. This \n     requires that we examine the treaties in close detail and \n     calculate the consequences of ratification for the present \n     and the future. Viewed in this context, I cannot support \n     the treaty's ratification.\n       I do not believe that the CTBT is of the same caliber as \n     the arms control treaties that have come before the Senate in \n     recent decades. Its usefulness to the goal of non-\n     proliferation is highly questionable. Its likely \n     ineffectuality will risk undermining support and confidence \n     in the concept of multi-lateral arms control. Even as a \n     symbolic\n\n[[Page S12381]]\n\n     statement of our desire for a safer world, it is problematic \n     because it would exacerbate risks and uncertainties related \n     to the safety of our nuclear stockpile.\n\n\n                         STOCKPILE STEWARDSHIP\n\n       The United States must maintain a reliable nuclear \n     deterrent for the foreseeable future. Although the Cold War \n     is over, significant threats to our country still exist. At \n     present our nuclear capability provides a deterrent that is \n     crucial to the safety of the American people and is relied \n     upon as a safety umbrella by most countries around the world. \n     One of the most critical issues under the CTBT would be that \n     of ensuring the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons \n     stockpile without testing. The safe maintenance and storage \n     of these weapons is a crucial concern. We cannot allow them \n     to fall into disrepair or permit their safety to be called \n     into question.\n       The Administration has proposed an ambitious program that \n     would verify the safety and reliability of our weapons \n     through computer modeling and simulations. Unfortunately, the \n     jury is still out on the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The \n     last nine years have seen improvements, but the bottom line \n     is that the Senate is being asked to trust the security of \n     our country to a program that is unproven and unlikely to be \n     fully operational until perhaps 2010. I believe a National \n     Journal article, by James Kitfield, summed it up best by \n     quoting a nuclear scientist who likens the challenge of \n     maintaining the viability of our stockpile without testing to \n     ``walking an obstacle course in the dark when your last \n     glimpse of light was a flash of lightning back in 1992.''\n       The most likely problems facing our stockpile are a \n     result components degrade in unpredictable ways, in some \n     cases causing weapons to fail. This is compounded by the \n     fact that the U.S. currently has the oldest inventory in \n     the history of our nuclear weapons programs.\n       Over the last forty years, a large percentage of the weapon \n     designs in our stockpile have required post-deployment tests \n     to resolve problems. Without these tests, not only would the \n     problems have remained undetected, but they also would have \n     gone unrepaired. The Congressional Research Service reported \n     last year that: ``A problem with one warhead type can affect \n     hundreds of thousands of individually deployed warheads; with \n     only 9 types of warheads expected to be in the stockpile in \n     2000, compared to 30 in 1985, a single problem could affect a \n     large fraction of the U.S. nuclear force.'' If we are to put \n     our faith in a program other than testing to ensure the \n     safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent and thus our \n     security, we must have complete faith in its efficacy. The \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program falls well short of that \n     standard.\n       The United States has chosen to re-manufacture our aging \n     stockpile rather than creating and building new weapon \n     designs. This could be a potential problem because many of \n     the components and procedures used in original weapon designs \n     no longer exist. New production procedures need to be \n     developed and substituted for the originals, but we must \n     ensure that the re-manufactured weapons will work as \n     designed.\n       I am concerned further by the fact that some of the weapons \n     in our arsenal are not as safe as we could make them. Of the \n     nine weapon designs currently in our arsenal, only one \n     employs all of the most modern safety and security measures. \n     Our nuclear weapons laboratories are unable to provide the \n     American people with these protections because of the \n     inability of the Stockpile Stewardship Program to completely \n     mimic testing.\n       At present, I am not convinced the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program will permit our experts to maintain a credible \n     deterrent in the absence of testing. Without a complete, \n     effective, and proven Stockpile Stewardship Program, the CTBT \n     could erode our ability to discover and fix problems with the \n     nuclear stockpile and to make safety improvements.\n       In fact, the most important debate on this issue may be an \n     honest discussion of whether we should commence limited \n     testing and continue such a program with consistency and \n     certainty.\n\n\n                              verification\n\n       President Reagan's words ``trust but verify'' remain an \n     important measuring stick of whether a treaty serves the \n     national security interests of the United States. The U.S. \n     must be confident of its ability to detect cheating among \n     member states. While the exact thresholds are classified, it \n     is commonly understood that the United States cannot detect \n     nuclear explosions below a few kilotons of yield. The \n     Treaty's verification regime, which includes an international \n     monitoring system and on-site inspections, was designed to \n     fill the gaps in our national technical means. Unfortunately, \n     the CTBT's verification regime will not be up to that task \n     even if it is ever fully deployed.\n       Advances in mining technologies have enabled nations to \n     smother nuclear tests, allowing them to conduct tests with \n     little chance of being detected. Similarly, countries can \n     utilize existing geologic formations to decouple their \n     nuclear tests, thereby dramatically reducing the seismic \n     signal produced and rendering the test undetectable. A recent \n     Washington Post article points out that part of the problem \n     of detecting suspected Russian tests at Novaya Zemlya is that \n     the incidents take place in a large granite cave that has \n     proven effective in muffling tests.\n       The verification regime is further bedeviled by the lack of \n     a common definition of a nuclear test. Russia believes hydro-\n     nuclear activities and sub-critical experiments are permitted \n     under the treaty. The U.S. believes sub-critical experiments \n     are permitted but hydro-nuclear tests are not. Other states \n     believe both are illegal. A common understanding or \n     definition of what is and what is not permitted under the \n     treaty has not been established.\n       Proponents point out that if the U.S. needs additional \n     evidence to detect violations, on-site inspections can be \n     requested. Unfortunately, the CTBT will utilize a red-light \n     inspection process. Requests for on-site inspections must be \n     approved by at least 30 affirmative votes of members of the \n     Treaty's 51-member Executive Council. In other words, if the \n     United States accused another country of carrying out a \n     nuclear test, we could only get an inspection if 29 other \n     nations concurred with our request. In addition, each country \n     can declare a 50 square kilometer area of its territory as \n     off limits to any inspections that are approved.\n       The CTBT stands in stark contrast to the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention in the area of verifiability. Whereas the CTBT \n     requires an affirmative vote of the Executive Council for an \n     inspection to be approved, the CWC requires an affirmative \n     vote to stop an inspection from proceeding. Furthermore, the \n     CWC did not exclude large tracts of land from the inspection \n     regime, as does the CTBT.\n       The CTBT's verification regime seems to be the embodiment \n     of everything the United States has been fighting against in \n     the UNSCOM inspection process in Iraq. We have rejected \n     Iraq's position of choosing and approving the national origin \n     of inspectors. In addition, the 50 square kilometer \n     inspection-free zones could become analogous to the \n     controversy over the inspections of Iraqi presidential \n     palaces. The UNSCOM experience is one that is best not \n     repeated under a CTBT.\n\n\n                              enforcement\n\n       Let me turn to some enforcement concerns. Even if the \n     United States were successful in utilizing the laborious \n     verification regime and non-compliance was detected, the \n     Treaty is almost powerless to respond. This treaty simply has \n     no teeth. Arms control advocates need to reflect on the \n     possible damage to the concept of arms control if we embrace \n     a treaty that comes to be perceived as ineffectual. Arms \n     control based only on a symbolic purpose can breed cynicism \n     in the process and undercut support for more substantive and \n     proven arms control measures.\n       The CTBT's answer to illegal nuclear testing is the \n     possible implementation of sanctions. It is clear that this \n     will not prove particularly compelling in the decision-making \n     processes of foreign states intent on building nuclear \n     weapons. For those countries seeking nuclear weapons, the \n     perceived benefits in international stature and deterrence \n     generally far outweigh the concern about sanctions that could \n     be brought to bear by the international community.\n       Further, recent experience has demonstrated that enforcing \n     effective multilateral sanctions against a country is \n     extraordinarily difficult. Currently, the United States is \n     struggling to maintain multilateral sanctions on Iraq, a \n     country that openly seeks weapons of mass destruction and \n     blatantly invaded and looted a neighboring nation, among \n     other transgressions. If it is difficult to maintain the \n     international will behind sanctions on an outlaw nation, how \n     would we enforce sanctions against more responsible nations \n     of greater commercial importance like India and Pakistan?\n       In particularly grave cases, the CTBT Executive Council can \n     bring the issue to the attention of the United Nations. \n     Unfortunately, this too would most likely prove ineffective, \n     given that permanent members of the Security Council could \n     veto any efforts to punish CTBT violators. Chances of a \n     better result in the General Assembly are remote at best.\n       I believe the enforcement mechanisms of the CTBT provide \n     little reason for countries to forego nuclear testing. Some \n     of my friends respond to this charge by pointing out that \n     even if the enforcement provisions of the treaty are \n     ineffective, the treaty will impose new international norms \n     for behavior. In this case, we have observed that ``norms'' \n     have not been persuasive for North Korea, Iraq, Iran, India \n     and Pakistan, the very countries whose actions we seek to \n     influence through a CTBT.\n       If a country breaks the international norm embodied in the \n     CTBT, that country has already broken the norm associated \n     with the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Countries other than \n     the recognized nuclear powers who attempt to test a weapon \n     must first manufacture or obtain a weapon, which would \n     constitute a violation of the NPT. I fail to see how an \n     additional norm will deter a motivated nation from developing \n     nuclear weapons after violating the longstanding norm of the \n     NPT.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       On Tuesday the Senate is scheduled to vote on the \n     ratification of the CTBT. If this vote takes place, I believe \n     the treaty should be defeated. The Administration has failed \n     to make a case on why this treaty is in our national security \n     interests.\n       The Senate is being asked to rely on an unfinished and \n     unproven Stockpile Stewardship Program. This program might \n     meet our needs in the future, but as yet, it is not close\n\n[[Page S12382]]\n\n     to doing so. The treaty is flawed with an ineffective \n     verification regime and a practically nonexistent enforcement \n     process.\n       For these reasons, I will vote against ratification of the \n     CTBT.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Let me quote three or four lines from it.\n  He said:\n\n       If we are to put our faith in a program other than testing \n     to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent \n     and thus our security, we must have complete faith in its \n     efficacy. The Stockpile Stewardship Program falls well short \n     of that standard. . . .\n       At present, I am not convinced the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program will permit our experts to maintain a credible \n     deterrent in the absence of testing.\n\n  He goes on the say:\n\n       Unfortunately, the CTBT's verification regime will not be \n     up to that task even if it is ever fully deployed.\n\n  He concludes his statement with this paragraph:\n\n       The Senate is being asked to rely on an unfinished and \n     unproven Stockpile Stewardship Program. This program might \n     meet our needs in the future, but as yet, it is not close to \n     doing so. The treaty is flawed with an ineffective \n     verification regime and a practically nonexistent enforcement \n     process.\n       For these reasons, I will vote against ratification of the \n     CTBT.\n\n  So spoke Senator Richard Lugar. I do not suggest that any of us here \nin the Senate are as expert as other people I have quoted, but \ncertainly Senator Lugar has a reputation for being a very serious and \nwell-informed student of arms control issues, a proponent of arms \ncontrol treaties. When he says, as he did with respect to this treaty, \nthat it is simply not of the same caliber as other arms control \ntreaties for the variety of reasons he expresses in his release, I \nthink all of us should pay serious attention to that.\n  Madam President, it is now my pleasure, at long last, to turn to the \nSenator from New Hampshire, who has been very patient in waiting for \nSenator Biden and me to conclude.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I won't take the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield to Senator Biden and then have a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I want to print in the Record, without \ntaking the time from the Senator from New Hampshire, some other quotes \nfrom Dr. Robinson from his testimony on October 7, 1999. I ask \nunanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nWritten Testimony of Dr. Paul Robinson to the Armed Services Committee, \n                              Oct. 7, 1999\n\n       Nuclear effects tests carried out in underground test \n     chambers were always a compromise to the actual conditions \n     that warheads would experience in military use. Thus, this is \n     not the first time that we have been challenged to do the \n     best job simulating phenomena which cannot be achieved \n     experimentally.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. As well, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record \nquotes from the October 7 testimony of Dr. Robinson, Dr. Tarter, Dr. \nTarter again, Dr. Browne, Dr. Robinson, Mr. Levin, Dr. Robinson, Dr. \nRobinson, Dr. Tarter, Dr. Tarter and Dr. Browne; it is an exchange.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nLab Directors' Written Testimony--Key Quotes on Stockpile Stewardship, \n           October 7, 1999, Armed Services Committee Hearing\n\n       Dr. Robinson, Page 5:\n       I believed then, as I do now, that it may be possible to \n     develop the Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship approach as a \n     substitute for nuclear testing for keeping previously tested \n     nuclear weapons designs safe and reliable.\n       Dr. Tarter, Page 1:\n       The bottom line remains the same as it has been in my \n     previous testimonies before this Committee. Namely, that a \n     strongly supported, sustained Stockpile Stewardship Program \n     has an excellent chance of ensuring that this nation can \n     maintain the safety, security, and reliability of the \n     stockpile without nuclear testing.\n       Dr. Tarter, Page 4:\n       In December 1998, we completed the third annual \n     certification of the stockpile for the President and were \n     able to conclude that nuclear tests were not required at this \n     time to assure the safety and reliability of the nation's \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Dr. Brown, Page 1:\n       I am confident that a fully supported and sustained program \n     will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear \n     deterrent without nuclear testing.\n       Senator Levin. . . . what you are telling us is that if \n     this safeguard and the other safeguards are part of this \n     process that you can rely on . . ., Dr. Robinson, you are on \n     board in terms of this treaty; is that correct?\n       Dr. Robinson. I am on board that science-based stockpile \n     stewardship has a much higher chance of success and I will \n     accept it as the substitute.\n       Senator Levin. For what?\n       Dr. Robinson. I still had other reservations about the \n     treaty--\n       Senator Levin. As a substitute for what?\n       Dr. Robinson. As a substitute for requiring yield tests for \n     certification.\n       Senator Levin. Dr. Tarter?\n       Senator Tarter. A simple statement again: It is an \n     excellent bet, but it is not a sure thing.\n       Senator Levin. My question is are you on board, given these \n     safeguards?\n       Senator Tarter. I can only testify to the ability of \n     stockpile stewardship to do the job. It is your job about the \n     treaty.\n       Senator Levin. Are you able to say that, providing you can \n     rely on safeguard F and at some point decide that you cannot \n     certify it, that you are willing under that condition to rely \n     on this stewardship program as a substitute for actual \n     testing?\n       Senator Tarter. Yes.\n       Senator Levin. Dr. Browne?\n       Senator Browne. Senator Levin, if the government provides \n     us with the sustained resources, the answer is yes, and if \n     safeguard F is there, yes.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair, my colleagues, and my friend from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord, at a cost of $3,228.00, a series of decision briefs and \nnewspaper articles on the subject of the test ban treaty.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Center for Security Policy, Oct. 11, 1999]\n\n                      Decision Brief No. 99-D 107\n\n\n c.t.b.t. truth or consequences #1: a safe, reliable nuclear deterrent \n            demands periodic, realistic underground testing\n\n       (Washington, D.C.): In various series settings over the \n     past few days, President Clinton has made a number of \n     pronouncements about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the \n     hope of selling it to an unreceptive U.S. Senate. Many of his \n     statements are misleading, some simply inaccurate; not a few \n     fall into both categories.\n       Fortunately, the hearings held in the Senate Armed Services \n     and Foreign Relations Committees last week provided needed \n     rebuttals from respected former Cabinet and sub-Cabinet \n     officers and other authorities. As a contribution to the \n     Senate's deliberations, the Center offers highlights of these \n     expert witnesses' testimony and other relevant information to \n     help correct the record.\n       President Clinton: ``Our experts have concluded that we \n     don't need more tests to keep our own nuclear forces \n     strong.''\n       The Truth: The ``experts'' President Clinton cites may feel \n     as he claims they do, but if so, they are ignoring historical \n     experience and indulging in wishful thinking of the most \n     dangerous kind. The more responsible among them make clear \n     that their ``confidence'' in being able to keep the U.S. \n     nuclear forces not only ``strong'' but safe and reliable is \n     highly conditional--dependent upon an as-yet incomplete, \n     unproven Stockpile Stewardship Program being fully funded for \n     at least a decade (at a total cost of $45 billion or more) \n     and no problems that would require testing to correct \n     developing in the meantime. For example, Dr. John Browne, the \n     current Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory told \n     the Armed Services Committee last week:\n       ``The issue that we face is whether we will have the \n     people, the capabilities and the national commitment to \n     maintain this confidence in the stockpile in the future, when \n     we expect to see more significant changes. Although we are \n     adding new tools each year, the essential tool kits for \n     stockpile stewardship will not be complete until sometime in \n     the next decade.''\n       Last week's testimony, moreover, made clear the views of \n     other ``experts'' who believe that the American deterrent \n     cannot be kept safe and relialbe--let alone strong--without \n     periodic, realistic underground nuclear tests. These include \n     the following:\n       Dr. James Schlesinger, former Secretary of Energy under \n     President Carter (as well as former Secretary of Defense, \n     Director of the CIA and Chairman of the Atomic Energy \n     Commission): ``In the absence of testing, confidence in the \n     reliability of the stockpile will inevitably, ineluctably \n     decline. In the seen years since our last test, confidence \n     has declined. It is declining today and will continue to \n     decline. . . .\n       ``Why is such a decline in confidence unavoidable? Our \n     nuclear weapons are highly sophisticated devices composed of \n     thousands of components that must operate with split-second \n     timing and with scant margin for error. Weapons are also \n     radioactive, and thus subject to radioactive decay and \n     chemical decomposition. Other components will age and will \n     fail. All of the components must ultimately be replaced due \n     to changes in material, changes in regulations, the \n     disappearance of manufacturers, the changing of processes. \n     That replacement can never be perfect.''\n\n[[Page S12383]]\n\n       Former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger: ``If we need \n     nuclear weapons, we have to know that they will work. That is \n     the essence of their deterrence. If there is uncertainty \n     about that, the deterrent capability is weakened. The only \n     assurance that you could have that they will work is to test \n     them, and the only way to test them is the most effective way \n     to test them.''\n       ``Since [U.S.] testing ended [in 1992] there have been no \n     weapons ``red-lined'' [i.e., removed from operational status \n     for safety and/or reliable reasons]. The assumption seems to \n     be that since we stopped testing everything's fine. Well, I \n     can't share that assumption, I don't think that's correct, \n     and I don't want to take a chance. You just aren't allowed \n     any margin for error in this business. And this treaty gives \n     a very large margin for error.''\n       ``And all of the discussion in other committees and a great \n     deal of the discussion in public has been an attempt to show \n     that the stockpile stewardship program will be an effective \n     way of testing them, although everyone agrees it's not as \n     effective as testing them in the way that we have done in the \n     past with underground explosions, with all precautions to \n     prevent any of the escape of the material into the \n     atmosphere.\n       ``You will have all kinds of statements made that the \n     stewardship stockpile program will be able to be tested by \n     computer modeling. We've had some less than reassuring \n     statements that the computers that can do this best will be \n     available in 2005 or 2008, which is a tacit admission that in \n     the meantime, the stockpile stewardship program, as it's \n     presently constituted, is not an effective way of testing. \n     And the only way to be sure that these weapons will work and \n     will be able to do their horribly lethal task is to test them \n     and test them in the most effective way possible.''\n       Admiral Henry Chiles, President Clinton's former Commander-\n     in-Chief, U.S. Strategic Forces Command: `'We are going to \n     have to remove and replace almost all, if not all, of the \n     non-nuclear components in those weapons with newly designed \n     components. The older components are not available. They were \n     originally manufactured by technologies that are obsolete, \n     and they are not supported in our evolving industrial base. \n     And without testing I know of no other engineering unit of \n     comparable complexity that anyone would consider safe and \n     reliable in a modern world.''\n       Dr. Paul Robinson, the current Director of the Sandia \n     National Laboratory: ``I can state with no caveats that to \n     confirm the performance of high-tech devices--cars, \n     airplanes, medical diagnostics, computers or nuclear \n     weapons--testing is the preferred methodology . . . actually \n     nuclear testing of the entire system. . . . To forego testing \n     is to live with an uncertainty. And the question is, what is \n     the risk, can one bound the uncertainty, and how does that \n     work out?''\n       ``In the past, we used to change out the nation's nuclear \n     weapons about eight to 10 years; we would replace an old \n     design with a completely new design at that point in time. \n     And so we had really very little effects due to aging of the \n     system sitting in there. Today the stockpile is the oldest \n     one we've ever had in the 54-year history of the program, so \n     we're watching for new effects due to aging that we haven't \n     seen before.''\n       Dr. John Nuckles, former Director of the Lawrence Livermore \n     National Laboratory under President Clinton: ``It cannot be \n     assured that the powerful computational and experimental \n     capabilities of the Stockpile Stewardship program will \n     increase confidence and reliability. Improved understanding \n     may reduce confidence in the estimates to performance margins \n     and reliability if fixes and validations are precluded by the \n     CTBT.''\n       ``The SSP will probably succeed in finding undetected \n     stockpile defects and in narrowing the major gaps in our \n     understanding of nuclear weapons which have eluded 50 years \n     of nuclear testing. Nuclear testing would then be required to \n     confirm this new understanding and validate the resulting \n     stockpile fixes.''\n       Dr. Troy Wade, former Assistant Secretary of Energy for \n     Defense Programs and nuclear bomb designer: ``Nuclear weapons \n     are not like artillery shells. You cannot store them in a \n     bottle or building and then get them whenever the exigencies \n     of the situation prompt you to do so. Nuclear weapons are \n     very complicated assemblies that require continued vigilance \n     to assure reliability and safety.\n       ``It is, therefore, a first-order principle that nuclear \n     weapons that are now expected to be available in the enduring \n     stockpile for much longer than was contemplated by the \n     designers, will require enhanced vigilance to continue to \n     ensure safety and reliability.\n       ``I am a supporter, only because I believe it is a way to \n     develop the computational capability to assure the annual \n     certification process for warheads, that have not changed, or \n     for which there is no apparent change. For nuclear weapons \n     that do not fit that category, stockpile stewardship is \n     merely--as we say in Nevada--a crap shoot. Nuclear testing \n     has always been the tool necessary to maintain, with high \n     confidence, the reliability and safety of the stockpile. I \n     believe this treaty would remove the principle tool from the \n     tool chests of those responsible for assuring safety and \n     reliability.''\n       ``Maintaining the nuclear deterrence of the United States, \n     without permitting needed testing, is like requiring the \n     local ambulance service to guarantee 99 percent reliability \n     any time the ambulance is requested, but with a provision \n     that the ambulance is never to be started until the call \n     comes. I believe this is a patently absurd premise.''\n       Dr. Robert Barker, former Assistant for Atomic Energy to \n     Secretaries of Defense Weinberger, Carlucci and Cheney and a \n     nuclear weapon designer: ``There are nine weapons in the \n     continuing inventory; only three of those weapons have the \n     three modern safety features of enhanced nuclear detonation \n     safety, the fire resistant pit and insensitive high \n     explosive. Three of the systems in the continuing inventory \n     have only one of those features.\n       ``Now, I believe to freeze an inventory in place in which \n     every weapon is not as safe as it could be is unconscionable. \n     I think that is a decision that the Senate really needs to \n     take on and ask itself whether it is comfortable with making \n     a decision to freeze the stockpile in a situation in which it \n     is less safe than it could be. Should an accident happen, the \n     loss of life, loss of property, as a result of not having \n     included--it could have been precluded by the inclusion of \n     one of these features--who is it that will take the credit or \n     take the blame for that? I think any prudent program that \n     called for a cessation in testing would have made sure that \n     every weapon in the inventory was as safe as it could be \n     before such a step was taken.\n\n                            The bottom line\n\n       In his testimony before the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee, Secretary Schlesinger cited remarks made by Dr. \n     Victor Reis, President Clinton's erstwhile Assistant \n     Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs and architect of the \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program, in a speech delivered before \n     he left office to the Sandia National Laboratory:\n       ``Think about [the challenge of the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program]. We are asking to maintain forever an incredibly \n     complex device no larger than this podium, filled with exotic \n     radioactive materials, that must create, albeit briefly, \n     temperatures and pressures only seen in the nature of the \n     center of stars. Do it without an integrating nuclear test \n     and without any reduction in extraordinarily high standards \n     of safety and reliability. And while you're at it, downsize \n     the industrial complex that supports this enterprise by a \n     factor of two and stand up critical new manufacturing \n     processes; this, within an industrial system that was \n     structured to turn over new designs every 15 years and for \n     which the nuclear explosive testing was the magic tool for \n     demonstrating success.''\n       Dr. Schlesinger observed dryly: ``Now, this challenge was \n     laid down by the architect of the SSP. He understood the \n     risks. The only thing that he might add to that statement is \n     that, in order to validate the SSP, we would require nuclear \n     testing.''\n       The ineluctable reality is that the United States has \n     already run potentially grave risks by not testing its aging \n     arsenal for the past seven years. It perpetuates this \n     moratorium--let alone making it a permanent, international \n     obligation--at its peril.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Decision Brief No. 99-D 108\n\n\nc.t.b.t. Truth or Consequences #2: This Treaty is Unverifiable--It May \n          Make Monitoring Others' Nuke Programs More Difficult\n\n       (Washington, D.C.): In a daily drumbeat of remarks aimed at \n     selling the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to an \n     unreceptive Senate, President Clinton has repeatedly made the \n     claim that this treaty is ``effectively verifiable.'' While \n     he and his subordinates acknowledge that all testing will not \n     actually be detectable, they insist that any that would \n     undermine our nuclear deterrent would be picked up by U.S. \n     and/or international monitoring systems--the latter, the \n     CTBT's proponents assert, representing a significant \n     augmentation of the former. For example, Mr. Clinton recently \n     declared: ``The treaty will also strengthen our ability to \n     monitor if other countries are engaged in suspicious \n     activities through global chains of sensors and on-site \n     inspections, both of which the treaty provides for.''\n\n                               The truth\n\n       Fortunately, authoritative testimony in the Senate \n     Intelligence, Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees \n     last week provided needed rebuttals to such claims. While the \n     most sensitive of that testimony was taken by the \n     Intelligence Committee in closed session, an invaluable \n     summary was provided by the Chairman of the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), in an \n     appearance before the Foreign Relations Committee on 7 \n     October. Highlights of Chairman Shelby's authoritative \n     statement include the following:\n       ``It's my considered judgment, as chairman of the \n     Intelligence Committee, based on a review of the intelligence \n     analysis and on testimony this week from the intelligence \n     community's senior arms control analyst, that it's impossible \n     to monitor compliance with this treaty with the confidence \n     that the Senate should demand before providing its advice and \n     consent for ratification.\n       ``I'm not confident that we can now or can in the \n     foreseeable future detect any and all nuclear explosions \n     prohibited under the treaty. While I have a greater degree of \n     confidence in our ability to monitor higher-yield explosions \n     in known test sites, I have markedly less confidence in our \n     capabilities to monitor lower-yield and/or evasively \n     conducted tests, including tests that may enable states to \n     develop new nuclear weapons or improve existing weapons.\n\n[[Page S12384]]\n\n       ``At this point, I should point out too that while the \n     proponents of the treaty have argued that it will prevent \n     nuclear proliferation, the fact is that some of the countries \n     of most concern to us--North Korea, Iran and Iraq--can \n     develop and deploy nuclear weapons without any nuclear tests \n     whatsoever.\n       ``With respect to monitoring, in July of '97, the \n     intelligence community issued a national intelligence \n     estimate entitled: `Monitoring the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty Over the Next 10 Years.' . . . The NIE was not \n     encouraging about our ability to monitor compliance with the \n     treaty or about the likely utility of the treaty in \n     preventing countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq from \n     development and fielding nuclear weapons. The NIE identified \n     numerous challenges, difficulties and credible evasion \n     scenarios that affect the intelligence community's confidence \n     in its ability to monitor compliance.\n       ``Because the details are classified and because of the \n     inherent difficulty of summarizing a very highly technical \n     analysis covering a number of different countries and a \n     multitude of variables, I recommend that members, including \n     the members of this committee, review this document with the \n     following caution: Based on testimony before the committee \n     this week, I believe that newly acquired information requires \n     reevaluation of the 1997 estimate's assumptions and \n     underlying analysis on certain key issues. The revised \n     assumptions and analysis appear certain to lead to even more \n     pessimistic conclusions.''\n       ``Many proponents of the treaty place their faith, in \n     monitoring aids provided under the treaty such as the \n     International Monitoring System--IMS--a multinational seismic \n     detection system, and the CTBT's On-Site Inspection regime--\n     OSI. Based on a review of the structure, likely capabilities \n     and procedures of these international mechanisms, neither of \n     which will be ready to function for a number of years, and \n     based on the intelligence community's own analysis and \n     statements, I'm concerned that these organizations will be of \n     at best limited, if not marginal margin.\n       ``I believe this IMS will be technically inadequate. For \n     example, it was not designed to detect evasively conducted \n     tests which, if you are Iraq or North Korea, are precisely \n     the kind you're going to conduct. It was designed, as you \n     know with diplomatic sensitivities rather than effective \n     monitoring in mind. And it will be eight to 10 years before \n     the system is complete.\n       ``Because of these factors and for other technical reasons, \n     I'm afraid that the IMS is more likely to muddy the waters by \n     injecting questionable data into what will inevitably be \n     highly charged political debate over possible non-compliance. \n     As a result, the value of more accurate, independently \n     obtained U.S. information will be undermined, making it more \n     difficult for the U.S. to make its case for noncompliance if \n     it were to become necessary.\n       ``And with respect to on-site inspection, I believe that \n     the on-site inspection regime invites delay and confusion. \n     For example, while U.S. negotiators originally sought an \n     automatic green light for on-site inspections as a result of \n     the opposition of the People's Republic of China, now, the \n     regime that was adopted allows inspections only with the \n     approval of 30 of the 51 countries on the executive \n     committee. Members of the Committee will appreciate the \n     difficulty of rounding up the votes for such a supermajority.\n       ``I am also deeply troubled by the fact that the inspected \n     party has a veto, a veto over including U.S. inspectors on an \n     inspection team and the right of the inspected party to \n     declare areas up to 50 kilometers off limits to inspection. I \n     understand these provisions mirror limitations sought by \n     Saddam Hussein on the UNSCOM inspectors, which leads me to \n     believe that some of the OSI standards could be what's cut \n     out for Iraq. As a result of these and other hurdles even \n     if inspectors do eventually get near the scene of a \n     suspicious event, the evidence, which is highly \n     perishable, may well have vanished.\n       In addition to Sen. Shelby's summary of the information \n     available to the Intelligence Committee, Dr. Kathleen \n     Bailey--a highly respected former Associate Director of the \n     Arms Control and Disarmament Agency--added the following \n     points in her testimony before the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee:\n       ``The international monitoring system of the CTBT is \n     designed or is capable of detecting greater than one kiloton \n     of nuclear yield for a non-evasively conducted test. So, if \n     Russia or someone else decides to conduct a test evasively, \n     the IMS system will probably not be able to detect it.\n       ``This is because there are various techniques that can be \n     used to basically mask the fact that you tested. One of the \n     most widely known is called decoupling, and I would here rely \n     on an unclassified paper I heard a CIA official present last \n     year in which he described the fact that a nation could put a \n     nuclear device in a cavity, detonate it, and essentially the \n     space around it in this cavity would muffle or mitigate the \n     sound, so that the seismic signal is reduced by as much as a \n     factor of 70. This means that a one-kiloton explosion could \n     look like only 14 tons. So it would be well below the \n     threshold of the international monitoring system.''\n\n                            The bottom line\n\n       The fact is that militarily significant covert nuclear \n     testing can--and almost certainly will--be conducted at low-\n     yields or in other ways aimed at masking the force of an \n     explosion. Unfortunately, the history of arms control is \n     riddled with examples of treaties where even clear-cut \n     violations are excused or ignored by the other parties. Just \n     as President Clinton has acknowledged a tendency on the part \n     of his Administration to ``fudge'' the facts when the \n     alternative of telling the truth will have hard policy \n     implications, the Comprehensive Test Ban will prompt this \n     government and others to take the most charitable view of \n     ambiguous data, rather than conclude the treaty has been \n     violated.\n       If anything, as Sen. Shelby has noted, the very fact that a \n     treaty is at stake will probably make it more likely, not \n     less, that U.S. intelligence will be discouraged from \n     ascertaining the true status of potentially hostile powers' \n     nuclear weapons programs and behavior that may contravene the \n     CTBT and/or the ``international norm'' it is supposed to \n     establish and promote. Far from contributing to American \n     security, the Comprehensive Test Ban would--in this fashion, \n     among others--degrade that security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Decision Brief No. 99-D 109\n\n\n C.T.B.T. Truth or Consequences #3: President Bush Did Not `Impose' a \n                 Test Moratorium--It was Imposed on Him\n\n       (Washington, DC): One of the more pernicious misstatements \n     being served up by Clinton Administration officials \n     desperately trying to induce Republican Senators to agree to \n     the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) \n     is to the effect that former President George Bush ``imposed \n     a moratorium'' on U.S. nuclear testing before leaving office. \n     The most recent such misrepresentation was made on ABC News' \n     ``This Week'' program on Sunday by Secretary of State \n     Madeleine Albright. By so doing, they transparently hope to \n     lend an otherwise almost wholly lacking patina of \n     bipartisanship to this accord.\n       The fact is that President Bush was euchred on the eve of \n     the 1992 election into accepting legislative restrictions on \n     nuclear testing that he vehemently opposed. This point was \n     made clear in testimony before the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee last week by Dr. Robert Barker, a nuclear weapon \n     designer who served as the Pentagon's top nuclear weapons \n     expert during the Reagan and Bush Administrations.\n       There should be no doubt whatsoever that President Bush and \n     the entire administration that stood behind him believed that \n     nuclear testing was necessary for the maintenance of a safe \n     and reliable stockpile. I don't believe the technical facts \n     have changed since 1993. I believe we are faced with a \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty not because the technical facts \n     have changed but because some political issues are different \n     now than were true in 1993.\n\n                        President Bush's legacy\n\n       President Bush's attitude towards nuclear testing is made \n     express in an unclassified passage from a classified report \n     he submitted to the Congress on his Administration's last \n     full day in office. This report was written to explain why \n     the Bush Administration found a statute mandating an end to \n     all U.S. nuclear testing, following a final series of \n     underground tests, to be incompatible with the national \n     security. It read, in part:\n       ``. . . The Administration has concluded that it is not \n     possible to develop a test program within the constraints of \n     Public Law 102-377 that would be fiscally, militarily and \n     technically responsible. The requirement to maintain and \n     improve the safety of U.S. forces necessitates continued \n     nuclear testing for those purposes, albeit at a modest level, \n     for the foreseeable future. The Administration strongly urges \n     the Congress to modify this legislation urgently, in order to \n     permit the minimum number and kind of underground nuclear \n     tests that the United States requires--regardless of the \n     action of other states--to retain safe and reliable, although \n     dramatically reduced, nuclear deterrent forces.''\n       The reasons for President Bush's adamant position on the \n     need to continue nuclear testing in order to assure the \n     safety and reliability of the U.S. deterrent is not hard to \n     comprehend in light of the experience described by Dr. Barker \n     in his testimony on 7 October:\n       ``During my six years in the Pentagon, from 1986 and 1992, \n     the people in the nuclear weapons laboratories were even more \n     experienced [than they are today since they] were doing \n     nuclear testing. Well, every day of any year I could go to \n     them and they would tell me my stockpile was safe, my \n     stockpile was reliable--I could count on their judgment.\n       ``Five times during that six-year period I was faced with \n     catastrophic failures in the stockpile. The Department of \n     Energy came to me on five occasions, and I found myself going \n     to Secretaries Weinberger or Carlucci or Cheney, and telling \n     them that a weapon in the inventory could not be trusted to \n     do its job. And until we did further tests those weapons were \n     basically non-operational, and we were faced with trying to \n     deal with the situation of instantaneously having a weapons \n     system not available to us . . . . In every case where a \n     change had to be made in order to fix the problem, a nuclear \n     test was required to be sure that the fix worked.''\n\n                       President Clinton's Legacy\n\n       Dr. Barker also pointed out to Senate how the Clinton \n     Administrations' ideological attachment to the idea of \n     banning all nuclear testing--without regard to the \n     implications for the safety and reliability of the \n     stockpile--had a singularly perverse effect:\n\n[[Page S12385]]\n\n       ``It's one of the great ironies that there was a thing in \n     existence back in 1993 called a test ban readiness program, \n     which called for a significant number of tests each year for \n     a decade in order to prove whether or not a scheme of \n     calculation and non-nuclear simulation would provide a \n     reliable replacement for nuclear testing. . . . That is the \n     reliable, scientific even business approach. You do not \n     change your calibration tool without comparing the results.\n       ``No business would change its accounting system without \n     verifying that the new system gave the same results of the \n     new. No scientist would change the calibration tool in his \n     laboratory without validating that the new tool gave the same \n     result as the old. And in 1993 we were embarked upon a \n     process of developing a set of tools that we could assess \n     whether or not they would prove to be a reliable replacement \n     for nuclear testing.\n       ``The cessation of nuclear testing cut that whole thing \n     off, and instead we jumped into the replacement and have \n     denied ourselves the ability to ever calibrate it if we \n     ratify this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.''\n\n                            The bottom line\n\n       No President since John F. Kennedy has voluntarily imposed \n     the kind of unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing upon \n     which Bill Clinton has insisted over the past seven years--\n     and for good reason. And President Kennedy declared when he \n     ended the three year testing moratorium he had adopted:\n       ``We know enough now about broken negotiations, secret \n     preparations and the advantages gained from a long test \n     series never to offer again an uninspected moratorium. Some \n     may urge us to try it again, keeping our preparations to test \n     in a constant state of readiness. But in actual practice, \n     particularly in a society of free choice, we cannot keep top \n     flight scientists concentrating on the preparation of an \n     experiment which may or may not take place on an uncertain \n     date in the undefined future.\n       ``Nor can large technical laboratories be kept fully alert \n     on a stand-by-basis waiting for some other nation to break an \n     agreement. This is not merely difficult or inconvenient--we \n     have explored this alternative thoroughly and found it \n     impossible of execution.''\n       The fact is that President George Bush, many of those who \n     served in senior ranks of his administration--notably, his \n     Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, his National Security \n     Advisor Brent Scowcroft and his Secretary of Energy James \n     Watkins have all expressed their opposition to this treaty--\n     and his son, George W. Bush, have formally counseled the \n     Senate against permanent unilateral and/or multilateral bans \n     on nuclear testing. This counsel should be heeded--not \n     misrepresented or ignored.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Decision Brief No. 99-D 110\n\n\nc.t.b.t. Truth or consequences #4: the zero-yield, permanent test ban's \n          pedigree is hard left, not bipartisan or responsible\n\n       (Washington, D.C.): President Clinton is fond of saying \n     that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is the \n     ``longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in the history of arms \n     control.'' He and his subordinates and other CTBT proponents \n     try, however, to confuse by whom the present, zero-yield, \n     permanent ban on all nuclear tests has been so long sought \n     and hard fought. This is not an accident. After all, as it \n     has become clear that this arms control initiative has been \n     the agenda not, as the CTBT's champions contend, for every \n     President since Dwight Eisenhower, but rather for radical, \n     left-wing anti-nuclear ideologies, its prospects for approval \n     by the Republican Senate dwindle.\n       The fact is, as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman \n     Jesse Helms has observed ``not a single president before the \n     current one has ever sought a zero-yield, indefinite duration \n     CTBT.'' Actually, every one of his predecessors rejected such \n     an approach.\n\n                       President Reagan's legacy\n\n       Particularly instructive is the forceful 1988 rejection of \n     nuclear test bans and other limitations on nuclear testing \n     beyond those currently on the books that was sent by \n     President Reagan to the Congress in September of that year. \n     The highlights of this carefully prepared, interagency-\n     approved report entitled, The Relationship between Progress \n     in Other Areas of Arms Control and More Stringent Limitations \n     on Nuclear Testing should be required reading for Senators \n     now confronting the decision whether to advise and consent to \n     the CTBT:\n\n                      The Requirement for Testing\n\n       ``Nuclear testing is indispensable to maintaining the \n     credible nuclear deterrent which has kept the peace for over \n     40 years.''\n       ``Thus we do not regard nuclear testing as an evil to be \n     curtailed, but as a tool to be employed responsibly in \n     pursuit of national security.''\n       ``The U.S. Tests neither more often nor at higher yields \n     than is required for our security.''\n       ``As long as we must depend on nuclear weapons for our \n     fundamental security, nuclear testing will be necessary.''\n\n              Why the United States Tests Nuclear Weapons\n\n       ``First, we do so to ensure the reliability of our nuclear \n     deterrent.''\n       ``Second, we conduct nuclear tests in order to improve the \n     safety, security, survivability, and effectiveness of our \n     nuclear arsenal. Testing has allowed the introduction of \n     modern safety and security features on our weapons. It has \n     permitted a reduction by nearly one-third in the total number \n     of weapons in the stockpile since 1960, as well as a \n     reduction in the total megatonnage in that stockpile to \n     approximately one-quarter of its 1960 value.''\n       ``Third, the U.S. tests to ensure we understand the effects \n     of a nuclear environment on military systems.''\n       ``Finally, by continuing to advance our understanding of \n     nuclear weapons design, nuclear testing serves to avoid \n     technological surprise and to allow us to respond to evolving \n     threat.''\n       ``These four purposes are vital national security goals. As \n     companion reports by the Departments of Defense and Energy \n     indicate, they cannot currently be met without nuclear \n     testing.''\n\n Reductions in Nuclear and/or Conventional Arms May Actually Increase \n                       U.S. Testing Requirements\n\n       ``. . . It is important to recognize that there is no \n     direct technical linkage between the size of the nuclear \n     stockpile and the requirements for nuclear testing.''\n       ``Indeed, under [an agreement providing for] deep \n     reductions in strategic offensive arms the reliability of our \n     remaining U.S. strategic weapons could be even more important \n     and the need for testing even greater. . . .''\n       ``Similarly, neither reductions in strategic offensive arms \n     themselves nor success in conventional arms reductions will \n     eliminate the third reason for U.S. nuclear testing, the \n     requirement to ensure we understand, from both an offensive \n     and defensive standpoint, the effects of the environment \n     produced by nuclear explosions on military systems. . . . \n     Even in a world with reduced strategic arms and an improved \n     balance in conventional forces, nuclear arms will exist. In \n     such a world, understanding nuclear effects would be no less \n     important.''\n\n                         Further Policy Caveats\n\n       ``. . . The U.S. recognizes that neither nuclear testing \n     nor arms control per se are ends in themselves. They are \n     tools to be employed in the interests of enhancing national \n     security.''\n       ``. . . It is clear that limitations as stringent as a \n     complete ban on tests above either 1 kiloton- or 10 kilotons-\n     yield pose serious risks and will almost certainly not prove \n     to be compatible with our overall security interests. As the \n     companion reports by the Departments of Defense and Energy \n     make clear, such limitations have exceptionally severe \n     effects on U.S. programs. In addition, we do not know how to \n     verify such yield limitations.''\n\n                            The Bottom Line\n\n       The Reagan Administration report declared in closing that \n     ``A comprehensive test ban remains a long-term objective of \n     the United States.'' It makes clear, however, that the \n     circumstances under which such a ban might be acceptable are \n     very different from those that applied at the time, or today: \n     ``We believe such a ban must be viewed in the context of a \n     time when we do not need to depend on nuclear deterrence to \n     ensure international security and stability, and when we \n     have achieved broad, deep, and effectively verifiable arms \n     reductions, substantially improved verification \n     capabilities, expanded confidence-building measures, and \n     greater balance in conventional forces.''\n       Senators being asked to consider postponing a final vote on \n     the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty should understand that the \n     practical effect of doing so would effectively be to agree \n     that--despite its incompatibility with U.S. national security \n     interests and its consistency with the sort of woolly-headed, \n     radical disarmament notions Ronald Reagan eschewed--the \n     CTBT's restraints would continue to bind the United States. \n     For, under international legal practice, unless and until a \n     nation formally gives notice of its intention not to ratify a \n     treaty, it is obliged to refrain from actions that would \n     undercut its object and purpose. Such notice should be given, \n     and promptly.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Decision Brief No. 99-D 111\n\n\n    c.t.b.t. truth or consequences #5: opposition to a zero-yield, \n        permanent test ban is rooted in substance, not politics\n\n       (Washington, D.C.).--Advocates for the Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty (CTBT) have recently engaged in a form of \n     political contortionism that would impress Houdini. Having \n     insisted on the Senate's immediate consideration of this \n     accord in time for a CTBT review conference held last week in \n     Vienna, they were initially surprised, then seemingly pleased \n     when Senate Republicans agreed two weeks ago to a fixed \n     period for debate and a near-term vote. Accordingly, every \n     single Democratic Senator and those relatively few \n     Republicans who have declared their support for the CTBT \n     agreed--obviously with the Clinton White House's blessing--to \n     a ``unanimous consent'' agreement designed to do just that. \n     In other words, when they thought they had (or could get) the \n     necessary votes, the CTBT's proponents were quite content \n     with this arrangement.\n       As it became clear that the treaty's opponents had easily \n     the 34 votes needed to defeat President Clinton's permanent, \n     zero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban, however, the \n     Administration and its allies began to complain that the \n     arrangement they had agreed to was no longer satisfactory. \n     Suddenly, they claimed the CTBT was in danger of falling \n     victim to ``partisan politics'' and that only by delaying the \n     vote would that accord receive the deliberate consideration \n     due it.\n\n[[Page S12386]]\n\n       Unfortunately for the pro-CTBT contortionists, the \n     announcement on 7 October by Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) of \n     his adamant opposition to the present Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty makes such arguments untenable. Sen. Lugar is, after \n     all, a man with a record of unwavering support for arms \n     control and unfailing willingness to pursue bipartisan \n     approaches to foreign policy issues. His closely reasoned and \n     well-researched grounds for his declared intention to vote \n     against this CTBT makes it clear that he and other like-\n     minded Senators will do so for legitimate, substantive \n     reasons.\n       Reduced to its essence, Sen. Lugar's critique--which is \n     likely to prove highly influential with other centrist \n     Senators--reads as follows:\n       ``The goal of the CTBT is to ban all nuclear explosions \n     worldwide: I do not believe it can succeed. I have little \n     confidence that the verification and enforcement provisions \n     will dissuade other nations from nuclear testing. \n     Furthermore, I am concerned about our country's ability to \n     maintain the integrity and safety of our own nuclear arsenal \n     under the conditions of the treaty.\n       ``. . . While affirming our desire for international peace \n     and stability, the U.S. Senate is charged with the \n     constitutional responsibility of making hard judgments about \n     the likely outcomes of treaties. This requires that we \n     examine the treaties in close detail and calculate the \n     consequences of ratification for the present and the future. \n     Viewed in this context, I cannot support the treaty's \n     ratification.''\n       Highlights of Senator Lugar's critique should be required \n     reading for Senators and their constituents alike:\n       Bad Arms Control: ``I do not believe that the CTBT is of \n     the same caliber as the arms control treaties that have come \n     before the Senate in recent decades. Its usefulness to the \n     goal of non-proliferation is highly questionable. Its likely \n     ineffectuality will risk undermining support and confidence \n     in the concept of multi-lateral arms control. Even as a \n     symbolic statement of our desire for a safer world, it is \n     problematic because it would exacerbate risks and \n     uncertainties related to the safety of our nuclear \n     stockpile.''\n       No Safety Net on the SSP: ``At present our nuclear \n     capability provides a deterrent that is crucial to the safety \n     of the American people and is relied upon as a safety \n     umbrella by most countries around the world. One of the most \n     critical issues under the CTBT would be that of ensuring the \n     safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile \n     without testing. The safe maintenance and storage of these \n     weapons is a crucial concern. We cannot allow them to fall \n     into disrepair or permit their safety to be called into \n     question.\n       ``. . . Unfortunately, the jury is still out on the \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program. The last nine years have seen \n     improvements, but the bottom line is that the Senate is being \n     asked to trust the security of our country to a program that \n     is unproven and unlikely to be fully operational until \n     perhaps 2010.\n       ``. . . The Congressional Research Service reported last \n     year that: `A problem with one warhead type can affect \n     hundreds of thousands of individually deployed warheads; with \n     only 9 types of warheads expected to be in the stockpile in \n     2000, compared to 30 in 1985, a single problem could affect a \n     large fraction of the U.S. nuclear force.' If we are to put \n     our faith in a program other than testing to ensure the \n     safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent and thus our \n     security, we must have complete faith in its efficacy. The \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program falls well short of that \n     standard.\n       ``. . . I am concerned further by the fact that some of the \n     weapons in our arsenal are not as safe as we could make them. \n     Of the nine weapon designs currently in our arsenal, only one \n     employs all of the most modern safety and security measures. \n     Our nuclear weapons laboratories are unable to provide the \n     American people with these protections because of the \n     inability of the Stockpile Stewardship Program to completely \n     mimic testing.\n       ``At present, I am not convinced the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program will permit our experts to maintain a credible \n     deterrent in the absence of testing. Without a complete, \n     effective, and proven Stockpile Stewardship program, the CTBT \n     could erode our ability to discover and fix problems with the \n     nuclear stockpile and to make safety improvements.''\n       An Unverifiable CTBT: ``The U.S. must be confident of its \n     ability to detect cheating among member states. While the \n     exact thresholds are classified, it is commonly understood \n     that the United States cannot detect nuclear explosions below \n     a few kilotons of yield. The Treaty's verification regime, \n     which includes an international monitoring system and on-site \n     inspections, was designed to fill the gaps in our national \n     technical means. Unfortunately, the CTBT's verification \n     regime will not be up to that task even if it is ever \n     fully deployed.''\n       ``The verification regime is further bedeviled by the lack \n     of a common definition of a nuclear test. Russia believes \n     hydro-nuclear activities and sub-critical experiments are \n     permitted under the treaty. The U.S. believes sub-critical \n     experiments are permitted but hydro-nuclear tests are not. \n     Other states believe both are illegal. A common understanding \n     or definition of what is and what is not permitted under the \n     treaty has not been established.''\n       ``The CTBT's verification regime seems to be the embodiment \n     of everything the United States has been fighting against in \n     the UNSCOM inspection process in Iraq. We have rejected \n     Iraq's position of choosing and approving the national origin \n     of inspectors. In addition, the 50 square kilometer \n     inspection-free zones could become analogous to the \n     controversy over the inspections of Iraqi presidential \n     palaces. The UNSCOM experience is one that is best not \n     repeated under a CTBT.''\n       Mission Impossible--Enforcement of the CTBT: ``Even if the \n     United States were successful in utilizing the laborious \n     verification regime and non-compliance was detected, the \n     Treaty is almost powerless to respond. This treaty simply has \n     no teeth. Arms control advocates need to reflect on the \n     possible damage to the concept of arms control if we embrace \n     a treaty that comes to be perceived as ineffectual. Arms \n     control based only on a symbolic purpose can breed cynicism \n     in the process and undercut support for more substantive and \n     proven arms control measures.\n       ``The CTBT's answer to illegal nuclear testing is the \n     possible implementation of sanctions. It is clear that this \n     will not prove particularly compelling in the decision-making \n     processes of foreign states intent on building nuclear \n     weapons. For those countries seeking nuclear weapons, the \n     perceived benefits in international stature and deterrence \n     generally far outweigh the concern about sanctions that could \n     be brought to bear by the international community.''\n       Fraudulent ``Norm'': ``I believe the enforcement mechanisms \n     of the CTBT provide little reason for countries to forego \n     nuclear testing. Some of my friends respond to this charge by \n     pointing out that even if the enforcement provisions of the \n     treaty are ineffective, the treaty will impose new \n     international norms for behavior. In this case, we have \n     observed that ``norms'' have not been persuasive for North \n     Korea, Iraq, Iran, India and Pakistan, the very countries \n     whose actions we seek to influence through a CTBT.\n       ``If a country breaks the international norm embodied in \n     the CTBT, that country has already broken the norm associated \n     with the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Countries other than \n     the recognized nuclear powers who attempt to test a weapon \n     must first manufacture or obtain a weapon, which would \n     constitute a violation of the NPT. I fail to see how an \n     additional norm will deter a motivated nation from developing \n     nuclear weapons after violating the long-standing norm of the \n     NPT.''\n\n                            The Bottom Line\n\n       The Clinton Administration's transparent intent to use the \n     CTBT as a political weapon against its critics makes Senator \n     Lugar's statesmanship and courage in opposing this treaty as \n     a matter of principle all the more commendable. Although the \n     Indiana Senator has made clear his preference not to vote on \n     the CTBT in the coming days, the substantive case he has made \n     against this accord should be dispositive to his colleagues \n     in deciding to reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty now, \n     rather than be subjected to endless political attacks until \n     such time as the Treaty is once again placed on the Senate \n     calendar.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Decision Brief No. 99-D 112\n\n\n   c.t.b.t. truth or consequences #6: Heed Past and Present Military \n             Opposition to a Zero-Yield, Permanent Test Ban\n\n       (Washington, D.C.): As the prospects for Senate rejection \n     of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on its merits \n     have grown in recent days, the Treaty's proponents have \n     become more reliant than ever on celebrity endorsements--\n     especially those it has received for retired and serving \n     senior military officers. Indeed, few advocates for the \n     present, zero-yield, permanent test ban make their case for \n     the CTBT without referring to the support it enjoys from past \n     and present members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including a \n     number of former JCS Chairmen (notably, Gen. Colin Powell).\n       Most recently, President Clinton declared in his Saturday \n     radio address: ``So I say to the Senators who haven't \n     endorsed [the CTBT], heed the best national security advice \n     of our military leaders.'' The trouble is, the best national \n     security advice of our military leaders is to reject this \n     permanent, all-inclusive test ban, not approve it.\n\n                             Which Advice?\n\n       Setting aside the singularly unimpressive job the serving \n     Chairman, Gen. Hugh Shelton, has done in his advocacy for the \n     CTBT--at his reconfirmation hearing a few weeks ago, his \n     endorsement was unintelligible; on NBC's Meet the press on 10 \n     October, he gave a statement of support for the Treaty that \n     was more articulate, but wholly inappropriate to the question \n     he was asked, not once but twice--fans of the CTBT should be \n     careful in relying too heavily upon their favorite officers \n     to sell this Treaty.\n       Consider, for example, statements that three of the most \n     prominent of these officers--General Powell, Admiral William \n     Crowe and General David Jones--during their respective stints \n     as chairmen of the Joint Chief of Staff\n       General Colin Powell, 30 September 1991: [In response to a \n     question by Senator Malcolm Wallop (R-Wy) as to how Gen. \n     Powell would respond to a Soviet proposal to halt testing.] I \n     would recommend to the Secretary and the President [that] \n     it's a condition we couldn't meet. I would recommend against \n     it. We need nuclear testing to ensure the safety, [and] \n     surety of our nuclear stockpile. As long as one has nuclear \n     weapons, you have to know what it is they will do, and so I \n     would recommend continued testing.''\n\n[[Page S12387]]\n\n       Gen. Powell, 1 December 1992: ``With respect to a \n     comprehensive test ban, that has always been a fundamental \n     policy goal of ours, but as long as we have nuclear weapons \n     we have a responsibility for making sure that our stockpile \n     remains safe. And to keep that stockpile safe, we have to \n     conduct a limited number of nuclear tests to make sure we \n     know what a nuclear weapon will actually do and how it is \n     aging and to find out a lot of other physical characteristics \n     with respect to nuclear phenomenon.\n       ``So I would like ultimately to go to a comprehensive test \n     ban, but I don't think we'll get there safely and reliably \n     until we also get rid of nuclear weapons. As long as we have \n     to conduct testing.''\n       Admiral William Crowe, 8 May 1986: [According to a \n     contemporary press report] ``Admiral William Crow, Chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a comprehensive test ban--\n     which many members of Congress have urged President Reagan to \n     negotiate with Moscow--would `introduce elements of \n     uncertainty that would be dangerous for all concerned.\n       ``Given the pressure from lawmakers for conventional \n     weapons testing, `I frankly do not understand why Congress \n     would want to suspend testing on one of the most critical and \n     sophisticated elements of our nuclear deterrent--namely the \n     warhead's he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.''\n       General David Jones per an Aviation Week article dated 29 \n     May 1978: ``General David Jones, Chairman of the Joint Chief \n     of Staff, told a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting last \n     week that he could not recommend an indefinite zero-yield \n     test ban.\n       ``He added that it is not verifiable, and that the U.S. \n     stockpile reliability could not be assured. Gen. Jones said \n     he is concerned over asymmetries that could develop through \n     an unverifiable agreement with the USSR. He told Senators he \n     is not convinced by the safeguards he has seen to date, and \n     that it would not be difficult to overcome them.''\n       Gen. Jones, according to a 27 May 1978 Washington Post \n     article: Air Force Gen. David Jones, selected by [President] \n     Carter to be chairman of the Joints chiefs, told the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee at his recent confirmation hearing \n     that ``I would have difficulty recommending a zero[-yield] \n     test ban for an extended period.''\n       It falls to these individuals and those who are interested \n     in their views to establish which position--their former ones \n     opposing an open-ended, zero-yield test ban or their present \n     ones endorsing it--actually reflect their ``best national \n     security advice.'' Suffice it to say that when they actually \n     held positions of responsibility, all three went on record in \n     favor of continued testing. Will their serving counterpart \n     and his fellow members of the JCS undergo a reverse \n     transformation after leaving office, in which capacity they \n     have endorsed the CTBT? If so, which view will represent \n     their best professional military advice (i.e., advice not \n     influenced by political judgments or considerations)?\n\n           Leading Retired Military Officers Oppose the CTBT\n\n       Senators would do well to consider the views of other \n     distinguished retired military officers. For example, in an \n     open letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott dated 9 \n     September, ten retired four-star combat commanders (Marine \n     Corps Commandant Gen. Louis H. Wilson and Assistant \n     Commandants Gens. Raymond G. Davis and Joseph J. Went; \n     Commander-in-Chief Strategic Air Command Gen.

Starry; Commanding General, Army Material Command \n     Gen. Louis C. Wagner, Jr.) joined more than forty other \n     experienced civilian and retired military policy \n     practitioners in opposition to the CTBT. They wrote, in \n     part:\n       ``We consider the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty signed by \n     President Clinton in 1996 to be inconsistent with vital U.S. \n     national interests. We believe the Senate must reject the \n     permanent ban on testing that this treaty would impose so \n     long as the Nation depends upon nuclear deterrence to \n     safeguard its security.''\n       Importantly, in a 5 October letter to Senate Armed Services \n     Committee Chairman John Warner, one of the most highly \n     regarded JCS Chairman in history, Gen. John Vessey, \n     forcefully urged the Senate to reject the present CTBT. \n     Highlight of Gen. Vessey's letter include the following:\n       ``Supporters of the CTBT argue that it reduces the chances \n     for nuclear proliferation. I applaud efforts to reduce the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons but I do not believe that \n     the test ban will reduce the ability of rogue states to \n     acquire nuclear weapons in sufficient quantities to upset \n     regional stability in various parts of the world.''\n       ``If the United States is to remain the preeminent nuclear \n     power and maintain a modern, safe, secure, reliable and \n     useable nuclear deterrent force, I believe we need to \n     continue to develop new nuclear weapons designed to \n     incorporate the latest in technology and to meet the changing \n     security situation in the world. . . . The United States, the \n     one nation most of the world looks to for securing peace in \n     the world, should not deny itself the opportunity to test the \n     bedrock building block of its security, its nuclear \n     deterrence force, if conditions require testing.''\n       ``I . . . believe that the more demonstrably modern and \n     useable is our nuclear deterrent force, the less likely are \n     we to need to use it, but we must have modern weapons, and we \n     ought not deny ourselves the opportunity to test if we deem \n     it necessary.\n\n                            The Bottom Line\n\n       The case for the Clinton Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n     fundamentally comes down to a question of ``confidence''--in \n     the judgments of those who say that they are ``confident'' in \n     the future viability of the U.S. deterrent or, alternatively, \n     in the judgment of those who warn that history suggests such \n     confidence is unwarranted in the absence of periodic, \n     realistic underground testing.\n       It should, at a minimum, shake the confidence of Senators \n     whose support for the Treaty rests substantially upon the \n     endorsement of prominent retired military leaders that those \n     leaders previously held a far more dire (not to say, \n     realistic) view of the implications of such an accord for the \n     U.S. deterrent and security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Center for Security Policy, Oct. 12, 1999]\n\n                      Decision Brief No. 99-D 112\n\n\n   C.T.B.T. Truth or Consequences #7: Realistic Explosive Testing is \n          Required to `remanufacture' Existing Nuclear Weapons\n\n       (Washington, D.C.): One of the most pernicious \n     misrepresentations being served up in recent days by the \n     proponents of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is the \n     claim that the U.S. deterrent stockpile can be maintained for \n     the indefinite future without further underground tests. \n     Since they explicitly rule out modernization of the nuclear \n     arsenal, however, the only way a stockpile comprised of \n     weapons having the highest average age in history could \n     possibly be preserved in a safe and reliable condition would \n     be if existing weapons types were to be substantially (if not \n     virtually completely) remanufactured.\n       While advocates of the zero-yield, permanent CTBT deny it, \n     neither historical experience and common sense support the \n     proposition that U.S. nuclear weapons--comprised as they are \n     of as many as 6,000 exactingly manufactured parts, made of \n     exotic and often dangerous materials and constantly exposed \n     for years to high levels of radiation--will not undergo \n     substantial changes over time. In fact as a result of such \n     factors, former Assistant Secretary of Energy Victor Reis \n     declared in congressional testimony in October 1997 that: \n     ``Just about all the parts [of those obsolescing devices] are \n     going to have to be remade.''\n\n    Why `Remaking' of the Arsenal Cannot be Effected Without Testing\n\n       There a numerous, serious problems with undertaking such a \n     program in the absence of nuclear testing. First, the \n     production lines for building the stockpile's existing bombs \n     and warheads were disassembled long ago. Reconstitution and \n     recertifying them would take quite some time, would be very \n     costly and probably won't be possible to effect with \n     confidence absent realistic, explosive nuclear testing.\n       Second, it will not be possible to replicate some of the \n     ingredients in weapons designed two decades or more ago; key \n     components are technologically obsolete and no one would \n     recommend using them when smaller, lighter, cheaper, more \n     reliable and carcinogenic materials are now the state-of-the-\n     art. In addition, federal safety and health guidelines \n     prohibit the use of some of the materials utilized in the \n     original designs.\n       Third, virtually everybody who was involved in designing \n     and proving the original designs has left the industrial and \n     laboratory complex, taking with them irreplaceable corporate \n     memory that may spell the difference between success and \n     failure in reproducing their handiwork.\n\n                   An Authoritative Historical Review\n\n       These points were underscored in an authoritative report to \n     Congress issued by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory \n     in 1987. Among its relevant highlights are the following \n     (emphasis added throughout):\n       ``It has frequently been stated that non-nuclear and very-\n     low yield (i.e., less than 1 kiloton) testing and computer \n     stimulation would be adequate for maintaining a viable \n     nuclear deterrent. A recent variant of this argument asserts \n     that while such testing and computer stimulation may be \n     insufficient for the development of new warheads, they would \n     be adequate for indefinite maintenance of a stockpile of \n     existing weapons. We believe that neither of these assertions \n     can be substantiated.\n       ``The major problem is that a nuclear explosive includes \n     such a wide range of processes and scales that it is \n     impossible to include all the relevant physics and \n     engineering in sufficient detail to provide an accurate \n     representation of the real world.''\n       ``A final proof test at the specified low-temperature \n     extreme of the W80 (Air-Launched Cruise Missile) was done as \n     the weapon was ready for deployment. The test results were a \n     complete surprise. The primary gave only a small fraction of \n     its expected yield, insufficient to ignite the secondary.\n\n[[Page S12388]]\n\n       ``Our experience with the W80 illustrates the inadequacy of \n     non-nuclear and low-yield testing and the need for full-scale \n     nuclear tests to judge the effects of small changes. Even \n     though it has been argued that such a ``thorough'' test \n     should have occurred earlier, the critical point is that \n     computer simulation, non-nuclear testing, and less-than-full-\n     scale nuclear testing are not always sufficient to assess the \n     effects of deterioration, changes in packaging, or \n     environmental conditions on weapons performance.''\n       ``Testing of newly produced stockpiled systems has shown a \n     continuing need for nuclear tests. Even an ``identical'' \n     rebuild should be checked in a nuclear test if we are to have \n     confidence that all the inevitable, small and subtle \n     differences from one production run to the other have not \n     affected the nuclear performance. The current stockpile is \n     extremely reliable, but only because continued nuclear \n     testing at adequate yields has enabled us to properly assess \n     and correct problems as they occur.''\n       ``Although tests of a complex system are expensive and \n     time-consuming, one is hard-put to find an example anywhere \n     in U.S. industry where a major production line was reopened \n     and requalified without tests. Exact replication, especially \n     of older systems, is impossible. Material batches are never \n     quite the same, some materials become unavailable, and \n     equivalent materials are never exactly equivalent. Different \n     people--not those who did the initial work--do the \n     remanufacturing.\n       ``Documentation has never been sufficiently exact to ensure \n     replication. A perfect specification has never yet been \n     written. We have never known enough about every detail to \n     specify everything that may be important.\n       ``Tests, even with the limitations of small numbers and \n     possibly equivocal interpretation of results, are the final \n     arbiters of the tradeoffs and judgments that have been made. \n     We are concerned that, if responsible engineers and \n     scientists were to refuse to certify a remanufactured weapon, \n     pressures could produce individuals who would. The Challenger \n     accident resulted from such a situation and highlights an \n     all-too-common tendency of human nature to override judgment \n     in favor of expediency.''\n       ``Remanufacture of a nuclear warhead is often asserted to \n     be a straightforward exercise in engineering and material \n     science, and simply involves following well-established \n     specifications to make identical copies. In the real world, \n     however, there are many examples where weapon parts cannot be \n     duplicated because of outmoded technologies, health hazards, \n     unprofitable operations, out-of-business vendors, \n     reproducible materials, lack of documentation, and myriad \n     other reasons. . . . Not only must remanufacturing attempt to \n     replicate the construction of the original weapon, it must \n     also duplicate the performance of the original weapon.''\n       ``It is important to emphasize that in weapon remanufacture \n     we are dealing with a practical problem. Idealized proposals \n     and statements that we `should be able to remanufacture \n     without testing because expertise is not essential' are a \n     prescription for failure.''\n\n                            The Bottom Line\n\n       Senators concerned about the Nation's ability to perform \n     the needed modifications essential to any effort to \n     ``remanufacture'' stockpiled weapon types should bear in mind \n     a comment by one of the prominent scientists usually cited by \n     CTBT proponents: Dr. Richard Garwin. In testimony before the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, Dr. Garwin \n     declared: ``I oppose modifying our nuclear weapons under the \n     moratorium or under the CTBT.''\n       Given historical experience and the scientific insights \n     gleaned from it, no one who is serious about maintaining the \n     U.S. deterrent for the indefinite future would argue that the \n     existing inventory can be perpetuated without nuclear \n     testing. Remanufactured weapons will have to be realistically \n     tested, at least at low-yield levels, if we--and those we \n     hope to deter--are to have confidence in their effectiveness.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Center for Security Policy, Oct. 7, 1999]\n\n                       Security Forum No. 99-F 23\n\n\n           six secretaries of defense urge defeat of c.t.b.t.\n\n       (Washington, D.C.): In an unprecedented public statement of \n     opposition to a signed arms control agreement, six former \n     Secretaries of Defense--one of whom, Dr. James R. Schlesinger \n     was also (among other things) a Secretary of Energy in the \n     Carter Administration--have written the Republican and \n     Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate urging the defeat of \n     the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n       This authoritative description of the CTBT's defects and \n     the deleterious repercussions its ratification would have for \n     America's nuclear deterrent should be required reading for \n     every Senator and every other participant in what is shaping \n     up to be a momentous debate over the Nation's future security \n     posture. In particular, this letter--which clearly benefits \n     from Dr. Schlesinger's vast experience as a former Chairman \n     of the Atomic Energy Commission, former Director of Central \n     Intelligence as well as a former Secretary of Defense and \n     Energy (in the latter capacity, he was instrumental in \n     dissuading President Carter from pursuing the sort of \n     permanent, zero-yield CTBT that the incumbent President hopes \n     to ratify)--does much to rebut the putative ``military'' \n     arguments being made on behalf of this accord.\n\n                                                  October 6, 1999.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: As the Senate weighs \n     whether to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), \n     we believe Senators will be obliged to focus on one dominant, \n     inescapable result were it to be ratified: over the decades \n     ahead, confidence in the reliability of our nuclear weapons \n     stockpile would inevitably decline, thereby reducing the \n     credibility of America's nuclear deterrent. Unlike previous \n     efforts at a CTBT, this Treaty is intended to be of unlimited \n     duration, and though ``nuclear weapon test explosion'' is \n     undefined in the Treaty, by America's unilateral declaration \n     the accord is ``zero-yield,'' meaning that all nuclear tests, \n     even of the lowest yield, are permanently prohibited.\n       The nuclear weapons in our nation's arsenal are \n     sophisticated devices, whose thousands of components must \n     function together with split-second timing and scant margin \n     for error. A nuclear weapon contains radioactive material, \n     which in itself decays, and also changes the properties of \n     other materials within the weapon. Over time, the components \n     of our weapons corrode and deteriorate, and we lack \n     experience predicting the effects of such aging on the safety \n     and reliability of the weapons. The shelf life of U.S. \n     nuclear weapons was expected to be some 20 years. In the \n     past, the constant process of replacement and testing of new \n     designs have some assurance that weapons in the arsenal would \n     be both new and reliable. But under the CTBT, we would be \n     vulnerable to the effects of aging because we could not test \n     ``fixes'' of problems with existing warheads.\n       Remanufacturing components of existing weapons that have \n     deteriorated also poses significant problems. Manufacturers \n     go out of business, materials and production processes \n     change, certain chemicals previously used in production are \n     now forbidden under new environmental regulations, and so on. \n     It is a certainty that new processes and materials--\n     untested--will be used. Even more important, ultimately the \n     nuclear ``pits'' will need to be replaced--and we will not \n     be able to test those replacements. The upshot is that new \n     defects may be introduced into the stockpile through \n     remanufacture, and without testing we can never be certain \n     that these replacement components will work as their \n     predecessors did.\n       Another implication of the CTBT of unlimited duration is \n     that over time we would gradually lose our pool of \n     knowledgeable people with experience in nuclear weapons \n     design and testing. Consider what would occur if the United \n     States halted nuclear testing for 30 years. We would then be \n     dependent on the judgment of personnel with no personal \n     experience either in designing or testing nuclear weapons. In \n     place of a learning curve, we would experience an extended \n     unlearning curve.\n       Furthermore, major gaps exist in our scientific \n     understanding of nuclear explosives. As President Bush noted \n     in a report to Congress in January 1993, ``Of all U.S. \n     nuclear weapons designs fielded since 1958, approximately \n     one-third have required nuclear testing to resolve problems \n     arising after deployment.'' We were discovering defects in \n     our arsenal up until the moment when the current moratorium \n     on U.S. testing was imposed in 1992. While we have uncovered \n     similar defects since 1992, which in the past would gave let \n     to testing, in the absence of testing, we are not able to \n     test whether the ``fixes'' indeed work.\n       Indeed, the history of maintaining complex military \n     hardware without testing demonstrates the pitfalls of such an \n     approach. Prior to World War II, the Navy's torpedoes had not \n     been adequately tested because of insufficient funds. It took \n     nearly two years of war before we fully solved the problems \n     that caused our torpedoes to routinely pass harmlessly under \n     the target or to fail to explode on contact. For example, at \n     the Battle of Midway, the U.S. launched 47 torpedo aircraft, \n     without damaging a single Japanese ship. If not for our dive \n     bombers, the U.S. would have lost the crucial naval battle of \n     the Pacific war.\n       The Department of Energy has structured a program of \n     experiments and computer simulations called the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program, that it hopes will allow our weapons to \n     be maintained without testing. This program, which will not \n     be mature for at least 10 years, will improve our scientific \n     understanding of nuclear weapons and would likely mitigate \n     the decline in our confidence in the safety and reliability \n     of our arsenal. We will never know whether we should trust \n     Stockpile Stewardship if we cannot conduct nuclear tests to \n     calibrate the unproven new techniques. Mitigation is, of \n     course, not the same as prevention. Over the decades, the \n     erosion of confidence inevitably would be substantial.\n       The decline in confidence in our nuclear deterrent is \n     particularly troublesome in light of the unique geopolitical \n     role of the United States. The U.S. has a far-reaching \n     foreign policy agenda and our forces are stationed around the \n     globe. In addition, we have pledged to hold a nuclear \n     umbrella over our NATO allies and Japan. Though we have \n     abandoned chemical and biological weapons, we have threatened \n     to retaliate with nuclear weapons to such an attack. In the \n     Gulf War, such a threat was apparently sufficient to deter \n     Iraq from using chemical weapons against American troops.\n       We also do not believe the CTBT will do much to prevent the \n     spread of nuclear weapons. The motivation of rogue nations \n     like\n\n[[Page S12389]]\n\n     North Korea and Iraq to acquire nuclear weapons will not be \n     affected by whether the U.S. tests. Similarly, the possession \n     of nuclear weapons by nations like India, Pakistan, and \n     Israel depends on the security environment in the region not \n     by whether or not the U.S. tests. If confidence in the U.S. \n     nuclear deterrent were to decline, countries that have relied \n     on our protection could well feel compelled to seek nuclear \n     capabilities of their own. Thus, ironically, the CTBT might \n     cause additional nations to seek nuclear weapons.\n       Finally, it is impossible to verify a ban that extends to \n     very low yields. The likelihood of cheating is high. ``Trust \n     but verify'' should remain our guide. Tests with yields below \n     1 kiloton can both go undetected and be militarily useful to \n     the testing state. Furthermore, a significantly larger \n     explosion can go undetected--or mistaken for a conventional \n     explosion used for mining or an earthquake--if the test if \n     ``decoupled.'' Decoupling involves conducing the test in a \n     large underground cavity and has been shown to dampen an \n     explosion's seismic signature by a factor of up to 70. The \n     U.S. demonstrated this capability in 1966 in two tests \n     conducted in salt domes at Chilton, Mississippi.\n       We believe that these considerations render a permanent, \n     zero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty incompatible with \n     the Nation's international commitments and vital security \n     interests and believe it does not deserve the Senate's advice \n     and consent. Accordingly, we respectfully urge you and your \n     colleagues to preserve the right of this nation to conduct \n     nuclear tests necessary to the future of our nuclear \n     deterrent by rejecting approval of the present CTBT.\n           Respectfully,\n     James R.

Richard \n     Lugar (R-IN) has delivered what is surely the kiss-of-death \n     for this accord. In a lengthy and detailed memorandum \n     released today, Sen. Lugar declared ``I will vote against the \n     ratification of the CTBT.''\n       The Senator's reasons for reaching what was clearly a \n     wrenching decision are characteristically thoughtful and \n     powerful explained in the following excerpts of his \n     memorandum. The Center applauds Senator Lugar for his \n     courageous leadership in this matter and commends his \n     arguments to his colleagues--and to the American people on \n     behalf of whose security they are made.\n\n  [Press Release from U.S. Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, a Senior \nMember of the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees and \n             the Senate's National Security Working Group]\n\n       The Senate is poised to begin consideration of the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty under a unanimous consent \n     agreement that will provide for 14 hours of general debate, \n     debate on two amendments, and a final vote on ratification. . \n     . . In anticipation of the general debate, I will state my \n     reasons for opposing ratification of the CTBT.\n       The goal of the CTBT is to ban all nuclear explosions \n     worldwide: I do not believe it can succeed. I have little \n     confidence that the verification and enforcement provisions \n     will dissuade other nations from nuclear testing. \n     Furthermore, I am concerned about our country's ability to \n     maintain the integrity and safety of our own nuclear arsenal \n     under the conditions of the treaty.\n       I am a strong advocate of effective and verifiable arms \n     control agreements. As a former Vice-Chairman of the Senate \n     Arms Control Observer Group and a member of the Foreign \n     Relations Committee, I have had the privilege of managing \n     Senate consideration of many arms control treaties and \n     agreements.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I understand the impulse of the proponents of the CTBT to \n     express U.S. leadership in another area of arms control. \n     Inevitably, arms control treaties are accompanied by \n     idealistic principles that envision a future in which \n     international norms prevail over the threat of conflict \n     between nations. However, while affirming our desire for \n     international peace and stability, the U.S. Senate is charged \n     with the constitutional responsibility of making hard \n     judgments about the likely outcomes of treaties. This \n     requires that we examine the treaties in close detail and \n     calculate the consequences of ratification for the present \n     and the future. Viewed in this context, I cannot support the \n     treaty's ratification.\n       I do not believe that the CTBT is of the same caliber as \n     the arms control treaties that have come before the Senate in \n     recent decades. Its usefulness to the goal of non-\n     proliferation is highly questionable. Its likely \n     ineffectuality will risk undermining support and confidence \n     in the concept of multi-lateral arms control. Even as \n     a symbolic statement of our desire for a safer world, it \n     is problematic because it would exacerbate risks and \n     uncertainties related to the safety of our nuclear \n     stockpile.\n\n                         Stockpile Stewardship\n\n       The United States must maintain a reliable nuclear \n     deterrent for the foreseeable future. Although the Cold War \n     is over, significant threats to our country still exist. At \n     present our nuclear capability provides a deterrent that is \n     crucial to the safety of the American people and is relied \n     upon as a safety umbrella by most countries around the world. \n     One of the most critical issues under the CTBT would be that \n     of ensuring the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons \n     stockpile without testing. The safe maintenance and storage \n     of these weapons is a crucial concern. We cannot allow them \n     to fall into disrepair or permit their safety to be called \n     into question.\n       The Administration has proposed an ambitious program that \n     would verify the safety and reliability of our weapons \n     through computer modeling and simulations. Unfortuantely, the \n     jury is still out on the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The \n     last nine years have seen improvements, but the bottom line \n     is that the Senate is being asked to trust the security of \n     our country to a program that is unproven and unlikely to be \n     fully operational until perhaps 2010. I believe a National \n     Journal article, by James Kitfield, summed it up best by \n     quoting a nuclear scientist who likens the challenge of \n     maintaining the viability of our stockpile without testing to \n     ``walking an obstacle course in the dark when your last \n     glimpse of light was a flash of lightning back in 1992.''\n       The most likely problems facing our stockpile are a result \n     of aging. This is a threat because nuclear materials and \n     components degrade in unpredictable ways, in some cases \n     causing weapons to fail. This is compounded by the fact that \n     the U.S. currently has the oldest inventory in the history of \n     our nuclear weapons programs.\n       Over the last forty years, a large percentage of the weapon \n     designs in our stockpile have required post-deployment tests \n     to resolve problems. Without these tests, not only would the \n     problems have remained undetected, but they also would have \n     gone unprepaired. The Congressional Research Service reported \n     last year that: ``A problem with one warhead type can affect \n     hundreds of thousands of individually deployed warheads; with \n     only 9 types of warheads expected to be in the stockpile in \n     2000, compared to 30 in 1985, a single problem could affect a \n     large fraction of the U.S. nuclear force.'' If we are to put \n     our faith in a program other than testing to ensure the \n     safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent and thus our \n     security, we must have complete faith in its efficacy. The \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program falls well short of that \n     standard.\n       The United States has chosen to re-manufacture our aging \n     stockpile rather than creating and building new weapon \n     designs. This could be a potential problem because many of \n     the components and procedures used in original weapon designs \n     no longer exist. New production procedures need to be \n     developed and substituted for the originals, but we must \n     ensure that the remanufactured weapons will work as designed.\n       I am concerned further by the fact that some of the weapons \n     in our arsenal are not as safe as we could make them. Of the \n     nine weapons designs currently in our arsenal, only one \n     employs all of the most modern safety and security measures. \n     Our nuclear weapons laboratories are unable to provide the \n     American people with these protections because of the \n     inability of the Stockpile Stewardship Program to completely \n     mimic testing.\n       At present, I am not convinced the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program will permit our experts to maintain a credible \n     deterrent in the absence of testing. Without a complete, \n     effective, and proven Stockpile Stewardship program, the CTBT \n     could erode our ability to discover and fix problems with the \n     nuclear stockpile and to make safety improvements.\n       In fact, the most important debate on this issue may be an \n     honest discussion of whether we should commence limited \n     testing and continue such a program with consistency and \n     certainty.\n\n                              Verification\n\n       President Reagan's words ``trust but verify'' remain an \n     important measuring stick of whether a treaty serves the \n     national security interests of the United States. The U.S. \n     must be confident of its ability to detect cheating among \n     member states. While the exact thresholds are classified, it \n     is commonly understood that the United States cannot detect \n     nuclear explosions below a few kilotons of yield. The \n     treaty's verification regime, which includes an international \n     monitoring system and on-site inspections, was designed to \n     fill the gaps in our national technical means. Unfortunately, \n     the CTBT's verification regime will not be up to that task \n     even if it is ever fully deployed.\n       Advances in mining technologies have enabled nations to \n     smother nuclear tests, allowing them to conduct tests with \n     little chance of being detected. Similarly, countries can \n     utilize existing geologic formations to decouple their \n     nuclear tests, thereby dramatically reducing the seismic \n     signal produced and rendering the test undetectable. A recent \n     Washington Post article points out that part of the problem \n     of detecting suspected Russian tests at Novaya Zemlya is that \n     the incidents take place in a large granite cave that has \n     proven effective in muffling tests.\n       The verification regime is further bedeviled by the lack of \n     a common definition of a\n\n[[Page S12390]]\n\n     nuclear test. Russia believes hydro-nuclear activities and \n     sub-critical experiments are permitted under the treaty. The \n     U.S. believes sub-critical experiments are permitted but \n     hydro-nuclear tests are not. Other states believe both are \n     illegal. A common understanding or definition of what is and \n     what is not permitted under the treaty has not been \n     established.\n       Proponents point out that if the U.S. needs additional \n     evidence to detect violations, on-site inspections can be \n     requested. Unfortunately, the CTBT will utilize a red-light \n     inspection process. Requests for on-site inspections must be \n     approved by at least 30 affirmative votes of members of the \n     Treaty's 51-member Executive Council. In other words, If the \n     United States accused another country of carrying out a \n     nuclear test, we could only get an inspection if 29 other \n     nations concurred with our request. In addition, each country \n     can declare a 50 square kilometer area of its territory as \n     off limits to any inspections that are approved.\n       The CTBT stands in stark contrast to the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention in the area of verifiability. Whereas the CTBT \n     requires an affirmative vote of the Executive Council for an \n     inspection to be approved, the CWC requires an affirmative \n     vote to stop an inspection from proceeding. Furthermore, the \n     CWC did not exclude large tracts of land from the inspection \n     regime, as does the CTBT.\n       The CTBT's verification regime seems to be the embodiment \n     of everything the United States has been fighting against in \n     the UNSCOM inspection process in Iraq. We have rejected \n     Iraq's position of choosing and approving the national origin \n     of inspectors. In addition, the 50 square kilometer \n     inspection-free zones could become analogous to the \n     controversy over the inspections of Iraqi presidential \n     palaces. The UNSCOM experience is one that is best not \n     repeated under a CTBT.\n\n                              Enforcement\n\n       Let me turn some enforcement concerns. Even if the United \n     States were successful in utilizing the laborious \n     verification regime and non-compliance was detected, the \n     Treaty is almost powerless to respond. This treaty simply has \n     no teeth. Arms control advocates need to reflect on the \n     possible damage to the concept of arms control if we \n     embrace a treaty that comes to be perceived as \n     ineffectual. Arms control based only on a symbolic purpose \n     can breed cynicism in the process and undercut support for \n     more substantive and proven arms control measures.\n       The CTBT's answer to illegal nuclear testing is the \n     possible implementation of sanctions. It is clear that this \n     will not prove particularly compelling in the decision-making \n     processes of foreign states intent on building nuclear \n     weapons. For those countries seeking nuclear weapons, the \n     perceived benefits in international stature and deterrence \n     generally far outweigh the concern about sanctions that could \n     be brought to bear by the international community.\n       Further, recent experience has demonstrated that enforcing \n     effective multilateral sanctions against a country is \n     extraordinarily difficult. Currently, the United States is \n     struggling to maintain multilateral sanctions on Iraq, a \n     country that openly seeks weapons of mass destruction and \n     blatantly invaded and looted a neighboring nation, among \n     other transgressions. If it is difficult to maintain the \n     international will behind sanctions on an outlaw nation, how \n     would we enforce sanctions against more responsible nations \n     of greater commercial importance like India and Pakistan?\n       In particularly grave cases, the CTBT Executive Council can \n     bring the issue to the attention of the United Nations. \n     Unfortunately, this too would most likely prove ineffective, \n     given that permanent members of the Security Council could \n     veto any efforts to punish CTBT violators. Chances of a \n     better result in the General Assembly are remote at best.\n       I believe the enforcement mechanisms of the CTBT provide \n     little reason for countries to forego nuclear testing. Some \n     of my friends respond to this charge by pointing out that \n     even if the enforcement provisions of the treaty are \n     ineffective, the treaty will impose new international norms \n     for behavior. In this case, we have observed that ``norms'' \n     have not been persuasive for North Korea, Iraq, Iran, India \n     and Pakistan, the very countries whose actions we seek to \n     influence through a CTBT.\n       If a country breaks the international norm embodied in the \n     CTBT, that country has already broken the norm associated \n     with the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Countries other than \n     the recognized nuclear powers who attempt to test a weapon \n     must first manufacture or obtain a weapon, which would \n     constitute a violation of the NPT. I fail to see how an \n     additional norm will deter a motivated nation from developing \n     nuclear weapons after violating the long-standing norm of the \n     NPT.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       On Tuesday the Senate is scheduled to vote on the \n     ratification of the CTBT. If this vote takes place, I believe \n     the treaty should be defeated. The Administration has failed \n     to make a case on why this treaty is in our national security \n     interests.\n       The Senate is being asked to rely on an unfinished and \n     unproven Stockpile Stewardship Program. This program might \n     meet our needs in the future, but as yet, it is not close to \n     doing so. The treaty is flawed with an ineffective \n     verification regime and a practically nonexistent enforcement \n     process.\n       For these reasons, I will vote against ratification of the \n     CTBT.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Center for Security Policy, Oct. 12, 1999]\n\n                       Security Forum No. 99-F25\n\n\n richard Perle Discounts Allies' Objections to Senate Rejection of the \n                     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\n\n       (Washington, D.C.): In an op.ed. article slated for \n     publication in a major British daily newspaper tomorrow, \n     former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle puts in \n     perspective recommendations made last week by the leaders of \n     Britain, France and Germany that the Senate agree to the \n     ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Mr. \n     Perle--an accomplished security policy practitioner widely \n     respected on both sides of the Atlantic and, indeed, around \n     the world--powerfully argues that the objections heard from \n     Messrs. Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroeder in \n     an op.ed. article published in the New York Times on 8 \n     October should not dissuade the United States Senate for \n     doing what American national security and interests dictate: \n     defeating the CTBT.\n\n\n                      Passion's Slave and the CTBT\n\n                           (By Richard Perle)\n\n       Always generous with advice, a chorus of European officials \n     has been urging the United States Senate to ratify the \n     ``Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.'' Last Friday, Tony Blair, \n     Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroeder (BC for short) issued \n     what Will Hutton, writing in the Observer, called ``a \n     passionate appeal'' to the American Senator whose votes will \n     decide whether the United States signs up to the fanciful \n     conceit that the CTBT will halt the testing of nuclear \n     weapons.\n       Advice giving is contagious, and Hutton has some of his \n     own: to encourage the U.S. to ratify the CTBT, he urged \n     Britain and France to phase out their nuclear weapons \n     entirely--a suggestion they will passionately reject.\n       Now, the prospect of crowning the Western victory in the \n     Cold War with a piece of international legislation that will \n     stop the spread of nuclear weapons is certainly appealing. \n     After all, a signature on a piece of paper would be a \n     remarkably cheap and efficient way to keep nuclear weapons \n     out of the hands of Kim Jong-il, Saddam Hussein and the other \n     44 regimes now deemed capable of developing nuclear weapons.\n       So what explains the need for passionate appeals from \n     politicians and strident comment from leader writers? Why \n     doesn't the Senate congratulate its friends on their wise and \n     timely counsel and vote to ratify the treaty?\n       I suspect that one reason is the Senators--or at least the \n     more responsible among them--have actually read the treaty \n     and understand how deeply flawed it is, how unlikely it is to \n     stop nuclear proliferation or even nuclear testing, and how \n     it has the potential to leave the United States with an \n     unsafe, unreliable nuclear deterrent.\n       Arms control agreements--especially ones affecting matters \n     as sensitive as nuclear weapons--must be judged both in broad \n     concept and in the details of their implementation. As a \n     device for ending all nuclear tests, the CTBT fails on both \n     counts.\n       It is characteristic of global agreements like the CTBT \n     that they lump together, under a single set of constraints, \n     states that can be counted upon to comply and those which \n     intend either to find and use loopholes--the CTBT is full of \n     them--or to cheat to defeat the constraints of the agreement. \n     To make matters worse, states joining global conventions, \n     even if they do so in bad faith, obtain the same treatment \n     as those who join in order to advance the proper purposes \n     of the agreement.\n       There can be little doubt that Indian participation in the \n     ``atoms for peace program'' facilitated New Dehli's \n     acquisition of nuclear weapons by legitimating the \n     construction of a Canadian designed reactor from which India \n     extracted the nuclear material to make its first bomb. We now \n     know that Saddam Hussein made full use of the information \n     provided by Iraqi inspectors on the staff of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (set up to police the Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty) to conceal his clandestine nuclear \n     weapons program. With knowledge of the sources and methods by \n     which the IAEA attempts to ferret out cheating, Iraqis \n     ensconced there (by virtue of Iraq's having signed the NPT) \n     were better able to circumvent treaty's essential purpose.\n       In domestic affairs, no one would seriously propose that \n     the police and criminals come together and sign agreements \n     according to which they accept the same set of constraints on \n     their freedom of action. Yet that is the underlying logic of \n     the CTBT: a compact among nation states, some of which are \n     current or likely criminals, others--the majority--respectful \n     of international law and their treaty obligations. Because \n     there can be no realistic hope of verifying compliance with \n     the DTBT, this fundamental flaw, which is characteristic of \n     global agreements, is greatly magnified. The net result of \n     ratification of the CTBT would be (a) American compliance, \n     which could leave the U.S. uncertain about the safety and \n     reliability of its nuclear deterrent; and (b) almost certain \n     cheating by one or more rogue states determined to acquire \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Among the leaders in Congress who have taken a keen \n     interest in arms control is Senator Richard Lugar from \n     Indiana, a senior\n\n[[Page S12391]]\n\n     member of the Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees. \n     A frequent floor manager in favor of arms control \n     legislation, he has supported every arms control treaty to \n     come before the Senate and has often led the proponents in \n     debate. Last week he announced that he would vote against \n     ratification of the CTBT.\n       I would be willing to bet that Senator Lugar has spent more \n     time studying this treaty than Blair, Chirac, Schroeder and \n     Hutton combined--which may explain why his view of the treaty \n     is one of reason and not passion. Senator Lugar opposes \n     ratification--not because he shares my view that the treaty \n     is conceptually flawed--but because he believes it cannot \n     achieve its intended purpose but it could ``risk undermining \n     support and confidence in the concept of multi-lateral arms \n     control.''\n       Arguing that the CTBT is ``not of the same caliber as the \n     arms control treaties that have come before the Senate in \n     recent decades.'' Lugar concludes that the treaty's \n     usefulness is ``highly questionable,'' and that it would \n     ``exacerbate risks and uncertainties related to the safety of \n     our nuclear stockpile.'' He rightly points to the treaty's \n     ``ineffective verification regime'' and ``practically \n     nonexistent enforcement process.''\n       Senator Lugar's careful, detailed assessment of the treaty \n     contrasts sharply with the rugby cheering section coming from \n     the London, Paris and Berlin offices of BC Do BC know \n     that the treaty actually lacks a definition of the term \n     ``nuclear test?'' Rushed to completion before the 1996 \n     Presidential election, Clinton abandoned in mid-stream an \n     effort to negotiate a binding definition. Do they know that \n     advances in mining technology permit tests to be smothered so \n     they cannot be detected? Do they understand the composition \n     and complexities of the U.S. nuclear stockpile or the \n     importance of future testing to overcome any potential \n     problems? Can they get beyond their passion?\n       ``Give me that man/That is not passion's slave, and I will \n     wear him/In my heart's core . . .''

The plan apparently is to use this occasion to flex \n     the muscles of the unreconstructed anti-nuclear movement with \n     phone calls barraging the Capitol Hill switchboard, a \n     demonstration on the Capitol grounds, Senate speeches and \n     other agitation aimed at intimidating Majority Leader Trend \n     Lott and Foreign Relations Chairman Jesse Helms into clearing \n     the way for this treaty's ratification.\n       An insight into the strategy was offered last Friday by \n     Sen. Byron Dorgan, North Dakota Democrat, who suggested in \n     the colloquy with Mr. Lott that he intended to tie the Senate \n     into knots if hearings and action on the CTBT's resolution of \n     ratification were not promptly scheduled. The Majority leader \n     responded by indicating he had already spoke to Sen. Helms \n     about scheduling such hearings. He added portentously, \n     however, that ``I cannot wait to hear how Jim Schlesinger \n     describes the CTBT treaty. When he gets through damning it, \n     they may not want more hearings.''\n       Mr. Dorgan responded: ``Mr. Schlesinger will be standing in \n     a mighty small crowd. Most of the folks who are supporting \n     this treaty are the folks who Sen. Lott and I have the \n     greatest respect for who have served this country as \n     Republicans and Democrats, and military policy analysts for \n     three or four decades, going back to President Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower.''\n       This, then, is how the fight over the Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty is shaping up. It will be one in which the pivotal \n     block of senators--mostly Republicans but possibly including \n     a number of ``New Democtats''--decide how they will vote less \n     on the basis of the merits of this accord than on the company \n     they will be keeping when they choose sides.\n       This is not an unreasonable response to a treaty that deals \n     with a matter as complex as nuclear testing. Such testing is, \n     after all, an exceedingly esoteric field, mostly science but \n     with a fair measure of art thrown in. For the best part of \n     the past 55 years, it has been recognized to be an \n     indispensable methodology for ensuring the reliability, \n     safety and effectiveness of America's nuclear deterrent.\n       Now, though, the Clinton administration would have us \n     accept that it is no longer necessary, that our nuclear \n     arsenal can continue to meet these exacting standards even if \n     none of its weapons are tested via underground explosions \n     ever again. This represents a stunning leap of logic (if not \n     of faith), given the contrary argument made by many CTBT \n     advocates in other contexts--notably, with respect to the F-\n     22 and missile defenses. These weapons, we are told, cannot \n     be tested enough; they should not be procured, let alone \n     relied upon, the party line goes, unless and until the most \n     exacting test requirements have been satisfied.\n       Whom is a senator to believe? The answer will not only \n     determine his or her stance on the CTBT. It will also say a \n     lot about the senator is question.\n       My guess--like Sen. Lott's--is that, at the end of the day, \n     sufficient numbers of senators will be guided by James \n     Schlesinger on a matter that threatens to propel the United \n     States inexorably toward unilateral nuclear disarmament. Few \n     people in the nation have more authority and credibility on \n     this topic than he, the only man in history to have held the \n     positions of chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, \n     director of central intelligence, secretary of defense and \n     secretary of energy. Mr. Schlesinger's career has been made \n     even more influential in the Senate by virtue of his service \n     in both Republican and Democratic Cabinets.\n       Then there are the 50 or so senior security policy \n     practitioners who last week wrote Mr. Lott an open letter \n     advising him that ``the nation must retain an arsenal \n     comprising modern, safe and reliable nuclear weapons, and the \n     scientific and industrial base necessary to ensure the \n     availability of such weapons over the long term. In our \n     professional judgment, the zero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty is incompatible with these requirements and, \n     therefore, is inconsistent with America's national security \n     interests.\n       Among the many distinguished signatories of this letter \n     are: former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick; two of \n     President Reagan's National Security Advisers (Richard Allen \n     and William Clark); former Attorney General Edwin Meese; and \n     10 retired four-star generals and admirals (including the \n     former commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Louis Wilson). \n     When these sorts of men and women challenge the zero-yield \n     CTBT, as Mr. Schlesinger has done, on the grounds it will \n     contribute to the steady erosion of our deterrent, will be \n     impossible to verify and will make no appreciable \n     contribution to slowing proliferation, responsible senators \n     cannot help but be concerned.\n       To be sure, the Clinton administration and its arms control \n     allies have generated their own letters offering \n     ``celebrity'' endorsements of the CTBT. Senators weighing \n     these endorsements, however, would be well-advised to \n     consider the following, obviously unrehearsed statement of \n     support for the Treaty given by one such prominent figure--\n     the serving chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Hugh \n     Shelton. It came last week in a congressional hearing in \n     response to a softball question from Sen. Carl Levin, \n     Michigan Democrat, about why Gen. Shelton thought the CTBT is \n     in our national interest. The chairman responded by saying:\n       ``Sir, I think from the standpoint of the holding back on \n     the development of the testing which leads to wanting a \n     better system, developing new capabilities, which then leads \n     you into arms sales or into proliferation. Stopping that as \n     early as we can, I think, is in the best interest of the \n     international community in general, and specifically in the \n     best interest of the United States.''\n       Stripped of the veneer of this sort of support, the zero-\n     yield Comprehensive Test Ban can be seen for what it is: the \n     product primarily of the decades-long agitation of the looney \n     left who, in their efforts to ``disarm the ones they're \n     with,'' have made themselves the kind of company few \n     thoughtful senators should want to keep--on CTBT Day of \n     Action or when the votes on this treaty ultimately get \n     counted.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Investor's Business Daily, Sept. 13, 1999]\n\n               Test Ban or Unilateral Disarmament Treaty?\n\n                       (By Frank J. Gaffney Jr.)\n\n       The utopians in the Clinton camp have set their sights on \n     another nuclear weapons treaty. It's not designed to preserve \n     U.S. military capability, but rather to disarm it.\n       A major campaign is on to press the U.S. Senate to approve \n     ratification of the controversial arms control accord, the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). It's intended to ban \n     permanently all nuclear weapons tests.\n       For the better part of 50 years, such testing has been \n     relied upon by successive Republican and Democratic \n     administrations to assure the safety, reliability and \n     effectiveness of the nation's nuclear deterrent.\n       Now we are told by the Clinton team and its allies that our \n     arsenal will be able to continue to meet this exacting \n     standard for the indefinite future without conducting another \n     underground detonation.\n       What is extraordinary is that the claim is being made by \n     many of the same people who regularly rail that the Pentagon \n     is not doing enough to test its weapons systems to ensure \n     that they will perform as advertised.\n       For example, such critics challenge the realism of the two \n     successful intercepts recently achieved by the Theater High \n     Altitude Area Defense missile defense system. Then there is \n     the complaint that too much computer modeling and too little \n     rigorous pre-production testing has been done to permit \n     further procurement of the Air Force's impressive next-\n     generation fighter, the F-22.\n       So one might ask of CTBT proponents: Which is it going to \n     be? Can we settle for computer modeling and simulations? Or \n     is realistic testing essential if we are to trust our \n     security and tax dollars to sophisticated weaponry?\n       Their answer? It depends: As long as the CTBT remains \n     unratified, the administration position seems likely to \n     remain that we can rely upon the current nuclear inventory, \n     and simulations will assure their reliability. But \n     simulations won't allow us to develop new weapons.\n       Thus, it would be hard to modernize the inventory as \n     strategic circumstances change.\n\n[[Page S12392]]\n\n     For instance, how could we know if a new, deep-penetrating \n     warhead will take out a hardened underground bunker if we \n     can't test it?\n       Should the Senate give its advice and consent to this \n     accord, however, that line seems sure to change. Then the \n     CTBT's proponents will revert to form, free to acknowledge \n     the obvious: The existing stockpile--comprised increasingly \n     obsolescing weapons--cannot be maintained without testing, \n     either. So by their logic, the next move would be to just \n     retire all the weapons.\n       Consider the October 1997 congressional testimony of then-\n     Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs Victor \n     Reis: ``Just about all the parts of our present nuclear \n     weapons) are going to have to be remade.'' No responsible \n     scientists could promise, in the absence of explosive \n     testing, that completely remanufactured thermonuclear devices \n     will work as advertised. And no one will be arguing that \n     point more vociferously than the antinuclear activists who \n     are pushing the CTBT.\n       When challenged on this score, the White House blithely \n     asserts it is pursuing a $40 billion Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program (SSP) to address such quality-control issues down the \n     road.\n       Unfortunately, this capability will materialize--if at \n     all--a long way down the road. It will take some 10 years to \n     construct new facilities to house the various exotic \n     experimental diagnostic technologies that are supposed to \n     provide the same confidence about the performance of our \n     nuclear stockpile as does nuclear testing.\n       Plus, no one knows for sure whether the SSP will actually \n     pan out. Even before the CTBT is ratified, many of the \n     treaty's supporters are urging Congress to delete the \n     billions being sought each year for Lawrence Livermore \n     Laboratory's National Ignition Facility and its counterpart \n     facilities at the other nuclear labs.\n       Even if properly funded and brought on line as scheduled, \n     though, it is unclear that the simulations provided by these \n     experimental devices will be as accurate as underground \n     detonations. And, of course, a test ban will preclude the one \n     scientifically rigorous way of proving the simulations' \n     accuracy.\n       The bottom line is that U.S. national security demands that \n     we filed nothing but systematically and rigorously tested \n     military systems, both conventional and nuclear. To be sure, \n     computer simulations can contribute significantly to reducing \n     the cost and the length of time it takes to develop and \n     deploy such weapons. But we cannot afford to let any weapon--\n     least of all the most important ones in our arsenal, our \n     nuclear deterrent--go untested and unproven.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From the Worldwide Weekly Defense News, Sept. 27, 1999]\n\n         Truth About Nuclear Testing Would Sink Test Ban Treaty\n\n                           (By Frank Gaffney)\n\n       In the course of a Sept. 9 hearing before the U.S. Senate \n     Armed Services Committee called to consider the nomination of \n     Gen.

Carl Levin (D-Mich.) asked the general \n     to explain why the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was \n     in the national interest.\n       He responded in a halting, almost tortured fashion, saying: \n     ``Sir, I think from the standpoint of the holding back on the \n     development of the testing which leads to wanting a better \n     system, developing new capabilities, which then leads you \n     into arms sales or into proliferation.

Still, the party line is that we \n     support this treaty and I am going to do so, no matter what.\n       The administration of President Bill Clinton established in \n     1993, long before Shelton became Joint Chiefs chairman, that \n     there would be no further testing of U.S. nuclear weapons, \n     with or without a CTBT.\n       The general inherited a position adopted on his \n     predecessor's watch and with the latter's support that would \n     be politically costly at this late date to repudiate. The \n     fact remains, however, that the idea of trying to ban all \n     nuclear tests (the so-called zero-yield test ban) was opposed \n     by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among other relevant U.S. \n     government agencies, before Clinton decided to embrace it.\n       The reason the U.S. military counseled against such an \n     accord was elementary: It is widely understood that a zero-\n     yield treaty cannot be verified. Other countries can, and \n     must be expected to, exploit the inability of U.S. national \n     technical means and international seismic monitors to detect \n     covert, low-yield underground tests.\n       Since the United States would scrupulously adhere to a \n     zero-yield ban, it would be enjoined from conducting \n     experimental detonations necessary to maintaining the safety \n     and reliability of its nuclear deterrent.\n       U.S. military leaders are not expected to be experts on \n     nuclear nonproliferation or arms control. The government \n     hires lots of other people to do those jobs. Unfortunately, \n     many of the policy-makers responsible for those portfolios \n     lack the integrity or common sense one expects of men and \n     women in uniform, hence their claims that the CTBT will \n     contribute to curbing the spread of nuclear weapons.\n       This is, of course, fatuous nonsense in a world in which a \n     number of countries have acquired such weaponry without \n     conducting known nuclear tests, and others seek to buy proven \n     nuclear devices or the necessary know-how and equipment from \n     willing sellers in Russia, China and Pakistan.\n       Neither should the leadership of the American armed forces \n     be seen as adjuncts to an administration's political \n     operation. Rather, what is expected from such leaders is \n     their best professional military judgment, the unvarnished \n     truth, no matter how politically incorrect or inconvenient it \n     may be.\n       The United States cannot afford to allow its nuclear \n     arsenal to continue to go untested (it has already been seven \n     years since the last underground detonation occurred) any \n     more than it could permit its national security to depend on \n     untested conventional planes, tanks, missiles or ships.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 10, 1999]\n\n                       A Test Ban That Disarms Us\n\n       When it comes to nuclear testing, nations will act in their \n     perceived self-interest.\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Some debates just never go away. The Clinton administration \n     is back again pressing Congress for passage of the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). This is part of a \n     final-legacy push that includes a Middle East peace for just-\n     in-time delivery by September 2000.\n       The argument for the test ban is that it will prevent \n     nuclear proliferation. If countries cannot test nukes, they \n     will not build them because they won't know if they work. \n     Ratifying the CTBT is supposed to close the testing option \n     for would-be nuclear powers.\n       We sign. They desist, How exactly does this work?\n       As a Washington Post editorial explains, one of the ways to \n     ``induce would-be proliferators to get off the nuclear \n     track'' is ``if the nuclear powers showed themselves ready to \n     accept some increasing part of the discipline they are \n     calling on non-nuclear others to accept.'' The power of \n     example of the greatest nuclear country is expected to induce \n     other countries to follow suit.\n       History has not been kind to this argument. The most \n     dramatic counterexamples, of course, are rogue states such as \n     North Korea, Iraq and Iran. They don't sign treaties and, \n     even when they do, they set out to break them clandestinely \n     from the first day. Moral suasion does not sway them.\n       More interesting is the case of friendly countries such as \n     India and Pakistan. They are exactly the kind of countries \n     whose nuclear ambitions the American example of restraint is \n     supposed to mollify.\n       Well, then. The United States has not exploded a nuclear \n     bomb either above or below ground since 1992. In 1993, \n     President Clinton made it official by declaring a total \n     moratorium on U.S. testing. Then last year, India and \n     Pakistan went ahead and exploded a series of nuclear bombs. \n     So much for moral suasion. Why did they do it? Because of \n     this obvious, if inconvenient, truth: Nuclear weapons are the \n     supreme military asset. Not that they necessarily will be \n     used in warfare. But their very possession transforms the \n     geopolitical status of the possessor. The possessor acquires \n     not just aggressive power but, even more important, a \n     deterrent capacity as well.\n       Ask yourself: Would we have launched the Persian Gulf War \n     if Iraq had been bristling with nukes?\n       This truth is easy for Americans to forget because we have \n     so much conventional strength that our nuclear forces appear \n     superfluous, even vestigial. Lesser countries, however, \n     recognize the political and diplomatic power conveyed by \n     nuclear weapons.\n       They want the nuclear option. For good reason. And they \n     will not forgo it because they are moved by the moral example \n     of the United States. Nations follow their interests, not \n     norms.\n       Okay, say the test ban advocates. If not swayed by American \n     example, they will be swayed by the penalties for breaking an \n     international norm.\n       What penalties? China exploded test after test until it had \n     satisfied itself that its arsenal was in good shape, then \n     quit in 1996. India and Pakistan broke the norm on nuclear \n     testing and nonproliferation. North Korea openly flouted the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n       Were any of these countries sanctioned? North Korea was \n     actually rewarded with enormous diplomatic and financial \n     inducements--including billions of dollars in fuel and food \n     aid--to act nice. India and Pakistan got slapped on the wrist \n     for a couple of months.\n       That's it. Why? Because these countries are either too \n     important (India) or too scary (North Korea). Despite our \n     pretensions, for America too, interests trump norms.\n       Whether the United States signs a ban on nuclear testing \n     will not affect the course of proliferation. But it will \n     affect the nuclear status of the United States.\n       In the absence of testing, the American nuclear arsenal, \n     the most sophisticated on the globe and thus the most in need \n     of testing to\n\n[[Page S12393]]\n\n     ensure its safety and reliability, will degrade over time. As \n     its reliability declines, it becomes unusable. For the United \n     States, the unintended effect of a test ban is gradual \n     disarmament.\n       Well, maybe not so unintended. For the more extreme \n     advocates of the test ban, nonproliferation is the ostensible \n     argument, but disarmament is the real objective. The Ban the \n     Bomb and Nuclear Freeze movements have been discredited by \n     history, but their adherents have found a back door. A \n     nuclear test ban is that door. For them, the test ban is part \n     of a larger movement: the war against weapons. It finds \n     expression in such touching and useless exercises as the land \n     mine convention, the biological weapons convention, etc.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 7, 1998]\n\n                             Paper Defense\n\n                          (By George F.

Having nuclear weapons? Were it \n     not for them, scores of thousands of Americans would have \n     died in 1945 ending the fighting in the Pacific. And nuclear \n     weapons were indispensable ingredients of the containment of \n     the Soviet Union and its enormous conventional forces.\n       Perhaps the president meant that arms competitions were the \n     ``mistakes.''

That bromide \n     was offered to nations weighing what they consider questions \n     of national life and death.\n       U.S. policy regarding such tests has been put on automatic \n     pilot by Congress's itch to micromanage and to mandate \n     cathartic gestures, so the United States will now \n     evenhandedly punish with economic sanctions India for its \n     provocation and Pakistan for responding to it. Because India \n     is stronger economically, the sanctions will be \n     disproportionately injurious to Pakistan.\n       India has an enormous advantage over Pakistan in \n     conventional military forces.

John McCain says the first \n     thing to do is impose ``sanctions which hurt'' and the second \n     is ``to get agreements that they will not test again.''\n       So, automatic sanctions having failed to deter either \n     nation, Washington's attention turns, robotically, to an even \n     more futile ritual--the superstition of arms control, \n     specifically the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the \n     United States signed in 1996, but which the Senate has \n     prudently not ratified. The designation ``superstition'' fits \n     because the faith of believers in arms control is more than \n     impervious to evidence; their faith is strengthened even by \n     evidence that actually refutes it.\n       Far from demonstrating the urgency of ratification, India's \n     and Pakistan's tests demonstrate the CTBT's irrelevance. \n     India had not tested since 1974. Pakistan evidently had never \n     tested. Yet both had sufficient stockpiles to perform \n     multiple tests. So the tests did not create new sabers, they \n     were the rattling of sabers known to have existed for years. \n     Indeed, in 1990, when fighting in the disputed territory of \n     Kashmir coincided with Indian military exercises, the Bush \n     administration assumed that both Pakistan and India had built \n     weapons with their nuclear technologies and worried about a \n     possible nuclear exchange.\n       The nonproliferation treaty authorizes international \n     inspections only at sites declared to be nuclear facilities. \n     Nations have been known to fib. The CTBT sets such a low-\n     yield standard of what constitutes a test of a nuclear \n     device, that verification is impossible.\n       Various of the president's policies, whether shaped by \n     corruption, in competence of naivete, have enabled China to \n     increase the lethality of its ICBMs. The president and his \n     party are committed to keeping America vulnerable to such \n     weapons: 41 senators, all Democrats, have filibustered \n     legislation sponsored by Sens. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) and \n     Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) declaring it U.S. policy ``to deploy \n     effective anti-missile defenses of the territory of the \n     United States as soon as technologically possible.''\n       Instead, the administration would defend the nation with \n     parchment--gestures like the CTBT, which is a distillation of \n     liberalism's foreign policy of let's pretend. Let's pretend \n     that if we forever forswear tests, other nations' admiration \n     will move them to emulation. Diagnostic tests are \n     indispensable for maintaining the safety and reliability of \n     the aging U.S. deterrent inventory. So the CTBT is a recipe \n     for slow-motion denuclearization. But let's pretend that if \n     we become weaker, other nations will not want to become \n     stronger.\n       Seeking a safer world by means of a weaker America and \n     seeking to make America safe behind the parchment walls of \n     arms control agreements, is to start the 21st century by \n     repeating the worst fallacies of the 20th century.\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 12, 1999]\n\n               . . . Would Be Even Worse if It Succeeded\n\n                          (By Kathleen Bailey)\n\n       It appears the Senate will either vote down the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty or postpone a vote \n     indefinitely. The treaty's supporters, led by President \n     Clinton, argue that the CTBT is necessary to constrain \n     nations that seek to acquire a workable nuclear weapons \n     design. But the treaty would accomplish none of its \n     proponents' nonproliferation goals. It would, however, \n     seriously degrade the U.S. nuclear deterrent.\n       No treaty can stop a nation from designing and building a \n     simple nuclear weapon with confidence that it will work. To \n     do so doesn't require testing. One of the U.S. bombs dropped \n     on Japan in 1945 was of a design that had never been tested, \n     and South Africa built six nuclear weapons without testing.\n       By contrast, the U.S. today needs to test its nuclear \n     weapons because they are more complex. They are designed to \n     make pinpoint strikes against small targets such as silos. \n     This dictates high-performance delivery systems, which, in \n     turn, requires tight parameters on the allowable weight, \n     size, shape, safety measures and yield.\n       Today's would-be proliferators are likely to target cities, \n     not silos. The delivery vehicles may be ships, barges, trucks \n     or Scud-type missiles. The exact yield of the weapon will not \n     matter, and there will be no tight restrictions imposed by \n     advanced delivery systems. Safety standards will not be a \n     crucial issue.\n       CTBT proponents also contend that the treaty will promote \n     nonproliferation by creating an international norm against \n     nuclear weapons. But there is already a norm against \n     additional nations acquiring nuclear weapons: the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty, signed by every major country except \n     India, Israel and Pakistan.\n       The NPT norm against the pursuit of nuclear weapons, \n     established when the treaty went into effect in 1970, has \n     been broken repeatedly, and not just by the three countries \n     that refused to sign it. The list of states that have broken \n     or are thought to have broken the norm includes Argentina, \n     Brazil, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, South Africa, South Korea \n     and Taiwan.\n       It is true, as treaty proponents argue, that the CTBT will \n     inhibit nuclear-weapons modernization. But this is not a \n     plus. It would keep the U.S. from modernizing its nuclear \n     arsenal to make it as safe as possible. Already there are new \n     safety measures that could be incorporated into the American \n     stockpile, making it less likely that weapons will explode \n     accidentally--but the U.S. is not incorporating these new \n     safety technologies because they would require low-yield \n     nuclear testing.\n       Modernization is also needed to make U.S. weapons more \n     effective against the ever-evolving countermeasures by \n     opponents. We know that deeply buried targets are a new \n     problem, as are biological weapons. America may need to \n     tailor its arsenal to a totally different type of targets in \n     the future, which would require nuclear testing.\n       While the treaty would inhibit U.S. modernization, it would \n     not affect those that choose to cheat. It would be easy for \n     Russia, China, and others to conduct nuclear tests without \n     being detected. This is because the CTBT is not even \n     minimally verifiable.\n       Effective verification entails having high confidence that \n     militarily significant cheating will be detected in a timely \n     manner. In the case of the CTBT, we need to know the answers \n     to two questions: What yield nuclear test can provide \n     militarily significant information? Can the CTBT verification \n     system detect to that level?\n       Five hundred tons of yield is a very useful testing level, \n     although not sufficient to gain full confidence in all \n     aspects of an existing weapon's performance or to develop \n     sophisticated new nuclear weapons. The latter goals could be \n     achieved for most designs with tests at yields between one \n     and 10 kilotons. Tests at levels as low as 500 tons may be \n     militarily significant.\n       The International Monitoring System of the CTBT is expected \n     to provide the ability to detect, locate and identify non \n     evasive nuclear testing of one kiloton or greater. But most \n     cheaters are likely to be evasive. By taking some relatively \n     simple measures, they could test several kilotons with little \n     risks of detection. One method by which they may do so is \n     through energy decoupling--detonation of the device \n     underground--that can reduce the seismic signal by as much as \n     a factor of 70. Thus, a fully decoupled one-kiloton explosion \n     would look seismically like at 14-ton explosion, or a 10-\n     kiloton explosion like a 140-ton one.\n       On-site inspection will not solve the verification problem. \n     Even if we knew that a test would conducted, we almost \n     certainly would not know exactly where it took place. Without \n     knowing the precise location, the search area would be too \n     large for a meaningful inspection.\n\n[[Page S12394]]\n\n       If the Senate ratified the CTBT, it's certain that the U.S. \n     would comply with it, foreclosing America's ability to \n     modernize its nuclear forces. But other nations have a \n     history of noncompliance with arms-control treaties. Thus the \n     limited political benefits of the CTBT are not worth the high \n     cost to America's national security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From The New Republic, October 25, 1999]\n\n                 The Flawed Test Ban Treaty--Poor Pact\n\n                       (By Frank J. Gaffney Jr.)\n\n       If current vote-counts prove accurate and no last-minute \n     postponement is agreed to, the Senate will not provide the \n     two-thirds support necessary to ratify the Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty (CTBT). Although the Clinton administration acts \n     as if this would be disastrous for the struggle against \n     nuclear proliferation, defeat of the CTBT would actually be a \n     victory for American national security.\n       As the administration has implicitly conceded by sending \n     Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on a last-minute trip to \n     Russia to negotiate better verification procedures, many \n     senators harbor deep concerns about the treaty's \n     verifiability. They are right to do so. U.S. intelligence \n     suspects (but cannot prove) that both the Russians and the \n     Chinese have conducted covert nuclear tests in recent months. \n     In fact, it is impossible to verify a total, or ``zero-\n     yield,'' ban on all nuclear testing, since foreign monitors \n     cannot reliably differentiate covert low-yield explosions \n     from earthquakes or conventional explosions.\n       This would be true even if the sort of worldwide seismic \n     monitoring system to be established under the CTBT (thanks \n     largely to the administration's decision to put U.S. \n     intelligence assets at the service of a multilateral \n     organization) were in place. For political, if not technical, \n     reasons, the data compiled by the ``international community'' \n     will probably be even less conducive to a finding of \n     noncompliance than the iffy information the United States \n     often gets on its own.\n       Treaty proponents point to the CTBT's provision for on-site \n     inspections. Such inspections are far from automatic and can \n     be stymied by U.N. Security Council members determined to \n     block them. If nations exploit well-understood techniques for \n     muffling the seismic shocks that such events \n     precipitate (``decoupling''), they can increase the yield \n     of their tests without getting caught--as the United \n     States proved in its own 1960 experiment.\n       Even if the CTBT were fully verifiable, it would be \n     irrelevant to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Explosive \n     testing is simply no longer the sine qua non of a nuclear \n     development and acquisition program. From Israel to North \n     Korea, countries have acquired atomic devices without \n     conducting identified nuclear tests. (Pakistan and India \n     conducted their recent tests for political, not \n     technological, reasons, and the tests took place years after \n     each of them had gotten the bomb.) Even Clinton's CTBT point \n     man, National Security Council staffer Steve Andreason, has \n     publicly stated that this treaty will not prevent countries \n     from obtaining ``simple'' weapons--which can be all too \n     useful for terrorism and blackmail.\n       While the CTBT will not have the benefits the \n     administration claims, it will cost the United States dearly \n     by making it impossible to maintain the U.S. nuclear \n     deterrent over time. That will be the practical and \n     ineluctable effect of denying those responsible for ensuring \n     the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of this deterrent \n     the tool that they have relied upon for the vast majority of \n     the past 55 years: realistic, explosive testing. The \n     exceedingly sophisticated nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal \n     cannot prudently be kept ``on the shelf'' indefinitely. The \n     current average age of these weapons is 14 years; they were \n     only designed to be in service for 20. And none were planned \n     or manufactured to remain viable in a no-test environment.\n       Indeed, experience suggests that problems with the nuclear \n     deterrent probably exist already, going undetected ever since \n     Congress voted to adopt a testing cutoff in 1992. On his last \n     day in office, President Bush formally appealed for relief \n     from this legislation, warning that ``the requirement to \n     maintain and improve the safety of our nuclear stockpile and \n     to evaluate and maintain the reliability of the U.S. forces \n     necessitates continued nuclear testing for those purposes, \n     albeit at a modest level, for the foreseeable future.'' \n     Although President Clinton tends to dissemble on this point, \n     every administration until his recognized that periodic \n     underground testing--at least at low levels of explosive \n     ``yield''--was necessary to detect and fix problems that \n     unexpectedly, but chronically, appear even in relatively new \n     weapons. Hence, no other president since World War II was \n     prepared to accept the sort of permanent, zero-yield ban \n     Clinton has embraced.\n       Moreover, the older the weapon, the more problematic it \n     becomes to certify its safety and reliability through \n     computer simulations alone. As complex nuclear arms age, \n     their exotic metals, chemicals, and highly radioactive \n     materials undergo changes that are exceedingly difficult to \n     predict and model via computer methods. At a minimum, if such \n     weapons are to be retained for the foreseeable future, they \n     must be updated. As then-Assistant Secretary of Energy for \n     Defense Programs Victor Reis told Congress in October 1997, \n     ``Just about all the parts [of the current arsenal's weapons] \n     are going to have to be remade.''\n       There are serious challenges to such a wholesale \n     refurbishing program that even new experimental devices such \n     as those being developed under the administration's more than \n     $45 billion Stockpile Stewardship Program will not be able to \n     address with certainty, at least not for the next decade or \n     so. First, the production lines for building the stockpile's \n     existing bombs and warheads were dismantled long ago. \n     Reconstituting them would require a lot of time and money. \n     And, even if the original designs could be faithfully \n     replicated, one could never be certain they would work \n     according to their specifications without realistic, \n     explosive testing to validate the product.\n       Second, it is impossible to replicate some of the \n     ingredients in weapons designed two decades ago or earlier; \n     key components have become technologically obsolete, and no \n     one would recommend using them when smaller, lighter, \n     cheaper, and more reliable materials and equipment are now \n     readily available. In addition, federal safety and health \n     guidelines now prohibit the use of some of the components \n     utilized in the original designs.\n       Third, most of those who were involved in designing and \n     proving these weapons have left the industrial and laboratory \n     complex, taking with them irreplaceable corporate memory. \n     With continuing nuclear testing, all these problems could \n     presumably be overcome. Without such testing, the United \n     States will be able neither to modernize its nuclear arsenal \n     to meet future deterrent requirements nor to retain the high \n     confidence it requires in the older weapons upon which it \n     would then have to rely for the foreseeable future.\n       It is precisely for these reasons that the CTBT has been, \n     to use Clinton's phrase, the ``longest-sought, hardest-\n     fought'' goal of the anti-nuclear movement. Fortunately, more \n     than 34 senators have figured out that, were it to be \n     ratified, the CTBT would set the United States on the \n     slippery slope to unilateral nuclear disarmament. Whenever \n     the votes are finally tallied on this accord, will the \n     ``nays'' include any of the Senate's self-described New \n     Democrats--whose partisans brought Clinton and Al Gore to \n     power on a platform that prominently featured a more tough-\n     minded approach to national security and defense issues?\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 12, 1999]\n\n                          Time for a CTBT Vote\n\n                        (By Frank Gaffney, Jr.)\n\n       In 23 years of working on nuclear weapons policy and \n     related arms control matters, I have never seen anything like \n     what happened last Thursday. That was the day Sen. Richard \n     Lugar, Indiana Republican, released a six-page press release \n     detailing the myriad and compelling reasons that would cause \n     him to vote against the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n       What makes this development so extraordinary, of course, is \n     that Dick Lugar has an unparalleled reputation in Washington \n     for his commitment to arms control in particular and his \n     willingness more generally to rise above politics in the \n     interest of lending bipartisan heft to foreign policy \n     initiatives he believes to be in the national interest. With \n     apologies to the Smith Barney marketeers, when Mr. Lugar \n     speaks on treaties, people listen.\n       Rarely has it been more important that his Senate \n     colleagues do so. Indeed, the Indiana senator has offered a \n     critique of the CTBT that should be required reading for \n     anyone being asked to vote on this treaty. He summarizes the \n     reasons why he will vote against this treaty as follows:\n       The goal of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is to ban all \n     nuclear explosions worldwide: I do not believe it can \n     succeed. I have little confidence that the verification and \n     enforcement provisions will dissuade other nations from \n     nuclear testing. Furthermore, I am concerned about our \n     country's ability to maintain the integrity and safety of our \n     own nuclear arsenal under the conditions of the treaty.\n       The impact of so withering an assessment--backed up by \n     pages of painstaking analysis--was evident on Sunday as \n     syndicated columnist George Will accomplished the \n     intellectual equivalent of rope-a-dope in an interview with \n     Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on ABC News' ``This \n     Week'' program. Mrs. Albright was reduced to sputtering as \n     Mr. Will read from one section of Sen. Lugar's indictment \n     after another, unable either to challenge the authority of \n     the indicter or effectively to rebut his damning conclusions.\n       Instead, she worked rather tendentiously and unconvincingly \n     through her talking points about how Senate opposition to the \n     CTBT signals that ``We are not as serious about controlling \n     nuclear weapons as we should be.'' Nonsense. To the contrary, \n     the opposition to this treaty can be justified as much on its \n     adverse impact on ``serious'' efforts to control nuclear \n     weapons as on the fact it will undermine the U.S. nuclear \n     deterrent. As Sen. Lugar put it:\n       ``I do not believe that the CTBT is of the same caliber as \n     the arms control treaties that have come before the Senate in \n     recent decades. Its usefulness to the goal of non-\n     proliferation is highly questionable. Its likely \n     ineffectuality will risk undermining support [for] and \n     confidence in the concept of multilateral arms control. Even \n     as a symbolic statement of our desire for a safer world, it \n     is problematic because it would exacerbate risks and \n     uncertainties related to the safety of our nuclear \n     stockpile.''\n\n[[Page S12395]]\n\n       In short, by making it clear the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty is incompatible with U.S. national security \n     requirements and bad for arms control, Richard Lugar has \n     delivered the kiss-of-death to the CTBT. Without his support, \n     it is inconceivable that a two-thirds majority could be found \n     in the Senate to permit ratification of this accord.\n       The question that occurs now is: Since the CTBT is so \n     fatally flawed and so injurious, will the Senate's Republican \n     majority agree to let it continue to bind the United \n     States for the foreseeable future? That would be the \n     practical effect of exercising the option a number of GOP \n     senators (including, it must be noted, Mr. Lugar) hope \n     President Clinton will allow them to exercise--\n     unscheduling the vote this week and deferring further \n     Senate action on the Comprehensive Test Ban until after \n     the 2000 elections, at the earliest.\n       Under international law, that would mean only one thing: \n     Until such time as our government makes it clear the CTBT \n     will not be ratified, the United States will be obligated to \n     take no action that would defeat the ``object and purpose'' \n     of the CTBT. This would mean not only no resumption of \n     testing. Under the Clinton administration, there will \n     certainly be no preparations to conduct explosive tests \n     either--or even actions to stop the steady, lethal erosion of \n     the nation's technical and human capabilities needed to do \n     so.\n       If national security considerations alone were not \n     sufficiently compelling to prompt the Senate leadership to \n     stay the course and defeat the treaty, the conduct of the \n     president and his surrogates should be sufficient inducement. \n     After all, administration spokesmen are using every available \n     platform to denounce Republicans for playing ``political'' \n     games with this treaty. (Never mind that the president and \n     every one of his allies on CTBT in the Senate had a chance to \n     reject the time-agreement that scheduled the vote. As long as \n     they thought their side would prevail, the 14 hours of debate \n     were considered to be sufficient; only when more accurate, \n     and ominous, tallies were taken did the proponents begin to \n     whine there was too little time for hearings and floor \n     deliberation.)\n       Moreover, in refusing to date to commit not to push for a \n     vote in an even more politically charged environment next \n     year, the CTBT's champions are behaving in a manner that can \n     only encourage GOP speculation that the president and his \n     partisans have every intention of using whatever deferral \n     they are granted to campaign against the Republican \n     majority--with the hope not only of changing minds, but \n     changing senators and even control of the Senate in the \n     upcoming election.\n       With Dick Lugar arguing that the zero-yield, permanent \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty must be defeated, Senate \n     Republicans can safely do what is right without fear of \n     serious domestic political repercussions. And, while there \n     will be much bellyaching around the world if the CTBT is \n     rejected by the U.S. Senate, the real, lasting impact will \n     not be to precipitate nuclear proliferation; it is happening \n     now and will intensify no matter what happens on this treaty. \n     Neither will it be to inflict mortal harm or \n     ``embarrassment'' on the presidency. No one could do more to \n     demean that office than the incumbent.\n       Rather, the most important--and altogether desirable--\n     effect will be to re-establish the U.S. Senate as the Framers \n     of the Constitution intended it to be: a co-equal with the \n     president in the making of international treaties; a quality-\n     control agent pursuant to the sacred principles of checks-\n     and-balances on executive authority, one that if exercised \n     stands to strengthen the leverage of U.S. diplomats in the \n     future and assure that the arms control and other treaties \n     they negotiate more closely conform to American security \n     interests. Mr. Lugar put it very well in his formidable press \n     release of last Thursday:\n       ``While affirming our desire for international peace and \n     stability, the U.S. Senate is charged with the constitutional \n     responsibility of making hard judgments about the likely \n     outcomes of treaties. This requires that we examine the \n     treaties in close detail and calculate the consequences of \n     ratification for the present and the future. Viewed in this \n     context, I cannot support the [CTBT's] ratification.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Cline Crosier on my staff be granted the privilege of the floor \nfor the remainder of the debate on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, it was interesting to \nhear my colleague from Delaware. He is correct. I remember those signs, \n``One hydrogen bomb could ruin your day.'' I think the reason we are \nhere today is a second hydrogen bomb that ruined their day. I think we \nneed to make sure they understand we have the capability to respond in \nkind with weapons that will work. I think that is really the subject of \nthe debate.\n  It takes a very confident person to criticize Edward Teller a little \nbit.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, not on his \nscientific assessments, on his political judgment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Right.\n  The Senator from Delaware also said that if you can't verify the \nreliability or certify the reliability, you can always get out of the \ntreaty. That is true. But my concern is, will it be too late to catch \nup at that point? How much time will have elapsed?\n  I wonder sometimes how the results of the cold war might have come \nout had we yielded to all of the arms control pressures and adopted \nevery arms control agreement exactly as it was pushed upon us, not only \nin the Senate but also in the House over the years. I look at arms \ncontrol agreements in the 1960s and 1970s and 1980s. In spite of the \nfact we had a full-scale Soviet expansion throughout the world and \nfull-scale nuclear buildup and absolutely no verification for the most \npart and cheating year after year, time after time we still pushed hard \nfor these arms control agreements.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds for me to respond? \nWe did pass the ABM Treaty, SALT I treaty, the START I treaty, the INF \nTreaty, the CFE Treaty, and we did it during the cold war.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. And the Soviets violated every one of \nthem.\n  Mr. BIDEN. They seem to work.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. They work if you want to accept the fact \nthat they violated it. We got lucky. That is the bottom line. As to the \nviolations that President Reagan said trust but verify, in this \nparticular case, I am not prepared to trust the North Koreans or the \nLibyans or the Iranians or the Iraqis or the Red Chinese, No. 1; and, \nNo. 2, we cannot verify anything they are doing. That has been \ntestified to over and over and over again.\n  I rise in very strong opposition to this Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty and, in doing so, know full well that we have one of the \ngreatest communicators and spinners in American history in the White \nHouse. The idea will be that this will become a political debate in \nthat how could anyone not be in favor of or how could anybody be \nopposed to a comprehensive test ban where we would ban the testing of \nnuclear weapons. That is the way it will be spun.\n  The answer is very simple. Because if you can't verify what the other \nside is doing, then you are at a disadvantage because we have the \nsuperiority of the arsenal. So if we don't verify that they are not \ntesting, and we don't keep our stockpile up to speed because of that, \nand we don't know it is reliable and they do, then we are gradually \nlosing that advantage. That is the issue.\n  In spite of all the spin we will hear over the next day or two after \nthis treaty is voted on, that is the crux of the issue. Let us separate \nthe spin. Let us take the politics out of this. Let us take the spin \nout of it and go right to the heart of it. We can't verify what they \ndo, and if our stockpile is not reliable because we don't test, they \ngain on us.\n\n  The other point is, some of these nations, such as North Korea, might \ndecide to test it on us and think nothing of it. Does anybody feel \nconfident that the Iranians or the Iraqis would feel they had to test a \nnuclear weapon before they tried it on us? I don't feel that confident. \nI certainly don't think many in America do either. This treaty is wrong \nfor our nuclear weapons program. It is wrong for America. It is wrong \nfor the international community. It cannot be verified. It does not \nhelp us in maintaining our own stockpile.\n  Time after time the past several weeks, I have heard members of the \nadministration try to spin this issue and claim that every President \nsince Eisenhower has sought a comprehensive test ban. Basically, that \nis an attempt to hide the truth, to fool the American people into \nthinking this treaty would have had unanimous support from all of those \nPresidents. It wouldn't have had the unanimous support of those \nPresidents. To make those of us who oppose this treaty look as if we \nare standing out on the fringes is simply wrong. Yet that is the way it \nis reported. That is the way it is written. That is the way it will be \nspun tonight, tomorrow, and the next day by members of the \nadministration as they\n\n[[Page S12396]]\n\nmove out on to the talk shows--at taxpayers' expense, I might add--and \ncriticize those of us in the Senate who in good conscience vote against \nthis treaty.\n  What they haven't told the American people about these Presidents is \nthat not one single President--not Eisenhower, not Kennedy, Johnson, \nNixon, Carter, no one, not Reagan--no one until Bill Clinton ever \nproposed a test ban of zero yield and unlimited duration--zero yield, \nunlimited duration.\n  In the past few days, the spin machines have been working overtime \ntelling the American people this issue is far too critical to national \nsecurity for the Senate to make such a rash decision on its \nratification. The administration now wants to pull the treaty, saying \nwe haven't had enough time to study it. For up until a week or two ago, \nthey were pushing us for a vote on it.\n  My colleague from Delaware mentioned the coup in Pakistan, did that \nbother me. No, frankly. I don't think it has a heck of a lot to do with \nthis decision. I don't like to see coups anywhere. They contribute to \nthe instability in the world. But it has nothing to do, in my view, \nwith the issue before us.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues, this treaty was signed by \nPresident Bill Clinton in 1996 and transmitted to the Senate in 1997. \nOver 2 years, we have had this treaty before us. One of the problems I \nhave in the Senate is that it doesn't matter how much time you spend on \nsomething or how long something is before this body; the only time we \ntry to get really involved in it is when we are about to vote on \nsomething. Then those who haven't done their homework want to come out \nhere and say we need more time.\n  We have had plenty of time. I have had 5 years of hearings on this \nissue. I chaired them myself and have listened to people testify for \nthe past 5 years on this issue. I remind my colleagues, just a few \nmonths ago the minority threatened to hold up every single piece of \nlegislation that came to the Senate floor until we agreed to have a \nvote on the test ban treaty. Now they are criticizing us because we are \nhaving one. It was President Clinton and the minority who demanded the \ntreaty be brought before the Senate; it was President Clinton and the \nminority who urged consideration; and it was President Clinton and the \nminority who scolded the majority for failing to act on this issue. \nThat was 2, 3 weeks ago.\n\n  So when things go sour on the President, he has a unique way--and a \nvery good way, frankly--of twisting things around to his benefit. We \nfound that out here on the floor in a very important impeachment vote a \nfew months ago. The President has been demanding a vote on this treaty \nfor 2 years. Now he has it. But now it is our fault because he is not \ngoing to get the vote he wants. The President said in remarks on the \n50th anniversary of the Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in \nAugust, 1999--not too many months ago--``I ask the Senate to vote for \nratification as soon as possible.'' That was 2 months ago. He asked the \nSenate, ``to give its advice and consent to the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty this year.''\n  The problem with the President is, he wants us to give consent, but \nhe doesn't like our advice. That is the problem. The Constitution \nrequires both advice and consent. This President needs to learn that \nthe Senate is here to advise, and if you want the consent, then you \nneed to advise and discuss. That is part of the process. It is part of \nthe process in treaties, and it is part of the process in judicial \nnominations, and it is part of the process in other appointments in his \nadministration. After 7 years, almost, he still hasn't learned that.\n  In his State of the Union, in 1998, President Clinton said, ``Approve \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year.'' That was last year. The \nVice President, Mr. Gore, said, ``The U.S. Congress should act now to \nratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.'' That now was July 23, 1998.\n  Now, because the votes are going against him, he is now saying we \nneed more time, don't vote now. It is just spin at its best, and he is \ngood at it; there is no question about it. That was pure partisan \npolitics because when the majority leader finally consented and offered \nto bring the treaty to the floor, it was objected to. Let's remind the \nAmerican people of that. You can bet the President is not going to \nremind them of that. This treaty was objected to when the majority \nleader asked to bring it to the floor. Then he offered a second time to \nbring the treaty to the floor and this body agreed by unanimous consent \nto a debate and a vote.\n  Let me say again: Unanimously, we agreed to a debate and a vote.\n  The minority party had ample opportunity at that time to object on \nthe grounds that we haven't had enough time to study the treaty. Why \ndidn't they say so then? Because the answer is, that is not the issue. \nWe have had plenty of time to study the treaty. ``We haven't had enough \ntime to have hearings,'' they said. The minority leader objected. Once \nthe President sensed he was going to lose the vote, the spin machine \nbegan and he tried to figure out a way not to vote on what the \nPresident urged us so desperately to schedule in the first place--to \navoid the vote he asked us to have.\n  I agreed with the President then that this treaty deserved \nconsideration by the Senate. I wish we had more chance to advise, but \nhe didn't choose that. So he asked for our consent. As it turns out, we \nare not going to give it to him. That is our constitutional right. It \nshould not be spun and changed. It should be truthfully debated. We are \nall accountable. Some have said they don't want to vote on this treaty. \nI am not one of those people. We are here to be held accountable; we \nare here to vote. That is why we are here. If we disagree, we can vote \nagainst it. If we agree, we can vote for it.\n\n  My objection to this treaty is not based on partisan politics; it is \nbased on careful, thoughtful study of the treaty and its implications \nboth here in the United States and around the world. I believe the \nworld will be more unstable--contrary to the feelings of my colleague \nfrom Delaware--not a more stable place, and America's nuclear deterrent \ncapability will become more unreliable than at any time in the history \nof America if this treaty were to be ratified.\n  There are three points that would support that argument:\n  One, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is not verifiable.\n  Two, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will not stop proliferation.\n  Three--and perhaps most important--the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nputs our nuclear arsenal at risk.\n  My job as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee is to oversee that \narsenal. I have been out to the labs, and I have had 5 or 6 years of \nhearings on these issues. Others will discuss the first two points in \nmore depth than I will, and some have already. Let me focus on the \nthird concern, which is that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is not \nverifiable.\n  Last week, we saw reports in the media that the CIA admitted they \nwere unable to verify key tests that may even be taking place today. We \ncan't base our national security on an ability --which arguably may not \nexist--to detect an adversary's covert activity, and that the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty will not stop proliferation. We already \nhave a treaty in place to do that, the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This \ntreaty has been violated repeatedly, over and over, year after year, by \nrogue nations that don't respect international law.\n  Do you think, with this kind of treaty, that every nation is going to \nhave this great respect for international law and they are going to \nallow us total access to their country to verify this? When are we ever \ngoing to learn? Some have mentioned how futile the treaty would be in \nasking rogue nations not to test the same nuclear weapons they promised \nnot to develop in the first place under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. \nAnd it is false hope that our adversaries will abide by international \nlaw if we just promise to do this treaty.\n  As I mentioned, the safety and reliability of the nuclear arsenal is \nmy most serious concern. Rather than relying solely on the good \nintentions of other countries--and they may be good or they may not \nbe--or on our ability to detect violations by other countries, my \nconcern is ensuring that we remain capable of providing the safeguard \nand nuclear deterrent that won the cold war. That is what won the cold \nwar--\n\n[[Page S12397]]\n\nthe fact that other nations knew what would happen. They knew what \nwould happen if they messed with us; we had the arsenal.\n  The linchpin of this treaty, as I see it, is whether or not you \nbelieve the United States can maintain a safe, credible, and reliable \nnuclear arsenal, given a zero-yield ban in perpetuity. The Stockpile \nStewardship Program is really at the heart of this matter. If you think \nthat we can have a reliable nuclear arsenal, with a zero-yield ban, in \nperpetuity, you should be for this treaty. Even the Secretary of \nDefense, William Cohen, has illustrated this point. This was 2 days \nago. I want this to be listened to carefully. During testimony before \nthe Armed Services Committee.\n\n       Senator Snowe. Would you support ratification of this \n     treaty without the Stockpile Stewardship Program?\n       Secretary Cohen. No.\n       Senator Snowe. No? So then, obviously, you are placing a \n     great deal of confidence in this program.\n       Secretary Cohen. I oppose a unilateral moratorium, without \n     some method of testing for the safety and security and \n     reliability of our nuclear force. The question right now is, \n     does the Stockpile Stewardship Program give us that \n     assurance? If there is doubt about it, then, obviously, you \n     would say we cannot rely upon it and we should go back to \n     testing.\n\n  Let me repeat that last line:\n\n       If there is doubt about it, then, obviously, you would say \n     we cannot rely upon it and we should go back to testing.\n\n  Well, that is a critical point. Which of us would knowingly ratify a \ntreaty that was advertised to put the safety, reliability, and \ncredibility of the United States nuclear deterrent stockpile at risk \nand place the lives of the American people at risk? None of us would do \nthat. Certainly not us, not the Secretary, not anybody. But that is the \nlinchpin. If you believe in the Stockpile Stewardship Program, a series \nof computer simulations and laser experiments--that is what the program \nis, that we don't need to test, and that we do these computer tests and \nlaser experiments--if you think that can sufficiently guarantee the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear weapons program, without testing \nof any kind forever--forever--then you should vote for the treaty \nbecause that is what this is about. As the Senator from Delaware said, \nyou can get out of the treaty, but if you don't like what is going on, \nthen it is too late.\n  If, however, you do not believe that the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram can sufficiently guarantee the safety and reliability of our \nnuclear weapons programs, then you should vote against the treaty.\n  Well--as Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I have \noversight of all three of the Nation's nuclear laboratories--Los \nAlamos, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia. I have been to the labs, I have \nseen the computer simulations, I have talked with the physicists and \nprogrammers. Just last February Senator Landrieu and I traveled to \nLawrence Livermore Lab for a field hearing and a very productive set of \ntours and briefings.\n  Based on my experience--based on what I've seen, I don't have the \nconfidence that the Stockpile Stewardship Program can sufficiently \nguarantee the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons arsenal--\nforever--without any testing of any kind.\n  But don't just take my word for it--after all I'm not a physicist--\nI'm not a nuclear lab director. To settle the question about whether \nthis Stockpile Stewardship Program can guarantee the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear weapons, we must turn to those lab \ndirectors, the men directly responsible for administering, executing, \nand overseeing the Stockpile Program.\n  Those three gentlemen testified before the Armed Services Committee \njust last week, and I think it is absolutely critical to share that \ntestimony with my colleagues as we debate this treaty.\n  Dr. John Browne, Director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, had this \nto say about the condition and reliability of the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram:\n\n       Maintaining the safety and reliability of our nuclear \n     weapons without nuclear testing is an unprecedented technical \n     challenge.\n       The Stockpile Stewardship Program is working successfully \n     toward this goal, but it is a work in progress.\n       There are simply too many processes in a nuclear explosion \n     involving too much physics detail to perform a complete \n     calculation. At present, with the most powerful \n     supercomputers on Earth, we know that we are not doing \n     calculations with sufficient accuracy and with sufficient \n     detail to provide maximum confidence in the stockpile.\n       We know that we do not adequately understand instabilities \n     that occur during the implosion process and we are concerned \n     about the aging of high explosives and plutonium that could \n     necessitate remanufacture of the stockpile.\n       We do not know the details of how this complex, \n     artificially produced metal (plutonium) ages, including \n     whether pits fail gradually, giving us time to replace them \n     with newly manufactured ones, or whether they fail \n     catastrophically in a short time interval that would render \n     many of our weapons unreliable at once.\n       It is important to note that even with a complete set of \n     tools we will not be able to confirm all aspects of weapons \n     safety and performance. Nuclear explosions produce pressures \n     and temperatures that cannot be duplicated in any current or \n     anticipated laboratory facility. Some processes simply cannot \n     be experimentally studied on a small scale because they \n     depend on the specific configuration of material at the time \n     of the explosion.\n       On the basis of our experience in the last 4 years, we \n     continue to be optimistic that we can maintain our nuclear \n     weapons without testing. However, we have identified many \n     issues that increase risk and lower our level of confidence.\n\n  Dr. Bruce Tarter, Director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory \ntestified:\n\n       We have not been able to meet the deadlines of the \n     program as we thought we could.\n       It (the stockpile stewardship program) hasn't been \n     perfect--the challenge lies in the longer term.\n       The stockpile stewardship program is an excellent bet--but \n     it's not a sure thing.\n\n  Dr. Paul Robinson, director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, which \nis responsible for the engineering of more than 90 percent of the \ncomponent parts of all U.S. nuclear warheads, provided an even more \nominous testimony.\n\n       There is no question from a technical point of view, actual \n     testing of designs to confirm their performance is the \n     desired regimen for any high-technology device.\n       For a device as highly consequential as a nuclear weapon, \n     testing of the complete system both when it is first \n     developed and periodically throughout its lifetime to ensure \n     that aging effects do not invalidate its performance, is also \n     the preferred methodology.\n       I could not offer a proof, nor can anyone, that such an \n     alternative means of certifying the adequacy of the U.S. \n     stockpile will be successful. I believe then as I do now that \n     it may be possible to develop the stockpile stewardship \n     approach as a substitute for nuclear testing for keeping \n     previously tested nuclear weapon designs safe and reliable. \n     However, this undertaking is an enormous challenge which no \n     one should underestimate, and will carry a higher level of \n     risk than at any time in the past.\n       The difficulty we face is that we cannot today guarantee \n     that stockpile stewardship will be ultimately successful; nor \n     can we guarantee that it will be possible to prove that it is \n     successful.\n       Confidence in the reliability and safety of the U.S. \n     nuclear weapons stockpile will eventually decline without \n     nuclear testing.\n       The stockpile stewardship program--though essential for \n     continual certification of the stockpile--does not provide a \n     guarantee of perpetual certifiability.\n       I have always said actual testing is preferred method--to \n     do otherwise is acceptable risk.\n       I cannot ensure the program will mature in time to ensure \n     safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile in \n     the future.\n       I have always felt if you are betting your country--you \n     better be conservative.\n\n  I find this testimony absolutely chilling. I am not willing to ``Bet \nmy country'' on the stockpile stewardship program. America's lab \ndirectors who are directly responsible for the execution of the \nstockpile stewardship program testified before Congress that this \nprogram cannot guarantee the future security or stability or our \nnuclear weapons. I am not willing to accept any risk. I will not risk \nthe lies of the American people on a program who's director--empowered \nby the President with the responsibility for running that program--are \nso very uncertain about its reliability.\n  On the basis of the expert testimony of these three lab Directors \nalone, if any Senators had any doubt about how they would vote on this \ntreaty--it should now be gone!\n  And I cannot for the life of me understand why the President would \nask the Senate to ratify a treaty that lives or dies based on the \nstockpile stewardship program--a program that our lab Directors are \ntelling us they cannot guarantee!\n\n  If we ratify this treaty, there is a very high probability we will \nhave to start looking for a way out of it within 10-15 years--maybe \neven sooner. I don't\n\n[[Page S12398]]\n\nunderstand entering into a treaty you know full well you may have to \npull out of almost as soon as it goes into effect.\n  Now, supporters of the treaty will point out that if in fact the lab \nDirectors, and the Secretary of Energy all agree in 10 years that the \nstockpile stewardship isn't working, the President, in consultation \nwith Congress, can just pull us out of the treaty.\n  Well, treaties tend to take on a life of their own, and I do not \nbelieve it would be that easy. Just look at the ABM Treaty of 1972. Our \nco-signer, the U.S.S.R. doesn't even exist anymore, and although there \nis overwhelming agreement between the defense and intelligence \ncommunities, and the American public, that our national interests are \nat stake, the President still opposes pulling out of the ABM Treaty!\n  The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty of 1968 are two more examples. These treaties have both been \nviolated. But have we pulled out of either one despite the legal right \nto do so--absolutely not!\n  My friends and colleagues, it makes no sense to ratify a treaty that \nour own nuclear experts tell us we may have to negotiate a way out of \nwithin a decade.\n  This treaty is dangerous and ill-advised. It places our nuclear \nstockpile, and hence our nuclear deterrent capability, at considerable \nrisk. This treaty is bad for America, and it is bad for the \ninternational community, and I will vote against it.\n  That is if I'm given the opportunity to vote against it. While Senate \nDemocrats and the White House are back pedaling furiously, some in the \nSenate are anxious to rescue them from their miscalculation and deliver \nthem from a major legislative defeat. It might be tempting to view this \nas a ``win-win'' situation for those who oppose the treaty. The \nreasoning goes like this: If we effectively kill this flawed treaty \nwithout a vote, we will have forced the White House to back down, and \nhave won without letting the White House accuse us of killing the \ntreaty. This is superficially appealing. But it is a strategy for, at \nbest, a half-victory, and at worst, a partial defeat.\n  Postponing a vote on the CTBT will allow the White House to claim \nvictory in saving the treaty, and will allow the White House to \ncontinue to spin the American people by blaming opponents for not \nratifying the treaty. There is no conservative victory in that.\n  Every single Senator knows today how he or she will vote on this \ntreaty. More debate and more hearings won't change that. It's time to \nput partisan politics aside and stand firm on our beliefs. The die is \ncast, and Republicans and Democrats alike have staked out their \npositions. It's time for Senators to stand by those positions and vote \ntheir conscience. Mr. President, I oppose postponing the vote on this \ntreaty, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I feel obliged to observe that the United States has \nalready flirted with an end to nuclear testing--from 1958 to 1961. It \nbears remembering that the nuclear moratorium ultimately was judged to \nconstitute an unacceptable risk to the nation's security, and was \nterminated after just three years. On the day that President Kennedy \nended the ban--March 2, 1962--he addressed the American people and \nsaid:\n\n       We know enough about broken negotiations, secret \n     preparations, and the advantages gained from a long test \n     series never to offer again an uninspected moratorium. Some \n     urge us to try it again, keeping our preparations to test in \n     a constant state of readiness. But in actual practice, \n     particularly in a society of free choice, we cannot keep top \n     flight scientists concentrating on the preparation of an \n     experiment which may or may not take place on an uncertain \n     date in the future. Nor can large technical laboratories be \n     kept fully alert on a standby basis waiting for some other \n     nation to break an agreement. This is not merely difficult or \n     inconvenient--we have explored this alternative thoroughly \n     and found it impossible of execution.\n\n  This statement is very interesting. It makes clear that the \nfundamental problems posed by a test ban remain unchanged over the past \n27 years. The United States certainly faces a Russian Federation that \nis engaging in ``secret preparations'' and likely is engaging in \nclandestine nuclear tests relating to the development of brand-new, \nlow-yield nuclear weapons. The United States, on the other hand, cannot \nengage in such nuclear modernization while adhering to the CTBT.\n  Likewise, the Senate is faced with the same verification problem that \nit encountered in 1962. As both of President Clinton's former \nintelligence chiefs have warned, low-yield testing is undetectable by \nseismic sensors. Nor does the United States have any reasonable chance \nof mobilizing the ludicrously high number of votes needed under the \ntreaty to conduct an on-site inspection. In other words, the treaty is \nunverifiable and there is no chance that cheaters will ever be caught.\n  This is not my opinion. This is a reality, given that 30 of 51 \ncountries on the treaty's governing board must approve any on-site \ninspection. Even the President's own senior arms controller--John \nHolum--complained in 1996 that ``treaty does not contain . . . our \nposition that on-site inspections should proceed automatically unless \ntwo-thirds of the Executive Council vote ``no.'' Instead of an \nautomatic green light for inspections, the U.S. got exactly the \nopposite of what it requested.\n  But most importantly, in 1962 President Kennedy correctly noted that \nthe inability to test has a pernicious and corrosive effect--not just \nupon the weapons themselves (which cannot be fully remanufactured under \nsuch circumstances)--but upon the nation's nuclear infrastructure. Our \nconfidence in the nuclear stockpile is eroding even as we speak. Again, \nthis is not my opinion. It is a fact which has been made over and over \nagain by the nation's senior weapons experts.\n  In 1995, the laboratory directors compiled the following two charts \nwhich depict two simple facts: (1) that even with a successful science-\nbased program, confidence will not be as high as it could be with \nnuclear testing; and (2) even if the stockpile stewardship program is \ncompletely successful by 2010, the United States will not be able to \ndesign new weapons, and will not be able to make certain types of \nnuclear safety assessments and stockpile replacements.\n  Senators will notice that, on both charts, there is mention of ``HN'' \n(e.g. hydronuclear) and 500 ton tests. The laboratory directors, in a \njoint statement to the administration in 1995, said: ``A strong \nStockpile Stewardship and Management Program is necessary to underwrite \nconfidence. A program of 500-ton experiments would significantly reduce \nthe technical risks.''\n  This judgment has not changed over the past several years. Both \nweapons laboratory directors stated in 1997 that nuclear testing would \ngive the United States greater confidence in the stockpile.\n  So as I listen to these claims that the United States is ``out of the \ntesting business,'' I make two basic observations. First, we are only \nout of the testing business because President Clinton has taken us out. \nThere is no legal barrier today to conducting stockpile experiments. \nThe reason is purely political. Indeed, the White House is using \ncircular logic. The United States is not testing because the White \nHouse supports the test ban treaty; but the White House is claiming \nthat because we are not testing, we should support the treaty.\n  Second, I remind all that the United States thought it was out of the \ntesting business in 1958, only to discover how badly we had \nmiscalculated. President Kennedy not only ended the 3-year moratorium, \nbut embarked upon the most aggressive test series in the history of the \nweapons program. If Senators use history as their guide, they will \nrealize that the CTBT is a serious threat to the national security of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my very grave \nconcerns over the path down which we are heading. The United States \nSenate is on the verge of voting down a treaty the intent of which is \nconsistent with U.S. national security objectives, but the letter and \ntiming of which are fraught with serious implications for our security \nover the next decade.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against ratifying the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty. This is not a vote I take lightly. I am not ideologically \nopposed to arms control, having voted to ratify the START Treaty and \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention. But, my concerns about the flaws in \nthis Treaty's drafting and in the administration's plan for\n\n[[Page S12399]]\n\nmaintaining the viability of the stockpile leave me no other choice.\n  On October 5, Henry Kissinger, John Deutch and Brent Scowcroft wrote \nto the majority and minority leaders stating their serious concerns \nwith the Senate's voting on the treaty so far in advance of our being \nable to implement its provisions and relying solely on the Stockpile \nStewardship Program. They noted that ``. . . few, if any, of the \nbenefits envisaged by the treaty's advocates could be realized by \nSenate ratification now. At the same time, there could be real costs \nand risks to a broad range of national security interests--including \nour nonproliferation objectives--if [the] Senate acts prematurely.'' \nThese are sage words that should not be taken lightly by either party \nin the debate on ratification.\n  In the post-cold-war era, a strong consensus exists that \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is our single greatest \nnational security concern. Unfortunately, a ban on nuclear testing, \nespecially when verification issues are so poorly addressed, as in this \ntreaty, will not prevent other countries from developing nuclear \nweapons. A number of countries have made major strides in developing \nnuclear weapons without testing. South Africa and Pakistan both built \nnuclear stockpiles without testing; North Korea may very well have one \nor two crude nuclear weapons sufficient for its purposes; and Iraq was \nperilously close to becoming a nuclear state at the time it invaded \nKuwait. Iran has an active nuclear weapons program, and Brazil and \nArgentina were far along in their programs before they agreed to \nterminate them. Testing is not necessary to have very good confidence \nthat a first generation nuclear weapon will work, as the detonation \nover Hiroshima, utilizing a design that had never been tested, \ndemonstrated more than half-a-century ago.\n  Whenever an arms control agreement is debated, the issue of \nverification rightly assumes center stage. That is entirely \nappropriate, as the old adage that arms control works best when it is \nneeded least continues to hold true. That the leaders of Great Britain, \nFrance, and Germany support ratification is less important than what is \ngoing on inside the heads of the leaders of Russia, China, India, \nPakistan, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. We don't need arms control \nagreements with our friends; we pursue arms control as a way of \nminimizing the threat from those countries that may not have our \nnational interests at heart. Some of the countries with active nuclear \nweapons programs clearly fall into that category. On that count, the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty falls dangerously short.\n  In order to fully comprehend the complexity of the verification \nissue, it is important to understand the distinction between monitoring \nand verifying. Monitoring is a technical issue. It is the use of a \nvariety of means of gather information--in other words, detecting that \nan event took place. Verification, however, is a political process.\n  Even if we assume that compliance with the treaty can be monitored--\nand I believe very strongly, based in part on the CIA's recent \nassessment, that that is not the case--we are left with the age-old \nquestion posed most succinctly some 40 years ago by Fred Ikle: After \nDetection--What? What are we to make of a verification regime that is \nfar from prepared to handle the challenges it will confront. For \nexample, we are potentially years from an agreement among signatories \non what technologies will be employed for monitoring purposes. More \nimportantly, the treaty requires 30 disparate countries to agree to a \nchallenge on-site inspection when 19 allies couldn't agree on how to \nconduct air strikes against Yugoslavia?\n  Furthermore, we are being asked to accept arguments on verification \nby an administration that swept under the rug one of the most egregious \ncases of proliferation this decade, the November 1992 Chinese transfer \nof M-11 missiles to Pakistan, and that continues to cling tenaciously \nto the ABM Treaty despite the scale of global change that has occurred \nover the last 10 years.\n  In determining whether to support this treaty at this time, it is \nessential that we examine the continued importance of nuclear weapons \nto our national security. Last week's testimony by our nuclear weapons \nlab directors that the Stockpile Stewardship Program will not be a \nreliable alternative to nuclear testing for five to 10 years is a clear \nand unequivocal statement that ratification of this treaty is \ndangerously premature. General John Vessey noted in his letter to the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee that the unique role of the \nUnited States in ensuring the ultimate security of our friends and \nallies, obviating their requirement for nuclear forces in the process, \nremains dependent upon our maintenance of a modern, safe and reliable \nnuclear deterrent. As General Vessey pointed out, ``the general \nknowledge that the United States would do whatever was necessary to \nmaintain that condition certainly reduced the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons during the period and added immeasurably to the security \ncooperation with our friends and allies.'' This sentiment was also \nexpressed by former Secretaries of Defense Schlesinger, Cheney, \nCarlucci, Weinberger, Rumsfeld, and Laird, when they emphasized the \nimportance of the U.S. nuclear umbrella and its deterrent value \nrelative not just to nuclear threats, but to chemical and biological \nones as well.\n\n  The immensely important role that a viable nuclear deterrent \ncontinues to play in U.S. national security strategy requires the \nUnited States to be able to take measures relative to our nuclear \nstockpile that are currently precluded by the Test Ban Treaty. Our \nstockpile is older today than at any previous time and has far fewer \ntypes of warheads--a decrease from 30 to nine--than it did 15 years \nago. A fault in one will require removing all of that category from the \nstockpile. The military typically grounds or removes from service all \nof a specific weapons system or other equipment when a serious problem \nis detected. Should they act differently with nuclear warheads? \nObviously not.\n  Finally, this treaty will actually prevent us from making our nuclear \nweapons safer. Without testing, we will not be able to make essential \nsafety improvements to our aging stockpile--a stockpile that has \nalready gone seven years without being properly and thoroughly tested.\n  I hope the time does arrive when a comprehensive ban on nuclear \ntesting will be consistent with our national security requirements. We \nare simply not yet there. I will consider supporting a treaty when \nalternative means of ensuring safety and reliability are proven, and \nwhen a credible verification regime is proposed. Until then, the risks \ninherent in the administration's program preclude my adopting a more \nfavorable stance.\n  These are the reasons that I must vote against ratification of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty at this time. The viability of our \nnuclear deterrent is too central to our national security to rush \napproval of a treaty that cannot be verified and that will facilitate \nthe decline of that deterrent. Preferably, this vote would be delayed \nuntil a more appropriate time, but, barring that, I cannot support \nratification right now.\n  The operative phrase, though, is ``right now.'' The concept of a \nglobal ban on testing has considerable merit. Defeating the treaty \nwould not only imperil our prospects of attaining that objective at \nsome future point, it would in all likelihood send a green light to \nprecisely those nations we least want to see test that it is now okay \nto do so. Such a development, I think we can all agree, is manifestly \nnot in our national interest.\n  In articulating his reasons for continuing to conduct nuclear tests, \nthen-President Kennedy stated that, ``If our weapons are to be more \nsecure, more flexible in their use and more selective in their impact--\nif we are to be alert to new breakthroughs, to experiment with new \ndesigns--if we are to maintain our scientific momentum and leadership--\nthen our weapons progress must not be limited to theory or to the \nconfines of laboratories and caves.'' This is not an obsolete \nsentiment. It rings as true today as when President Kennedy uttered \nthose words 37 years ago.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate debates an arms control \ntreaty of idealistic intent, vague applicability, and undetermined \neffects. Given today's state of scientific, geopolitical and military \naffairs, I must vote against the resolution of ratification of\n\n[[Page S12400]]\n\nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a treaty that will lower confidence \nin our strategic deterrent while creating an international regime that \ndoes not guarantee an increase in this country's security.\n  On balance--and these matters are often concluded on balance, as \nrarely are we faced with clear-cut options--it is my reasoned \nconclusion that the CTBT does not advance the security of this nation.\n  Some people think that, by passing the CTBT, we will be preventing \nthe horrors of nuclear war in the future. There is great emotional \ncontent to this argument.\n  But in deliberations about a matter so grave, I had to apply a \nrational, logical analysis to the affairs of nations as I see them. \nAnd, on reflecting on half a century of the nuclear era, I can only \nconclude that it is the nuclear strategic deterrent of this country \nthat is the single most important factor in explaining why this country \nhas not been challenged in a major military confrontation on our \nterritory. We emerged victorious from the cold war without ever \nengaging in a global ``hot'' war.\n  Despite the security we have bought with our nuclear deterrent, the \nworld we live in today is more dangerous than the cold war era. Today, \nwe are faced with the emergence of new international threats. These \ninclude rogue states, such as Iraq, Sudan, and North Korea; \nindependent, substate international terrorists, such as Osama bin \nLaden; and international criminal organizations that may facilitate \nfunds and, perhaps, nuclear materials to flow between these actors. \nSome of these actors, of course, can and have developed the ``poor \nman's'' nukes, as they are called: biological and chemical weapons.\n  It is to the credit of the serious proponents of this treaty that \nthey have not argued that this treaty can effectively prevent these new \nactors on the global scene from developing primitive nuclear weapons--\nwhich can be built without tests. The CTBT does not prevent them from \nstealing or buying tactical nuclear weapons that slip unsecured out of \nRussian arsenals. The CTBT cannot prevent or even detect low-yield \ntesting by rogue states which have a record of acting like treaties \naren't worth the paper they're written on. These are the threats we \nface today.\n  In this new threat environment, the proponents of this treaty suggest \nthat we abandon testing to determine the reliability of our weapons, to \nincrease their safety, and to modernize our arsenal.\n  Yet we have recent historical evidence that our nuclear deterrent is \na key factor in dealing with at least some of these actors. Recall \nthat, in the gulf war, Saddam Hussein did not use his chemical and \nbiological weapons against the international coalition. This was not \nbecause Saddam Hussein was respecting international norms. It was \nsolely because he knew the United States had a credible nuclear \ndeterrent that we reserved the right to use.\n  Proponents of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty argue that scientific \ntests at the sub-critical level can replace testing as the methodology \nto ensure the reliability and safety of our nuclear arsenal, which, we \nall know, has not been tested since 1992. The question of reliability \nof our deterrent is absolutely essential to this nation's security. And \nyet the proponents of our science-based alternative program to \ntesting--known as the Stockpile Stewardship Program--all acknowledge \nthat this critical replacement to testing is not in place today and \nwill not be fully developed until sometime in the next decade.\n  Even if the Stockpile Stewardship Program is fully operational in \n2005, as the most optimistic representations suggest, that will be more \nthan 10 years since we have had our last tests. After a decade of no \ntesting, the confidence in our weapons will have declined. Throughout \nthis period, we will be relying on a scientific regime whose evolution \nand effectiveness we can only hope for.\n  This is the concern of numerous national security experts, and their \nconclusions were not supportive of the CTBT. Addressing this central \nissue, six former Secretaries of defense (Schlesinger, Cheney, \nCarlucci, Weinberger, Rumsfeld, Laird) said:\n\n       The Stockpile Stewardship Program, which will not be mature \n     for at least 10 years, will improve our scientific \n     understanding of nuclear weapons and would likely mitigate \n     the decline in our confidence in the safety and reliability \n     of our arsenal. We will never know whether we should trust \n     the Stockpile Stewardship if we cannot conduct tests to \n     calibrate the unproven new techniques.\n\n  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former National Security \nAdvisor Brent Scowcroft, and former Director of Central Intelligence \nJohn Deutch said recently:\n\n       But the fact is that the scientific case simply has not \n     been made that, over the long term, the United States can \n     ensure the nuclear stockpile without nuclear testing . . . \n     The Stockpile Stewardship Program is not sufficiently mature \n     to evaluate the extent to which it can be a suitable \n     alternative to testing.\n\n  I hasten to point out that the experts who have spoken against the \nCTBT have served in Republican and Democratic Administrations. \nSecretary Kissinger served in the Nixon administration, for example, \nwhich negotiated the Threshold Test Ban Treaty banning tests above 150 \nkilotons. This treaty was ratified during the Bush Administration. John \nDeutch, as we all know, was head of the CIA in the present \nAdministration.\n  I support the Stockpile Stewardship Program, and will continue to \nsupport it. There may be a day when my colleagues and I can be \nconvinced that science-based technology can ensure the reliability and \nsafety of our arsenal to a level that matches what we learn through \ntesting. That would be a time to responsibly consider a Comprehensive \nTest Ban. And that time is not now.\n  This central point on the reliability of our nuclear deterrent has \nnot escaped the public's view of the current debate. Utahns have \napproached me on both sides of the argument.\n  Yes, we have seen numerous polls that suggest that the public \nsupports the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. When people are asked, ``do \nyou support a global ban on nuclear testing?'' majorities respond \naffirmatively. However, when people are asked, as some more specific \npolls have done, ``Do you believe our nuclear arsenal has kept this \ncountry free from attack?'' the majority always answers overwhelmingly \naffirmatively. When asked whether we need to continue to rely on a \nnuclear deterrent, the answer is always overwhelmingly affirmative, as \nit is when the public is asked whether we need to maintain reliability \nin our nuclear deterrent. Once again, I find the public more \nsophisticated than they are often given credit for.\n  When I speak with people about the limits of monitoring this global \nban, and the numerous methods and technologies available to parties \nthat wish to evade detection, confidence in the CTBT falls even lower. \nThe fact is--and, once again, the proponents of the treaty concede \nthis--that a zero-yield test ban treaty is unverifiable.\n  Small but militarily significant tests--that is, 500-ton tests, \nsignificant to the development and improvement of nuclear weapons--will \nnot always be detectable. Higher yield tests--such as 5 kilotons--can \nbe disguised by the techniques known as ``decoupling,'' where \ndetonations are set in larger, either natural or specially constructed, \nsubterranean settings.\n  Today we are uncertain about a series of suspicious events that have \noccurred recently in Russia, a country that has not signed the CTBT. \nSome Russian officials have suggested that they would interpret the \nCTBT to allow for certain levels of nuclear tests, a view inimical to \nthe Clinton administration's proponents of the CTBT. These are \ntroubling questions, Mr. President, which should cast great doubt on \nthe hopes of the proponents of the CTBT.\n  But the proponents say, under a CTBT regime we could demand an on-\nsite inspection. But the on-site inspection regime is, by the terms of \nthe treaty, weak. It is a ``red-light'' system, which means that \nmembers of the Executive Council of the Conference of States Parties \nmust vote to get affirmative permission to inspect--and the vote will \nrequire a super-majority of 30 of 51 members of the Council for \npermission to conduct an inspection. The terms of the treaty allow for \nnumerous obstructions by a member subject to inspection. Some of these \ncodified instructions appear to have come out of\n\n[[Page S12401]]\n\nSaddam Hussein's play book for defeating UNSCOM.\n  Some have suggested that Senate rejection of this treaty, which seems \nlikely, will undermine this country's global leadership. It is said \nthat, if we fail to ratify, critical states will not ratify the treaty. \nThis assertion strikes me as highly suppositious.\n  Since the end of World War II, there are very few instances of the \nUnited States using its nuclear threat explicitly. Besides the Soviet \nUnion, locked in a bipolar global competition with us until its \ncollapse in 1991, other nations' decision to develop nuclear programs \nwere based, not on following ``U.S. leadership,'' but on their \nperception of regional balances of power, or on their desire to \nestablish global status with a strategic weapon. Their decisions to \ncease testing will be similarly based.\n\n  The CTBT, it is argued, will prevent China from further modernizing \nits nuclear forces. It would be more accurate, in my opinion, to state \nthat the treaty, if it works as its proponents wish, may constrain \nChina from testing the designs for nuclear warheads it has gained \nthrough espionage. The debate over future military developments always \nhinges on the distinction between intentions and capabilities. China's \ncurrent nuclear capabilities are modest, although it has a handful of \nwarheads and the means to deliver them to the North American continent.\n  But I have to ask: Are the analysts in the Clinton administration \nconfident that China's intentions are consistent with a view embodied \nin the CTBT that would lock China into substantive nuclear inferiority \nto the United States?\n  Is that what their espionage was about? Or their veiled threats--such \nas the famous ``walk-in'' in 1995, when a PRC agent showed us their \nnew-found capabilities? And how about the PRC's explicit threat to rain \nmissiles on Los Angeles? That was a reflection on intentions.\n  Those of us who study intentions and capabilities of such a key \ngeopolitical competitor as China know that their capabilities are far \ninferior to us. But you have to wonder, based on their statements and \nother actions, whether the Chinese are willing to accept the current \nstrategic balance that would be locked in with the CTBT.\n  And, does it make sound strategic sense for the defense of our \ncountry that the United States, in effect, unilaterally disarms our \ntechnological superiority by freezing our ability to modernize and \ntest?\n  When we freeze our deterrent capability, we are, in effect, \nabandoning America's technological edge and mortgaging that \ndeteriorating edge on the belief and hope that all of our geopolitical \ncompetitors will do the same. This reflects a view of the world that is \nfar more optimistic than I believe is prudent. A substantial dose of \nskepticism should be required when thinking about the defense of our \ncountry.\n  To address these concerns, the administration has waived ``Safeguard \nF,'' which it will attach to the treaty. This addendum states that it \nis its understanding that if the Secretaries of Defense and Energy \ninform the President that ``a high level of confidence in the safety or \nreliability of a nuclear weapon type which the two Secretaries consider \nto be critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, \nthe President, in consultation with Congress, would be prepared to \nwithdraw from the CTBT under the standard ``supreme national \ninterests'' clause in order to conduct whatever testing might be \nrequired.''\n  This vaguely worded escape clause is the manifestation of what is \nknown in international law as rebus sic stantibus. This famous \nexpression is attributed to Bismark, who declared: ``At the bottom of \nevery treaty is written in invisible ink--rebus sic stantibus--`until \ncircumstances change'.'' This is a recognition common in international \nlaw, and now manifest in black-and-white in ``Safeguard F,'' that \nagreements hold only as long as the fundamental conditions and \nexpectations that existed at the time of their creation hold.\n  The fundamental conditions that the CTBT seeks to address are where \nmy fundamental reservations lie. There are too many factors that we \ncannot control and that will not be restrained by the best intentions \nof a testing freeze.\n  The world is changing, and alliances are subtly changing. \nGeopolitical competitors such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea \nare undergoing radical--radical--social changes that are demonstrably \naffecting their governments, foreign policies, and militaries. An \nagreement on a test ban freeze today does not reconcile with these \nrealities.\n  Even the most stalwart proponents of the treaty can only argue that \nU.S. ratification of the treaty may influence other states' behaviors. \nThat is a hope, not a certainty. The need for a reliable nuclear \ndeterrent, last tested in 1992, remains a certainty. I firmly believe \nthat the CTBT will not control these external realities. While some \ncountries may see a test ban regime in their interests, others, \nmotivated not by the norms we hope for in the international community, \nbut by the more historic realities of national interest and \ncompetition, may not.\n  The timing is simply wrong to pass this treaty. The science has not \nbeen sufficiently reassuring, and global developments have not been \nencouraging.\n  I must admit that my ongoing concerns about this administration's \nunderstanding of the world do not promote confidence in their support \nfor this treaty. Under this administration, we have seen a precipitous \ndecline in the funding of the military; we have seen an unacceptable \nresistance to missile defense; we have seen that it was Congress that \nhad to promote sanctions on nuclear and missile proliferation from \nRussian firms spreading nuclear and missile technology to rough states. \nAll of this belies confidence.\n  Combine this with a lack of confidence in the science-based \nalternative to testing promoted by the administration, which even its \nsupporters recognize is not up to speed, and I must conclude that it is \nagainst the U.S. national interest to vote for the CTBT.\n  This vote is not about the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is \nabout whether the nuclear deterrent that has kept this country secure \nfor half a century and will keep this country secure for the \nforeseeable future.\n  Deterrence is not static, it is dynamic. The world is not static, it \nis unpredictable and dangerous. The CTBT is an attempt to impose a \nstatic arms control environment--to freeze our advantage--while \ngambling that our competitors abide by the same freeze. Today, that is \nunsound risk.\n  I will vote to oppose the resolution of ratification of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Signed by the President on \nSeptember 24, 1996, and submitted to the Senate approximately one year \nlater, the CTBT bans all nuclear explosions for an unlimited duration.\n  Every member of the Senate would like to strengthen the national \nsecurity of the United States. Every member of the Senate would like to \nleave this country more safe and secure. There are time-honored \nprinciples which undergrid genuine security, however. As George \nWashington stated over two centuries ago, ``There is nothing so likely \nto produce peace as to be well prepared to meet an enemy.'' Washington \nbelieved that if we wanted peace, we must be prepared to defend our \ncountry.\n  The CTBT is not based on the national security principles of \nWashington or any other President who used strength and preparedness to \nprotect our way of life and advance liberty around the globe. This \ntreaty is based on an illusion of arms control, dependent on the \nunverifiable good will of signatory nations--some of which are openly \nhostile to the United States. The CTBT will do nothing to stop \ndetermined states from developing nuclear weapons and will degrade the \nreadiness of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. The U.S. nuclear arsenal is \nstill the most powerful deterrent to aggression against the United \nStates, but this treaty would place the reliability of that arsenal in \nquestion.\n  Is such a step worth the risk? What does the CTBT give us in return? \nIs the treaty really the powerful weapon in the war against \nproliferation that the Administration claims? Several critical \ndeficiencies of the CTBT make this treaty a genuine threat to U.S. \nnational security.\n  First, the monitoring system of the treaty will not be able to detect \nmany nuclear tests. The International Monitoring System (IMS) of the \nCTBT is designed to detect nuclear blasts greater\n\n[[Page S12402]]\n\nthan one kiloton, but tests with a smaller blast yield may be used to \nvalidate or advance nuclear weapons designs. Tests larger than one \nkiloton can be masked through certain testing techniques. By testing \nunderground, for example, the blast yield from a nuclear test can be \nreduced by a factor of 70. The bottom line is that countries will be \nable to continue testing under this treaty and not be detected.\n  The unverifiability of the CTBT was highlighted by the Washington \nPost on October 3, 1999. In an article entitled ``CIA Unable to \nPrecisely Track Testing,'' Roberto Suro writes that ``the Central \nIntelligence Agency has concluded that it cannot monitor low-level \nnuclear tests by Russia precisely enough to ensure compliance with the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. . .'' Twice last month, Russia may have \nconducted nuclear tests, but the CIA was unable to make a \ndetermination, according the Post article.\n  Senator John Warner, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, is quoted in the Post article concerning a broader pattern \nof Russian deception with regard to nuclear testing. According to a \nmilitary assessment mentioned in the Post, Russia has conducted \nrepeated tests over the past 18 months to develop a low-yield nuclear \nweapon to counter U.S. superiority in precision guided munitions.\n  Such behavior reinforces the central point that proponents of the \nCTBT seem to miss in this debate. When nations have to choose between \nthe communal bliss of international disarmament or pursuing their \nnational interest, they follow their national interest. Countries such \nas Russia have the best of both worlds with an unverifiable treaty like \nthe CTBT: Russia can continue to test without being caught and the U.S. \nnuclear arsenal cannot be maintained or modernized and eventually \ndeteriorates over time.\n  A second critical problem with the CTBT is that countries do not have \nto test to develop nuclear weapons. The case of India and Pakistan \nprovides perhaps the best example that a ban on nuclear testing can be \nirrelevant. Pakistan developed nuclear explosive devices without any \ndetectable testing, and India advanced its nuclear program without \ntesting for twenty-five years.\n  Proliferation in South Asia also lends itself to a broader discussion \nof this Administration's nonproliferation record. The Administration's \nrhetoric on the CTBT has been strong in recent weeks, but has the \nAdministration always been as committed to stop proliferation?\n  The case of Pakistan is particularly illustrative of this \nAdministration's flawed approach to nonproliferation and arms control. \nIn an unusually candid report in 1997, the CIA confirmed China's role \nas the ``principal supplier'' of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. \nAlthough the Administration has been careful to use milder language in \nsubsequent proliferation reports, China is suspected of continuing such \nassistance. Rather than take consistent steps to punish Chinese \nproliferation, however, the Administration is pushing a treaty to stop \nnuclear testing--testing which is not needed for the development of \nnuclear weapons in the first place.\n  This Administration would have more credibility in the area of \nnonproliferation if it had been taking aggressive steps to punish \nproliferators and defend America's interests over the last seven years. \nWhen China transfers complete M-11 missiles to Pakistan, this \nAdministration turns a blind eye. When China is identified by the CIA \nin 1997 as the ``. . . the most significant supplier of WMD-related \ngoods and technology to foreign countries,'' the Administration rewards \nChina with a nuclear cooperation agreement in 1998.\n\n  These severe lapses in U.S. nonproliferation policy cannot be covered \nover with the parchment of another unverifiable arms control treaty.\n  A third problem with the CTBT is that it places the reliability of \nthe U.S. nuclear arsenal at risk. While other countries can develop \nsimple nuclear weapons without testing, such tests are critically \nimportant for the maintenance and modernization of highly sophisticated \nU.S. nuclear weapons. In that it forbids testing essential to ensure \nthe readiness of the U.S. stockpile, the CTBT is really a back door to \nnuclear disarmament. The preamble of the CTBT itself states that the \nprohibition on nuclear testing is ``a meaningful step in the \nrealization of a systematic process to achieve nuclear disarmament . . \n.''\n  Proponents of the CTBT argue that we have the technology and \nexpertise to ensure the readiness of our nuclear arsenal through the \nStockpile Stewardship Program. The truth of the matter is that only \ntesting can ensure that our nuclear weapons are being maintained, not \ncomputer modeling and careful archiving of past test results. As Dr. \nRobert Barker, a strategic nuclear weapons designer and principal \nadvisor to the Secretary of Defense on all nuclear weapons matters from \n1986-92, stated, ``. . . sustained nuclear testing . . . is the only \ndemonstrated way of maintaining a safe and reliable nuclear \ndeterrent.''\n  Dr. James Schlesinger, a former Secretary of the Defense and Energy \nDepartments, is one of the most competent experts to speak on the \nnational security implications of the CTBT and the Stockpile \nStewardship Program. His comments on the Stockpile Stewardship Program \nshould be heeded by every Senator. In testimony before Congress, Dr. \nSchlesinger stated that the erosion of confidence in our nuclear \nstockpile would be substantial over several decades. Dr. Schlesinger \nstates that ``In a decade or so, we will be beyond the expected shelf \nlife of the weapons in our nuclear arsenals, which was expected to be \nsome 20 years.''\n  The real effect of the CTBT, then, is not to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons, for less developed countries can develop simple \nnuclear weapons without testing and countries like Russia and China can \ntest without being detected. The real effect of the CTBT will be to \ndegrade the U.S. nuclear arsenal, dependent on periodic testing to \nensure readiness.\n  Modernization and development of new weapons systems, also dependent \non testing, will be precluded. The need to modernize and develop new \nnuclear weapons should not be discounted. New weapons for new missions, \nchanges in delivery systems and platforms, and improved safety devices \nall require testing to ensure that design modifications will and be \neffective. In supporting this treaty, the President is saying that \nregardless of the future threats the United States may face, we will \nsurrender our ability to sustain a potent and effective nuclear \ndeterrent. Mr. President, such shortsighted policies which leave \nAmerica less secure are completely unacceptable and should be rejected.\n  It is difficult for me to understand how a President who determines \nthat ``the maintenance of a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile to be a \nsupreme national interest of the United States'' can support the CTBT, \na treaty which could jeopardize the entire nuclear arsenal within \nyears.\n  Those who favor the CTBT argue that the treaty will create an \ninternational norm against the development of nuclear weapons. If the \nUnited States will take the lead, advocates for the treaty state, then \nother countries will see our good intentions and follow our example.\n  Mr. President, moral suasion carries little weight with countries \nlike North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. Moral suasion means little more to \nRussia, China, Pakistan, and India. These countries follow their \nsecurity interests, not the illusory arms control agenda of another \ninternational bureaucracy.\n  It is folly to degrade the U.S. nuclear deterrent through a treaty \nthat has no corollary security benefits. I am not opposed to treaties \nand norms which seek to reduce the potential for international \nconflict, but arms control treaties which are not verifiable leave the \nUnited States in a more dangerous position. When we can trust but not \nverify, the better path is not to place ourselves in a position where \nour trust can be broken, particularly when the security of the American \npeople is at stake.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address this important \nmatter and I urge my colleagues to oppose the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the incredible and contrived rhetoric \npouring forth constantly from the White House for the past few weeks \nhas at times bordered on absurd and futile efforts to\n\n[[Page S12403]]\n\nsell to the American people the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. For \nexample, only this administration could attempt to put a positive spin \non a Washington Post article reporting that the CTBT is unverifiable. \nIt didn't work and once again it was demonstrable that you can't make a \nsilk purse out of a sow's ear.\n  No administration, prior to the present one, has ever tried to argue \nwith a straight face that a zero yield test ban would or could be \nverifiable. A treaty which purports to ban all nuclear testing is, by \ndefinition, unverifiable. In fact, previous administrations admitted \nthat much less ambitious proposals, such as low-yield test ban, were \nalso not verifiable.\n  This is not a ``spin'' contest. This is a fact.\n  There is one hapless fellow, at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, \nwho is bound to know this, and he should not be lending his name to \nsuch shenanigans.\n  I am not referring to the President. This is his treaty--the only \nmajor arms control agreement negotiated on his watch--and its \nratification is entirely about his legacy. No, I am talking about Vice \nPresident Gore, who took the correct, flat-out-position--when he was a \nUnited States Senator--he was opposed to even a 1-kiloton test ban. \nAccording to then Senator Gore, the only type of test ban that was \nverifiable was, in his estimation, one with no less than a 5-kiloton \nlimit. He was quite clear, Mr. President, in saying that anything \nless--such as the CTBT treaty now before the Senate--would be \nunverifiable.\n  On May 12, 1988, Senator Gore objected to an amendment offered to the \n1989 defense bill which called for a test ban treaty and which \nrestricted nuclear tests above 1 kiloton. Then-Senator Gore declared:\n\n       Mr. President, I want to express a lingering concern about \n     the threshold contained in the amendment. Without regard to \n     the military usefulness or lack of usefulness of a 1 kiloton \n     versus the 5 kiloton test, purely with regard to \n     verification, I am concerned that a 1 kiloton test really \n     pushes verification to the limit, even with extensive \n     cooperative measures. . . . I express the desire that this \n     threshold be changed from 1 to 5.\n\n  In other words, the Vice President knows full well that a 1-kiloton \nlimit--to say nothing of 0-kiloton ban--was unverifiable. In fact, at \nhis insistence, the proposed amendment was modified upwards to allow \nfor all nuclear tests below 5 kilotons.\n  Why then, is the administration, of which he is now a part, claiming \nthat a zero-yield ban is ``effectively verifiable''?\n  Numerous experts have cautioned the Senate that a ``zero-yield'' CTBT \nis fundamentally unverifiable. Other nations will be able to conduct \nmilitarily significant nuclear tests well below the detection threshold \nof the Treaty's monitoring system, and even below the United States' \nown unilateral capability.\n  President Clinton's own former Director of Central Intelligence, Jim \nWoolsey, testified before the Foreign Relations Committee, on May 13, \n1998, that ``With the yield of zero, I have very serious doubts that we \nwould be able to verify.''\n  On August 5, 1999, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger noted: \n``When I was involved in test-ban negotiations, it was understood that \ntesting below a certain threshold was required to ensure confidence in \nU.S. nuclear weapons. It also was accepted that very low-yield tests \nwould be difficult to detect, and an agreement to ban them would raise \nserious questions about verifiability.''\n  Most significantly, Fred Eimer, former Assistant Director of the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency and chief verification expert for both \nthe Reagan and Bush administrations, wrote to me this past Sunday \nstating his opposition to the CTBT.\n  Dr. Eimer noted that: ``Other nations will be able to conduct \nmilitarily significant nuclear tests well below the verification \nthreshold of the Treaty's monitoring system, and well below that of our \nown National Technical Means.''\n  Now, of course, the Administration has claimed on a variety of \noccasions that the CTBT is ``effectively verifiable.'' It seems, \nhowever, that this administration is saying one thing to the Senate and \nthe American people, and admitting quite another thing overseas. I will \nread into the Record the criticism that was leveled against the CTBT on \nAugust 1, 1996, by Mr. John Holum--President Clinton's ACDA Director--\nwhen he was in Geneva. Mr. Holum stated:\n\n       The United States' views on verification are well known: We \n     would have preferred stronger measures, especially in the \n     decision-making process for on-site inspections, and in \n     numerous specific provisions affecting the practical \n     implementation of the inspection regime. I feel no need to \n     defend this view. The mission on the Conference on \n     Disarmament is not to erect political symbols, but to \n     negotiate enforceable agreements. That require effective \n     verification, not as the preference of any party, but as the \n     sine quo non of this body's work. . . . On verification \n     overall, the Treaty tilts toward the `defense' in a way that \n     has forced the United States to conclude, reluctantly, that \n     it can accept, barely, the balance that Ambassador Ramaker \n     has crafted.\n\n  ``Reluctantly''?\n  ``Accept, barely''?\n  Does this sound like a ringing endorsement of the CTBT's verification \nregime? I would say this is tantamount to ``damnation by faint \npraise''.\n  The fact of the matter is that the CTBT's much-vaunted international \nmonitoring system (IMS) was only designed to detect ``fully coupled'' \nnuclear tests down to one kiloton, and cannot detect evasive nuclear \ntesting. Any country so-inclined could easily muffle its nuclear tests \nby conducting them in natural cavities (such as salt domes or caverns) \nor in man-made excavations. This technique can reduce the seismic \nmagnitude of a test by a factor of 70. In other words, countries can \nconduct tests of up to 60 kilotons without being detected by the IMS.\n  Every country of concerns to the United States is technically capable \nof decoupling its nuclear explosions. In other words, countries such as \nNorth Korea, China, and Russia will be able to conduct very significant \nwork on their weapons programs without fear of detection by the IMS. I \npoint out to Senators that, according to Department of Energy data, 56 \npercent of all U.S. nuclear tests were less than 20 kilotons in yield. \nSuch tests, if decoupled, would all have been undetectable by the IMS. \nIn other words, one out of every two nuclear tests ever conducted by \nthe United States would not have been detected by the IMS--had the U.S. \nchosen to mask its program. I fail to see how the administration does \nnot think this monitoring deficiency is not militarily significant.\n  Moreover, claims that the IMS will provide new seismic monitoring \ncapabilities to the United States are ludicrous. The vast majority of \nseismic stations listed in the CTBT already exist, and were funded by \nthe U.S. taxpayer; 68 percent of the ``Primary Seismological \nStations,'' and 47 percent of the ``Auxiliary'' stations called for \nunder the treaty already are in place because the United States put \nthem there years ago. I repeat, the only reason the IMS has any value \nto the United States is because it was already U.S. property long \nbefore the CTBT was negotiated.\n  So where are the additional 32 percent of the stations going to be \nlocated? In places such as the Cook Islands, the Central African \nRepublic, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Cameroon, Niger, \nBolivia, Botswana, Costa Rica, Samoa, and so on and so forth. There is \nno benefit to having seismic stations in these places. In other words, \nMr. President, the CTBT will provide zero benefit to our nuclear test \nmonitoring.\n\n  In fact, it is going to make life more difficult for the United \nStates. The same ``overselling'' of the IMS that is going on here in \nthe United States is also occurring internationally. Ultimately, this \nis going to cause great problems for the United States in arguing that \na country has violated the treaty when the much-vaunted IMS has not \ndetected anything. Few nations are likely to side with the United \nStates in situations where the IMS has not detected a test.\n  Moreover, the IMS also will complicate U.S. efforts by providing \nfalse or misleading data, which in turn will be used by countries to \nconceal treaty violations. Specifically, the CTBT fails to require \nnations to ``calibrate'' their regional stations to assess the local \ngeology.\n  Naturally, countries such as Russia and China have refused to \nvolunteer to do so. By consequence, these stations will record data \nthat will be inconsistent with U.S. national information\n\n[[Page S12404]]\n\nand will be used to argue against U.S. on-site inspection initiatives.\n  While it is important to realize the deficiencies of the CTBT's \nseismic monitoring regime, it also is a fact that several treaty \nprovisions will severely impair the ability of any on-site inspection, \nif launched, to uncover credible evidence of a violation. First, the \naforementioned failure to calibrate regional stations will introduce \ninaccuracies in the location of suspicious events, creating a broader \ninspectable area than otherwise would be the case. Second, if the \nUnited States requests an inspection, no U.S. inspectors would be \nallowed to participate, and the country in question can refuse to admit \nother specific inspectors. Third, the treaty allows for numerous delays \nin providing access to suspect sites, which will cause dissipation of \nmost of the best technical signatures of a nuclear test.\n  Indeed, in the case of low-yield testing, there are few enough \nobservable signatures to begin with, and on-site inspections are \nunlikely to be of use at all. Finally, the inspected party is allowed \nto restrict access under the treaty and to declare up to 50 square \nkilometers as being ``off-limits.'' As UNSCOM found with Iraq, any time \na country is given the right to designate sites as off-limits to \ninspectors, the inspection regime is undermined.\n  In conclusion, the IMS and the inspection regime is likely to be so \nweak that I would not be surprised if countries such as Iraq and North \nKorea did not ultimately sign and ratify. Because of the technical \nimpossibility of verifying a zero-yield test ban, such rogue regimes \ncan credibly claim to adhere to a fraudulent, unverifiable norm against \ntesting without fear of ever getting caught.\n  The only puzzling question for me, Mr. President, is why, with a Vice \nPresident who knows the truth quite well, does the Clinton \nadministration continue to insist otherwise?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senate giving its \nadvice and consent to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n  Debate on the CTBT has unfortunately become politicized. It should \nnot be. The series of hearings held in the Armed Services Committee and \nthe Foreign Relations Committee were fair and serious. I was impressed \nby the intelligent discussion and debate. But I wish that we had heard \nmore. As Senator Hagel indicated in his statement on the floor, we \nshould not be compressing debate on this issue. We should hold more \nextensive hearings.\n  This treaty is about the future. It is about making a world more \nsecure from the threat of nuclear war. This issue is too important, too \nimportant for the Senate of the United States not to have held hearing \nafter hearing on all aspects of the treaty. Such hearings would, in my \nview, have better clarified all the benefits of the Treaty.\n  I have supported the treaty, I continue to support the treaty, and I \nwill vote for the treaty, not because it is perfect--the CTBT does not \nmean an end to the threat of nuclear war or nuclear terrorism or \nnuclear proliferation, but it does represent a step in the right \ndirection of containing these threats.\n  Let us be clear on what not ratifying the CTBT means:\n  A vote against the CTBT is a vote for the resumption of nuclear \ntesting by the United States.\n  A resumption of nuclear testing is the clear consequence of the \ncriticism by opponents of the CTBT that the stockpile Stewardship \nProgram is not sufficient to guarantee the safety, reliability and \nperformance of the nation's nuclear weapon stockpile.\n  Critics of the Stockpile Stewardship Program argue that only actual \ntesting can preserve our nuclear deterrence. Indeed at least one \nwitness testifying before the Armed Services Committee advocated a \nresumption of 10 kiloton testing. That means testing a weapon almost \nthe size of what was dropped on Hiroshima.\n  I do not believe that the American public wants to see the resumed \ntesting of Hiroshima-sized nuclear weapons.\n  Nor do I believe such testing is necessary, not as long as America \npersists in investing sufficient resources in the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram.\n  Yes, there are uncertainties about the ability of the Stewardship \nProgram over time to be successful. As the Director of Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory, John Browne, has testified, ``the average age of \nthe nuclear stockpile is older than at any time in history, and nuclear \nweapons involve materials and technologies found nowhere else on \nearth.'' And as his colleague at the Lawrence Livermore laboratories, \nBruce Tarter, stated, ``the pace of progress must be quickened. Much \nremains to be accomplished, and the clock is running.''\n  Indeed, the United States has no alternative to the Stockpile \nStewardship Program unless we want to return to the level of nuclear \ntesting that we saw prior to President Bush ordering a moratorium on \ntesting in 1992.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a chart demonstrating the number of \nUnited States nuclear tests, from July 1945 through September 1992, be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. The United States needs to train people, design equipment, \nand to invent new techniques if it is going to preserve the safety and \nreliability of its nuclear deterrent. The Stockpile Stewardship Program \ncan accomplish all of these objectives.\n  The Stockpile Stewardship Program has had problems but it has made \ngreat progress. As Director Tarter noted, it has opened up new \npossibilities for weapons science not even contemplated a few years \nago.\n  This is the future: one of science, not one of testing.\n  As a strong advocate of National Missile Defense, I have been struck \nby how some are willing to have such extraordinary confidence in the \nability of American scientist and engineers to overcome problems in \nmissile defense but do not seem to place the same confidence in the \nability of American scientists and engineers to do the same with \nstockpile stewardship.\n  Choosing the path of science does not mean the United States cannot \ntest if science proves inadequate to practice. The assurances contained \nin the President's six safeguards attached to this treaty mean that, if \nnecessary, we can resume testing. I have full confidence in this \nPresident or any future President being willing to take this \nextraordinary step, and I have full confidence that this or any future \nCongress will back that President up should such a decision to return \nto testing be necessary.\n  Supporting the CTBT does not preclude America from taking whatever \nsteps are necessary to preserve our national security.\n  I would argue, as have many of my colleagues, and interestingly \nenough, many of our allies, that ratification of the treaty helps \npreserve American security by locking in our nuclear superiority and \nlimiting the abilities of other nations to match our nuclear \ncapability. Our allies, who benefit from the security of the American \nnuclear umbrella, want the CTBT because they know it enhances, not \ndetracts, from their security.\n  Yes, it is true that the treaty will not prevent proliferation \nabsolutely. A country does not need to conduct nuclear tests to have a \nnuclear capability. But will it have a reliable weapons system? I do \nnot think so.\n  Yes, it is true that the CTBT will not prevent a country from trying \nto hide small scale nuclear tests. But I believe that the international \nmonitoring system which will be in place as well as the United States' \nown national technical means will be so extensive that any test will be \ndetected. That country will then be subject to an international \ninspection. Some suggest that the United States will not be able to \ngain a consensus for such an inspection. I do not see why not: it will \nbe in the interest of all signatories to ensure that no countries \nviolate the agreement. I cannot envision a majority of states not \nagreeing to an inspection of a suspected nuclear test.\n  I do not know if the CTBT will create a new international norm \ndiscouraging nuclear weapons development. I do know that the CTBT will \nmake such development technically more difficult to do and politically \nmore difficult to deny.\n  Let me conclude by asking this simple question: do my colleagues who \noppose the CTBT want our country to resume nuclear testing?\n  If not, then I suggest that the only course is to invest in the \nStockpile Stewardship Program. I say, give\n\n[[Page S12405]]\n\nAmerican science a chance. Invest in the future of weapons science, not \nin the past of weapons testing by ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    U.S.      U.S.-U.K.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal tests by calendar Year:\n    1945........................................         1             0\n    1946........................................         2             0\n    1947........................................         0             0\n    1948........................................         3             0\n    1949........................................         0             0\n    1950........................................         0             0\n    1951........................................        16             0\n    1952........................................        10             0\n    1953........................................        11             0\n    1954........................................         6             0\n    1955........................................        18             0\n    1956........................................        18             0\n    1957........................................        32             0\n    1958........................................        77             0\n    1959........................................         0             0\n    1960........................................         0             0\n    1961........................................        10             0\n    1962........................................        96             2\n    1963........................................        47             0\n    1964........................................        45             2\n    1965........................................        38             1\n    1966........................................        48             0\n    1967........................................        42             0\n    1968........................................        56             0\n    1969........................................        46             0\n    1970........................................        39             0\n    1971........................................        24             0\n    1972........................................        27             0\n    1973........................................        24             0\n    1974........................................        22             1\n    1975........................................        22             0\n    1976........................................        20             1\n    1977........................................        20             0\n    1978........................................        19             2\n    1979........................................        15             1\n    1980........................................        14             3\n    1981........................................        16             1\n    1982........................................        18             1\n    1983........................................        18             1\n    1984........................................        18             2\n    1985........................................        17             1\n    1986........................................        14             1\n    1987........................................        14             1\n    1988........................................        15             0\n    1989........................................        11             1\n    1990........................................         8             1\n    1991........................................         8             1\n    1991........................................         7             1\n    1992........................................         6             0\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Total tests...............................     1,030            24\nTotal tests by location:\n    Pacific.....................................         4             0\n    Johnston Island.............................        12             0\n    Enewetak....................................        43             0\n    Bikini......................................        23             0\n    Christmas Island............................        24             0\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Total Pacific.............................       106             0\n    Total S.

Mr. President, yesterday President Clinton sent a written \nrequest to the Senate asking that we ``postpone'' a vote on the CTBT. \nIn light of the President's outburst on Friday lashing out at Senate \nRepublicans, and his adamant declaration that he would never submit a \nwritten request asking the Senate to withdraw the CTBT from \nconsideration, his decision to send just such a letter is interesting.\n  His letter, was a baby-step in the right direction, insufficient to \navert a vote on the CTBT today. The President is clearly playing poker \nwith the Senate, but he doesn't have a winning hand, and I think he \nknows it.\n  The President sent this letter only because he realizes he has failed \nto make a compelling case for the treaty, and failed to convince two-\nthirds of the Senate that this treaty is in the national interest. He \nknows that if we vote on the CTBT today, the treaty will be defeated.\n  His letter did not meet both the criteria set by me and others. For \nexample, he requested: (a) that the treaty be withdrawn and (b) that it \nnot be considered for the remainder of his presidency.\n  The President has repeatedly dismissed the critics of this treaty as \nplaying politics. Look who's talking. In his mind, it seems, the only \nreason anyone could possibly oppose this treaty is to give him a \npolitical black eye. Putting aside the megalomania in such a \nsuggestion, accusing Republicans of playing politics with our national \nsecurity was probably not the most effective strategy for convincing \nthose with substantive concerns about the treaty.\n  The fact is, we are not opposed to this treaty because we want to \nscore political points against a lame-duck Administration. We are \nopposed because it is unverifiable and because it will endanger the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. The White House and \nSenate Democrats have failed to make a compelling case to the contrary. \nThat is why the treaty is headed for defeat.\n  Of course, treaty supporters want to preserve a way to spin this \ndefeat into a victory, by claiming that they have managed to ``live to \nfight another day.'' That's probably the same thing they said after \nPresident Carter requested the SALT II Treaty be withdrawn. But they \nwill be fooling no one but themselves.\n  Before this debate is over, it must be made clear that to one and all \nthis CTBT is dead--and that the next President will not be bound by its \nterms. The next administration must be left free to establish its own \nnuclear testing and nuclear non-proliferation policies, unencumbered by \nthe failed policies of the current, outgoing administration.\n  Without such concrete assurances that this CTBT is dead, I will \ninsist that the Senate proceed as planned and vote down this treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/12/senate-section/article/S12405-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 1906, which the clerk will \nreport by title.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1906) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to present to the Senate \nthe conference report on H.R. 1906, the Fiscal Year 2000 Agriculture \nRural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act.\n  The conference agreement provides total new budget authority of $60.3 \nbillion for programs and activities of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture with the exception of the Forest Service, which is funded \nby the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The Food and Drug Administration and Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission are included also, and expenses and payments of the farm \ncredit system are provided.\n  The bill reflects approximately $5.9 billion more in spending than \nthe fiscal year 1999 enacted level and $6.6 billion less than the level \nrequested by the President.\n  It is $418 million less than the House-passed bill level and $391 \nmillion less than the Senate-passed bill level.\n  I must point out that we, of course, are constrained with the \nadoption of this conference report by allocations under the Budget Act. \nThe bill is consistent with the allocations that have been made to this \nsubcommittee under the Budget Act, and it is consistent in other \nrespects with the Budget Act.\n  The increase above the fiscal year 1999 enacted level reflects the \nadditional $5.9 billion which the administration projects will be \nrequired to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for net realized \nlosses.\n  The conference report also provides an additional $8.7 billion in \nemergency appropriations to assist agricultural\n\n[[Page S12406]]\n\nproducers who experienced weather-related agricultural and market \nlosses during 1999.\n\n  This was a difficult conference. We met on two occasions. House \nconferees at one point asked for a recess in our deliberations to \ndiscuss some of the difficult issues that were confronting the \nconferees. As a matter of fact, after the request for the recess for a \nconference among House conferees, we never were able to get back into a \nformal meeting with the House conferees. It was an unusual procedure \nbecause of that.\n  Negotiations took place Member to Member, Senator to conferee among a \nlot of interested Members of the House and Senate on a wide range of \nissues. Some of the most contentiously involved issues weren't in the \nbill, one of which was the dairy proposal for reauthorization of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, and an authorization for additional regional \ncompacts.\n  There was a discussion of the Senate-passed provision relating to \nsanctions and trying to change the policy by changing the statute with \nrespect to the authority of the President to impose unilateral \nsanctions against the export of U.S. agricultural commodities.\n  These involve situations where we are trying to influence the conduct \nof other nations using interruption in trade from the United States to \nput pressure on these other countries. Senator Ashcroft of Missouri had \nled the effort in the Senate to put language in the Senate bill on that \nsubject.\n  The House conferees insisted on a provision that would have imposed \nspecial restrictions on trade with Cuba. This ended up being a very \ndifficult issue to resolve, and finally was left out of the conference \nreport at the insistence of the House.\n  We tried to work out other disagreements.\n  We think that it is a balanced bill, and it addresses a wide range of \nneeds for funding for this next fiscal year--agricultural research, \nfood and nutrition programs, agricultural support programs, \nconservation programs--trying to insist that we do an effective job to \nprotect the environment as it relates to agricultural production and \nthe needs of production agriculture.\n  I hope the Senate will look with favor on the bill. The House adopted \nthe conference report on October 1, I believe, by a substantial margin. \nWe hope the Senate will look with favor and act accordingly.\n  Including Congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-\nyear spending actions, this conference agreement provides total non-\nemergency discretionary spending for fiscal year 2000 of just under $14 \nbillion in budget authority and $14.3 billion in outlays. These amounts \nare consistent with the revised discretionary spending allocations \nestablished for this conference agreement.\n  It was a difficult conference. After two meetings, the House \nconferees requested a recess. Because of some intractable issues, the \nHouse proposed to bring the conference to a close without reconvening \nthe conference committee. This was not a procedure I preferred, but one \nthat was necessary to reach a conference agreement on this \nappropriations measure so that it could be approved by the Congress and \nsent to the President as close as possible to the start of the new \nfiscal year. I wish to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, my \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, and the chairman of the House \nsubcommittee, Congressman Skeen for their hard work on this bill and \ntheir cooperation in achieving this conference product.\n  I am pleased to report that this conference report provides increased \nfunding of $51.9 million for activities and programs in this bill which \nare part of the administration's ``Food Safety Initiative.'' In \naddition, the conference report provides $649 million for the Food \nSafety and Inspection Service, an agency critical to maintaining the \nsafety of our food supply, $32 million more than the fiscal year 1999 \nlevel.\n  This conference agreement also provides increased appropriations for \nagriculture research programs. An appropriation of $834 million is \nprovided for the Agriculture Research Service, $49 million more than \nthe fiscal year 1999 level and $25 million more than the Senate-passed \nbill level. Total funding of $950 million is provided for research, \neducation, and extension activities of the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation and Extension Service, $31 million more than the fiscal year \n1999 level and $19 million more than the Senate-passed bill level.\n  Approximately $35 billion, close to 58 percent of the total new \nbudget authority provided by this conference report, is for domestic \nfood programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These \ninclude food stamps; commodity assistance; the Special Supplemental \nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the school \nlunch and breakfast programs; and the new school breakfast pilot \nprogram funded at $7 million. The conference adopted an appropriations \nlevel of $4,032 billion for the WIC program, $6 million less than the \nSenate bill level and $27 million more than the level recommended by \nthe House. More recent data on actual participation rates and food \npackage costs indicates that this appropriation will be sufficient to \nmaintain a 7.4 million average monthly WIC participation level in \nfiscal year 2000.\n  For farm assistance programs, the conference report provides $1.2 \nbillion in appropriations. Included in this amount is the full increase \nof $80 million above the fiscal year 1999 level requested by the \nadministration for Farm Service Agency salaries and expenses, as well \nas appropriations to meet or exceed the fiscal year 2000 farm operating \nand farm ownership loan levels included in the President's budget \nrequest.\n  Appropriations for conservation programs administered by the Natural \nResources Conservation Service total $813 million, $13 million more \nthan the House bill level and $5 million more than level recommended by \nthe Senate.\n  For rural economic and community development programs, the conference \nreport provides appropriations of $2.2 billion to support a total loan \nlevel of $7.6 billion. Included in this amount is $719 million for the \nRural Community Advancement Program, $640 million for the rental \nassistance program, and a total rural housing loan program level of \n$4.6 billion.\n  A total of $1.1 billion is provided for foreign assistance and \nrelated programs of the Department of Agriculture, including $113 \nmillion in new budget authority for the Foreign Agricultural Service \nand a total program level of $976 million for the P.L. 480 Food for \nPeace Program, $39 million above the budget request.\n\n  Total new budget authority for the Food and Drug Administration is \n$1.1 billion, $70 million more than the fiscal year 1999 level and $5.1 \nmillion more than the Senate-passed bill level, along with an \nadditional $145 million in Prescription Drug Act and $14.8 million in \nmammography clinics user fee collections. Included in the appropriation \nfor salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration is the \nfull $30 million increase requested in the budget for food safety, \nalong with the Senate-recommended increase of $28 million for premarket \napproval activities. The additional funding provided to the FDA for \npremarket approvals will hopefully enable the agency to speed up \ndevice, drug, food additive, and other product review times to prevent \nunnecessary delays in getting new products to the market.\n  For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $63 million is \nprovided; and a limitation of $35.8 million is established on \nadministrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration.\n  Title VIII of this conference report provides emergency relief to \nagricultural producers and others who have suffered weather-related and \neconomic losses. Senators may recall that during consideration of this \nbill in the Senate, an amendment was adopted providing over $7.6 \nbillion in disaster assistance for agricultural producers. The \nconference agreement essentially retains the amendment adopted by the \nSenate and provides $1.2 billion for 1999 crop losses for a total of \n$8.7 billion.\n  Included in the emergency assistance provided is: $5.54 billion for \nmarket loss assistance; $1.2 billion for crop loss assistance; $475 \nmillion for soybean producers; $400 million for 2000 crop insurance \ndiscounts; $328 million for tobacco producers; $325 million for \nlivestock and dairy producers; $82 million for producers of certain \nspeciality crops; and reinstatement of the cotton step-2 program.\n  On May 14 of this year, the conferees on the Hurricane Mitch and \nKosovo\n\n[[Page S12407]]\n\nsupplemental appropriations bill included language in the statement of \nmanagers recognizing the likelihood that additional disaster assistance \nwould be needed for agricultural producers this year. The conferees \ncalled on the Administration to submit requests for supplemental \nappropriations once it determined the extent of the needs.\n  In June, 21 Senators joined me in writing the President to bring this \nstatement of managers language to his attention and to invite the \nadministration to submit a request for supplemental appropriations. As \nof today, we have received no response to our letter nor a request for \nany funds for farmers. Other Members of Congress have made similar \nrequests of the administration with the same result.\n  On September 15, 1999, the Secretary of Agriculture testified before \nthe House Agriculture Committee that the estimated needs for crop \nlosses was between $800 million and $1.2 billion. This bill provides \nthe full $1.2 billion that the Secretary estimated was needed. While I \nunderstand that these estimates were issued prior to Hurricane Floyd, \nit is my understanding that damage estimates are still being \nformulated.\n  A USDA press release dated September 17, 1999, states:\n\n       The Congress, along with the Clinton Administration, is \n     also currently working on emergency farm legislation which, \n     if enacted, could offer additional assistance to farmers and \n     ranchers in North Carolina, as well as other states affected \n     by natural disasters.\n\n  I do not believe we should delay disaster assistance until these \nestimates are complete. I believe we should take care of what we know \nis needed now and come back to address new estimates when they are \nreceived from the Administration.\n  Mr. President, this administration does not deserve credit for one \npenny of the emergency assistance in this bill. It has been ``sitting \non the fence.'' It has submitted no requests for funding, nor offered \nany assistance in formulating this plan.\n  Other Senators may be concerned that this legislation does not \ncontain legislative provisions regarding dairy or to relax unilateral \nsanctions on food and medicine. Senators should remember that neither \nthe House nor the Senate versions of this bill included legislative \nprovisions regarding dairy policy. Therefore, it was beyond the scope \nof this conference.\n  With respect to sanctions reform, this Senator supports sanctions \nreform like the majority of other members who voted for the sanctions \namendment during Senate consideration of this bill, but an \nappropriations bill is not the right vehicle for the enactment of this \nlarge policy issue. Further, on July 26, the Senate voted 53 to 45 to \nreinstate rule 16, which prohibits legislating on an appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. President, this conference report was filed on Thursday night, \nSeptember 30, and was passed the following morning by the House of \nRepresentatives. Senate passage of this conference report today is the \nfinal step necessary to send this fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill \nto the President for signature into law.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this conference report. Many of our \nfarmers and ranchers continue to face an economic crisis. Others \ncontinue to suffer from extreme weather conditions, including severe \ndrought and flooding. It is time we act now to provide them some relief \nand this conference report, when signed into law, will do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, at the outset, I compliment my \ndistinguished colleague from Mississippi for the outstanding work that \nhe has done as chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee of \nAppropriations.\n  I have had the pleasure to work with Senator Cochran for some 19 \nyears now. We have been on the subcommittee together for that time and \nthe full committee for that time. There is no more difficult area in \nthe Senate than working out a farm bill on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill because, candidly, the farmers are faced with so \nmany problems. These are subjects very near and dear to my heart \nbecause I grew up in farm territory in the State of Kansas. I was born \nin Wichita and moved to Russell County, KS, when I was 12, worked on a \nfarm as a teenager, drove a tractor, and have some firsthand experience \nwith the problems which the agricultural community has.\n  I am very much concerned with a number of provisions in the bill. I \ndeclined to sign the conference report, and with great reluctance \nbecause of the hard work that the chairman has done and others have \ndone. I intend to vote against the conference report, although I think \nthere are enough votes present to pass it. There is a cloture motion \npending. The issue has been raised as to whether there would be an \nattempt to filibuster. It may be that the issues can be worked out \nwithout a filibuster. I hope the issues can be worked out. But if the \nfilibuster vote comes up I will vote against cloture to continue the \nconsideration of this issue, even though I realize fully the importance \nof resolving our appropriations bills in the very immediate future.\n  The reasons that I am concerned about the provisions of the bill \nrelate to two issues.\n  First, it is my view that Mid-Atlantic States, and my State of \nPennsylvania specifically, have not gotten a fair share of the disaster \nassistance. The Agriculture appropriations bill provides for $8.7 \nbillion in disaster assistance. But the vast majority of this money \ngoes to farmers in the Midwest to compensate for low commodity prices. \nIt may be that the disaster assistance is a broader category than you \nmight expect, or perhaps the disaster assistance is modified by the \nfact that some $7.5 billion goes to the Midwest to compensate for low \ncommodity prices. Only $1.2 billion is provided for natural disasters. \nThat $1.2 billion must compensate not only for the drought but also the \ndisasters including Hurricane Floyd, flooding in the Midwest, livestock \nloss, and fishery loss. Pennsylvania alone has sustained $700 million \nin drought loss. The Mid-Atlantic States have suffered $2.5 billion as \na result of the drought this summer.\n  Year after year, Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic Senators have \nsupported massive aid packages to farmers in the Midwest--some $17 \nbillion between August 1998 and June 1999. Now that the Mid-Atlantic \nfarmers are facing a real crisis, my view is the Congress has not \nprovided sufficient compensation.\n  There is another issue of concern; that is, the amendment which I was \nprepared to offer in the conference. Senator Cochran has accurately \ndescribed the conference. It was rather anomalous.\n  At about 7:15, the House conferees asked for a recess of 10 to 15 \nminutes. And more than an hour and a half later they had not returned.\n  Although many of the conferees wanted to vote to extend the Northeast \nDairy Compact and to allow Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, New \nJersey, and Virginia to join, the leadership in the House was opposed. \nI believe the Northeast Compact ought to be reauthorized, and a number \nof States, including Pennsylvania, ought to be permitted to join.\n  Without going into elaborate arguments, this is to provide price \nstability without any cost to the Government, but to the benefit of \nconsumers. The price fluctuated from as much as $17.34 in December of \n1998 to a little over $10 in January of 1999. With that kind of \ninstability, it is very difficult on the farmers.\n  There is another issue about option 1-A which some 60 Senators and \n240 House Members have recommended; contrary to that very large \nmajority, the Secretary of Agriculture proposed a rule which was \ndifferent, 1-B. Dairy compact legislation was offered on April 27, \n1999, by Senators Jeffords and Leahy. I joined with 40 cosponsors. When \nthe Senate considered the issue of dairy pricing and compacts on August \n4, 1999 on a vote for cloture, we received 53 votes--short of the 60 \nmajority.\n  It is my hope yet we will work out the compact for the Northeastern \nUnited States and also the 1-A pricing. These are matters which impact \nvery heavily upon my State and upon the farmers far beyond my State as \na national matter.\n  With reluctance, I intend to vote against the conference report and \nto support the postcloture for extended debate to try to bring about \ngreater equities.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S12408]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport, though I have many of the same reservations I heard the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania express. I was not present to hear the comments of \nthe Senator from Mississippi, but I suspect he has reservations about \nthe conference report, as well.\n  As was pointed out, the conference was adjourned as a result of the \ndecision by the House not to come back. Many matters that were not in \nthis conference report such as sanctions, probably would have been in \nthe report. My guess is we are moving toward some kind of resolution of \nthat particular issue that did not make it into the conference report.\n  We did not get additional money in the legislation for Farm Service \nAgency employees. I think we will need that. I don't think it is fair \nto ask the Farm Service Agency to find the money from other programs, \nthat basically the farmers will have to pay to deliver this program \nthemselves.\n  There was an effort to get--and I think we have succeeded--bipartisan \nsupport to provide some resources for a very heavily attacked sector of \nour agricultural economy, the hog industry, where there are not only \nlow prices but also significant structural changes going on. We had an \ninnovative proposal for cooperatives that enabled Members to come up \nwith a win-win solution without having to put a bunch of money in the \nprogram and enabled Congress to use some ideas that this very important \npart of our agricultural sector had worked out on their own. I regret \nthat is not in this legislation.\n  There are a number of other things I would prefer to see included, \nand as a consequence I was disappointed that the conferees were not \nable to complete their work. Nonetheless, this is an extremely \nimportant piece of legislation for Nebraska. I appreciate in the \nNortheast there are some concerns there may not be a sufficient amount \nof resources in this bill to satisfy concerns, but the problem, of \ncourse, is that most of the disaster occurs as a consequence of \nproblems with low prices that are affecting the feed grain section, and \nrice and cotton as well. That is where the big money is. Most of the \ncrops are not grown in the Northeast and that tends to produce apparent \ninequities. There is almost nothing we can do about that kind of \ninequity.\n\n  In the legislation I appreciate the inclusion of mandatory price \nreporting. The chairman and I had a little colloquy on that a year or \nso ago. I appreciate that being included in this legislation. A great \ndeal of effort has been made in the meantime since last year's \nAgriculture appropriations bill between lots of different sectors of \nthe involved economy: the livestock producers, packers, and feedlot \noperators. I appreciate that is in the legislation because I think it \nis a very important part of trying to make the market work to enable \npeople who are running cow-calf operations and feedlot operations to \nget good price discovery. It is simply a way to ensure that the \nrestructuring that is going on in the industry doesn't prevent the kind \nof price discovery needed in order to get a good market functioning.\n  Last, I think this growing requirement to come back to Congress to \nfund disaster programs underscores the urgency of reexamining the \nFreedom to Farm contract that was not supposed to expire until 2002. \nRemember, in 1996, we promised the Freedom to Farm bill would be a lot \nless expensive than previous farm bills. We have already spent more \nthan we anticipated for the entire 7 years of the program in the first \n4 years alone. Obviously, we are not done. We are heading to a point \nwhere we will spend as much as we did at the peak of the 1980s.\n  Talking to farmers where I come from in Nebraska, I am hard pressed \nto find many that think Freedom to Farm has worked. They are not very \nenthusiastic about getting another big check from the Government. They \nwould rather have modifications in the farm bill similar to what the \nNebraska corn growers presented to the House agricultural committee \nhearing in Nebraska, saying bring back the farmer loan reserve, uncap \nthe loan rates, make some adjustments in the center on trade, on \nsanctions. There are lots of things that can be done to make the \nprogram better. My hope as we consider this additional disaster payment \nis that we understand there is a way to operate this farm program and \nspend a lot less money.\n  In all the talk about the failed farm policies of the past, we never \nspent more than $6 billion a year through the 1970s when we had a \nsystem called normal crop acreage. It was not the heavy hand of \ngovernment. There was a single base planted; farmers had flexibility \ncoming in. If farmers wanted to have Freedom to Farm, they didn't have \nto sign up for the farm program. It ought to be voluntary. We had a \nprogram in the 1970s that was a lot more efficient, a lot less costly, \nand a lot more flexible for the farmer. This is getting more and more \ncomplicated, more and more difficult, with more and more trips to the \nFarm Service Agency than anybody anticipated.\n  My hope, as we debate this conference report, is that one of the \nthings we start to consider is that in 2000 the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee needs to take up, as the House Agriculture Committee will do, \nthe question of whether or not we ought to rewrite Freedom to Farm in \norder to not only save the family farm but also to save the taxpayer \ngetting repeatedly hit for the bills of agricultural disasters that may \nnot be created by Freedom to Farm.\n  I see my good friend down here, Senator Roberts of Kansas. He heard \nme talking about Freedom to Farm and he rushed to the floor to defend \nhimself. I am not saying that Freedom to Farm has caused the problem. I \nam simply saying I do think it is time to reexamine it. We should do it \nin a calm and bipartisan fashion. This Freedom to Farm is getting more \nand more expensive with fewer and fewer satisfied customers.\n  Last, I also hope the Senate Agriculture Committee will be able to \nresolve some differences that we have over crop insurance and we can \nenact crop insurance reform yet this year. The Senate conference with \nthe House has already taken action. This is by no means the only thing \nwe need to do to help people manage the risk, but Senator Roberts and I \nhave listened to farmers, written a bill, we have almost 20 cosponsors, \na majority of people on the Agriculture Committee. The distinguished \nchairman of the committee has some terrific ideas, as well, \nincorporated in his legislation.\n  My hope is, with 14 legislative days remaining, we can pass that out \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee and take it up on the floor, pass \nit here, get it to conference with the House, and get that signed and \non to the President. There is money in the budget to do it. There is \nmoney in the disaster program to make it easier for people to afford \nthe premiums.\n  It is consistent with what most of us have been talking about in \nterms of trying to give the farmers something they can use to manage \ntheir risk.\n  I say finally, I appreciate very much the difficulty the \ndistinguished chairman of this subcommittee has had. Senator Cochran \nhad no easy task of trying to produce a conference report. There are \nthings in it I would love to change. I know I cannot change them. But I \nwill vote for this legislation and hope the President will sign it and \nhope it gets into law as quickly as possible so cash can get into the \nhands of people who desperately need it in order to survive.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Vermont. Who \nyields time to the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the leaders on this side, I \nyield such time as he may consume to the distinguished Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee \nfor all his tremendous work on this bill. Most of what I wanted, \nhowever, did not succeed. It was not because of his lack of effort. He \nhas put a tremendous amount of time in trying to make the bill more \nacceptable to those of us who live in the Northeast.\n  It is with great disappointment that I stand before the Senate to \nexpress my reasoning for opposing the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture \nappropriations bill, the bill that provides funding for agriculture \nprograms, research and services for American agriculture.\n\n[[Page S12409]]\n\n  In addition, the bill provides billions of dollars of aid for farmers \nand ranchers throughout America who have endured natural and market \ndisasters. However, and most unfortunately, it neglects our Nation's \ndairy farmers.\n  I understand the importance of funding these programs and the need to \nprovide relief for farmers. However, dairy farmers throughout the \ncountry and the drought stricken Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions \nhave been ignored in this bill. For these reasons, I must vote against \nthis bill.\n  The Agriculture appropriations bill provides $8.7 billion in \nassistance to needy farmers across the country. I believe they should \nreceive the help of the Federal Government. What is troubling is that \ndairy farmers are not asking for Federal dollars, but instead are \nasking for a fair pricing structure for their products, at no cost to \nthe Government.\n  The drought-stricken Northeastern States are not asking for special \ntreatment, just reasonable assistance to help deal with one of our \nregion's worst drought.\n  Weather-related and market-related disasters do occur and we must as \na nation be ready help those in need. In Vermont, in times of need, a \nneighbor does not have to ask another for help. Vermonters are willing \nto help, whether it is plowing out a neighbors snow covered driveway or \ndelivering hay to Midwestern States during one of their worst droughts, \nwhich we did some years ago to save Wisconsin and Minnesota from \nterrible problems.\n  This summer weather conditions in the Northeastern and mid-Atlantic \nput a tremendous strain on the region's agricultural sector. Crops \nthroughout the region were damaged or destroyed. Many farmers will not \nhave enough feed to make it through this winter. Water for livestock \nand dairy operations dried up, decreasing production and health of the \ncows.\n  The Northeastern and mid-Atlantic States were not asking for much. \nJust enough assistance to help cope with the unpredictable Mother \nNature.\n  America's dairy farmers need relief of a different kind. There is no \nneed for the expenditure of Federal funds. Commodity farmers are asking \nthe government for relief from natural and market disasters. Dairy \nfarmers are asking for relief from the promised Government disaster in \nthe form of a fair pricing structure from the Secretary of Agriculture. \nThat is all we are asking.\n  Unless relief is granted by correcting the Secretary's Final rule and \nextending the Northeast Dairy Compact, dairy farmers in every single \nState will sustain substantial losses, but not because of Mother Nature \nor poor market conditions, but because of the Clinton administration \nand a few here in Congress have prevented this Nation's dairy farmers \nfrom receiving a fair deal.\n  Unfortunately, Secretary Glickman's pricing formulas are fatally \nflawed and contrary to the will of Congress. The Nation's dairy farmers \nare counting on this Congress to prevent the dairy industry from being \nplaced at risk, and to instead secure its sound future.\n  Secretary Glickman's final pricing rule, known as Option 1-B, was \nscheduled to be implemented on October 1 of this year. However, the \nU.S. District Court in Vermont has prevented the flawed pricing rule \nfrom being implemented by issuing a 30 day temporary restraining order \non Secretary Glickman's final rule. The court finds that the \nSecretary's final order and decision violates Congress' mandate under \nthe Agriculture Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and the plaintiffs who \nrepresent the dairy farmers would suffer immediate and irreparable \ninjury from implementation of the Secretary's final decision.\n  The temporary restraining order issued by the U.S. district court has \ngiven Congress valuable additional time to correct Secretary Glickman's \nrule.\n  We must act now. With the help of the court, Congress can now bring \nfairness to America's dairy farmer and consumers.\n  Instead of costing dairy farmers millions of dollars in lost income, \nCongress should take immediate action by extending the dairy compact \nand choosing Option 1-A.\n  The Agriculture appropriations bill which includes billions of \ndollars in disaster aid seemed like the logical place to include \nprovisions that would help one of this country's most important \nagricultural resources without any cost to the Federal Government.\n  Giving farmers and consumers a reliable pricing structure and giving \nthe States the right to work together at no cost to the Federal \nGovernment to maintain a fresh supply of local milk is a noble idea, \nand it is a basic law of this Nation.\n  It is an idea that Congress should be working towards. Instead, a few \nMembers in both the House and Senate continue to block the progress and \ninterest of both consumers and dairy farmers.\n  This Congress has made its intention abundantly clear with regard to \nwhat is needed for the new dairy pricing rules. Sixty-one Senators and \nmore than 240 House Members signed letters to Secretary Glickman last \nyear supporting what is known as Option 1-A, for the pricing of fluid \nmilk.\n  On August 4 of this year, you will recall the Senate could not end a \nfilibuster from the Members of the upper Midwest, but did get 53 votes, \nshowing a majority of the Senate supports Option 1-A and keeping the \nNortheast Dairy Compact operating. Most recently, the House passed \ntheir version of Option 1-A by a vote of 285 to 140.\n  Both the House and Senate have given a majority vote on this issue. \nThus, I felt very hopeful that its inclusion would have been secured in \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill or some other place.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Cochran, the Senate stood firm \non these important dairy provisions in conference. For days he worked \nhard to hold the line to include these. His farmers should be very \nappreciative of his efforts to bring about another compact of a \ndemonstration program for the Southeast. The Southeast is another \nspecial area of the country that needs help just to organize their \npricing system better to help farmers survive.\n  Although the House would not allow the provisions to move forward, \nboth Chairman Cochran and Senator Specter led the fight for the dairy \nprovisions. Farmers from Mississippi and Pennsylvania should be proud \nof the work and commitment of their Senators.\n  In fact, dairy farmers throughout the country should be thankful for \nthe tremendous support their livelihoods have received from Chairman \nCochran, Senator Specter, Senator Bond, and others on the Agriculture \nappropriations conference. Since then, there have been opportunities \nsupported by the Senate to extend the compact and both times it failed \nbecause of lack of support in the other body.\n  With the Senate's leadership, the dairy provisions had a fighting \nchance in the conference committee. Unfortunately, time and time again \nHouse Members rebutted our efforts to include Option 1-A and include \nour dairy compacts in this bill.\n  If not for the actions of the House conferees dairy farmers could \nembrace this bill.\n  The October 1, 1999, deadline for implementation of the Secretary's \nrule has come and gone, but with the help of the district court, \nCongress still has time to act.\n  We must seize this opportunity to correct the Secretary of \nAgriculture's flawed pricing rules and at the same time maintain the \nability of the States to help protect their farmers, without additional \ncost to the Federal Government, through compacts.\n  I understand the significance of the disaster aid in this bill and do \nnot want to prevent the farmers and ranchers throughout the country \nfrom receiving this aid. However, in order to protect dairy farmers in \nmy State, as well as farmers throughout the country, I most oppose this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 20 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are going to be voting on the cloture \nmotion on the Agriculture appropriations conference report. I come \nwithout\n\n[[Page S12410]]\n\ngreat enthusiasm for this bill, although I admit there is much in this \nbill that is important and necessary. The process by which this \nconference report comes to the Senate is a horribly flawed process.\n  We face a very serious farm crisis. Part of this legislation deals \nwith that crisis. This appropriations bill deals with the routine \nappropriations that we provide each year for a range of important \nthings that we do in food safety and a whole range of issues at the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture and elsewhere dealing with agricultural \nresearch and more. But it also deals with what is called the emergency \npiece in the Agriculture appropriations bill to respond to the \nemergency in farm country these days.\n  We have seen prices collapse. We have seen flooding in North Dakota \nof 3 million acres that could not be planted this spring. We have seen \nsome of the worst crop disease in a century. We have seen substantial \nproblems with the import of grain coming into this country that has \nbeen traded unfairly. We have seen the shrinking of the export market \nwith financial problems in Asia. The result has been a buffeting of \nfamily farmers in a very tragic way, many of whom are hanging on by \ntheir fingertips wondering whether they will be able to continue \nfarming.\n  We attempted to include some emergency provisions in this piece of \nlegislation. This legislation does, in fact, contain emergency help for \nfamily farmers. I wish it contained that help in a different manner \nthan it does. It contains it in a payout called the AMTA payment. This \nbill will actually double the AMTA payment.\n  The problem with that is there will be a fair number of people across \nthe country who will receive payments who are not even farming, are not \neven producing anything, yet they are going to get a payment. There \nwill be people in this country who will get payments of up to $460,000. \nI expect taxpayers are going to be a little miffed about that. So \n$460,000 to help somebody? That is a crisis? That is not a family farm \nwhere I live. Taking the limits off, and allowing that kind of payment \nto go out, in my judgment, is a step backward.\n  Most important, the Senate passed, by 70 votes, a provision that \nsays: Let us stop using food as a weapon. Let us no longer use food and \nmedicine as part of the embargoes that we apply to those countries and \ngovernments around the world that we think are behaving badly. By 70 \nvotes, this Senate said: Let us stop using food as a weapon. Let us not \nuse food and medicine as part of an embargo. This conference report \ndoes not include that provision because it was dropped. That is a step \nbackward, in my judgment. We ought to have adopted the Senate provision \nthat says: Let us not use food as a weapon. Let us stop using food as \npart of an embargo.\n  There was no conference. It started. It went on for a couple of \nhours. The Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, who chaired it on our \nside, did the right thing. He opened it up for amendments. We had an \namendment, had a vote, and the vote did not turn out right for some \nother folks in the conference, so they decided to adjourn. That was it. \nNever heard from them again. Then the leadership decided to put \ntogether this bill, and they coupled together a conference report. And \nso here it rests now for our consideration. I am not enthusiastic about \nit.\n  But having said that, I likely will support it because farmers need \nemergency help, and they need it now. I do want to say that as harsh as \nI was about this process--and it was an awful process--I made it clear \nsome weeks ago, when I talked about this, that Senator Cochran from \nMississippi was not part of the reason this process did not work. On \nour side, he chaired the conference. And he did, I think, what should \nhave been done. He opened it up for discussion, the offering of \namendments, and to hold votes. That is exactly the way conferences \nshould work. I applaud the Senator from Mississippi. As always, even \nunder difficult circumstances, he is someone with whom I enjoy working \nand someone for whom I have great respect.\n  But in this circumstance, we must pass some emergency help for \nfarmers. This bill contains some of that emergency help. It fails to \ncontain other things that I think are very important. It seems to me, \nall in all, on balance, this legislation will probably proceed forward; \nthe President will sign it; we will get some help out to family \nfarmers; and come back again and see if we can provide some additional \nassistance when prices collapse and when that assistance is necessary.\n  It is especially the case we will need additional disaster help. I do \nnot think the $1.2 billion will do the job that is necessary all around \nthe country to respond to disasters. Senator Conrad has described on \nthe floor, as have I, the 3 million acres that did not get planted this \nspring because of flooding. Those producers need help. To be a farmer \nand not to be able to farm, having all of your land under water, that \nis what I call a disaster. The amount of money in this bill is not \nenough to deal with all of these issues all around the country, so I \nthink we are going to have to come back and add to that and try to \nprovide the resources that are necessary.\n  But again, let me yield the floor because I know others would like to \nspeak. I say to my colleague from Mississippi, I appreciate the fair \nmanner in which he proceeded.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. President, I know time is limited, so I would ask the indulgence \nof the senior Senator from Mississippi and assume that the Record \nstretched on for hours for the praise I would put upon his shoulders. \nActually, I do not say that as facetiously as it may sound.\n  I have served here for a lot of years. I know of no Senator who is a \nfiner Senator, with more integrity or greater abilities than the senior \nSenator from Mississippi. On top of that, he is one of the closest \nfriends I have in the Senate. I know he has driven mightily in this \nbill to include a lot of things necessary for parts of the country, \nstaying within the caps.\n  My concern is one in the Northeast, that while we hear of talk about \nsupplementals to help us later on--the administration or whoever \nsaying, the check is in the mail--this does not help us. In my little \nState of Vermont, we have witnessed over $40 million just in drought \ndamage. Most of our feed grains were lost this year. Without some \nassistance, many of our farmers are not going to make it through the \nwinter. In the last 2 years, they have suffered through an ice storm \nwhere it dropped to 30 below zero. There has been flooding and two \nsummers of drought.\n  Congress authorized $10.6 billion in disaster payments in fiscal year \n1999. The Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic got 2.5 percent of that. Today \nor tomorrow we will likely pass $8.7 billion in disaster assistance. \nOur farmers will get about 2 cents out of every dollar.\n  According to Secretary Glickman, the drought resulted in a total of \n$1.5 to $2 billion in damages already this year. The recent rains did \nnot alleviate that. Our farmers need additional funding now that is \ntargeted for crop, feed, and livestock losses caused by the drought. We \nneed drought funding for the crop loss disaster assistance program to \nhelp cover crop losses, livestock feed assistance to address feed \nshortages, the Emergency Conservation Program to restore failed water \nsupplies.\n  Without funding targeted drought recovery, most of the $1.2 billion \nwill likely go to the Southern States to recover from Hurricane Floyd. \nAnd they need that funding. I am not asking we take that funding away \nfrom them. I am asking we take care of their needs, but let's not \nneglect the needs of the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic States.\n  I wish we would vote against cloture. Then the President would say, \nwait a minute, maybe we ought to put together a supplemental request \nfor victims of Hurricane Floyd, so the $1.2 billion in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill could be used for drought relief.\n\n  We in the East, east coast Senators, Northeast Senators, have always \nbeen there to vote for disaster assistance for other parts of the \ncountry, even though it has not affected us: earthquake assistance for \nCalifornia, flood assistance for the Mississippi Valley, drought \nassistance in the Upper Plains.\n  When I became chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I brought the \nAgriculture Committee out to North and\n\n[[Page S12411]]\n\nSouth Dakota and elsewhere to emphasize why we needed drought relief, \neven though what we did was going to cost us in the Northeast. Drought \nrelief for Kansas or any other place cost us in increased feed prices, \nin taxes. But we did it because it was the right thing to do. We have \ndone it in cases of hurricane assistance for Texas, Louisiana, North \nand South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, and other States. All we would \nlike is somebody to step back and say, wait a minute, why don't we get \nback to the administration and say, what are you going to request so \nthis actually takes care of everyone.\n  Obviously, I was disappointed that we did not have extended the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact. But my concern would be the same \ntoday, whether it was there or not, because of the drought issues. I am \nconcerned that lifting the Cuban embargo for food and medicine that was \npassed by the Senate by 74 or 75 votes, the Ashcroft amendment, was not \nincluded.\n  I would like to take a moment to reiterate the importance of the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact and my disappointment that its \nextension is not in this bill. The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact \nhas proven itself to be a successful and enduring partnership between \ndairy farmers and consumers throughout New England. Thanks to the \nNortheast Compact, the number of farmers going out of business has \ndeclined throughout New England--for the first time in many years. If \nyou are a proponent of states' rights, regional dairy compacts are the \nanswer. Compacts are state-initiated, state-ratified and state-\nsupported programs that assure a safe supply of milk for consumers.\n  Indeed, half the Governors in the nation, and half the state \nlegislatures in the nation, asked that the Congress allow their States \nto set their own dairy policies--within federally mandated limits--\nthrough interstate compacts. And the dairy compact passed with \noverwhelming support in these States--in Arkansas, for instance, the \nCompact passed the Senate with a vote of 33 to 0 and the House passed \nit with a vote of 91 to 0. In North Carolina, the Compact passed the \nSenate with a vote of 49 to 0 and passed the House with the \noverwhelming majority of 106 to 1. Clearly, there is tremendous support \nfor dairy compacts in these states.\n  Since the Federal policies are not working to keep farmers in \nbusiness, these states acted to make sure that dairy farmers stay in \nbusiness so that consumers can be assured of fresh, local supplies \nmilk. If you support interstate trade, the Northeast Dairy Compact has \nproven itself to be the answer. Once the Compact went into operation, \nthe Office of Management and Budget reported an 8 percent increase in \nsales of milk into the compact region from New York and other \nneighboring States to take advantage of the higher prices. If you \nsupport a balanced budget, dairy compacts are the answer. The Northeast \nCompact does not cost taxpayers a single cent.\n  This is very different from the costliness of many farm programs--\nincluding many which are being funded through this appropriations bill. \nIf you support farmland protection programs, dairy compacts are the \nanswer. Major environmental groups have endorsed the Northeast Dairy \nCompact because they know it helps preserve farmland and prevent urban \nsprawl. In fact, the New Times reported on the importance of the \nCompact for the environment. In an article entitled ``Environmentalists \nSupporting Higher Milk Price for Farmers'' it was explained that \nkeeping farmers on the land maintains the beauty of New England.\n  And if you are concerned about the impact of prices on consumers, \nregional dairy compacts are the answer. Retail milk prices within the \ncompact region are lower on average than in the rest of the nation. I \nwould be pleased to compare retail milk prices in New England against \nretail milk prices in the Upper Midwest.\n  A GAO report, dated October, 1998, compared retail milk prices for \nvarious U.S. cities both inside and outside the Northeast Compact \nregion for various time periods. For example, in February 1998, the \naverage price of a gallon of whole milk in Augusta, ME, was $2.47. The \nprice for Milwaukee, WI, was $2.63/gallon. Prices in Minneapolis, MN, \nwere much higher--they were $2.94/gallon. Let's pick another New \nEngland city--Boston. In February 1998, the price of a gallon of milk \nwas $2.54 as compared to Minneapolis, MN, which was $2.94/gallon. Let's \nlook at the cost of 1 percent milk for November 1997, for another \nexample.\n  In Augusta, ME, it was $2.37/gallon, the same average price as for \nBoston and for New Hampshire and Rhode Island. In Minnesota, the price \nwas $2.82/gallon. I could go on and on comparing lower New England \nretail prices with higher prices in other cities for many different \nmonths. I invite anyone to review this GAO report. It is clear that our \nCompact is working perfectly by benefiting consumers, local economies \nand farmers. This major fact, that in many instances retail milk prices \nin the Compact region were much lower than in areas in the Upper \nMidwest, has been ignored by our opponents. I would also like to point \nout that before the Compact, New England lost 20 percent of its dairy \nfarms from 1990 to 1996--we lost one-fifth of our farms in just 6 \nyears. If farms had kept going under at that rate, the prices of milk \nin stores could have dramatically increased.\n  In June I received a letter from the National Grange strongly \nsupporting the Northeast Dairy compact. They represent 300,000 members \nnationwide, and I want to read a few lines from their letter. It states \nthat ``regional dairy compacts offer the best opportunity to preserve \nfamily dairy farms.'' It continues by stating that:\n\n       The heightened interest and support at the state level for \n     dairy compacts is based largely on the outstanding \n     accomplishments of the Northeast Dairy Compact. There is \n     recognition in the dairy industry that states must work \n     together to strengthen their rural economies and ensure \n     fresh, local supplies of milk to their urban areas.\n\n  The Grange letter notes that ``the Northeast Compact has been \nextremely successful in meeting this goal by balancing the interests of \nprocessors, retailers, consumers, and dairy farmers.''\n  The Grange goes on to support the Southern Dairy compact since a \nSouthern Compact would ``provide dairy farmers in that region with a \nstable price structure for the milk they produce while assuring the \nregion a viable supply of locally produced milk.'' I want to repeat \nthat OMB studied the Compact and concluded that consumer prices in the \nregion were on average five cents lower per gallon than the average for \nthe rest of the nation and that farm income had increased \nsignificantly. OMB also reported that the Compact put more pregnant \nwomen, infants, and children on the WIC program than would have been \nthe case without the Compact. The Compact has also been challenged in \ncourt and has been upheld as constitutional.\n  The Compact does not harm other States. Contrary to what some \nopponents may suggest, the Dairy Compact did not cause a drop in milk \nproduction in other regions of the country such as the Upper Midwest. \nIn fact, in 1997, Wisconsin had an increase in production of 1.7 \npercent while the Compact was in operation. This fact refutes another \nincorrect criticism of the Compact. Contrary to allegations of Compact \nopponents, interstate trade in milk has greatly increased as a result \nof the Compact according to OMB. Milk sales into the Compact region \nincreased by 8 percent--since neighboring New York and other farmers \nwanted to take advantage of the compact.\n  It should also be noted that farmers in the Compact region are now \nmilking about the same number of cows over the past couple of years--\nthey did not suddenly expand their herds to take advantage of the \nCompact as opponents had incorrectly feared. Comparing Vermont's milk \ncows and production from April of last year to April of this year, note \nthat Vermont's milk production did increase--but by only 2.6 percent. \nThis is slightly less than the increase for Wisconsin. However, the \nnumber of cows being milked remained the same for Vermont. Farmers were \nnot buying more cows and expanding their operations under the Compact, \nand production increases were less than other States.\n  So if all these points are refuted by the facts, what is the real \nagenda of those from the Upper Midwest? Based on newspaper accounts \nfrom the Upper Midwest, I think I know the answer. I know that the \nUpper Midwest massively overproduces milk--they produce far more than \nthey can consume--and thus want to sell this milk\n\n[[Page S12412]]\n\nin the South. They do not even attempt to refute the point that they \nare trying to sell their milk outside the state. However, it is very \nexpensive to ship milk because milk weighs a lot, it has to be \nrefrigerated, and the trucks come back empty. I have read press reports \nabout how they want to dehydrate milk--take the water out of milk--and \nthen rehydrate it by adding water in distant states.\n  The Minneapolis Star Tribune explained that Minnesota farmers want to \nsell ``reconstituted milk in Southern markets.'' The article from \nFebruary 12, 1992, points out that ``technology exists for them to draw \nwater from the milk in order to save shipping costs, then reconstitute \nit.''\n  Regular milk needs refrigeration and weighs a lot and is thus \nexpensive to ship. Also, only empty tanker trucks can come back since \nnothing else can be loaded into the milk containers. But dehydrated \nmilk can be shipped in boxes. By taking the water out of milk, the \nUpper Midwest can supply the South with milk.\n  I realize that according to a St. Louis Post-Dispatch article in 1990 \nthat ``Upper Midwest farmers say technological advances in making \npowdered milk and other concentrates has improved the taste and texture \nof reconstituted milk.'' However, the House National Security Committee \nhad a hearing on this reconstituted milk issue in 1997. I will quote \nfrom the hearing transcript: ``the Air Force on Okinawa decided that \nthe reconstituted milk was not suitable for the military and as a \nquality of life decision they closed the milk plant and opted to have \nfluid milk transported in from the United States.'' There was a great \narticle in the Christian Science Monitor a few years ago that talks \nabout the school lunch program.\n  It mentions the first time the author, as a first-grader, was given \nreconstituted milk. He said: ``Now, I like milk. . . .But not this \nstuff. Not watery, gray, hot, reconstituted milk that tasted more like \nrusty pump than anything remotely connected with a cow. We wept. We \ngagged. We choked.'' The second problem with the strategy of Wisconsin \nand Minnesota farmers selling their milk down South is what about ice \nstorms or snow? What happens when flooding or tornado damage or other \nproblems stop these trucks laden with milk?\n  Southern parents might not be able to buy milk at any price any time \nan ice storm hits the Upper Midwest if the South does not have fresh, \nlocal supplies of fresh milk.\n  Just remember the panic that affects Washington, DC, when residents \nthink we might get what is called in Vermont a ``dusting of snow.'' In \nthis debate on the Northeast dairy compact, I was very hopeful a few \nmonths ago that we could work out an amendment on dairy which would be \nsatisfactory to most members. The National Farmers Union made a great \nproposal which could have helped dairy farmers throughout America. The \nPresident of NFU, Leland Swenson, discussed the recent loss of millions \nof dollars by dairy farmers ``when the milk price suddenly dropped by \n37 percent'' in 1 month. In a letter to many Members of Congress, he \npointed out that ``family dairy producers will be subject to even \ngreater economic disaster when the support price is completely phased \nout at the end of the year.'' The National Farmers Union came up with \nan idea that would greatly benefit farmers in the Upper Midwest, the \nSouth, the West, the Northeast and the rest of the country. As their \nletter states, the proposal ``will also help consumers by ensuring a \nsteady supply of fresh milk and quality dairy products at reasonable \nprices.''\n  The NFU proposal consisted of: dairy compacts for the South and the \nNortheast; amendments to the federal order system that help farmers; \nand, third, a dairy price support at $12.50 per hundredweight. NFU \nconcludes by saying that this proposal would ``provide a meaningful \nsafety net for dairy farmers throughout the nation.'' Compacts for the \nNortheast and the South, a good support price for the Upper Midwest, \nthe Midwest, Florida, the Southwest, and the West, and reform to \nFederal order system. All three components would have helped dairy \nfarmers in every region. I know the huge processors launched a massive \nand expensive campaign against all elements of this NFU proposal. The \nprocessors, unfortunately, are for very low dairy prices. These giant \nmultinational processors have bought dozens and dozens of full-page ads \nand sent snow globes to members of the Congress. Their ads demonstrate \nwhat they are against. They oppose: an extension of dairy price \nsupports; increases in price supports; interstate dairy compacts; and \nother reforms to the federal order system designed to keep dairy \nfarmers in business. They propose instead, as do other opponents of \nthis compromise, nothing--they have no proposals that would help dairy \nfarmers.\n  Time will show that the opponents of this National Farmers Union \npackage, these large processors, are making a costly error. If their \npolicies of extremely low prices for dairy farmers continue to drive \nthousands of farmers out of business each year--eventually milk prices \nwill dramatically increase. Unfortunately, I may only be able to say at \na later date that ``I told you so.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. The Senator from \nNew York and the Senator from North Dakota want to speak.\n  On a personal level, I thank Senator Cochran from Mississippi for his \nfine work.\n  I am sympathetic to what my colleagues from the Northeast have to \nsay. They do not believe they really have been in the picture when it \ncomes to disaster relief. I make a commitment, as a Senator from the \nMidwest, to fight very hard with them to do better on disaster relief \nbefore we leave here over the next 4 weeks or 5 weeks. As a matter of \nfact, I have a lot of concerns about this disaster relief bill as well \nand this financial package. I am not sure the farmers in northwest \nMinnesota are going to figure in. We have had a lot of wet weather. \nThey haven't been able to plant their crops.\n  I am very worried that they actually are not going to get this \ndisaster assistance. I also worry about the formula. Altogether, this \nis an $8.7 billion relief package. I worry about the way in which it is \ndelivered. As I have said before, I think the AMTA payments all too \noften go to those least in need without enough going to those most in \nneed.\n  Finally, on the negative side, this is all a very painful way of \nacknowledging that our farm policy is not working. It is a price \ncrisis. Our farmers can't make it on these prices. We are going to lose \na whole generation of producers unless we get the loan rate up and get \nprices up and unless we have a moratorium on these acquisitions and \nmergers. I am determined to have a vote on the moratorium bill. I am \ndetermined to have a vote on doing something to get the prices up for \nfamily farmers. That is what speaks to the root of this crisis, which \nis a very painful economic crisis and a very painful personal crisis \nbecause an awful lot of good people are being driven off the land. The \nonly thing this does is enable people to live to maybe farm another \nday.\n  I say one more time to the majority leader, I want the opportunity to \ncome out with amendments and legislation that will alleviate some of \nthis pain and suffering. I know other Senators feel the same way.\n  Finally, I think I lean heavily toward voting for this only because \nwe need to get some assistance out to people. In Redwood County, which \nhas really been through it, we get about $23 million more to cover \nproduction losses in beans and corn from AMTA payments. I am told by \nTracy Beckman, who directs our FSA office, that Minnesota will receive \nabout $620 million in AMTA payments to be distributed to about 62,000 \neligible producers.\n  I don't think this emergency financial package is anywhere near close \nto perfect. I think it is flawed in a number of ways. I think we are \ngoing to have to do better on disaster relief. But I desperately want \nto get some help out to people. I think at least this is a step in that \ndirection.

Mr. President, under the authority of the leadership, I \nyield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I have received a number of letters from farm organizations and other \ngroups supporting the adoption of the conference report or supporting \ninvoking cloture so we can get to consideration of this conference \nreport.

We urge you to vote for cloture \n     this afternoon.\n       We are thankful to the members of the conference committee \n     for their diligent work in securing much needed financial \n     assistance for farmers who are suffering from this year's \n     devastating drought and low commodity prices.\n       However, we remain disappointed by the process which \n     rendered inadequate levels of funding for weather disaster \n     assistance, excluded trade sanctions reform and did not make \n     needed changes in dairy policy. We appreciate the efforts of \n     members of the House and Senate who worked for these needed \n     changes.\n       Farm Bureau will continue to work to secure these \n     beneficial changes in farm policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Dean Kleckner,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     National Corn\n\n\n                                          Growers Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Charles S. Robb,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Robb. On behalf of the 30,000 members of the \n     National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), I strongly urge the \n     United States Senate to pass the fiscal year 2000 agriculture \n     appropriations conference report. America's farmers are \n     facing Depression-era low prices and the political posturing \n     that continues to delay delivery of the desperately needed \n     $8.6 billion farm assistance package puts these farmers at \n     risk.\n       I cannot stress enough the importance of this farm aid \n     package and the importance of its timely passage. In many \n     cases, the market loss assistance payment will be the only \n     way many of our farmers will meet their end-of-year expenses.\n       The NCGA urges Congress to vote ``aye'' on cloture, \n     preventing an impending filibuster from further delaying the \n     bill, and vote ``aye'' on final passage. Acting immediately \n     on this bill will allow us to get this appropriations process \n     behind us and to then turn our attention to the challenge of \n     crafting long-term policy solutions that will restore the \n     health of the agricultural economy and help us avoid the need \n     for future emergency assistance packages.\n       NCGA looks forward to working with Congress on those long-\n     term goals in the months to come. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lynn Jensen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Wheat Growers,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 1999.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Senate Subcommittee on Agriculture Appropriations, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Cochran: As President of the National \n     Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG), and on behalf of wheat \n     farmers across the nation, I write to commend you and the \n     subcommittee on your hard work in completing the FY2000 \n     Agriculture Appropriations bill.\n       I believe that the emergency assistance package included in \n     the bill will go a long way in meeting the needs of America's \n     wheat producers. At the same time, however, I am very \n     disappointed that the sanctions reform provisions of the \n     Senate's version of the bill were not included in the \n     conference report. NAWG remains committed to lifting all U.S. \n     unilateral sanctions on food and will continue to work \n     towards this goal.\n       It is my understanding that a handful of your colleagues \n     are attempting to block the adoption of the conference report \n     in an effort to address policy matters outside the bill's \n     intended scope. This is unfortunate.\n       NAWG encourages all Senators to vote for cloture and final \n     adoption of the conference report as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jim Stonebrink,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              U.S. Rice Producers Association,\n\n                                     Houston, TX, October 1, 1999.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and \n         Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The U.S. Rice Producers Association \n     (USRPA) represents rice producers in Mississippi, Missouri, \n     Texas, and California, as well as affiliate members that \n     include rice millers, marketers, and other allied businesses. \n     We are writing to express our strong support for the passage \n     of the conference report on H.R. 1906, the fiscal year 2000 \n     agricultural appropriations bill. While this bill is not \n     perfect, it will help to address some of the critical \n     concerns of American rice producers who are facing record low \n     prices.\n       Emergency Assistance: H.R. 1906 includes a package of \n     emergency economic assistance that will be critical to the \n     economic survival of rice producers across the nation. With \n     prices for rice projected to fall by more than one-third \n     compared to last year's already low prices, the enactment of \n     this direct emergency assistance is imperative.\n       Equitable Marketing Loan Payments: H.R. 1906 includes a \n     provision to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     correct the inequitable treatment received by a number of \n     rice producers when the benchmark World Market Price for rice \n     was significantly adjusted downward in August by the \n     Department of Agriculture. For a number of producers, \n     particularly in Texas and Louisiana, only the enactment of \n     this provision can address this issue.\n       Comprehensive Sanctions Reform: We are disappointed that \n     the conference report fails to enact reforms regarding our \n     government's use of unilateral agricultural sanctions. We \n     oppose restrictions on the free and open export of U.S. \n     agricultural commodities that deny American farmers access to \n     important export markets. In particular, Cuba was a very \n     large and dependable market for U.S. rice prior to the \n     imposition of sanctions. However, we do not believe that the \n     failure of the bill to address the sanctions issue should be \n     viewed as a reason to defeat this very important bill.\n       As such, we urge you and your colleagues to vote for final \n     passage of the conference report on H.R. 1906.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Dennis R. DeLaughter,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 American Soybean Association,\n\n                                                  October 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the American Soybean \n     Association (ASA), I would like to express our strong support \n     for immediate passage of the Conference Report on \n     agricultural appropriations for FY-2000. Favorable \n     consideration of this important legislation is even more \n     urgent since it will provide emergency relief for producers \n     of soybeans and other commodities who are suffering from \n     historic low prices and from severe crop losses.\n       U.S. soybean farmers have seen prices fall 32% in the past \n     three years, to a season average level of $5.00 per bushel \n     for the 1999 crop, according to USDA. This represents a \n     decline of $4.4 billion in the value of this year's harvest, \n     compared to 1996.\n       While sluggish foreign demand is partly responsible for \n     lower prices, another factor is the increase in U.S. soybean \n     production under ``Freedom to Farm.'' Since 1996, soybean \n     plantings rose eight million acres, or 12%, from 66 to 74 \n     million acres. This increase has disadvantaged traditional \n     soybean producers, and particularly those who do not receive \n     large payments under the AMTA formula.\n       With Congress prepared to again provide supplemental AMTA \n     assistance to offset low prices received by producers of \n     former program crops, ASA is pleased that the farm relief \n     package includes $475 million to partially compensate \n     producers of soybeans and other oilseeds. This amount will \n     add an estimated 15 cents per bushel to farmers' income from \n     the sale of this year's soybean crop and from marketing loan \n     gains or Loan Deficiency Payments. ASA would like to express \n     appreciation to you for your leadership in including and \n     retaining this provision in the final Conference Report.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Marc Curtis,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               International Dairy\n\n\n                                            Foods Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: Next Tuesday, you will be asked to vote on \n     cloture to stop a filibuster of the final agriculture \n     appropriations conference report as some members seek to \n     force inclusion of controversial dairy compacts in the bill. \n     Without question, dairy compacts artificially inflate milk \n     prices, under the guise of helping dairy farmers.\n       Now is not the time to hold up this agriculture \n     appropriations bill--which includes important farm relief \n     measures. And it certainly isn't the time to unnecessarily \n     increase milk prices to consumers.\n       Attached are numerous editorials from across the nation \n     that strongly urge Congress to reject higher milk prices, and \n     let\n\n[[Page S12414]]\n\n     modest free market reforms stabilize the industry. We urge \n     you to vote for cloture and let the agriculture \n     appropriations process move forward.\n       Sincerely,\n                                              Constance E.

Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Cochran: On behalf of barley producers from \n     across the United States, I am writing to urge Congress to \n     expedite approval of the conference report for FY2000 \n     agricultural appropriations (H.R. 1906). While the conference \n     process was clearly imperfect and barley growers are \n     frustrated by the refusal of the congressional leadership to \n     allow conferees to consider provisions to enact much-needed \n     reforms to US sanctions policy, this package contains several \n     provisions of critical importance to barley producers and to \n     the entire agricultural community. It is important that this \n     package be approved immediately.\n       As such, barley growers urge you and your colleagues to \n     vote for final passage of the conference report on H.R. 1906.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jack Q.

As we \n     have indicated to you previously, the surge over the last few \n     years in cheap imports from China and other nations of the \n     Far East, in large part because of Asia's economic \n     difficulties, has had a severe impact on the American textile \n     industry. Restoration of funding for Step 2 will help offset \n     some of this damage by making the U.S. cotton and U.S. \n     textile industries more competitive with foreign \n     manufacturers.\n       As a final point, we understand and sympathize with the \n     concerns of Senators from dairy producing states. However, we \n     strongly urge that these issues be dealt with in an \n     expeditious manner without holding up this badly needed \n     agriculture spending bill. Please do everything you can to \n     achieve such an outcome which will address the needs of dairy \n     producers without holding American textile manufacturers and \n     cotton producers hostage. We need this conference report to \n     be signed into law as quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Carlos Moore,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Calcot, LTD.,\n\n                                Bakersfield, CA, October 11, 1999.\n     Hon.

Calcot's membership, which totals over \n     2000 members who grow almost 50 percent of the cotton in \n     Arizona and California, fully support the conference bill.\n       Growers are distressed at the delay in getting the \n     conference passed by the Senate. Hopefully, the cloture vote \n     tomorrow afternoon will be successful and this bill can be \n     forwarded to the President shortly after that. Growers \n     desperately need the benefits provided in the assistance \n     package, and we really need Step 2 to prevent the loss of \n     further sales of cotton.\n       Again, we appreciate your efforts to provide this package, \n     but we need it passed by the Senate and signed by the \n     President at the earliest possible date.\n           Sincerely,\n     T.W.

Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and \n         Related Agencies, Senate Appropriations Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The National Peanut Growers Group is a \n     coalition representing peanut growers across the United \n     States. We appreciate very much your hard work in developing \n     the Fiscal Year 2000 Agriculture, Rural Development and \n     Related Agencies appropriations bill. You have always \n     supported our industry.\n       The bill contains several key provisions that assist peanut \n     growers. In addition to important peanut research projects, \n     the bill provides approximately $45 million in direct \n     disaster payments to peanut growers based on the 1999 peanut \n     crop.\n       Language was also added during the Conference that requests \n     the Secretary of Agriculture use peanut growers marketing \n     assessment monies to offset potential program losses in the \n     1999 peanut crop.\n       We support the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill and \n     urge its immediate passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Wilbur Gamble,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 American Bankers Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran: On behalf of the American Bankers \n     Association (ABA), I am writing to express our support for \n     the FY\n\n[[Page S12415]]\n\n     2000 Agricultural Appropriations Conference Report (HR 1906). \n     The ABA represents all categories of banking institutions \n     which includes community, regional and money center banks and \n     holding companies as well as savings associations, trust \n     companies and savings banks. Our members are deeply concerned \n     about the future of our agricultural and rural borrowers.\n       At the end of 1998, our members had over $70 billion in \n     outstanding loans to farm and ranch customers. We provide \n     American agriculture with the credit needed to produce our \n     nation's safe and abundant food and fiber.\n       We join you in supporting the Conference Report because it \n     will address the emergency needs of this vital national \n     industry. Our nation's farmers and ranchers have been \n     battered by low prices and, in some areas, by severe weather \n     conditions. Many of our farmers and ranchers are losing hope \n     and are deciding to leave agriculture.\n       For many of these farmers and ranchers the FY 2000 \n     Agricultural Appropriations Conference Report can make the \n     critical difference between staying on the farm or leaving it \n     forever. We thank you for supporting the legislation, and we \n     urge you to impress on your colleagues the urgent need to \n     pass the legislation as quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Floyd E. Stoner.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the cloture \nvote this afternoon. I acknowledge the work of our colleague, Senator \nCochran, and our colleague, Senator Kohl, who are the chairman and \nranking member of this committee. I have found in my time in the Senate \nthat Senator Cochran is a very fair man. He is somebody who keeps his \nword. He always has time to listen. I appreciate that very much. I also \nappreciate the difficulty he has, along with Senator Kohl, in bringing \nthis bill to the floor. This is not easy to do. It is a very difficult \nthing year after year, to deal with all of our colleagues on these very \ncontentious issues. I thank my colleague, Senator Cochran, for his \npatience more than anything else because he has certainly demonstrated \nthat. I also thank Senator Kohl because he has also listened carefully \nto the needs of our colleagues from around the country.\n  I represent one of the most agricultural States in the Nation. My \nproducers there have been hit by a triple whammy of bad prices, bad \nweather, and bad policy. The prices are the lowest they have been in \nreal terms in over 50 years. There is a price collapse occurring that \nis putting enormous financial pressure on our producers.\n  Bad weather. I guess the simple fact that we had 3 million acres in \nthe State of North Dakota not even planted this year tells a story, not \nbecause it was too dry but because it was too wet. What an \nextraordinary circumstance. Back in 1988 and 1989, we had the worst \ndrought since the 1930s. Now we have the wettest conditions in 100 \nyears. Everywhere you go in North Dakota, at least in a big chunk of \nour State, there is nothing but water. Who could have believed this \ndramatic change? And we are hurt by bad trade policy and bad \nagriculture policy that has further burdened producers.\n  There are several parts of this package that I think are critically \nimportant. The 100-percent AMTA supplemental payment is going to mean \nthat a North Dakota wheat farmer, instead of getting a transition \npayment of 64 cents a bushel on wheat, is going to get $1.28. It may \nnot sound like much to many of my colleagues, and it isn't much in the \ngreat scheme of things. That is going to make the difference between \nliterally thousands of farm families having to be forced off the land \nand being able to survive for another year. That is critically \nimportant.\n  Second, there is a 30-percent crop insurance discount. That is very \nimportant because we have not devised a crop insurance system that can \nwork for the farmers of this country.\n  So those are two important provisions. They deserve our support.\n  As soon as I am positive about this bill, I also want to point out \nthose parts of the bill that are deficient because there is inadequate \ndisaster assistance in this bill. There is not enough money for those \nwho are victims of Hurricane Floyd; there is not enough money for those \nwho are the victims of the drought in the eastern part of the United \nStates; there is not enough money for those farmers in my State who \nhave been flooded out. These are farmers who didn't take a 30-percent \nloss or a 40-percent loss; they took a 100-percent loss because their \nland is under water.\n\n  Mr. President, we have to do better. We will have a further \nopportunity to do so in the legislative process later this year. I hope \nvery much we will do that. But right now, the right vote is to vote for \ncloture.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I must respectfully disagree with my \ncolleague from North Dakota. This bill is a disaster for the farmers in \nthe Northeast. We have been hit, in this bill, by a triple whammy. No. \n1, the dairy compact hangs by a thread. No. 2, the pricing support \nsystem for dairy 1-A is replaced by 1-B. And then, to add insult to \ndouble injury, what has happened is that there is so little disaster \nrelief--given the hurricane in North Carolina, flooding in North \nDakota, and the worst drought in a generation in the Northeast--it is \nhard to see how the money allocated here covers the needs of hard-\npressed farmers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. It just does not \ndo the job for us. I have spoken to many on my side, including our \nminority leader, who shares our heartfelt concerns; and we are going to \nmake an effort to do whatever we can to get extra disaster relief in \nother supplemental bills. But it is faint concern, little concern, to \nthe people and farmers in the Northeast.\n  We have 220,000 farmers in the Northeast, according to the Secretary \nof Agriculture. We have a program, a dairy program, and fruits and \nvegetables as well, that are different from the majority of farming \nhere in this country. It is not a row crop, and they are not large \nfarms; they are family farms.\n  I will leave my colleagues with a plea: We need help. We need real \nhelp, particularly this year when low prices and the drought have \nseverely affected us. We are not getting the help we need in this bill, \nand we hope we can come back another day and get it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I yield the time \nthat he may consume to the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, because of the lowest commodity prices \nin a quarter century in the Midwest and probably every place else in \nthe United States, I support the conference report we are considering \nthis afternoon. While there are elements of the legislation that I \nmight not support, or would rather not have in the bill, I think the \ngreater good is served by passing this legislation as quickly as \npossible. The sooner we pass this legislation, the sooner we can assist \nthe family farmer. That was our intention when we began this process \nthe first week of August, and I am glad to see it will be accomplished \nin the near future.\n  As everyone is aware, there is a crisis in rural America due to these \nlow commodity prices. I made a promise 3 years ago to guarantee a \nsmooth transition from big government command and control to a market-\ndriven agricultural economy. We predicted 3 years ago, in the 1996 farm \nbill, that that smooth transition would require about $5.5 billion for \nthe year 1999. We didn't anticipate the lowest prices in 25 years and, \nobviously, that transition turned out to be more difficult than we \nanticipated. To remedy the situation we have added economic assistance \nin this bill that we did not predict was necessary three years ago.\n  A number of factors have contributed to the downturn in the \nagriculture economy that we have experienced over the last 18 months. I \nwould like to tell you that the answer to our problem is as easy as \nchanging the 1996 farm bill. But, in fact, the economics involved are \ncomplex and international. For example, we saw soybean prices take a \nnosedive a while back, not because of anything we did in this country, \nbut because the Brazilian currency lost one-quarter of its value \novernight.\n\n[[Page S12416]]\n\n Brazil happens to be a major soybean producer and also an exporter. \nThat action also shaved roughly a dollar a bushel off of U.S. soybean \nprices.\n  Another example is that Asia has been one of our fastest growing and \nstrongest export markets. But when the Asian economy crashed, they \ncould no longer buy American pork and our grain. The financial crisis \nAsia experienced hurt all our farmers in America, even my friends and \nneighbors back at New Hartford, Iowa.\n  Global trade manifested by exports has become a mainstay of our \nNation's family farmers. Roughly one-fourth of farm receipts today come \nfrom overseas sales. Iowa is a significant supplier to the world, being \nthe Nation's No. 2 exporter of agricultural commodities, after \nCalifornia. The solution is to increase our access to world markets by \npassing fast track and opening doors through the World Trade \nOrganization and other trade agreements, not by limiting our ability to \ncompete in the world market by choking our own production.\n  There are 100 million new mouths to feed every year, almost a billion \nin the next decade. Farmers someplace in the world are going to feed \nthose new mouths. I would rather it be Iowa or United States products \nthan Brazilian and Argentine products. We can do it and compete. In the \nshort-term though, the most effective means of helping our family \nfarmers in need is providing economic assistance as quickly as \npossible.\n  The fastest means to provide emergency relief to our farmers is \nthrough the AMTA mechanism. I would like to mention that some of my \ncolleagues have criticized our plan to distribute income assistance \nthrough the AMTA payment mechanism. I have heard and witnessed \nstatements that would lead some to believe that landowners who do not \nshare in production risk or management are benefiting from this \nassistance. The 1996 farm bill states that payments are only available \nto those who ``assume all or part of the risk of producing a crop.''\n  Recently, 53 Senators signed a bipartisan letter asking Secretary \nGlickman whether there are payments being made to those who do not \nshare risk in agriculture--risk in a specific farming operation. If \nthat is occurring we have requested in the letter to Secretary Glickman \nthat the proper disciplinary action for any official approving payments \nin this manner be administered. But if this is not happening, I \napologize for my colleagues who have delayed the process by making \nbaseless claims due to their own ignorance.\n\n  So the action we take today guarantees the future stability of the \nfamily farmer and the agricultural economy. It is with this in mind \nthat I support this cloture motion and hope this bill passes, because \nwithin 10 days after getting this bill signed by the President, this \nmoney can be distributed to the farmers of America.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we are close to running out of \ntime. I will use my leader time to make a few comments on the pending \nconference report.\n  I come to the same conclusion as the distinguished Senator from Iowa, \nand I would like to elaborate, if I could, briefly on why I have come \nto that conclusion.\n  I believe we ought to be supportive of this conference report, but I \nmust say I am deeply disappointed that we have to be in this position \nin the first place. This is a badly flawed bill from many perspectives. \nI strongly disagree with using the AMTA mechanism as the only mechanism \nby which we provide resources to those in need. As a result of our \nreliance on AMTA, there will be thousands of people no longer directly \ninvolved in agriculture who are going to get payments of over five and \na half billion dollars. Our view is that that is a tragedy, given the \nlimited resources we have available to us and the extraordinary need to \nensure that resources are spent in the most prudent fashion. They will \nnot be, in large measure, because of the formula incorporated in this \nlanguage.\n\n  I also am very deeply concerned about the fact that there is no loan \navailability in this bill. There are going to be farmers who are going \nto be turned away from banks throughout the country. When they are \nturned away, as is happening on many occasions, farmers go to the Farm \nService Agency to ensure they can get the resources they need.\n  Let us be clear. There is no recourse as a result of this \nlegislation. Farmers have no opportunity to get alternative loan \navailability because there is no money in this bill for loans. For that \nreason, too, I am very concerned about the deficiencies in this \nlegislation.\n  As most of us know, we have lost a substantial number of our pork \nproducers. The number of pork producers in South Dakota has diminished \nsubstantially in recent years. In fact, we have lost a large portion of \nthe percentage of our hog producers in the last year in large measure \nbecause of the disastrous crisis they are now facing. There is not $1 \nin here for livestock producers involved in pork production. As a \nresult, our pork producers have no hope of obtaining any kind of \nassistance as a result of this legislation.\n  I must say we also are deeply concerned about the impact this \nlegislation could have, if this is the last word on the circumstances \nthose in the Northeast currently are facing. They have experienced \nserious drought. Other parts of the country have faced other serious \nfarm disasters. The disaster assistance in this package is absolutely \nunacceptable. The $1.2 billion is a fraction of what will be required \nif we are going to meet all of the obligations this country should and \nmust meet to address disaster needs, especially in the Northeast, in \nthe coming 12 months. We have an extraordinary deficiency with regard \nto disaster assistance.\n  As a result of that as well, I am deeply troubled that we are faced \nwith a very untenable choice: vote for this, and get some assistance \nout to those who will receive it, in time for it to do some good, or do \nnothing and hope that somehow in some way at some time we can resolve \nthis matter before the end of the session.\n  I sadly come to the conclusion that what we have to do is take what \nwe can get now, to take what we have been able to put in the bank now, \nand keep fighting to address all of these deficiencies before the end \nof this session. I have said just now to my colleagues in the Northeast \nthat we will not rest, we will not be satisfied until we have \nadequately addressed their needs in disaster assistance before the end \nof this session. We will make that point with whatever vehicles we have \navailable to us, appropriations or otherwise. It is absolutely \nessential that we provide that assistance before the end of this year \nand send a clear message that we understand the gravity of their \ncircumstances and are prepared to address it.\n  I might also say that we have to look also at an array of policy \nconsiderations. My view is that we are in this box in large measure \nbecause we created it ourselves. Those who voted for Freedom to Farm \nare coming to the realization that clearly this is a situation that has \nto be resolved through public policy, in new farm policy, with the \ncreation of a safety net, with the creation of market incentives to \ncreate more of a balance between supply and demand than what we have \nright now.\n  That is a debate for another day. We are left with a choice about \nwhether or not we provide $8.7 billion in aid now, as poor as the \nvehicle may be, to people who need it so badly. I will vote yes, and I \nencourage my colleagues to do likewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a \nletter addressed to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nstrongly endorsing the method of payment used for the disaster \nassistance portion of this bill from the American Soybean Association \nand other groups be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nrecord, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens: We are well aware that some have \n     encouraged conferees on the FY00 agricultural appropriations \n     bill to use alternative forms of funding emergency farm \n     income disaster assistance rather\n\n[[Page S12417]]\n\n     than supplemental Agricultural Market Transition Act (AMTA) \n     payments.\n       In Secretary Glickman's September 15 testimony before the \n     House Agricultural Committee, he says ``To be sure, there is \n     an immediate need to provide cash assistance to mitigate low \n     prices, falling incomes, and in some areas, falling land \n     values. Congress should enact a new program to target \n     assistance to farmers of 1999 crops suffering from low \n     prices. The Administration believes the income assistance \n     component must address the shortcomings of the farm bill by \n     providing counter-cyclical assistance.'' He goes on to say, \n     ``The income assistance should compensate for today's low \n     prices and therefore they should be paid according to this \n     year's actual production of the major field crops, including \n     oilseeds, not a formula based on an artificial calculation \n     done a decade ago.''\n       Mr. Chairman, we strongly disagree with that philosophy. \n     The current economic distress is partly a result of the \n     unfulfilled promises of expanded export markets, reduced \n     regulations, and tax reform that were part of the promises \n     made during deliberation of the 1996 farm bill. The costs of \n     these unfulfilled promises fall upon those people who were \n     participating in farm programs at that time.\n       The AMTA payment process is in place and can deliver \n     payments quickly. The administrative costs of developing an \n     alternative method of payments would be very high and eat \n     into funds that should go to farmers. Given the 7\\1/2\\ months \n     it took the Department to issue weather disaster aid last \n     year, we are unwilling to risk that producers might have to \n     wait that long for development and implementation of a new \n     farm economy disaster aid formula. Time is also critical for \n     suppliers of goods and services to producers. They need \n     payments for supplies now to stay in business, not just \n     promises that something will happen in the future.\n       Supplemental AMTA payments provide income to producers of \n     corn, wheat, cotton, rice, barley, and grain sorghum. Soybean \n     producers will receive separate payments under the Senate \n     Agricultural Appropriations language. Crop cash receipts for \n     these producers in 1999 will be down over 20 percent from the \n     1995-97 yearly average. Producers who have smaller than \n     normal crops due to weather problems will receive normal \n     payment levels. This is better than using the loan deficiency \n     payment program (LDPs) which are directly tied to this year's \n     production.\n       We urge you to retain the $5.5 billion in supplemental AMTA \n     payments as the method of distribution for farm economy aid \n     in the agricultural appropriations conference agreement. Any \n     alternative would certainly take additional time to provide \n     assistance to producers--time which we cannot afford.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Farm Bureau Federation; American Soybean \n           Association; National Association of Wheat Growers; \n           National Corn Growers Association; Nation Cotton \n           Council; National Grain Sorghum Producers; National \n           Sunflower Association; U.S. Canola Association; USA \n           Rice Federation.\n\n\n                            freeman lake dam\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the conference report making \nappropriations for fiscal year 2000 for Agriculture, Rural Development, \nFood and Drug Administration and Related Agencies which is currently \nbefore the Senate contains language under the Watershed and Flood \nPrevention Operations account of the Natural Resources Conservation \nService, NRCS, to utilize Emergency Watershed Protection Program monies \nto perform rehabilitation of designated dams constructed under the \nagency's watershed program. Is this correct?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The gentleman from Kentucky is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask the distinguished Chairman of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee if the conference report directs NRCS to \nprovide financial assistance for the Freeman Lake Dam located in \nElizabethtown, Kentucky?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I assure the gentleman from Kentucky that the Conference \nReport does contain the language as he has described.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chairman for including this project in the \nconference report. The Freeman Lake Dam is in dire need of \nrehabilitation, and the safety of the community rests upon the \nintegrity of this dam. Finally, I would ask the gentleman from \nMississippi, is it the conference's intent that funding to rehabilitate \nthis dam comes from existing Emergency Watershed Protection program \nfunds, since this structure represents a serious threat to life and \nproperty.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The gentleman from Kentucky is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                      food and drug administration\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about certain aspects \nof the FY 2000 funding level for the Food and Drug Administration. My \ngreatest concern is that while the FY 2000 conference report provides \nabout $70 million over FDA's 1999 funding level of $982,217 million, \nthis is about $90 million below the agency's FY 1999 request of $1.142 \nbillion.\n  While the conference report for FY 2000 does fund important new \ninitiatives within the FDA such as food safety programs, other key \npriorities are not accommodated such as $20.4 million for phase I \nfunding for construction of the agency's Los Angeles laboratory \nfacility and $15.3 million for improvements to FDA's adverse event \nreporting system.\n  I thank the chairman for allowing me to bring these vital issues to \nhis attention. If Congress can find resources to fund these important \npriorities, the American public will reap great benefits. Finally, I \ncommend him for your demonstrated leadership and expertise in financing \nthe operations FDA and I look forward to continuing to work with you on \nfunding this key public health agency.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Utah for his comments regarding \nfunding for the Food and Drug Administration. As the Senator knows, the \nCongress is required to comply with fiscal year 2000 budget caps on \ndiscretionary spending. Unlike the President's budget, we do not have \nthe luxury of being able to offset appropriations' increases with \nsavings from questionable scoring tactics, or from new user fee and \nother proposed legislation which has not won the support of the \nappropriate authorizing committees of the Congress.\n  I understand the Senator's concern that this conference agreement \ndoes not provide the full fiscal year 2000 level requested for the FDA. \nHowever, it does provide the FDA with a substantial increase in funding \nfrom the fiscal year 1999 level to provide the amount requested for two \nof FDA's highest priority activities--food safety and premarket review. \nI can assure my colleague from Utah that we will continue to review the \nfunding needs of this critical public health agency and consider future \nrequests of the agency to enhance funding for its essential activities, \nincluding those which he has brought to our attention here today.\n\n\n                        wic program requirements\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the conference \nreport on H.R. 1906, the fiscal year 2000 Appropriations Act for \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies. Included in this \nAct is more than $4 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition \nProgram for Women, Infants, and Children commonly known as the WIC \nprogram. This is one of the most successful programs provided by the \nfederal government, and I am glad to see that an increase above last \nyear's level is provided in this Act.\n  However, I have concerns about language in the statement of managers \nto accompany this conference report about the WIC program. This \nlanguage relates to the so-called ``sugar cap'' and I would like to ask \nmy friend from Wisconsin, the ranking member of the appropriations \nsubcommittee, about this specific provision.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Michigan, and he is correct, there \nis language in the statement of managers that instructs the Department \nof agriculture not to make any exceptions to the WIC sugar cap.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask the Senator, did this or any similar language appear \nin either the House or Senate measures before the conference committee \nconvened?\n  Mr. KOHL. This particular language was offered in the conference \ncommittee, and it does not appear in either the House or Senate \nversions of the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bills or reports.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. I was surprised to learn that \nlanguage relating to specific nutritional policy of the USDA--policy \nthat has been the subject of significant study and debate within the \nagency for years--that language which appears to reach a conclusion on \nthe outcome of years of study has been slipped into the fiscal year \n2000 appropriations report. This language appeared, deus ex machina, at \nthe very last minute and without discussion by all the conferees. \nThankfully, the language is not binding on USDA, so the agency can \ncontinue with their\n\n[[Page S12418]]\n\ndecision making process, without being bound by the language in the \nconference report.\n  Substantively, the report language conflicts with the USDA's own \nrecommendations on children's diets. When the National Association of \nWIC Directors and the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion \nboth urge people to add fruit to their cereal, it is irrational and \nincoherent to deny people the opportunity to obtain fruit in their \ncereal. But that is what the report language would accomplish.\n  USDA should make a determination on how the sugar cap on breakfast \ncereals in the WIC package of foods should be calculated and how best \nto incorporate fruit into WIC participants' diets. The agency should \nbring nutritional science and common sense to the task, and it should \nensure that the rule is consistent with the nutritional recommendations \nthat it makes regarding children's diets.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague that the \nUSDA, which has the expertise to make an informed decision about the \nvalue of fruit and other foods in children's diets should be left alone \nto design the composition of the WIC food packages. Over the past \nseveral years, the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies \nappropriations bill has become a vehicle for the debate surrounding the \ncontent of sugar in certain foods eligible for inclusion in the WIC \nprogram. More recently, the fiscal year 1999 Statement of Managers \ninstructed the Department to provide $300,000 for a study by the \nNational academy of Sciences on this issue, which was not conducted. \nNow, the fiscal year 2000 Statement of Managers includes language \ndirecting that no exception to the sugar cap be made. I assume that \nthis pattern of direction is as frustrating to all of us as it is to \nWIC program administrators, participants, and suppliers.\n  Our goal, quite simply, should be to promote a healthy diet for all \nAmericans. USDA nutrition policy should consider the totality of U.S. \neating habits and aim for consumer education and program implementation \nthat deals with a person's overall diet rather than one burdened by \nrequirements attached in a piecemeal fashion.\n  It is unfortunate that the grip of political consideration has taken \nhold of a matter best left to nutritionists and those trained in the \nscience of public health. It is also unfortunate that the result has \nbeen inconsistent policy development where certain nutritional \nlimitations have been imposed on some components of USDA nutrition \nprograms, but not on others. This issue should be resolved by experts \nwho can best determine dietary guidelines properly suited for all \nAmericans. My intent also does not suggest that USDA nutrition programs \nshould be made more complicated than they are, but that a simple \ninjection of common sense should prove refreshing and, hopefully, a \nbasis for sound public policy.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the view of the Senators from Michigan and \nCalifornia regarding this issue. For many years, I too have grown \nconcerned by the trend away from healthy food choices and toward eating \npatterns that may lead to tremendous health care costs in the future. \nTo the extent that human health is a result or human choices, there is \nprobably no better example than in what we choose to eat.\n  In my opinion, American consumers receive too much persuasion \nregarding diet from our popular culture and far too little from those \nbest qualified to provide good counsel. In the instance of the matter \nraised by the Senator from Michigan, I am not sure what benefits to \npublic policy are achieved by an never ending discussion within \npolitical circles where expertise in human nutrition is probably \nlacking. Does this send a good strong message to the American consumer \nregarding the right choices to make regarding nutrition? I hardly think \nso.\n  It is time, it is long time, for politicians to step back and let the \nexperts decide what is best for the American consumer. The Senator from \nMichigan makes some valid points regarding the need for a common sense \napproach to nutrition and public health. I hope the Department of \nagriculture recognizes that their responsibly transcends the political \nwinds where some matters, such as sound nutritional advice, have no \nplace. I would not expect doctors at the Mayo Clinic to take my advice \non how to proceed with a delicate operation. Further, I would not \nexpect nutrition experts at USDA to take my advice on what details best \nconstitute a totally balance diet for a certain population beyond my \nsuggestion that they use their best judgement base don their knowledge \nand experience. If they don't follow those standards it is unclear why \nthey are there in the first place.\n\n\n                           tobacco provisions\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the tobacco \nprovisions of this bill, will provide an additional $328,000,000 in \nfunds for farmers who produce the major cigarette tobaccos--burley and \nflue-cured tobacco. It is those farmers who have been the most affected \nby recent developments with respect to the manufacture and use of \ncigarettes. It is those farmers also who are the subject of the recent \n``Phase II Settlement'' in which moneys are being made available to \nburley and flue-cured tobacco growers through the use of State trusts. \nIt is also my understanding that the bill's reference to those farms \nwho receive ``quotas'' under the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938, is \nintentional, and does limit the relief, to burley and flue-cured \ntobacco. The reference to ``quotas'' is to poundage quotas and burley \nand flue-cured tobacco are the only tobaccos under the current \nregulatory scheme that receive poundage ``quotas'' as opposed to \nacreage allotments. This limitation to burley and flue-cured tobaccos \nis intentional and reflects recent developments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The gentleman from Kentucky is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Agriculture, \nRural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies \nAppropriations conference report for fiscal year 2000.\n  The conference report provides $68.6 billion in new budget authority \n(BA) and $48.5 billion in new outlays to fund most of the programs of \nthe Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. Within this \namount, $8.7 billion in BA, and $8.3 billion in outlays is designated \nas emergency spending for farmers who have experienced weather-related \ndisasters, and for additional market transition payments to compensate \nfarmers for depressed commodity prices. All of the discretionary \nfunding in this bill is nondefense spending. When outlays from prior-\nyear appropriations and other adjustments are taken into account, the \nconference report totals $73.0 billion in BA and $55.7 billion in \noutlays for FY 2000.\n  The Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 302(b) conference \nallocation totals $73.0 billion in BA and $55.7 billion in outlays. \nWithin this amount, $22.7 billion in BA and $22.6 billion in outlays is \nfor nondefense discretionary spending, of which $8.7 billion in BA, and \n$8.3 billion in outlays are designated as emergency spending. For \ndiscretionary spending in the bill, and counting (scoring) all the \nmandatory savings in the bill, the conference report is at the \nSubcommittee's 302(b) allocation in BA and outlays. It is $8.7 billion \nin BA and $8.5 billion in outlays above the 1999 level for \ndiscretionary spending, $1.1 billion in BA and $1.0 billion in outlays \nabove the Senate-passed bill, and $8.2 billion in BA and $7.7 billion \nin outlays above the President's request for these programs.\n  I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its \n302(b) allocation. I appreciate the committee's support for a number of \nongoing projects and programs important to my home State of New Mexico \nas it has worked to keep this bill within its budget allocation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nSenate Budget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   H.R. 1906, AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS, 2000, SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                            CONFERENCE REPORT\n               [Fiscal year 2000, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     Purpose   Crime  Mandatory   Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n  Budget authority................    22,687  ......    50,295    72,982\n  Outlays.........................    22,578  ......    33,088    55,666\n\n[[Page S12419]]\n\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority................    22,687  ......    50,295    72,982\n  Outlays.........................    22,578  ......    33,088    55,666\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority................    14,005  ......    41,460    55,465\n  Outlays.........................    14,093  ......    33,429    47,522\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority................    14,520  ......    50,295    64,815\n  Outlays.........................    14,831  ......    33,088    47,919\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority................    13,882  ......    50,295    64,177\n  Outlays.........................    14,508  ......    33,088    47,596\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority................    21,619  ......    50,295    71,914\n  Outlays.........................    21,532  ......    33,088    54,620\n \n  CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority................  ........  ......  .........  .......\n  Outlays.........................  ........  ......  .........  .......\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority................     8,682  ......     8,835    17,517\n  Outlays.........................     8,485  ......      -341     8,144\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority................     8,167  ......  .........    8,167\n  Outlays.........................     7,747  ......  .........    7,747\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority................     8,805  ......  .........    8,805\n  Outlays.........................     8,070  ......  .........    8,070\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority................     1,068  ......  .........    1,068\n  Outlays.........................     1,046  ......  .........    1,046\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted\n  for consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment that the agriculture appropriations conference report \nthat Congress is sending to the President does not ratify a Southern \nDairy Compact that 14 state legislatures have approved.\n  I recently met with several dairy farmers from Tennessee who stressed \nto me the importance of the Southern Dairy Compact to their farms' \nsurvival. Dramatic fluctuations in the price of milk continue, and it \nis increasingly difficult for these family farms, many of which have \nbeen passed down from one generation to the next, to hang on during the \nhard times. Let me illustrate how dire the situation is: in the last \ntwo years, 400 dairy farms in Tennessee have been forced out of \nbusiness, reducing the total number of farms producing Grade-A milk in \nthe state to under 1,000 for first time since anyone started counting.\n  Today I will vote to cut off a filibuster on the agriculture \nappropriations conference report because America's farmers are in \nurgent need of the disaster assistance the bill provides and cannot \nafford any delay in its delivery, but I am no less committed to the \nestablishment of a Southern Dairy Compact. I believe it would provide \nthe stability in milk prices that dairy farmers need to survive and \nwould protect the region's local supply of milk. Fourteen southern \nstates, including Tennessee, have voted to participate in the Southern \nDairy Compact, and it's now up to Congress to ratify it. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to get that done.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Cochran and his staff for \nputting together a bill that encompasses the needs of agriculture. I \nalso thank Chairman Stevens for his cooperation during the agricultural \nappropriations process. I am pleased with the funding that went to my \nhome State of Montana as well as to important national programs for \nagriculture.\n  During this economic crisis in agriculture, immediate funding needs \nof farmers and ranchers must be addressed. I believe this bill does \nthat. The $8.7 billion package contains important funding for \nAgricultural Marketing Transition Act, AMTA payments for wheat and \nbarley producers in Montana, as well as $322 million for livestock \nproducers and $650 million in crop insurance.\n  Additionally, I am thrilled that price reporting was included in the \nfinal bill at my request. I have been trying to secure price reporting \nfor our livestock producers for quite some time now. This legislation \nwill provide producers with the information they need to make prudent \nmarketing decisions, and take the control out of the hands of the meat \npackers.\n  Four major packers control 79% of the meat-packing industry. It is \nnecessary to have this price reporting information accessible to \nproducers so that they may take advantage of the best possible market \nopportunities available. Additionally, they must have the assurance \nthat they are receiving accurate data.\n  The majority of livestock producers in Montana sell their feeder \ncalves to feeder markets, which are highly concentrated. Increased \nconcentration within the agricultural industry provides them fewer and \nfewer options open for marketing. Price reporting will increase market \ntransparency and present producers an accurate view of the market.\n  The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American Sheep \nIndustry, and the National Pork Producers Council worked extensively \nwith State producer organizations and the packers to craft a bill that \nwill work for everyone and directly benefit producers. The end result \nof this work is the legislation included in agricultural appropriations \nas ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Agriculture on July 29, \n1999. I join all of these interested parties in directing the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the administration generally to this \ndocument for use in the correct interpretation and administration of \nthis important law.\n  I am disappointed that policy issues such as dairy and food-related \nsanctions were eventually stripped from this bill. I believe these \nconcerns must be addressed as soon as possible. I will support Option \n1-A legislation in H.R. 1402, in order to ensure my dairy farmers are \ntaken care of. Additionally, I will support Senator Ashcroft in his \nefforts to exempt food and medicine from sanctioned countries. American \nfarmers and ranchers stand much to lose by not having all viable \nmarkets open to them.\n  Again, I thank the fine chairman, Mr. Cochran, for all his good work \non this bill. I will continue to work for Montana farmers and ranchers \nto make sure they make not only a decent living but one that is \nprofitable and fulfilling.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about some grave \nconcerns I have regarding the dramatic and unprecedented cuts to Title \nXX, the Social Services Block Grant, in S. 1650, the Labor-Health and \nHuman Services Appropriations bill.\n  As I am sure many of my colleagues are aware, the Social Services \nBlock Grant is currently authorized at $2.38 billion, but the Senate \nbill provides for only $1.05 billion, a reduction of more than 50%, for \nFiscal Year 2000. In addition, it appears that the bill would also \naccelerate the reduction in transferability of Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families--or TANF--from 10% to 4.25%. In other words, not only \nhas the appropriation been slashed in half, the ability of the states \nand counties to transfer other dollars into SSBG is also sharply \nreduced.\n  My immediate reaction when I learned about these cuts to SSBG was \nenormous disappointment. When I travel through each of Wisconsin's 72 \ncounties each year holding town-meeting style listening sessions, many \nof my constituents have discussed with me the value and importance of \nSSBG funds in enabling the provision of vitally-needed services for \nsome of our most vulnerable citizens. I have the benefit of a very \nengaged and active Counties Association to keep me informed about the \nimportance of assuring SSBG funding.\n  But perhaps not all of my colleagues share my good fortune in this \nrespect, perhaps some of our colleagues are not aware of the value of \nSSBG funds in their own states and communities--that is the only reason \nI can think of why these cuts are included in the bill. In the event \nthat that is the case, please allow me a few moments to elaborate on \nthe important services that SSBG dollars fund in my home state of \nWisconsin:\n  Wisconsin counties received more than $42 million in SSBG dollars in \nFY 1997, the most recent year for which data is available. Those \ndollars provided services to Wisconsin's Seniors such as home meal \ndelivery programs like meals-on-wheels, day programs for seniors, and \nsupportive home care. SSBG dollars also help to provide crucial \nservices to protect children, such as investigating potential child \nabuse cases and providing protective services for children who ARE \nbeing abused, and providing for after school programs so that children \nhave a safe place to go in the afternoon. Throughout Wisconsin, SSBG \ndollars have enabled Wisconsin's counties to provide these services to \n283,964 Wisconsinites--many of whom will lose access to these services \nif SSBG is further cut.\n  Lastly, let me illustrate what the impact of SSBG cuts means for some \ncommunities in Wisconsin: the Rainbow Center for Prevention of Child \nAbuse in Dane County, Wisconsin, will have to cut services for 130 \nfamilies. In Milwaukee County, 428 patients will not receive outpatient \nmental health care, and 550 adults seeking drug and alcohol abuse \ntreatment will be turned away. Milwaukee County will also lose funding \nfor more than 2,000 shelter nights for the homeless and victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this short description of the many ways \nSSBG supports and strengthens counties and local communities helps to \nillustrate why a 50% reduction in funds will be so devastating. I hope \nthat House and Senate conferees will restore SSBG to its authorized \namount for Fiscal Year 2000 so that the counties who so rely on these \nfunds will be able to provide the services our constituents need, \nservices that are vital to supporting and strengthening our \ncommunities.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/12/senate-section/article/S12420-4", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/12/senate-section/article/S12420-5", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12420-S12421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE OPERATION OF THE CARIBBEAN BASIN ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 63\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 214 of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery \nExpansion Act of 1990 (19 U.S.C. 2702(f)), I transmit herewith to the \nCongress the Third Report on the Operation of the Caribbean Basin \nEconomic Recovery Act.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of pregnancy-related assistance for targeted low-\nincome pregnant women; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           mothers and newborns health insurance act of 1999\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nI believe is vitally important to the health care of children and \npregnant women in America. The goal of this legislation is simple--to \nmake sure more pregnant women and more children are covered by health \ninsurance so they have access to the health care services they need to \nbe healthy.\n  The need is great--on any given day, almost 12 million children and \nalmost half a million pregnant women do not have health insurance \ncoverage. For many of these women and children, they or their family \nsimply can't afford insurance. Many others are actually eligible for a \npublic program like Medicaid or CHIP, but they don't know they are \neligible and are not signed up.\n  Lack of health insurance can lead to numerous health problems, both \nfor children and for pregnant women. A child without health coverage is \nmuch less likely to receive the health care services that are needed to \nensure the child is healthy, happy, and fully able to learn and grow. \nAn uninsured pregnant woman is much less likely to get critical \nprenatal care that reduces the risk of health problems for both the \nwoman and the child. Babies whose mothers receive no prenatal care or \nlate prenatal care are at-risk for many health problems, including \nbirth defects, premature births, and low birth-weight.\n  The bill I am introducing--along with Senators Breaux, McCain, and \nBaucus--deals with this insurance problem in two ways.\n  First, it allows states to provide prenatal care for low-income \npregnant women under the state's CHIP program if the state chooses.\n  Through the joint federal-state Children's Health Insurance Program, \nstates are currently expanding the availability of health insurance for \nlow-income children. However, federal law prevents states from using \nCHIP funds to provide prenatal care to low-income pregnant women over \nage 19, even though babies born to many low-income women become \neligible for CHIP as soon as they are born.\n  As many as 45,000 additional women could be covered for prenatal \ncare. There are literally billions of dollars of CHIP funds that states \nhave not used yet, so I would hope that most states would choose this \noption. This provision will not impact federal CHIP expenditures \nbecause it does not change the existing federal spending caps for CHIP. \nBabies born to pregnant women covered by a state's CHIP program would \nbe automatically enrolled and receive immediate coverage under CHIP \nthemselves. It is foolish to deny prenatal care to a pregnant mother \nand then--only after the baby is born--provide the child with coverage \nunder CHIP. Prenatal care can be just as important to a newborn baby as \npostnatal care, and the prenatal care is of course important for the \nmother as well.\n  Second, the bill will help states reach out to women and children who \nare eligible for--but not signed up for--Medicaid or CHIP. 358,000 \npregnant women and 3 million children are estimated to be eligible for \nbut not enrolled in Medicaid. Millions of additional children are \neligible for but not yet enrolled in CHIP. When Congress passed the \nwelfare reform bill back in 1996, we created a $500 million fund that \nstates could tap into to make sure that all Medicaid-eligible people \nstayed in Medicaid. The problem is that only about 10 percent of that \nfund has been used, and most states are about to lose their 3-year \nwindow of opportunity to use these funds. My bill would allow states \ncontinued access to these funds by eliminating the 3-year deadline, and \nit would give states more flexibility to use the funds to reach out to \nboth Medicaid and CHIP-eligible women and children.\n  This legislation is a smaller piece of a bill I introduced earlier \nthis year called Healthy Kids 2000. By extracting it from the larger \nbill, we get a chance to show the widespread support I believe exists \nfor these measures. I believe this is crucial legislation, and urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of it so that we can pass this \nbill.\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Bond \nin introducing the Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of 1999. \nThis is important legislation regarding our children's health.\n  More than 12 million women of childbearing age--one in five--lacked \nhealth insurance in 1998, according to the Census Bureau. Lack of \ninsurance leads to bad outcomes for pregnant woman and the children. \nPregnant women without health insurance face barriers to care and do \nnot receive the medical attention they need to have healthy babies. The \nMothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act could provide insurance \ncoverage to virtually all pregnant women in the United States. Such \ncoverage will have an enormous impact on the health of children in our \nnation, by ensuring pregnant women have access to prenatal care and \nautomatically enrolling their babies in their State Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  In the United States, 7.6 out of 1000 babies die before their first \nbirthday. Our nation is ranked 25th, in the world for our infant \nmortality rate. The statistics in my home state are even more \ndisheartening; in Louisiana where 24.7% of childbearing age women are \nuninsured, there are 9.8 deaths per 1000 births. Many of these deaths \nare preventable, and good prenatal care is the first step to ensuring \nthat babies see their first birthday.\n  The Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of 1999 addresses these \nconcerns in three ways. One, it would amend Title XXI of the Social \nSecurity Act to give states the options to use Children's Health \nInsurance Program (CHIP) funds for health insurance coverage of \nuninsured low income pregnant women. Two, it would automatically enroll \nnewborns to CHIP eligible women in CHIP for one year. And\n\n[[Page S12422]]\n\nthree, our bill would provide states additional opportunities to tap \ninto a $500 million fund created by the 1996 welfare reform act to help \nexpand Medicaid outreach efforts. This bill would allow the fund to be \nused for any Medicaid or CHIP outreach initiatives.\n  This Act could provide insurance coverage to 95% of currently \nuninsured women, by both increasing outreach efforts to pregnant women \neligible for Medicaid and by giving states the option to extend CHIP \ncoverage to low income pregnant women over the age of 18. Since the \nenactment of the welfare reform law, many people who are eligible for \nMedicaid or CHIP coverage do not realize it and remain unenrolled. It \nis estimated that 358,000 pregnant woman and 3 million children are \neligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid. Millions of additional \nchildren are eligible for but not yet enrolled in CHIP.\n  This legislation has the potential to lower healthcare costs and keep \nour babies healthy. By removing barriers to prenatal care access and \nautomatically enrolling babies in their State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, we can give our children a head start on good \nhealth. Research shows that access to appropriate prenatal care \nimproves the outcome of pregnancy. According to the March of Dimes, \nprenatal care--especially among lower income women--reduces the risk of \nlow birth weight threefold and results in decreased infant mortality \nrates and healthier babies. According to the Institute of Medicine, \neach dollar spent on prenatal care for women at high risk, saves $3.38 \nin medical care costs for low birth-weight babies.\n  This legislation is an important step to ensuring our children have \nbright and healthy future. I thank Senator Bond for his leadership on \nthis bill, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the \nMothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of 1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1718. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit for medical research related to developing vaccines against \nwidespread diseases; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               LIFESAVING VACCINE TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lifesaving \nVaccine Technology Act of 1999 with my friend and colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. President, each year malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS kill more \nthan 7 million people, disproportionately in the developing world. Each \nof these diseases is potentially preventable by vaccination.\n  A recent column in the Boston Globe by David Nyhan sums up the \nsituation facing the developing world succinctly.\n  Tuberculosis causes more deaths than any other infectious disease, \nkilling 3 million people annually. One hundred thousand children die \nfrom TB each year. The World Health Organization estimates that between \nnow and 2020, ``nearly one billion more people will be newly infected, \n200 million people will get sick, and 70 million will die from \ntuberculosis, if control is not strengthened. Tuberculosis is not just \nan issue for some faraway countries; in the United States, more than \n19,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually and increasingly we \nare seeing drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis in this country but \nespecially in the states of the former Soviet Union where, according to \none CDC doctor, an epidemic is taking place of ``the worst situation \nfor multidrug resistant tuberculosis ever documented in the world.'' \nOther areas of the world, such as central India, Bangladesh, Latvia, \nCongo, Uganda, Peru are also experiencing near-epidemic tuberculosis \ncrises.\n  According to the World Health Organization, malaria kills more than 2 \nmillion people every year, and the disease is an important public \nhealth problem in 90 countries inhabited by almost half of the world's \npopulation. Each year, one million children under the age of five die \nfrom complications associated with malaria. Again, Mr. President, \nmalaria is a disease we tend to associate with foreign exotic lands, \nand overlook the fact that in this country, more than one thousand \npeople are stricken by malaria each year. Researchers at the National \nInstitute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases contend that \n``conventional control measures . . . appear increasingly inadequate. . \n. As a result of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant \nmosquitoes, fewer tools to control malaria exist today than did 25 \nyears ago.''\n  Last year, the human immunosuppressant virus took the lives of 2.5 \nmillion, of which more than 500,000 were children under the age of 15. \nIn the United States, almost one million are currently living with HIV-\ndisease and 40,000 are newly infected each year. In Zimbabwe and \nBotswana, as many as 25 percent of the adult population is infected \nwith HIV. In Zambia, 72 percent of households contain a child orphaned \nby AIDS. South Africa, which was largely isolated from HIV during its \napartheid years, is now home to 10 percent of the new infections in \nAfrica, and in the country's most populous province, KwaZulu-Natal, \none-third of adults are HIV-infected. Analysts claim that India is an \nAIDS disaster-in-waiting: half a million people in one of India's \nsmallest rural states (Tamil Nadu) are HIV-positive, as are fifteen \npercent of the women in one of India's more populous states \n(Maharashtra).\n  While AIDS is entirely preventable in this country and abroad, and \nwhile behavioral interventions for HIV have proven effective at \nreducing infection rates, many factors, including political obstacles, \ninsufficient prevention funding, forced sexual encounters, and the \ndifficulty of maintaining safe behavior over a lifetime, mean that a \nvaccine will be required for control of this worldwide epidemic.\n  And, yet, Mr. President, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies \nin the United States, the home of the most innovative research and \ndevelopment in the world, are not working on vaccines to the world's \nlargest killers. Market disincentives--especially the lack of a viable, \ncash-rich market--play against investment into these vaccines. Private-\nsector scientists and chief executive officers have a difficult time \njustifying to their boards an investment in developmental research \ntoward these vaccines as long as other pharmaceutical research and \ndevelopment into products appealing to the developed world, like anti-\ndepressants or Viagra, present more attractive investments.\n  This market failure and the need for incentives is shown most \ndramatically by last year's survey by the Pharmaceutical Research and \nManufacturers of America. Of the 43 vaccine projects found to be in \ndevelopment by the survey not one was for HIV, malaria or tuberculosis. \nTo find vaccines for the biggest infectious disease killers in the \nworld, both the private and public sectors must be engaged in a bolder, \nmore creative and dramatic way.\n  Mr. President, with that in mind, we are introducing the Lifesaving \nVaccine Technology Act, which establishes an income tax credit for 30 \npercent of the qualified expenses for medical research related to the \ndevelopment of vaccines against widespread diseases like malaria, HIV \nand tuberculosis, which according to the World Health Organization, \ncause more than one million deaths annually.\n  This bill also declares that it is the sense of Congress that if the \nvaccine research credit is allowed to any corporation or shareholder of \na corporation, the corporation should certify to the Secretary of the \nTreasury that, within one year after that vaccine is first licensed, \nthe corporation will establish a good faith plan to maximize \ninternational access to high quality and affordable vaccines. In \naddition, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that the President \nand Federal agencies (including the Departments of State, Health and \nHuman Services, and the Treasury) should work together in vigorous \nsupport of the creation and funding of a multi-lateral, international \neffort, such as a vaccine purchase fund, to accelerate the introduction \nof vaccines to which the vaccine research credit applies and of other \npriority vaccines into the poorest countries of the world. Lastly, the \nbill expresses the sense of Congress that flexible or differential \npricing for vaccines, providing lowered prices for the poorest \ncountries, is one of several valid strategies to accelerate the \nintroduction of vaccines in developing countries.\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation has received the support of the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S12423]]\n\nPublic Health Association, the Global Health Council, AIDS Action, the \nAIDS Policy Center for Children, Youth and Families, the International \nAIDS Vaccine Initiative and the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition. And, I \nam especially pleased that the Clinton Administration has signaled \ntheir approval of our approach. At his most recent speech before the \nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations, President Clinton committed \n``the United States to a concerted effort to accelerate the development \nand delivery of vaccines for malaria, TB, AIDS and other diseases \ndisproportionately affecting the developing world.''\n  This bill is highly targeted: it will cost relatively little to \nimplement but would have a profound impact on America's response to \ninternational public health needs. And it would complement--certainly \nnot supplant--current federal efforts at USAID, the NIH and other \nfederal agencies to assist developing countries and to bolster vaccine \nresearch.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a companion to a bipartisan bill \nintroduced in the other body by my friend and colleague from San \nFrancisco, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, and 36 co-sponsors. Over the \nyears, I have had the honor to work with the distinguished \nCongresswoman on various pieces of legislation. The nation is in her \ndebt for her tenacity and her overwhelming sense of duty to country. \nHer constituents benefit daily from her leadership, and I am pleased to \nbe associated with her again today.\n  I am hopeful that the positive response Congresswoman Pelosi has \nfound in the other body is replicated in the Senate and that our \ncolleagues join the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and I in \npassing the Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Nyhan column, an \narticle which appeared in the Albany Times-Union about the market \ndifficulties of developing an AIDS vaccine, and a Congressional \nResearch Service study of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Oct. 1, 1999]\n\n       It's Mostly Bad News for the Poorest People on the Planet\n\n                            (By David Nyhan)\n\n       Human nature being what it is, the hawkers of news prosper \n     more off what arouses the customer than that which accurately \n     informs.\n       That's why you get more sizzle than steak, particularly \n     when matters ``foreign'' are addressed. Pictures of a boy \n     dragged from the earthquake's rubble or a riot squad in \n     action are more compelling than footage of some middle-aged \n     bureaucrat rattling on about poverty statistics. But today \n     we're holding the sizzle and serving you teak in the form of \n     speeches made in Washington this week before the annual \n     meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary \n     Fund, two outfits that have become punching bags for a lot of \n     people who are convinced they know what's wrong with the \n     planet.\n       What is really going on here on Spaceship Earth?\n       Some good things: Life expectancy, on average, has gone up \n     more in the last 40 years than in the previous 4,000. The \n     Internet means near-universal access to information. Then \n     there are the not-so-good trends, World Bank chief James \n     Wolfensohn said Tuesday:\n       ``Per-capita incomes which will stagnate or decline this \n     year in all regions except East and South Asia. . . . with \n     the exception of China, 100 million more people living in \n     poverty today than a decade ago. In at least 10 countries in \n     Africa, the scourge of AIDS has reduced life expectancy by 17 \n     years. More than 33 million cases of AIDS in the world, of \n     which 22 million are in Africa. Some 1.5 billion people still \n     lacking access to safe water, and 2.4 million children who \n     die each year of waterborne diseases. Some 125 million \n     children still not in primary school. . . . A world where the \n     information gap is widening. And the forests are being \n     destroyed at the rate of an acre a second.''\n       These statistics are almost impossible to believe. In the \n     time it takes to sneeze, three acres of forest are burned. \n     And everything revolves around money. It is poverty that \n     holds half of mankind in chains.\n       Next month the planet's ridership surpasses 6 billion human \n     beings. How do they live now? Half of humanity gets along on \n     the equivalent of $2 a day or less. Half of that half lives \n     on less than $1 a day. When a child born today reaches the \n     age of 25, there will be 2 billion more people fighting for \n     air, water, food, space, roofs, jobs, schooling, roads, \n     sewers, farmland. Only development will spare them a life of \n     perilous poverty.\n       As the earthling more responsible than any single \n     individual, perhaps even more obligated than the President of \n     the United States, for the well-being of mankind and the \n     development of economic structures to make mankind's future \n     more secure, Wolfensohn asked: ``What have we learned about \n     development?''\n       ``We have learned that development is possible but not \n     inevitable, that growth is essential but not sufficient to \n     ensure poverty reduction.'' And it is essential to help poor \n     people with local institutions, controlled by them, insulated \n     against the corruption, both petty and grand, that turns so \n     many cops and bureaucrats in poor countries into petty \n     despots or grand thieves on the scale of the Baligate thieves \n     who sacked the treasury of Indonesia and pitched the world's \n     fourth-largest nation into anarchy.\n       He quoted from a massive World Bank study, ``Voice of the \n     Poor,'' distilled from 60,000 poor people in 60 countries: \n     ``Poverty is much more than a matter of income alone. The \n     poor seek a sense of well-being--which is peace of mind.''\n       Here's the bulletin: The poor of the planet are just like \n     us cozy Americans. What they want is what we've got. ``It is \n     good health, community, and safety. It is choice, and \n     freedom, as well as a steady source of income.'' He quoted \n     the old African woman: ``to live in love without hunger''; \n     the Eastern European survivor of communism: ``to be well is \n     to know what will happen to me tomorrow''; the mother in \n     Southeast Asia: ``When my child asks for something to eat, I \n     say the rice is cooking until he falls asleep from hunger. \n     For there is no rice.''\n       The day after Wolfensohn laid out the challenge, President \n     Clinton showed up to announce cancellation of that portion of \n     the debt owed the United States by 36 of the poorest \n     countries that had not already been forgiven. The Pope and a \n     number of celebrities had been agitating for debt \n     forgiveness.\n       The Clinton administration had already written off about 90 \n     percent of that debt, and this final write-off of what once \n     totaled nearly $6 billion will encourage the campaigners of \n     Jubilee 2000 to press other lender nations to follow suit. \n     Clinton has been a very good President, all things \n     considered, for the poorest people of the planet. He alluded \n     to the high-priced lobbying that goes on in the jousting \n     between agricultural haves to carve out more elbow room at \n     the trough of market share: ``Because we want to fight over \n     who sells the most food . . . are we supposed to accept the \n     fact that nearly 40 million people a year die of hunger? \n     That's nearly equal to the number of all the people killed in \n     World War II.''\n       He had more good lines, such as ``the wealth of nations \n     depends upon the health of nations.'' But you get the idea. \n     We rich nations are our brother's keeper; sister's too.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Albany Times Union, Mar. 14, 1999]\n\n          Drug Makers Still Reluctant to Invest in HIV Vaccine\n\n\n  scientific uncertainty, drug economics combine to discourage efforts\n\n                          (By Eric Rosenberg)\n\n       Washington.--Soon after the AIDS epidemic exploded in the \n     1980s, Dr. Donald Burke, a senior researcher at Baltimore's \n     Johns Hopkins University, began work on a vaccine against \n     HIV, the virus that causes the deadly disease.\n       Burke made progress but knew he needed the financial \n     backing and laboratory firepower of a pharmaceutical \n     manufacturer in order to succeed.\n       ``I went to all the major companies that were involved in \n     AIDS work at the time,'' said Burke, now the director of the \n     university's Center for Immunization Research. ``I couldn't \n     get anybody interested and I was shocked.''\n       Burke's experience highlights the fact that, with a few \n     exceptions, the pharmaceutical industry has been reluctant to \n     commit resources toward such a goal, despite worldwide demand \n     for a vaccine to protect against a disease that afflicts 35 \n     million people and infects 16,000 more people daily.\n       According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers \n     of America, a trade organization that represents prescription \n     drug makers, companies are sinking research dollars into 101 \n     new treatments for people infected with HIV.\n       These include new classes of antiviral drugs to suppress \n     the HIV virus once a person is infected; medications to fight \n     AIDS-related diseases such as Kaposi's Sarcoma; and drugs to \n     fend off opportunistic infections that attack when the immune \n     system is suppressed by HIV.\n       Although President Clinton has made development of an AIDS \n     vaccine a top priority and Congress has budgeted nearly $200 \n     million this year alone for the effort, companies are \n     investing in only 12 experimental vaccine proposals.\n       Nearly 20 years after the disease erupted, only one AIDS \n     vaccine has received Food and Drug Administration approval \n     for widespread human testing. That vaccine is under \n     development by VaxGen, a small, 52-employee biotechnology \n     firm, of South San Francisco, Calif.\n       More than 90 percent of the world's vaccines against other \n     diseases are produced by five companies: Merck & Co., of \n     Whitehouse Station, N.J., SmithKline Beecham and Wyeth-\n     Lederle of Philadelphia, Pasteur Merieux Connaught of \n     Swiftwater, Pa., and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif.\n       All are involved to varying degrees in AIDS vaccine \n     research. For example,\n\n[[Page S12424]]\n\n     SmithKline Beecham has only a small AIDS vaccine effort \n     underway. ``At this point it's not one of the major efforts \n     in our vaccine programs,'' said Richard Koenig, a SmithKline \n     spokesman.\n       Pasteur, on the other hand, has aggressively pursued an \n     experimental vaccine that is nearing government approval for \n     a large-scale human study.\n       Other companies started, but then curtailed, AIDS vaccine \n     programs. They include Bristol-Myers Squibb, British Biotech \n     and Immuno AG.\n       Dr. Donald Francis, president of VaxGen and a former AIDS \n     specialist at the federal Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, said that if VaxGen and Pasteur fail, ``There's \n     nothing five years behind us. That's it in the AIDS vaccine \n     field.''\n       Lagging science and drug economics are the two \n     considerations underlying the modest corporate interest in \n     AIDS vaccines.\n       Scientists have made strides unlocking the mysteries of how \n     the virus operates after it infects a person. While the \n     knowledge has been key to making new drugs that slow or halt \n     the disease's deadly progression, it doesn't point to the \n     discovery of a vaccine that would render a healthy person \n     immune to HIV.\n       Dr. Peggy Johnston, the assistant director for AIDS \n     vaccines at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious \n     Diseases, said company officials worry that not enough is \n     known about how HIV works to warrant a large vaccine \n     investment.\n       ``There are enormous challenges that AIDS presents that are \n     unparalleled compared with other viruses,'' said Johnston.\n       For example, HIV is proving more resilient than other \n     viruses. Vaccines typically fend off disease by stimulating \n     the body's production of antibodies which in turn destroy an \n     invading virus. However, HIV appears to defend itself with a \n     kind of sugar-based shield to fend off antibodies.\n       Another problem is that different strains of HIV exist in \n     the West and in Africa and Asia. So a vaccine to protect \n     against the North American variety might not work against \n     other strains.\n       The economics of vaccines also are daunting.\n       The average vaccine costs about $100 million to develop. \n     But because the scientific understanding of HIV is murky, a \n     company could commit the resources and more than a decade of \n     work and still fail to invent a vaccine.\n       In order to make a profit on vaccines, which are typically \n     priced in the $1 to $5 per shot range, a drug maker must sell \n     millions of inoculations. While industrialized countries \n     could easily afford the price, much of the developing world, \n     which is the largest potential market for an AIDS vaccine, \n     would have difficulty.\n       The profitability issue is fueling a proposal by the \n     International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), an advocacy \n     group based in New York, that is pressing wealthy nations to \n     create a $1 billion AIDS vaccine purchase fund for the Third \n     World, effectively assuring profit to a successful \n     manufacturer.\n       ``We think the fund would provide a very strong incentive \n     for industry,'' said Victor Zonana, a vice president at IAVI. \n     ``The companies would know that in addition to their markets \n     in industrialized countries, they would have a guaranteed \n     paying market in developing countries.''\n       But pharmaceutical executives believe that even with such a \n     fund in place, a vaccine won't be as profitable as are AIDS \n     therapeutic drugs, which are taken for the lifetime of a \n     patient as opposed to only a few times, as are vaccines.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1999.\n     To: Hon.

Effectiveness in this case signifies \n     the likely rise in domestic investment in vaccine research \n     and development (R) in response to the tax credits. This \n     method of assessing the proposed credits' effectiveness boils \n     down to comparing the additional vaccine R induced by one \n     dollar of tax credit claimed, which is a way of analyzing the \n     benefit-cost ratio for the credit. The proposed credits also \n     raise the issue of whether such a subsidy can be justified on \n     economic grounds. This issue is discussed briefly in the \n     final section.\n       Two noteworthy conclusions emerge from the analysis \n     presented here. One is that the proposed tax credits can be \n     expected to spur increased investment in vaccine R by the \n     private sector, by both increasing expected after-tax returns \n     on this investment and improving the access of small startup \n     firms to equity capital for investment in vaccine R The \n     second conclusion relates to the economic rationale for the \n     proposed tax credits: they are justified on economic grounds \n     to the extent that they attempt to correct failures in the \n     market for vaccines that result in economically inefficient \n     levels of domestic investment in vaccine R\n       If you have any questions about this analysis, please call \n     me at 7-7742.\n\n\n                  The Economics of Vaccine Innovation\n\n       Vaccines are among the most cost-effective weapons in the \n     arsenal of modern medicine against the spread of contagious \n     diseases, lethal and non-lethal. By strengthening an \n     individual's immune system to resist a wide range of \n     infectious diseases, they offer a relatively inexpensive \n     means of lowering a society's overall cost of medical care. \n     While historically vaccines have been used to prevent a \n     variety of diseases, intensive efforts are being made to \n     develop vaccines that can treat certain diseases--mainly \n     cancer and AIDS--after an individual contracts them.\n       On the whole, the development of new vaccines is a long, \n     costly, and risky process. It typically takes 10 years and \n     requires outlays of $100 million to bring a new vaccine from \n     the research laboratory to the medical marketplace.\\1\\ In \n     addition, firms seeking to develop new vaccines face a \n     considerable risk of failure. A 1989 study estimated that \n     only 3 out of 10 vaccines that enter clinical trials end up \n     being approved for general use.\\2\\ For the most part, vaccine \n     development passes through the same stages as the development \n     of new therapeutic drugs: a period of basic research or \n     discovery, followed by the filing of an investigational new \n     drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n     (FDA), followed by three stages of clinical trials. Vaccine \n     development, however, departs from the path of new drug \n     development during the third phase of clinical trials, when a \n     firm developing a new vaccine must file both a product \n     license application and an establishment license application \n     with the FDA; firms developing new therapeutic drugs only are \n     required to file a new drug application at this stage. Once \n     the FDA is satisfied that the vaccine is safe and effective \n     and that the plant where it is produced meets the FDA's \n     stringent standards for purity, cleanliness, and quality \n     control, the vaccine can be marketed in the United States. \n     This means that the FDA requires vaccine firms to construct \n     and start up manufacturing facilities for new products \n     several years before they can gain marketing approval--and \n     thus begin to earn a return on the funds invested in their \n     development.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of document.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The economics of vaccine innovation has important \n     implications for the structure of the vaccine industry. High \n     fixed costs for research, production setup, and obtaining and \n     maintaining FDA marketing approval result in marginal vaccine \n     production costs that are significantly below average vaccine \n     production costs. Such a cost structure is not conducive to \n     the existence of multiple sellers of the same vaccines. As a \n     seller's output expands, its average costs decline; and as \n     those costs fall, its ability to underprice its competitors \n     and still cover its costs grows.\\3\\ The degree of competition \n     in the world vaccine industry seems to confirm this crucial \n     point. Vaccine production in the United States and the rest \n     of the world has been highly concentrated: in 1994, four \n     firms (Institut Merieux, Merck, SmithKline Beecham, and \n     American Cyanamid) accounted for between 65% and 80% of world \n     sales of vaccines; and in 1993, the same four firms produced \n     nearly all the pediatric vaccines purchased in the United \n     States.\\4\\\n       In the United States, the federal government finances the \n     lion's share of basic research in vaccines, where the \n     emphasis is on understanding the fundamental mechanisms of \n     infectious disease and the immune system. Once a vaccine \n     research project advances to the level of applied research \n     and development, where the emphasis is on producing and \n     testing specific products with commercial potential, the \n     private sector takes the lead in financing. Near the end of \n     the development cycle for vaccines, the federal government \n     becomes more involved again by helping fund clinical trials \n     to test the safety and efficacy of new vaccines.\\5\\ \n     According to one estimate, the federal government provided \n     $500 million (or 36%) of the $1.4 billion spent on U.S. \n     vaccine R in 1995, and the private sector contributed \n     the remaining $900 million (or 64%), with the lion's share \n     coming from four large, established sellers of vaccines: \n     Merck, the Wyeth-Lederle division of American Home \n     Products, SmithKline Beecham, and the Pasteur Merieux \n     Connaught division of Rhone Poulenc.\\6\\\n       In the past decade, the private sector has shown a vibrant \n     interest in vaccine innovation, and investment in vaccine R \n     has risen accordingly. While a number of factors have come \n     together to spur this interest, a key driving force has been \n     the revolutionary advances in the understanding of the \n     molecular basis of the immune system and disease engineered \n     by biotechnology. Recombinant technology is now being used to \n     improve existing vaccines and to produce new ones, to design \n     more efficient combinations of existing vaccines, and to find \n     better ways of delivery than a shot in the arm. Moreover, \n     most vaccine industry executives are convinced that the new \n     vaccines developed through the application of recombinant \n     technology will gain patent protection, unlike traditional \n     vaccines which are derived from naturally occurring organisms \n     and thus not eligible for patent protection. Patented \n     vaccines tend to command much higher prices in private \n     markets than those lacking patent protection. By one account, \n     as of May 1998, at least 50 biotechnology firms had joined \n     the large, established producers of vaccines\n\n[[Page S12425]]\n\n     in the search for new vaccines, and about 75 new vaccines \n     were in various stages of development worldwide.\\7\\ The \n     economies of scale in vaccine production, however, make it \n     unlikely that many of small startup firms now engaged in \n     vaccine R will grow into large, independent producers. \n     Although public data on vaccine R are sparse and not \n     systematically collected, figures on pharmaceutical R \n     reported by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of \n     America (PhRMA) appear to underscore the renewed interest in \n     vaccine R in the pharmaceutical industry. In its latest \n     profile of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, PhRMA reports \n     that domestic R investment in biologicals, a product class \n     that is dominated by vaccines, rose from $274 million (or \n     4.7% of domestic pharmaceutical R) in 1989 to $716.8 \n     million (or 5.3% of domestic pharmaceutical R) in 1996.\n\n\nintended purpose of h.r. 1274, the lifesaving vaccine technology act of \n                                  1999\n\n       The central aim of H.R. 1274 is to boost U.S. investment in \n     the development of vaccines for diseases that kill large \n     numbers of people each year, especially in developing \n     countries. Its chief policy instrument for achieving this \n     objective is a tax credit equal to 30% of qualified vaccine \n     research expenses in a tax year. Under the bill, qualified \n     vaccine research expenses are defined as a firm's in-house \n     and contract research expenses related to the discovery and \n     development of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, or \n     any infectious disease that kills over one million persons \n     annually, as determined by the World Health Organization. The \n     definition of qualified research expenses under H.R. 1274 is \n     identical to the definition of research expenses that qualify \n     for the research and experimentation (R) tax credit, with \n     one significant exception: the proposed vaccine research \n     tax credit would apply to 75% of qualified contract \n     research expenses, whereas the R tax credit applies to \n     only 65% of such expenses--except in the case of contract \n     research performed by certain research consortia, where \n     75% of the expenses qualify for the credit. Like the R \n     tax credit, public or private grants for vaccine research \n     are ineligible for the credit. In addition, any research \n     expenses claimed for the vaccine research credit cannot \n     also be claimed for the R tax credit, although qualified \n     vaccine research expenses could be used to calculate the \n     base amount for the R credit; and with the exception of \n     expenses for human clinical testing conducted abroad, no \n     credit is available for foreign vaccine research. H.R. \n     1274 also specifies that the proposed vaccine research \n     credit would become part of the general business credit \n     and thus subject to its limitations; any portion of the \n     vaccine research credit that cannot be used in the tax \n     year in which it is earned could be carried forward to a \n     succeeding tax year, but the unused portion could not be \n     carried back beyond the year in which the credit was \n     enacted. Finally, like the R credit, qualified research \n     expenses that are deducted under section 174 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code (IRC) must be reduced by the amount \n     of any vaccine research credit claimed. This requirement \n     has important implications for the marginal effective rate \n     of the credit, because whatever vaccine research credit is \n     claimed in effect is taxed at a firm's marginal corporate \n     income tax rate.\n       H.R. 1274 would also create a less direct tax subsidy for \n     vaccine R This subsidy is targeted at investors and is \n     intended to make it easier for small firms involved in \n     vaccine R to raise money in equity markets. Specifically, \n     the bill would grant individuals or firms that purchase the \n     ``qualified research stock'' of small firms undertaking or \n     funding qualified vaccine research a tax credit equal to 20% \n     of the amount they pay for the stock, provided two conditions \n     are met. First, the firm whose stock is bought must use the \n     proceeds within 18 months of the date of purchase to pay for \n     research that qualifies for the vaccine reseach credit. \n     Second, the firm must waive its right to claim a tax credit \n     for the vaccine research funded by the stock purchases. Under \n     H.R. 1274, qualified research stock is defined as any stock \n     issued by a firm that is subject to the corporate income tax \n     and has gross assets of $50 million or less; the stock must \n     be issued after the date the bill is enacted and acquired \n     ``at its original issue in exchange for money or other \n     property (not including stock).''\n\n\n             Likely Impact of H.R. 1274 on U.S. Vaccine R\n\n       How are the proposed tax subsidies in H.R. 1274 likely to \n     affect vaccine R? The answer hinges largely on the effect \n     of the subsidies on two key determinants of business R \n     investments: the expected after-tax rate of return on such \n     investments and the availability and cost of capital to \n     finance the investments.\n       For firms seeking to develop new or improved vaccines, the \n     decision to invest in R is no different in principle from a \n     decision to invest in any other capital asset, such as a new \n     production facility. The key considerations are the expected \n     after-tax returns on the proposed R projects, the cost of \n     capital or funds for the projects, and the availability of \n     funds to finance the projects. Small startup firms are more \n     likey than large, well-established firms to have trouble \n     funding R projects out of retained earnings or raising \n     funds in debt or equity markets to finance these projects. In \n     theory, a vaccine firm will invest in R projects up to the \n     point where the expected after-tax rate of return on a \n     possible project matches the firm's cost of capital. Projects \n     with the largest gap between expected after-tax rates of \n     returns and the cost of capital are likely to receive the \n     highest priority.\n       H.R. 1274 can be expected to increase the level of domestic \n     vaccine R by both increasing the expected after-tax rates \n     of return on possible research projects and improving the \n     access of smaller, newer vaccine firms to equity markets. The \n     proposed flat 30-percent tax credit on qualified vaccine \n     research would be one of the factors shaping the expected \n     after-tax returns on vaccine R investments. Other important \n     factors are the eventual size of the market for the vaccine, \n     the predictability of prices and usage rates for the vaccine, \n     expected production costs, exposure to liability suits for \n     side effects of the vaccine, patent protection, the ease of \n     entry into the market for the vaccine, and the cost of \n     capital.\\8\\ The proposed credit would increase expected \n     after-tax rates of return. Under current tax law, firms \n     performing vaccine R can claim the 20% R tax credit for \n     qualified research. But because of the rules governing the \n     use of the credit, the marginal effective rate of the credit \n     is 6.5% or 13% on each additional dollar spent on vaccine \n     research by firms in the 35-percent corporate tax bracket. If \n     H.R. 1274 were enacted, the same firms could claim a tax \n     credit for qualified research with a marginal effective rate \n     of 19.5%; the rate would not be 30% because of the \n     requirement that any credit claimed must be added to a firm's \n     taxable income. All other things being equal, as a firm's \n     marginal effective rate for the vaccine research credit goes \n     up, the after-tax rate of return to this research rises.\n       In addition, vaccine firms that are constrained by a lack \n     of funds in pursuing research opportunities could be expected \n     to invest more in vaccine R if H.R. 1274 were enacted. \n     Investors would be eligible for a flat 20% tax credit on \n     purchases of common stock issued by small vaccine firms, \n     provided the firms invest the proceeds from the stock \n     purchases in qualified research within 18 months of the \n     purchase. As a result, investors would face lower marginal \n     tax rates on the returns to these investments than on the \n     returns to alternative investments. This difference could \n     lead them to invest more in small vaccine firms than they \n     otherwise would, augmenting their available funds for R \n     Innovation is the main route of entry into the vaccine \n     business for small firms.\n       How much is vaccine R spending likely to increase in \n     response to the proposed credit? This is difficult to analyze \n     in the absence of reliable estimates of the responsiveness of \n     vaccine R to changes in its after-tax price. The proposed \n     credit lowers the after-tax price of qualified R, and in \n     theory vaccine firms can be expected to perform more R as a \n     result. A variety of studies have estimated that in the 1980s \n     the ``tax price elasticity of total (U.S.) R spending'' was \n     unity or even higher, meaning that U.S. firms responded to a \n     1% decline in the after-tax price of R by increasing their \n     R spending by 1% in that decade.\\9\\ Assuming vaccine firms \n     exhibit the same tax price elasticity today, a research tax \n     credit with a marginal effective rate of 19.5% could lead to \n     a rise of as much as 19.5% in domestic vaccine R spending. \n     However, this estimate cannot be regarded as reliable and \n     could be greatly exaggerated, because it is unlikely that the \n     sensitivity of R investment to changes in its after-tax \n     price remains constant over time and is the same for all \n     kinds of R projects, and because vaccine firms would be \n     likely to differ in their ability to use the credit in any \n     given year.\n       Furthermore, there is some reason to believe that the \n     proposed vaccine research tax credit would eventually be as \n     cost-effective as direct spending by the federal government \n     on vaccine R A number of studies have concluded that the \n     existing R tax credit yields roughly a dollar-for-dollar \n     increase in reported R at the margin, but that in the early \n     years of the credit firms were not as responsive as they were \n     adjusting to the credit's availability.\\10\\ In other words, \n     these studies suggest that government spending programs and \n     the R tax credit are equally effective in increasing the \n     amount of qualified research performed in the United States.\n\n\n      Economic Justification for a Tax Credit for Vaccine Research\n\n       Under conventional economic theory, the use of a subsidy \n     such as a research tax credit is justified if its ultimate \n     aim is to correct some sort of market failure. In the case of \n     R, the R tax credit is one way to offset the tendency of \n     firms to underinvest in R because of the gap between the \n     social and private returns to research. Economists argue that \n     in the absence of government support for R, firms are \n     likely to invest too little in R because they cannot \n     appropriate all the returns to those investments. So the R \n     tax credit, by lowering the after-tax cost of qualified \n     research, is intended to spur firms to invest more in R \n     than they otherwise would. Ideallly, the added R stimulated \n     by the credit is enough to raise domestic R spending to the \n     level commensurate with the social returns to R The market \n     failure that the R tax credit is attempting to remedy is \n     underinvestment in R arising from the inability of firms \n     performing R to capture all the profits generated by the \n     investment.\n       These considerations raise the issue of whether the \n     proposed tax credit for vaccine research in H.R. 1274 is \n     justified on economic grounds. Is there a failure in the \n     market for\n\n[[Page S12426]]\n\n     vaccines that would warrant the adoption of such a subsidy? \n     As was suggested earlier, there are external economic \n     benefits from controlling the spread of infectious diseases. \n     The cost to society of preventing an outbreak of an \n     infectious disease tends to be much lower than the cost of \n     treating the outbreak that might occur in the absence of \n     immunization. This raises the possibility that private firms \n     invest less in vaccine R than its potential social benefits \n     warrant. Partly in an effort to correct for such a market \n     failure, the federal government supports vaccine R through \n     its funding of basic research in vaccines and clinical trials \n     for new vaccines. Its research support is also intended to \n     direct vaccine investment to address current and future \n     public health needs. In addition, it offers two tax subsidies \n     for R, namely: the R tax credit and the expensing of R \n     costs under IRC section 174. Although these subsidies are not \n     targeted at vaccine research but are available to all firms \n     that perform qualified research, they benefit vaccine firms \n     by increasing their potential aftertax rate of returns on R \n     investments. The proposed vaccine research tax credit would \n     supplant the R tax credit for vaccine firms, but its \n     treatment of qualified research would be more favorable, \n     increasing the expected profitability of vaccine F \n     investment relative to other kinds of R investment.\n       Thus, an important policy issued for Congress is whether \n     the current level of domestic vaccine R investment is \n     socially desirable or efficient. And if not, would the \n     proposed tax credit in H.R. 1274 be more efficient than added \n     federal funding of vaccine R or some other policy measure \n     (such as government grants to international agencies \n     that purchase and distribute needed vaccines in poor \n     countries) in raising total investment to such a level. \n     From the perspective of economic efficiency, the R \n     projects that should be promoted are those with the \n     largest gaps between the social and private rates of \n     return. Yet vaccine firms are likely to use any research \n     tax credits to fund first those projects with the highest \n     expected private rates of return. At the same time, there \n     is no certainty that the federal government could do a \n     better job of targeting those vaccine R projects with \n     the largest spillover effects. If it is determined that \n     domestic vaccine R is less than socially optimal, \n     perhaps a combination of a targeted tax credit like the \n     one proposed in H.R. 1274 and increased government support \n     for basic and applied vaccine research would be more \n     attractive than relying solely on one instrument or the \n     other.\n       Another policy issue for Congress raised by the proposed \n     tax credits in H.R. 1274 relates to the external benefits of \n     mass immunizations. The economic benefits to a society from \n     vaccinations far outweigh the benefits to individual \n     consumers, who in deciding whether or not to purchase \n     vaccines for themselves or their children tend to consider \n     only the costs and benefits to themselves and not the \n     potential benefits to others in the community. Even if the \n     market for vaccines were perfectly competitive, it is \n     unlikely that immunization levels would be socially \n     optimal.\\11\\ Thus government intervention in the development \n     and distribution of vaccines is certainly justified on \n     economic grounds. The proposed tax credits would spur the \n     development of new vaccines, but they would not lessen any of \n     the barriers to the achievement of universal immunization \n     with available vaccines. Low immunization rates are due to a \n     variety of factors, including out-of-pocket costs, parental \n     attitudes and knowledge, access to health clinics or doctors' \n     offices, the perceived efficacy of vaccines, and the \n     perceived risk of contracting diseases for which vaccines \n     exist.\\12\\ Clearly, other policy initiatives would be needed \n     to address these factors.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Sing, Merrile and Mary Kaye Willian. ``Supplying \n     Vaccines.''

This great nation, which was born as a nation of \nimmigrants, is quickly becoming even more one of many faces, many \nvoices, and many ideas, and it is this diversity which is one of our \ngreatest assets. One of the fastest growing populations in our Nation \ntoday is the Hispanic American population. I rise before my colleagues \ntoday to bring attention to and celebrate the occasion of Hispanic \nHeritage Month.\n  This month of recognition is a wonderful opportunity to recognize the \nwide-ranging achievements and contributions of the Hispanic American \npopulation. This is a community with leadership which is notable in \nevery facet of our society, a community filled with courage and \npersistence who have continually shown a commitment to family, business \nand education, and economic growth.\n  America's diverse and vibrant Hispanic population has made an \nenormous contribution to the building and strengthening of our nation, \nits culture, and its economic prowess. As the 21st century approaches, \nHispanic Americans are poised to play an increasingly prominent role in \nour Nation's political, economic, and cultural life.\n  Look no further than Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson; or Small \nBusiness Administration head, Aida Alvarez; Chicago Cub Sammy Sosa; or \nentertainers Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez; or business leaders like \nSal Diaz-Verson of Columbus, Georgia or the late Roberto Goizueta. \nHispanic Americans offer a valuable and vital social, intellectual, and \nartistic component of American society and their culture deeply \nenriches the vast American landscape.\n  What unites Hispanic Americans is a fundamental respect for the \ntraditions and values of their native lands combined with a strong \ncommitment to the American dream. In return, we in the Congress must \nshow a commitment to a legislative agenda that addresses the needs and \npriorities of Hispanic American families, which are in fact the same as \nthe those of most Americans. We must continue the policies that have \nlaid the foundation for the longest peacetime expansion of the economy, \nimprove and strengthen our education system, provide access to quality \nhealthcare, and protect this nation's children from crime and drugs.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nvaluable contributions of the Hispanic American population and honoring \nHispanic Heritage Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/12/senate-section/article/S12428-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL CENTER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nHolocaust Memorial Center in West Bloomfield, Michigan, as they \ncelebrate their 15th Anniversary, and to pay tribute to those whose \nlives have been affected by the Holocaust.\n  The work of the Holocaust Memorial Center and especially Executive \nVice President Rabbi Charles Rosenveig is truly commendable. In working \nto keep alive the spirit of those who suffered, the Holocaust Memorial \nCenter helps us remember. In highlighting the rich history and culture \nof the Jewish people, the Holocaust Memorial Center helps us learn.\n  The events of the Holocaust cast a dark shadow over history. And \nwhile it is painful to remember, the Holocaust Memorial Center will not \nlet us forget. Indeed, their mission is expressed in their logo, which \nis composed of four Hebrew characters that spell the word Zachor, which \nmeans ``remember.''\n  On behalf of the United States Senate, I extend my warmest regards \nand best wishes to everyone in attendance at the 15th Anniversary \nDinner and to all who have helped make the Holocaust Memorial Center an \nimportant educational resource for the State of Michigan and the \ncountry. I wish them continued success in their important \nmission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/12/senate-section/article/S12428-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12428-S12429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE 6 BILLIONTH PERSON\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at 12:02 AM this morning the six \nbillionth person was born. It was a boy, in Sarajevo.\n  It took hundreds of thousands of years for the world's population to \nreach 1 billion, but it has taken less than 40 years for it to double \nfrom 3 to 6 billion people. This is a staggering number with \nimplications that are impossible to fully grasp or predict.\n  What we do know, however, is that 95 percent of new births are \noccurring in developing countries that are least equipped to deal with \nthe consequences. From sub-Saharan Africa to Asia, people's most basic \nneeds continue to go unmet.\n  Of the 4.8 billion people in developing countries, it is estimated \nthat nearly 60 percent lack basic sanitation. Almost a third do not \nhave access to clean water. A quarter do not have adequate housing and \na fifth--about 1 billion people--have no access to modern health \nservices.\n  We also know that population pressures threaten every aspect of the \nEarth's environment. Severe water shortages, shrinking forests, soil \ndegradation, air and water pollution and the daily loss of animal and \nplant life have changed the face of the planet and contributed to \nfamine, social unrest and massive displacement of people.\n  This is not to minimize the progress that has been made in slowing \npopulation growth rates. Thanks in large part to the availability of \nmodern contraceptives, the average number of births per woman has \ndeclined from 6 to 3. In addition, people today enjoy longer, healthier \nlives than ever before. Women have more opportunities and choices. \nTechnology has enhanced access to medical care, education and \nemployment. In every corner of the globe, we have seen the dramatic \nsuccesses that have been achieved through vigorous, well-funded foreign \nassistance programs.\n  But the disparities between haves and have nots is growing. Given \nwhat we know about the inextricable link between population growth, \npoverty, political instability, lack of social justice and \nenvironmental degradation, it is astonishing to me that every year \nthere are those in Congress who continue to oppose funding for \ninternational family planning.\n  It is inexplicable that even though the world's population has \ndoubled since 1960, Members of Congress, especially in the House, \nvociferously oppose funding the United Nations Population Fund which \npromotes access to voluntary reproductive health services for women \naround the world. They do so because UNFPA has a small program in \nChina, which supports women's health, modern contraceptives, and other \nvoluntary family planning services. It makes absolutely no sense, since \nthese are precisely the interventions that reduce reliance on abortion \nas a method of family planning.\n  And this year's Foreign Operation's bill contains only $385 million \nfor the Agency for International Development's family planning \nprograms, a $150 million cut from what it was just five years ago.\n  It is a travesty that so many people around the world want family \nplanning services and still cannot get them. Time and again it has been \nproven that when these services are available the number of abortions \ndeclines, lives are saved and opportunities for women, children and \nfamilies dramatically increase.\n  It is also shortsighted. The decisions we make today will determine \nhow long it will be before another billion people occupy this planet \nand whether our children and grandchildren are born into a world of \npoverty and deprivation or a world of opportunity and prosperity.\n  Mr. President, today is a sobering reminder of the need for the \nUnited States to resume its leadership in support of international \nfamily planning. We have the ability to help improve the lives of \nbillions of people both now and in the future.\n\n[[Page S12429]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/12/senate-section/article/S12428-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12428-S12429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE 6 BILLIONTH PERSON\n\n Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Rear Admiral Norbert R. Ryan \nJr., as he completes more than three years of distinguished service as \nthe Navy's Chief of Legislative Affairs. It is a privilege for me to \nhonor his many outstanding achievements and commend him for his \ndevotion to the Navy and our great Nation.\n  A native of Mountainhome, Pennsylvania, Rear Admiral Ryan is a 1967 \ngraduate of the United States Naval Academy. An outstanding aviator and \nofficer, Rear Admiral Ryan was assigned as Chief of Legislative Affairs \nfrom August 1996 to October 1999. Through tireless effort, a keen sense \nof timing and decisive action, Admiral Ryan navigated Navy leadership \nthrough aggressive and demanding Congressional action on a wide variety \nof Navy programs during three complete legislative cycles. He ensured \nsupport for a difficult series of high profile and at times challenging \nissues to include the F/A-18 E/F, CVN-77/CVNX, DD-21 Acquisition \nStrategy, Tactical Tomahawk, Virginia Class Submarines, Shipyard \nmaintenance, and the Navy's role in Kosovo.\n  Admiral Ryan initiated a ground-breaking series of Congressional \nConstituent Caseworker Workshops by geographical area to ensure \ncongressional staff at the district level were provided the necessary \ntools and information on Navy and Marine Corps programs to be \nresponsive to their constituents. He forged strong bonds with many key \nMembers and their staffs ensuring the best interests of the Navy were \nfully understood and supported.\n  Admiral Ryan provided outstanding advice, recommendations, and \nstrategies to the Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations \nthat have significantly and positively affected the future size, \nreadiness, and capabilities of the Navy. As a result, Congress passed \nthe FY00 Defense Authorization Bill that has been lauded by many \nMembers as the best defense bill ever written.\n  Rear Admiral Ryan is a dynamic and resourceful naval officer who, \nthroughout his time in Navy Liaison, has proven to be an indispensable \nasset to our Nation. He is a passionate advocate of the Navy, our \nSailors and their families understanding better than anyone that they \nare truly the backbone of our national defense. His superior \ncontributions and distinguished service will benefit both the Navy and \nthe country he so proudly serves for years to come. As Rear Admiral \nRyan leaves, we will certainly miss him. I am proud to thank him for \nhis service as the Chief of Legislative Affairs and look forward with \npride and deepest respect as we continue to work with him in his new \nassignment as Chief of Naval Personnel. There is no better officer \naptly suited to lead the officers and Sailors into the 21st \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/12/senate-section/article/S12429-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE MEL BLOUNT YOUTH HOME OF GEORGIA, INC.\n\n Mr. CLELAND.

The primary \nmission of the Mel Blount Youth Home is to provide youth with the \nguidance, education, and life skills needed to get their lives back on \ntrack, resulting in self sufficient, productive contributors to \nsociety.\n  The Mel Blount Youth Home of Georgia, Inc., was founded in 1983 by \nMelvin and Clinton Blount. It is located in Vidalia, Georgia, and \noffers an alternative for troubled youths who have not been successful \nin their home environment. The home is licensed by the State of Georgia \nand serves youth from all around the country to meet the spiritual, \neducational, physical, and emotional needs of all children \nparticipating in the program.\n  The Mel Blount Youth Home program places an emphasis on academics, \ndiscipline and hard work with a consistent effort to meet the spiritual \nand emotional needs of young men placed the program. The average stay \nis from nine to eighteen months. Residents attend school on the grounds \nof the home and can earn credits toward graduation upon returning to \nhigh school at home. A GED program in collaboration with Southeastern \nTechnical Institute is also offered. The academic program consists of a \ncurriculum designed for youth who have been left behind in public \nschool, with tutors available to work with each child on an individual \nbasis.\n  The Mel Blount Youth Home of Georgia provides young men of diverse \nbackgrounds and cultures who have experienced difficulty adjusting \nduring adolescence a secure and safe haven to grow and develop. The \nhome provides a family setting with a spiritual base in addition to a \nfoundation which places high emphasis on education, hard work and \ndiscipline. For some youth, the Mel Blount Youth home is the only place \nthey can call home.\n  Every child deserves to grow and develop in an environment where they \nare nurtured and molded by hands and hearts that care. Different \ncircumstances have brought each child to the Mel Blount Youth Home, but \nall have come with a quiet hope of restarting their lives. At this \nhome, they get a second chance.\n  I ask my colleagues in this body to join me in recognizing the \nnoteworthy and noble mission of this great institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/12/senate-section/article/S12429-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12429-S12442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  On October 7, 1999, the Senate passed S. 1650, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1650\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Departments \n     of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \n     related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2000, and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                      TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF LABOR\n\n                 Employment and Training Administration\n\n\n                    Training and Employment Services\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Workforce Investment Act, \n     including the purchase and hire of passenger motor vehicles, \n     the construction, alteration, and repair of buildings and \n     other facilities, and the purchase of real property for \n     training centers as authorized by the Workforce Investment \n     Act; the Stewart B.

Expressing the Sense of the Senate to Raise the \n     Awareness of the Devastating Impact of Diabetes and to \n     Support Increased Funds for Diabetes Research. (a) \n     Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Diabetes is a devastating, lifelong condition that \n     affects people of every age, race, income level, and \n     nationality.\n       (2) Sixteen million Americans suffer from diabetes, and \n     millions more are at risk of developing the disease.\n       (3) The number of Americans with diabetes has increased \n     nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years, leading the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention to call it the ``epidemic \n     of our time''.\n       (4) In 1999, approximately 800,000 people will be diagnosed \n     with diabetes, and diabetes will contribute to almost 200,000 \n     deaths, making diabetes the sixth leading cause of death due \n     to disease in the United States.\n       (5) Diabetes costs our nation an estimated $105,000,000,000 \n     each year.\n       (6) More than 1 out of every 10 United States health care \n     dollars, and about 1 out of every 4 Medicare dollars, is \n     spent on the care of people with diabetes.\n       (7) More than $40,000,000,000 a year in tax dollars are \n     spent treating people with diabetes through Medicare, \n     Medicaid, veterans benefits, Federal employee health \n     benefits, and other Federal health programs.\n       (8) Diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed, and an estimated \n     5,400,000 Americans have the disease but do not know it.\n       (9) Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, \n     blindness in adults, and amputations.\n       (10) Diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease, \n     stroke, and birth defects, and shortens average life \n     expectancy by up to 15 years.\n       (11) An estimated 1,000,000 Americans have Type 1 diabetes, \n     formerly known as juvenile diabetes, and 15,200,000 Americans \n     have Type 2 diabetes, formerly known as adult-onset diabetes.\n       (12) Of Americans aged 65 years or older, 18.4 percent have \n     diabetes.\n       (13) Of Americans aged 20 years or older, 8.2 percent have \n     diabetes.\n       (14) Hispanic, African, Asian, and Native Americans suffer \n     from diabetes at rates much higher than the general \n     population, including children as young as 8 years-old, who \n     are now being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, formerly known \n     as adult-onset diabetes.\n       (15) In 1999, there is no method to prevent or cure \n     diabetes, and available treatments have only limited success \n     in controlling diabetes devastating consequences.\n       (16) Reducing the tremendous health and human burdens of \n     diabetes and its enormous economic toll depend on identifying \n     the factors responsible for the disease and developing new \n     methods for treatment and prevention.\n       (17) Improvements in technology and the general growth in \n     scientific knowledge have created unprecedented opportunities \n     for advances that might lead to better treatments, \n     prevention, and ultimately a cure.\n\n[[Page S12436]]\n\n       (18) After extensive review and deliberations, the \n     congressionally established and National Institutes of \n     Health-selected Diabetes Research Working Group has found \n     that ``many scientific opportunities are not being pursued \n     due to insufficient funding, lack of appropriate mechanisms, \n     and a shortage of trained researchers''.\n       (19) The Diabetes Research Working Group has developed a \n     comprehensive plan for National Institutes of Health-funded \n     diabetes research, and has recommended a funding level of \n     $827,000,000 for diabetes research at the National Institutes \n     of Health in fiscal year 2000.\n       (20) The Senate as an institution, and Members of Congress \n     as individuals, are in unique positions to support the fight \n     against diabetes and to raise awareness about the need for \n     increased funding for research and for early diagnosis and \n     treatment.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about the importance of the \n     early detection, and proper treatment of, diabetes; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the \n     quality of, health care services for screening and treating \n     diabetes;\n       (2) the National Institutes of Health, within their \n     existing funding levels, should increase research funding, as \n     recommended by the congressionally established and National \n     Institutes of Health-selected Diabetes Research Working \n     Group, so that the causes of, and improved treatments and \n     cure for, diabetes may be discovered;\n       (3) all Americans should take an active role to fight \n     diabetes by using all the means available to them, including \n     watching for the symptoms of diabetes, which include frequent \n     urination, unusual thirst, extreme hunger, unusual weight \n     loss, extreme fatigue, and irritability; and\n       (4) national organizations, community organizations, and \n     health care providers should endeavor to promote awareness of \n     diabetes and its complications, and should encourage early \n     detection of diabetes through regular screenings, education, \n     and by providing information, support, and access to \n     services.\n       Sec. 218. Study and Report on the Geographic Adjustment \n     Factors Under the Medicare Program. (a) Study.--The Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services shall conduct a study on--\n       (1) the reasons why, and the appropriateness of the fact \n     that, the geographic adjustment factor (determined under \n     paragraph (2) of section 1848(e) (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4(e)) used \n     in determining the amount of payment for physicians' services \n     under the medicare program is less for physicians' services \n     provided in New Mexico than for physicians' services provided \n     in Arizona, Colorado, and Texas; and\n       (2) the effect that the level of the geographic cost-of-\n     practice adjustment factor (determined under paragraph (3) of \n     such section) has on the recruitment and retention of \n     physicians in small rural States, including New Mexico, Iowa, \n     Louisiana, and Arkansas.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 3 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall submit a report to Congress on the study \n     conducted under subsection (a), together with any \n     recommendations for legislation that the Secretary determines \n     to be appropriate as a result of such study.\n       Sec. 219.

From \n     amounts appropriated under this title for the Health \n     Resources and Services Administration, sufficient funds are \n     available to the Maternal Child Health Bureau for the \n     establishment of a multi-State preventive dentistry \n     demonstration program to improve the oral health of low-\n     income children and increase the access of children to dental \n     sealants through community- and school-based activities.\n       Sec. 220.

Sense of the Senate Regarding Payments Under the \n     Prospective Payment System for Hospital Outpatient Department \n     Services. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, in order to achieve \n     the objective of balancing the Federal budget, provided for \n     the single largest change in the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) \n     since the inception of such program in 1965.\n       (2) Reliable, independent estimates now project that the \n     changes to the medicare program provided for in the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997 will result in the reduction of payments \n     to health care providers that greatly exceeds the level of \n     estimated reductions when such Act was enacted.\n       (3) Congressional oversight has begun to reveal that these \n     greater-than-anticipated reductions in payments are harming \n     the ability of health care providers to maintain and deliver \n     high-quality health care services to beneficiaries under the \n     medicare program and to other individuals.\n       (4) One of the key factors that has caused these greater-\n     than-anticipated reductions in payments is the inappropriate \n     regulatory action taken by the Secretary in implementing the \n     provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n\n[[Page S12441]]\n\n       (5) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, contrary to \n     the direction of 77 Members of the Senate and 253 Members of \n     the House of Representatives (stated in letters to the \n     Secretary dated June 18, 1999, and September 14, 1999, \n     respectively), has persisted in interpreting the provisions \n     of the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient \n     department services under section 1833(t) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l(t)) in a manner that would \n     impose an unintended 5.7 percent across the board reduction \n     in payments under such system.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Secretary of Health and Human Services should carry \n     out congressional intent and cease its inappropriate \n     interpretation of the provisions of the prospective payment \n     system for hospital outpatient department services under \n     section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395l(t)).\n       Sec. 517. It is the sense of the Senate that it is \n     important that Congress determine the economic status of \n     former recipients of assistance under the temporary \n     assistance to needy families program funded under part A of \n     title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).\n       Sec. 518. Confounding Biological and Physiological \n     Influences on Polygraphy. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds \n     that:\n       (1) The use of polygraph tests as a screening tool for \n     Federal employees and contractor personnel is increasing.\n       (2) A 1983 study by the Office of Technology Assessment \n     found little scientific evidence to support the validity of \n     polygraph tests in such screening applications.\n       (3) The 1983 study further found that little or no \n     scientific study had been undertaken on the effects of \n     prescription and nonprescription drugs on the validity of \n     polygraph tests, as well as differential responses to \n     polygraph tests according to biological and physiological \n     factors that may vary according to age, gender, or ethnic \n     backgrounds, or other factors relating to natural variability \n     in human populations.\n       (4) A scientific evaluation of these important influences \n     on the potential validity of polygraph tests should be \n     studied by a neutral agency with biomedical and physiological \n     expertise in order to evaluate the further expansion of the \n     use of polygraph tests on Federal employees and contractor \n     personnel.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Director of the National Institutes of Health should \n     enter into appropriate arrangements with the National Academy \n     of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study and \n     investigation into the scientific validity of polygraphy as a \n     screening tool for Federal and Federal contractor personnel, \n     with particular reference to the validity of polygraph tests \n     being proposed for use in proposed rules published at 64 Fed. \n     Reg. 45062 (August 18, 1999).\n       Sec. 519. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) In 1999, prostate cancer is expected to kill more than \n     37,000 men in the United States and be diagnosed in over \n     180,000 new cases.\n       (2) Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed nonskin cancer in \n     the United States.\n       (3) African Americans have the highest incidence of \n     prostate cancer in the world.\n       (4) Considering the devastating impact of the disease among \n     men and their families, prostate cancer research remains \n     underfunded.\n       (5) More resources devoted to clinical and translational \n     research at the National Institutes of Health will be highly \n     determinative of whether rapid advances can be attained in \n     treatment and ultimately a cure for prostate cancer.\n       (6) The Congressionally Directed Department of Defense \n     Prostate Cancer Research Program is making important strides \n     in innovative prostate cancer research, and this Program \n     presented to Congress in April of 1998 a full investment \n     strategy for prostate cancer research at the Department of \n     Defense.\n       (7) The Senate expressed itself unanimously in 1998 that \n     the Federal commitment to biomedical research should be \n     doubled over the next 5 years.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) finding treatment breakthroughs and a cure for prostate \n     cancer should be made a national health priority;\n       (2) significant increases in prostate cancer research \n     funding, commensurate with the impact of the disease, should \n     be made available at the National Institutes of Health and to \n     the Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program; \n     and\n       (3) these agencies should prioritize prostate cancer \n     research that is directed toward innovative clinical and \n     translational research projects in order that treatment \n     breakthroughs can be more rapidly offered to patients.\n       Sec. 520. The United States-Mexico Border Health Commission \n     Act (22 U.S.C. 290n et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by striking section 2 and inserting the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 2. APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS OF BORDER HEALTH COMMISSION.\n\n       ``Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of \n     this section, the President shall appoint the United States \n     members of the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission, \n     and shall attempt to conclude an agreement with Mexico \n     providing for the establishment of such Commission.''; and\n       (2) in section 3--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking the semicolon and \n     inserting ``; and'';\n       (B) in paragraph (2)(B), by striking ``; and'' and \n     inserting a period; and\n       (C) by striking paragraph (3).\n       Sec. 521. Sense of the Senate on Women's Access to \n     Obstetric and Gynecological Services. (a) Findings.--Congress \n     makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the 1st session of the 106th Congress, 23 bills have \n     been introduced to allow women direct access to their ob-gyn \n     provider for obstetric and gynecologic services covered by \n     their health plans.\n       (2) Direct access to ob-gyn care is a protection that has \n     been established by Executive order for enrollees in \n     medicare, medicaid, and Federal Employee Health Benefit \n     Programs.\n       (3) American women overwhelmingly support passage of \n     Federal legislation requiring health plans to allow women to \n     see their ob-gyn providers without first having to obtain a \n     referral. A 1998 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and \n     Harvard University found that 82 percent of Americans support \n     passage of a direct access law.\n       (4) While 39 States have acted to promote residents' access \n     to ob-gyn providers, patients in other State- or federally-\n     governed health plans are not protected from access \n     restrictions or limitations.\n       (5) In May of 1999 the Commonwealth Fund issued a survey on \n     women's health, determining that 1 of 4 women (23 percent) \n     need to first receive permission from their primary care \n     physician before they can go and see their ob-gyn provider \n     for covered obstetric or gynecologic care.\n       (6) Sixty percent of all office visits to ob-gyn providers \n     are for preventive care.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should enact legislation that requires health \n     plans to provide women with direct access to a participating \n     health provider who specializes in obstetrics and \n     gynecological services, and that such direct access should be \n     provided for all obstetric and gynecologic care covered by \n     their health plans, without first having to obtain a referral \n     from a primary care provider or the health plan.\n       Sec. 522. Sense of the Senate Regarding Comprehensive \n     Public Education Reform. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the \n     following:\n       (1) Recent scientific evidence demonstrates that enhancing \n     children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual \n     development before the age of six results in tremendous \n     benefits throughout life.\n       (2) Successful schools are led by well-trained, highly \n     qualified principals, but many principals do not get the \n     training that the principals need in management skills to \n     ensure their school provides an excellent education for every \n     child.\n       (3) Good teachers are a crucial catalyst to quality \n     education, but one in four new teachers do not meet State \n     certification requirements; each year more than 50,000 under-\n     prepared teachers enter the classroom; and 12 percent of new \n     teachers have had no teacher training at all.\n       (4) Public school choice is a driving force behind reform \n     and is vital to increasing accountability and improving low-\n     performing schools.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Federal Government should support State and local \n     educational agencies engaged in comprehensive reform of their \n     public education system and that any education reform should \n     include at least the following principals--\n       (1) that every child should begin school ready to learn by \n     providing the resources to expand existing programs, such as \n     Even Start and Head Start;\n       (2) that training and development for principals and \n     teachers should be a priority;\n       (3) that public school choice should be encouraged to \n     increase options for students;\n       (4) that support should be given to communities to develop \n     additional counseling opportunities for at-risk students; and\n       (5) school boards, administrators, principals, parents, \n     teachers, and students must be accountable for the success of \n     the public education system and corrective action in \n     underachieving schools must be taken.\n       Sec. 523. The applicable time limitations with respect to \n     the giving of notice of injury and the filing of a claim for \n     compensation for disability or death by an individual under \n     the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, as amended, for \n     injuries sustained as a result of the person's exposure to a \n     nitrogen or sulfur mustard agent in the performance of \n     official duties as an employee at the Department of the \n     Army's Edgewood Arsenal before March 20, 1944, shall not \n     begin to run until the date of enactment of this Act.\n       Sec. 524. Section 169(d)(2)(B) of Public Law 105-220, the \n     Workforce Investment Act of 1998, is amended by striking ``or \n     Alaska Native villages or Native groups (as such terms are \n     defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \n     Act (43 U.S.C. 1602)).'', and inserting in lieu thereof, ``or \n     Alaska Natives.''.\n       Sec. 525. Sense of the Senate on Prevention of Needlestick \n     Injuries. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n     that American health care workers report more than 800,000 \n     needlestick and sharps injuries each year;\n       (2) the occurrence of needlestick injuries is believed to \n     be widely under-reported;\n\n[[Page S12442]]\n\n       (3) needlestick and sharps injuries result in at least \n     1,000 new cases of health care workers with HIV, hepatitis C \n     or hepatitis B every year; and\n       (4) more than 80 percent of needlestick injuries can be \n     prevented through the use of safer devices.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should pass legislation that would eliminate \n     or minimize the significant risk of needlestick injury to \n     health care workers.\n       Sec. 526. (a) The Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention shall hereafter be known and designated as the \n     ``Thomas R. Harkin Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention''.\n       (b) Effective upon the date of enactment of this Act, any \n     reference in a law, document, record, or other paper of the \n     United States to the ``Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention'' shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``Thomas R. Harkin Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention''.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed as \n     prohibiting the Director of the Thomas R. Harkin Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention from utilizing for official \n     purposes the term ``CDC'' as an acronym for such Centers.\n       Sec. 527. Designation of Arlen Specter Department of Health \n     and Human Services. (a) In General.--The National Library of \n     Medicine building (building 38) at 8600 Rockville Pike, in \n     Bethesda, Maryland, shall be known and designated as the \n     ``Arlen Specter National Library of Medicine''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     building referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the Arlen Specter National Library of \n     Medicine.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Departments of Labor, Health \n     and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 2000''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/12/senate-section/article/S12442-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING HENRY ``HANK'' AARON\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 201, submitted \nearlier by Senators Coverdell and Cleland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 201) congratulating Henry ``Hank'' \n     Aaron on the 25th anniversary of breaking the Major League \n     Baseball career home run record established by Babe Ruth and \n     recognizing him as one of the greatest baseball players of \n     all time.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \ncommemorating one of the great heroes of American sport. Twenty-five \nyears ago, Henry ``Hank'' Aaron broke one of baseball's most legendary \nrecords--the all time home run record set by George Herman ``Babe'' \nRuth. In 1974 Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run and forever \netched his name in the annals of baseball history. But we should always \nremember that this record was only part of the story for an athlete \nwhose impact on the game and society is still felt today.\n  From the time he first arrived in the major leagues with the \nMilwaukee Braves in 1954, Hank Aaron gained a reputation as one of the \nmost feared hitters in the National League, prompting the rival \nBrooklyn Dodgers to quickly give him the nickname ``Bad Henry.'' In \n1957 he led the Braves to the World Series and earned himself the \nLeague's Most Valuable Player Award.\n  Aaron continued his consistently outstanding play through the 1960s \nand was with the Braves when they moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta in \n1966. During these years, Hank Aaron continued to lead the Braves' \noffense and began amassing an impressive number of home runs. By the \nearly 1970s it was clear that Aaron was on the verge of breaking a \nrecord many thought was unreachable--Babe Ruth's record of 714 career \nhome runs.\n  Despite numerous threats to himself and his family from those who did \nnot want to see him break the record, Hank Aaron persevered and made \nthe record his own on the evening of April 8, 1974 at Atlanta Stadium. \nHe went on to finish his career with the Milwaukee Brewers and retired \nwith an amazing total of 755 career home runs, along with a .305 \nlifetime batting average and 2,297 career runs batted in, also a major \nleague record. He entered baseball's Hall of Fame in 1982, receiving \none of the highest vote totals in the history of Hall of Fame \nballoting.\n  After his playing days were over, Aaron returned to the Braves and \nbecame a pivotal part of the team's front office staff as their vice \npresident of player development. He continues to serve the Atlanta \ncommunity through various charities, including his own Chasing the \nDream Foundation, and as corporate vice president of community \nrelations for Turner Broadcasting.\n  Few players have had as large an impact on their sport and the cities \nwhere they played. As one of baseball's first African-American stars, \nHank Aaron withstood prejudice and bigotry and helped to create the \nmodern integrated game where stars like Ken Griffey, Jr., Ramon \nMartinez, Brian Jordan and Sammy Sosa flourish. His calm, quiet, \nmethodical style is a lasting example that actions always speak louder \nthan words. The game of baseball and society as a whole owes a debt of \ngratitude to Henry Aaron, and this resolution will show the Senate's \nappreciation for the all-time home run king on the anniversary of his \ngreatest achievement on the field.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 201) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 201\n\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron hit a historic home run in \n     1974 to become the all-time Major League Baseball home run \n     leader;\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron over the course of his career \n     created a lasting legacy in the game of baseball and \n     continues to contribute to society through his Chasing the \n     Dream Foundation;\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron hit more than 40 home runs in \n     8 different seasons;\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron appeared in 20 All-Star games;\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron was elected to the National \n     Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, \n     receiving one of the highest vote totals (406 votes) in the \n     history of National Baseball Hall of Fame voting;\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron was inducted into the National \n     Baseball Hall of Fame on August 1, 1982;\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron finished his career in 1976 \n     with 755 home runs, a lifetime batting average of .305, and \n     2,297 runs batted in;\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron taught us to follow our \n     dreams;\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron continues to serve the \n     community through his various commitments to charities and as \n     corporate vice president of community relations for Turner \n     Broadcasting;\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron became one of the first \n     African-Americans in Major League Baseball upper management, \n     as Atlanta's vice president of player development; and\n       Whereas Henry ``Hank'' Aaron is one of the greatest \n     baseball players: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates Henry ``Hank'' Aaron on his great \n     achievements in baseball and recognizes Henry ``Hank'' Aaron \n     as one of the greatest professional baseball players of all \n     time; and\n       (2) commends Henry ``Hank'' Aaron for his commitment to \n     young people, earning him a permanent place in both sports \n     history and American society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/12/senate-section/article/S12442-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.
