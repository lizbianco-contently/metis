Help us \nto think about how much You love each of us with unqualified acceptance \nand forgiveness. May the tone and tenor of our words to the people in \nour lives be an expression of Your love. You have called us to love as \nYou have loved us. May we know when to express not only tough love but \nalso when to be tender in withholding judgment or condemnation. Help us \nto love those we find it difficult to bear and those who find it a \nchallenge to bear with us. All around us are people with highly \npolished exteriors that hide their real need for esteem, affirmation, \nand encouragement from us. Show us practical ways to express love in \ncreative ways. May we lift burdens rather than become one; may we add \nto people's strength rather than becoming a source of stress. Place on \nour agendas the particular people to whom You have called us to \ncommunicate Your love. And give us that resolve of which great days are \nmade: If no one else does, Lord, I will! Place in our minds loving \nthoughts and feelings for the people in our lives. Show us caring \nthings we can do to enact what's in our hearts. Direct specific acts of \ncaring You have motivated in our hearts. Don't let us forget, Lord. \nGive us the will to act, to say what we feel. Through Him who is Your \namazing Grace.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud to offer this amendment on behalf of \nthe colleagues who have been mentioned, eight in number, and myself. We \nhave worked for a very long time on the contents of this amendment. We \nhave\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\nspent a lot of time in our home States and elsewhere observing what is \nhappening in our public schools today, and this amendment is a response \nto what we have seen.\n  I would roughly categorize that in two ways, which I will describe in \na little more detail.\n  The first is, there remains an unacceptable gap in achievement levels \nbetween children in America's public schools who are disadvantaged \neconomically and those who are advantaged, and that is unfair and \nunacceptable.\n  Secondly, there is occurring, and has been occurring throughout our \ncountry over the last decade really, an extraordinary outburst of \neducational reform at the local level. Superior efforts are being made \nby teachers, by school administrators, by superintendents, by parents, \nby whole communities, to try to do everything possible to improve the \nstatus quo because when the status quo is not adequately educating our \nchildren, in this information age particularly, we are not achieving \none of the great goals of our Government.\n  This proposal we make today is an attempt to respond to both of those \nobservations and to use the 5-year reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act as an opportunity to leverage Federal \ndollars, perhaps small in percentage in the overall cost of public \neducation in our country but large in absolute terms, to do better at \neducating the poor and disadvantaged in our country and do much better \nat encouraging, facilitating, and financially supporting the \nextraordinary educational reform efforts going on around the country, I \nam pleased to say particularly in States such as my own State of \nConnecticut.\n\n  As we continue this debate on the ESEA, Congress itself is facing a \nmajor test, one that will likely be far more important to the future of \nmillions of America's children than any of the school exams or \nassessments they have to take this year.\n  Our challenge in Congress is to reform, and in some ways to reinvent \nin some fundamental ways, our Federal education policy to help States \nand school districts meet the demands of this new century and to help \nus fulfill our responsibility to provide a quality education for all of \nAmerica's children.\n  That is why I join today with eight of my colleagues, and perhaps at \nleast one more, in offering this amendment to the bill before us that \ncalls for a totally new approach to Federal education policy, one that \nwe who cosponsor this amendment believe could also serve as a bridge to \na bipartisan solution to this problem, to a bipartisan reauthorization \nof the ESEA. Of course, that has to be the goal to which all of us \naspire. It may be an interesting debate on Federal education policy, it \nmay be stimulating, it may be fascinating, it may even be educational, \nbut if it is only a debate without a result, it does nothing for the \nchildren of our country.\n  We hope this proposal we are making today can be a bridge to a \nbipartisan reauthorization of ESEA. Our approach will refocus our \nnational policy on helping States and local school districts raise \nacademic achievement for all children. That has to be our priority. It \nwould put the priority, therefore, for Federal programs on performance \ninstead of process, on delivering results instead of developing rules.\n  I am asking not just how much we are going to spend on education or \nwhat specific pipes it goes through to the State and local districts, \nbut on what comes out of the other end, which is to say how are our \nchildren being educated.\n  Our approach calls on States and local districts to enter into a new \ncompact with the Federal Government to work together to strengthen \nstandards and to improve educational opportunities, particularly for \nAmerica's poorest children. It would provide State and local educators \nwith significantly more funding from the Federal Government and \nsignificantly more flexibility in using that funding to meet their \nspecific local needs.\n  In exchange, our proposal would demand real accountability and, for \nthe first time, impose consequences on schools that continue to fail to \nshow progress. You cannot have a system of accountability that winks at \nthose who fail to appropriately educate our children.\n  In order to implement effective education policy, I think we have to \nfirst acknowledge that there are serious problems with the performance \nof many of our schools and that public confidence in public education \nwill erode seriously if we do not acknowledge and address those \nproblems now.\n  While overall student achievement is up, we must face the alarming \nachievement gap that still separates poorer minority Americans from \nbetter off white Americans.\n  According to the State-by-State reading scores of fourth graders, in \nthe National Assessment of Educational Progress, the achievement gap \nbetween African American and Caucasian American students actually grew \nlarger in 16 States between 1992 and 1998, notwithstanding the billions \nof dollars we have sent back to the States and local districts to \nreduce that gap over the last 35 years. The gap between Hispanic \nAmerican students and white American students became larger in nine \nStates over the same period of time. Perhaps most alarming is the data \nthat reveals that the average African American and Latino American 17-\nyear-old has about the same reading and math skills as the average \nCaucasian American 13-year-old. That is an unfair and unacceptable \noutrage. We must do something about it.\n  One recent report states:\n\n       Students are being unconsciously eliminated from the \n     candidate pool of Information Technology workers by the \n     knowledge and attitudes they acquire in their K-12 years. \n     Many students do not learn the basic skills of reasoning, \n     mathematics, and communication that provide the foundation \n     for higher education or entry-level jobs in Information \n     Technology work.\n\n  One cause of this, I am afraid, is that we have not done a very good \njob in recent years of providing more of our children with high-quality \nteachers, a critical component to higher student achievement. After \nall, what is education? Education is one person, the teacher, conveying \nknowledge and the ability to learn to another person, a younger person, \na student. We are failing to deliver enough teachers to the classroom \nwho truly know their subject matter.\n  One national survey found that one-fourth of all secondary school \nteachers did not major in their core area of instruction. And note \nthis. In terms of the inequity in the current system, in the school \ndistricts with the highest concentration of minority students, those \nstudents have less than a 50-percent chance of getting a math or \nscience teacher who has a license or degree in those fields. So we are \nputting them behind before they even get started.\n  While more money alone will not solve our problems, we cannot \nhonestly expect to reform and reinvent our schools without more money \neither. The reality is, there is a tremendous need for the additional \ninvestment in our public schools, not just in urban areas but in every \nkind of community, including, of course, poorer rural communities.\n\n  Not only are thousands of crumbling and overcrowded schools in need \nof modernization, but a looming shortage of 2 million new teachers to \ntrain and hire faces our country. Add to this billions in spiraling \nspecial education costs the local school districts have to meet and we \ncan see we cannot really uphold our responsibility without sending more \nmoney back to the States and local school districts.\n  Trying to raise standards at a time of profound social turbulence for \nour poorest families means we will need to expend new sums to reach and \nteach children who in the past, frankly, have never been asked to \nexcel, whose failure was accepted--in some senses perhaps even \nencouraged--who in the present will have to overcome enormous hurdles \nto do better.\n  At the same time that schools are trying to cope with new and complex \nsocietal changes, we are demanding that they teach more than they ever \nhave before. Parents and potential employers both want better teachers, \nstronger standards, and higher test scores for all our students as well \nas state-of-the-art technology and skills to match.\n  It is a tribute to the many dedicated men and women who are \nresponsible for teaching our children every schoolday across America \nthat the bulk of our schools are as good as they are today in light of \nthese broader contextual and sociological pressures. I believe--and I \nbelieve it is a fundamental\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\npremise of our system of government in our education system--that any \nchild can learn, any child. That has been proven over and over again in \nthe best schools in my home State of Connecticut and in many of \nAmerica's poorest cities and rural areas. There are, in fact, plenty of \npositives to highlight in public education today, which is something \nelse we have to acknowledge, yet too often do not, as part of this \ndebate.\n  I have made a real effort over the last few years to visit a broad \nrange of public schools and programs in Connecticut. I can tell you \nthat there is much happening in our schools we can be heartened by, \nproud of, and learn from.\n  There is the exemplary John Barry Elementary School in Meriden, CT, \nfor instance, which has a very-high-poverty, high-mobility student \npopulation but, through intervention programs, has had remarkable \nsuccess in improving the reading skills of many of its students.\n  There is the Side By Side Charter School in Norwalk--1 of 17 charters \nin Connecticut--which has created an exemplary multicultural, \nmultiracial program in response to the challenges of a State court \ndecision, Sheff versus O'Neill, to diminish racial isolation and \nsegregation in our schools. Side By Side is experimenting with a \ndifferent approach to classroom assignments, having students stay with \nteachers for 2 consecutive years to take advantage of the relationships \nthat develop. By all indications, it is working quite well for those \nkids.\n  There is the Bridge Academy, which is a charter high school in \nBridgeport, CT, formed, as so many of the most effective schools have \nbeen, by teachers from the public schools who wanted to go out and run \ntheir own schools to create the environment in which they believed they \ncould best teach. It is a remarkable experience to visit this school in \nBridgeport.\n  I remember when I went to the students a second time a couple months \nago. Some people criticize charter schools and say they skim off the \nbest students from the other schools. The kids laughed. One of the \nyoung women there, high school age, said, ``I think you can say, Mr. \nSenator, that what you have before you is the worst students from the \npublic high schools.'' She said, ``I will go one step further. If I \nremained at the high school I was attending, I would not be in the high \nschool; I would have dropped out by now. I was going nowhere.'' But \nthere was something about this school, the Bridge Academy, which, she \nsaid to me, maybe was the smaller class size, interestingly. ``Maybe it \nis the fact that we know the teachers here really care about us. We are \nlike a family here. Whatever it is, I have worked very hard and I have \ndone things I thought I was never able to do. I am going to college \nnext year.''\n  That is a remarkable story. I don't have the number with me, but a \ngreat majority of the students graduating there are going to college \nnext year. They will probably have the acceptance letter on the central \nbulletin board in the school. But that is occurring. In Connecticut, we \nhave the BEST program, which is building on previous efforts to raise \nteacher skills and salaries. It is now targeting additional State aid \nand training and, most importantly, mentoring support to help local \nschool districts bring in new teachers and prepare them to excel. It is \nvery exciting to see the more senior teachers--the mentors--committing \ntime, with little or no extra compensation, to help the younger \nteachers learn how to be good teachers.\n  I think you have to say that is one of the reasons why Connecticut \nscores on the national tests have now gone to the top. It is one of the \nbig reasons why they have, and it is why this BEST program of mentoring \nis cited by many groups, including the National Commission on Teaching \nin America's Future, as a model for us to follow.\n  A number of other States, including, by most accounts, North Carolina \nand Texas, have moved in the same direction, refocusing their education \nsystems, not on process but on performance, not on prescriptive rules \nand regulations but on results. More and more of them are, in fact, \nadopting what might be called a reinvest, reinvent and responsibility \nstrategy by, first, infusing new resources into their public education \nsystem; second, giving local districts more flexibility; and, third, \ndemanding new measures and mechanisms of accountability to increase the \nchances that these investments will yield the intended return, meaning \nimproved academic achievement by more students.\n  To ensure that more States and localities have the ability to build \non these successes around the country and prepare every student to \nsucceed in the classroom, which has to be our national objective, we \nmust invest more resources. The amendment my colleagues and I are \noffering today would boost ESEA funding by $35 billion over the next 5 \nyears. But we also believe that the impact of this funding will be \nseverely diluted if it is not better targeted to the worst performing \nschools and if it is not coupled with a demand for results. That is why \nwe not only increase title I funding for disadvantaged kids by 50 \npercent, but we use the more targeted formula for distributing those \ndollars to schools with the highest concentrations of poverty. That is \nwhy we develop a new accountability system that strips Federal funding \nfrom States that continually fail to meet their performance goals.\n\n  I wish to highlight for a moment our formula changes in title I on \nthe hope that they will draw some attention to an area I believe is \nvery worthy of debate, which is how best to target funds to the poorest \nchildren, the disadvantaged, who are still being left behind in great \nnumbers in our education system.\n  Our formula distributes more of the new funding through the targeted \ngrant formula enacted into law by Congress in 1994, which has never \nbeen funded by congressional appropriators. It is progressive, but \nthere is no money in it. It ensures that no State will lose funds while \nproviding for better targeting of new funds with those States with the \nhighest rates of poverty. In other words, it has a hold harmless in the \ncurrent level of funding under title I, but it takes the new money and \ntargets it to those who need it most. I am calling for this targeting \nto the school districts receiving the highest percentage of poor \nchildren.\n  We must face the fact that title I funds today are currently spread \ntoo thin to help the truly disadvantaged. According to a 1999 CRS \nreport, title I grants are provided to approximately 90 percent of all \nlocal education agencies--way beyond what we would guess are the truly \nneedy--and 58 percent of all public schools receive title I money.\n  Federal funds for poor children are currently distributed through two \ngrants known as the basic grant and the concentration grant. In order \nto be eligible for the basic grants, through which 85 percent of title \nI money is now distributed, local school districts only need to have 10 \nschool age children from low-income families, and these children must \nconstitute only 2 percent of the total school age population. I want to \nrepeat that because it is so stunning. When I first read it, I went \nback to my staff and the documents to see if I had read it right. This \nis the result of, frankly, a political formula. In order to be eligible \nfor basic grants, through which 85 percent of title I funds are \ndistributed--it is supposed to help disadvantaged kids--local districts \nonly need to have 10 school age children from low-income families, and \nthose children must constitute only 2 percent of the school age \npopulation. You can see how that money, therefore, is being spread so \nthin that a lot of poor kids are not getting help and a lot of kids who \nare not so poor, from schools in which there are few poor kids, are \nreceiving that money.\n  Under the concentration grant, districts with a child poverty rate of \n15 percent are eligible to receive funding. That is a little better but \nstill minimal. With those low thresholds, we have to ask ourselves are \nwe really living up to the original intent of the ESEA, which was to \nensure that poor children have access to a quality education on the \nsame level as more affluent children. I think the answer has to be, no, \nwe are not. That is what the facts say. In fact, another number, which \nunsettled me even more, is one out of every five schools in America \nthat has between 50 and 75 percent of its student body under the \npoverty level doesn't receive a dime of title I money. One out of every \nfive schools in America that has half to three-quarters of its student \npopulation under the poverty level doesn't receive a dime of\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\ntitle I money, which is supposed to benefit exactly those children.\n  I think we have to acknowledge that the current formula is not doing \nwhat it should be doing. It is a starting point and a way to draw our \nattention and resources back to the original intent of this act and the \nprimary function of the Federal Government in education stated in 1965, \nwhich we are not fulfilling now, and that is to better educate \neconomically disadvantaged children.\n\n  In calling for a refocus of our Federal priorities, we who have \nsponsored this amendment agree with those concerned that the current \nsystem of Federal education grants are both too numerous and too \nbureaucratic, too prescriptive, and too strong on mandates from \nWashington. That is why this amendment eliminates dozens of federally \nmicrotargeted, micromanaged programs that are redundant or incidental \nto our core national mission of raising academic achievement. We also \nbelieve we have a great overriding national interest in promoting a few \nimportant education goals, and chief among them is delivering on the \npromise of equal opportunity. It is irresponsible, it seems to us, to \nhand out Federal dollars to the localities with no questions asked and \nno thought of national priorities. That is why we carve out separate \ntitles in those areas that we think are critical to helping local \ndistricts elevate the performance of their schools.\n  In other words, we consolidate almost 50 existing Federal categorical \ngrant programs into the title I program for disadvantaged kids, the \nlargest by far. And performance-based grant programs in which we state \na national objective but give the local school district and the State \nthe opportunity and the authority to work out their priorities are in \nmeeting those objectives.\n  The first of these is title I with more money, $12 billion--a 50-\npercent increase in better targeting.\n  The second--a performance-based grant program--would combine various \nteacher training and professional development programs into a single \nteacher-quality grant, increase funding by 100 percent to $1.6 billion \nannually--the quality of our teachers is so important--and challenge \neach State to pursue the kind of bold, performance-based reforms, if it \nis their desire and choice, and higher salaries for teachers, as my own \nState of Connecticut has undertaken with great success and effect.\n  The third performance-based grant program would reform the Federal \nBilingual Education Program and hopefully diffuse the ongoing \ncontroversy surrounding it by making it absolutely clear that our \nnational mission is to help immigrant children learn and master \nEnglish, as well, of course, as to achieve high levels of achievement \non all subjects. We must be willing to back this commitment with more \nresources--the resources that are essential to help ensure that all \nlimited English-proficient students are served better and are not left \nbehind, and that the gap between their knowledge and that of the \nmajority does not grow larger in the years ahead as it has in the years \nimmediately past.\n  Under our approach, funding for limited English-proficient programs \nwould be more than doubled to $1 billion a year and for the first time \nbe distributed to States and local districts through a reliable formula \nbased on the number of students who need help with their English \nproficiency. As a result, school districts serving large LEP--limited \nEnglish-proficient--and high-poverty student populations would for the \nfirst time be guaranteed Federal funding and would not be penalized \nbecause of their inability to hire clever proposal writers for \ncompetitive grants.\n  The fourth performance-based grant title would provide greater choice \nwithin the public school framework by authorizing additional funding \nfor charter school startups and new incentives for expanding local, \nintradistrict public school choice programs.\n  The fifth performance-based grant program in this amendment would \nestablish and radically restructure the remaining ESEA and ensure that \nfunds are much better targeted while giving local districts more \nflexibility.\n  In this new title VI, our amendment would consolidate more than 20 \ndifferent programs into a single, high-performance initiatives title \nwith a focus on supporting bold new ideas, such as expanding access to \nsummer school and afterschool programs, improving school safety, and \nbuilding technological literacy, which is to say to close the looming \ndigital divide in our country for our children before it gets deep and \nunfixable.\n  We increase overall funding for these innovative programs by more \nthan $200 million annually and distribute this aid through a formula \nthat targets more resources for the highest poverty areas.\n  The boldest changes we are proposing are in the new accountability \ntitle. As of today, we have plenty of rules and requirements on inputs, \non how funding is to be allocated and who must be served, but little if \nany attention to outcomes on how schools ultimately perform in \neducating children. This amendment would reverse that imbalance by \nlinking Federal funding to the progress State and local districts make \nin raising academic achievements. It would call on State and local \nleaders to set specific performance standards and adopt rigorous \namendments for measuring how each district is faring and meeting these \ngoals. In turn, States that exceed those goals would be rewarded with \nadditional funds, and those that fail repeatedly to show progress would \nbe penalized. In other words, for the first time there would be \nconsequences for schools that perform poorly.\n  In discussing how exactly to impose those consequences, we have run \ninto understandable concerns about whether we can penalize failing \nschools and school systems without also hurting the children.\n  The truth is we are hurting too many children right now, especially \nthe most economically and sociologically vulnerable of them, by forcing \nthem to attend chronically troubled schools that are accountable to no \none--a situation that is just not acceptable anymore. Our amendment \nminimizes the potential negative impact of these consequences on \nstudents.\n  It provides the States with 3 years to set their performance-based \ngoals and put in place a monitoring system for gauging how local \ndistricts are progressing. It also provides additional resources for \nStates to help school districts identify and then improve low-\nperforming schools.\n  If after those 3 years the State is still failing to meet its goals, \nthe State would be cut in its administrative funding by 50 percent. \nOnly after 4 years of underperformance would dollars targeted for the \nclassroom through the new title VI be put in jeopardy. At that point, \nprotecting kids by continuing to subsidize bad schools honestly becomes \nmore like punishing them.\n  I want to point out that at no point would our proposal cut title I \nfunding, or the largest part of ESEA--the part focused on the needs of \nour poorest children.\n  Another concern that may be raised is that these performance-based \ngrants are open-ended block grants in sheep's clothing. There are \nsubstantial differences between a straight block-grant approach and our \nperformance-based grant proposal. First, in most block grant proposals, \nthe accountability mechanisms are often nonexistent or, if they are, \nthey are quite vague. Our bill would have tangible consequences pegged \nnot just to raising test scores in the more affluent areas, but to \nclosing the troubling achievement gap between them and students in the \npoor, largely minority districts.\n  We believe our amendment embraces a commonsense strategy--reinvest in \nour public schools, reinvent the way we run them, and restore a sense \nof responsibility in our schools to the children who we are supposed to \nbe educating and to their parents. Hence the title of our bill, ``The \nPublic Education Reinvention, Reinvestment, and Responsibility Act,'' \nwhich we call RRR for short.\n  I guess you could say our approach in this amendment is modest enough \nto recognize that there are no easy answers, particularly not from the \nFederal Government, for turning around low-performing schools, to \nlifting teaching standards, to closing the debilitating achievement \ngap, and that most of those answers won't be found in Washington \nanyway. But our proposal is bold enough to try to harness\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\nour unique ability to set the national agenda and recast the Federal \nGovernment as an active catalyst for educational success instead of a \npassive enabler of failure.\n  Finally, this debate raises again for all of us in the Senate the \nbasic question: Did we come here to produce or to posture? Are we going \nto be practical or are we going to be partisan?\n  At this moment, when our constituents seem to be telling us \neverywhere in the country that the deed they most want us to do is to \nhelp reform the public schools of this country, are we going to be \ncontent with a debate that does not produce a bill?\n  At this moment, the apparent answers to these questions are not \nencouraging. But there is still time. And we hope this amendment can be \nthe path to bipartisan discussions, compromises, and ultimately \neducational reform.\n  I thank my colleagues who are cosponsors of this bill for the \ncontributions that each and every one of them has made. I urge my \nfellow Members of the Senate in the time ahead to take the time to look \nat our proposal with an open mind--nobody will like every part of it--\nand to see if there is enough here to form the basis of a bridge that a \nsignificant majority of us can walk across to achieve a bipartisan \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is there a time allocation under this bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a time allocation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by saying I congratulate the \nSenator from Connecticut for bringing forward an amendment that has a \nlot of interesting, creative ideas, ideas that are attractive to myself \nand other Members on the other side of the aisle that find attractive \nthe proposals presented; and the accountability proposals and the idea \nwe should allow local communities and States to have more flexibility \nin the management of the funds which come from the Federal Government, \nwith an expectation they produce a better level of achievement for \ntheir students.\n\n  These are ideas which we think make sense. We have some reservations \nabout some proposals within the amendment, but I hope we can work over \ntime with the Senator from Connecticut and his cosponsors on his side \nof the aisle to evolve a bipartisan package. I think there is \nsignificant opportunity for that. I congratulate the Senator for his \nefforts.\n  The amendment that was set aside, offered by Senator Lott, is called \nthe Teachers' Bill of Rights. That amendment involves four items: \nFirst, a commitment that allows, under the underlying bill, S. 2, to \nmake sure we use the dollars of the Teacher Empowerment Act, which is \n$2 billion, to hire high-quality teachers, teachers who have the \nqualifications to teach the subjects they are supposed to be teaching. \nIn turn, it has accountability standards which we expect from the \nStates for using the money to hire quality teachers, to show they have \nhired the quality teachers, and as a result student achievement has \nimproved.\n  The thrust is not directed at institutions or school systems but is \ndirected at children and making sure children's achievement improves in \nthe context of giving States more flexibility but expecting more \naccountability. This amendment tracks that proposal. It gives more \ndollars to the local districts and the States to hire quality teachers, \nbut it expects the quality teachers to be able to show results. It \nspecifically requires accountability in showing either student \nachievement is increasing or that the teachers who are teaching in the \ncore curriculums they are assigned to--math teachers teaching math, for \nexample--actually know the subject and are capable of teaching the \nsubject to the children.\n  In addition, the bill has an authorization of $50 million to \nencourage midcareer professionals to come into the teaching profession, \na very important proposal that came forward with Senator Hutchison of \nTexas, Senator Frist, and Senator Crapo, a good idea that allows using \ndollars to attract folks who have gone through their professional \ncareer in the private sector and decided they wanted to give back a \nlittle bit to society and have decided to go into public education. \nThis assists them in doing that. We are starting to attract a fair \nnumber of people from that career path. It is important to encourage.\n  The fourth element of the Teachers' Bill of Rights is the very \nimportant proposal from Senator Coverdell limiting teacher liability as \nthey pursue professional activities in teaching children. This is a \nproblem for teachers. Most teachers say their big concern is they will \nget sued because a child is on the playground, gets injured, and they \nare held responsible. They are afraid of the impact on their family to \nhave such a lawsuit occur. This is an attempt to try to mitigate that \nin a reasonable way. It is a good proposal.\n  These are the four elements of the Teachers' Bill of Rights \namendment. I hope my colleagues can support that amendment which is not \noverly controversial. It is a good proposal.\n  Speaking about the general debate we have been involved in for the \nlast week on the issue of ESEA, it has been an interesting and a very \nsubstantive debate. It has, however, involved clear distinctions on \npolicy in how we approach the question of education in this country.\n\n  On our side of the aisle, we believe very strongly that we should \nhave an approach to elementary education that stresses the child and \nstresses the need for the child to do better, especially the low-income \nchild, which is where the bill focuses.\n  Third, it gives the State, the teachers, principals, and \nsuperintendents flexibility as they try to address that issue of how it \ngives low-income children a better education.\n  Fourth, it expects academic accountability. We give flexibility to \nStates and they have to produce academic accountability. Low-income \nchildren have to do better than in the past. We have spent, as I \nmentioned a number of times, over $130 billion in title I over the last \n35 years. Yet the academics of our low-income children have actually \ngone down over that time period. As a result, we are seeing the gap \nwiden between the non-low-income child and the low-income child in the \nschool systems. The statistics are stark. The Senator from Connecticut \ncited a number of them. The most stark is that the average low-income \nchild reads at two grade levels below their peers by the fourth grade; \nthat difference expands as they move into high school years.\n  We believe strongly there has to be a different approach. We have to \nallow the local school districts flexibility and expect academic \nachievement.\n  On the other side of the aisle, I have been interested by the tenor \nof the debate. A large percentage of the positions taken on the other \nside have been to attack the idea of giving flexibility and power to \nthe States, subject to accountability standards in the area of \nachievement. There has been a clear and aggressive response and attack \ncoming from the other side of the aisle on the leaders of our States \nand our school districts across this country. It has been focused to a \nlarge extent on the Governors. There seems to be a deep suspicion on \nthe other side of the aisle about Governors, which I find discouraging, \nhaving been a former Governor. I think there are about 12 or 16 of us \nin this room. I see one other former Governor in the room right now on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  Here are some of the quotes from Members on the other side of the \naisle about Governors or State leadership. Senator Wellstone:\n\n       But honest-to-goodness, Washington, DC, and this Congress \n     is the only place I've been where people say, ``Let's hear \n     from the grassroots, the Governors are here.'' I mean, \n     Governors are not what I know to be grassroots. Could be good \n     Governors, bad Governors, average Governors. But my \n     colleagues have a bit of tunnel vision here thinking that \n     decentralization and grassroots is the Governors.\n\n  Senator Kennedy on the issue of local control:\n\n       What priority do these children get in terms of the States? \n     They didn't get any priority when this bill was passed in \n     1965, even with requirements that the funds go down to the \n     local community. This legislation is going to effectively \n     give it to all of the States, as I mentioned. I think that is \n     basically and fundamentally in error. As I mentioned, what \n     are we trying to do?\n\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\n\n  A little suspicious about what would happen if the money goes to the \nStates.\n\n  Senator Schumer:\n\n       I understand the desire to keep schools locally controlled. \n     But a block grant, a formula for waste, and much of it going \n     to the Governors, so that money doesn't even trickle down.\n\n  As an editorial comment, the evil Governors will get their hands on \nit.\n  Senator Kennedy:\n\n       We need a guarantee. We don't need a blank check. We want \n     to make sure the money's going to go to where it's needed and \n     not go to the Governors' pet programs and pet projects and \n     pet leaders in the local communities and their States.\n\n  Once again, the evil Governors strike.\n  Senator Murray:\n\n       The Republican approach would take the things that are \n     working and turn them into block grants, and their block \n     grant does not go to the classroom. It goes to the State \n     legislatures and--it goes to the State legislatures and adds \n     a new layer of bureaucracy between the education dollars and \n     the students that is so important.\n\n  There it is, the evil State legislatures.\n  Senator Dodd:\n\n       . . . What are we saying in this bill or trying to say is \n     back in that community I won't be able to make it absolutely \n     equal. But I would like to get some resources into that \n     school. Now I've got to trust--trust your good Governors.\n\n  Said with a bit of sarcasm, the Governors, once again, are being \npointed out as being inappropriate sources to be trusted in our \ninstitutions.\n  Senator Reid:\n\n       What Republicans are saying essentially is let's give the \n     money to the Governors; if they want to concentrate more \n     efforts on low-income students, they can, but if they don't, \n     they don't have to.\n\n  The Governors are the force of evil, it appears, in the educational \nsystems of America.\n  It is very surprising language. I am tempted to say it is the \nGovernors who actually have been doing the original thinking in the \narea of education. In fact, ironically, if you look at what has \nhappened in education, you will see in the issue of class size \nreduction, which is such an important question we have debated on this \nfloor, 22 States have implemented major class size reductions. In fact, \nmost of those States implemented those projects before there was any \nclass size initiative adopted at the Federal level.\n  In the area of school accountability, 40 States have initiated report \ncards already. These have been initiated, I suspect, by the Governors \nin those States, as was the class size initiative, I suspect, initiated \nby the Governors in those States.\n  In the area of charter schools, before there was any idea of a \nFederal charter school initiative, 2,000 charter schools had been \ninitiated at the local and State level. Once again, it would be the \nGovernors who initiated those charter schools; 2,000 of them have been \ninitiated across this country. In fact, the National Educational Goals \nPanel, which is probably the most objective reviewer of what is \nhappening in education, looking at it from a national perspective--they \ndon't have too much of an agenda. They have a little agenda, but they \nhave not too much, and the NEPA test is something that comes out of \nthat agenda--said States such as North Carolina and Texas, which were \ncited by the Senator from Texas as States very effective in raising the \nscores of low-income students--they said in their studies they cannot \nattribute any gains to Federal activity. They attribute the gains to \nthe fact that in the States, the local communities, the local policy \nhas been the force for educational excellence.\n\n  I am not here necessarily to defend, carte blanche, Governors, \nbecause I suspect Governors make mistakes. But Governors have as their \nprimary responsibility the issue of education. A Governor is not going \nto stop halfway through the day, is not going to stop talking about \neducation and suddenly go on to the African trade agreement and the \nCaribbean Basin agreement, which is exactly what we are going to do in \na couple of hours. Then we are going to be on to an appropriations bill \non military construction. Then we are going to be on to an \nappropriations bill on agriculture.\n  Governors, for the most part, think about education probably 40 to 50 \npercent of their time. Why? Because 40 to 50 percent of the dollars \nthat are spent at the State level in most States--not New Hampshire, \nironically, but in most States--are education dollars. That is the \nbiggest item in their budget, so they spend almost all their time on \nthat issue.\n  It is not as if they come to this issue as some sort of force for \ndarkness. But if you listened to our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, you would think so. This bill gives more authority to the \nState Governors and to the local schools and to parents and to \nteachers--by the way, subject, however, to significant accountability--\nand you would think the Governors were part of the Evil Empire, that \nthey came from the dark side. Maybe you would think they are related to \nDarth Vader, if you listened to Senator Murray, Senator Reid, Senator \nDodd, Senator Kennedy, Senator Wellstone, Senator Schumer.\n  So I decided to make up a chart. It is very obvious to me, as I \nlisten to the debate, the other side of the aisle has met the enemy and \nthe enemy is the Governors. That is the problem with education \naccording to the other side of the aisle. So I got pictures of all our \nGovernors, our good Governors. I am sure they are all good Governors. A \nfew of them are Democratic Governors. Surprisingly, a majority are \nRepublican Governors. That was not the case when I was a Governor, but \nI am glad to see that is the case today. I am thinking to myself: All \nthese good people, they are the enemy. I did not know that.\n  Poor Governor Shaheen, she has some problems in New Hampshire, I have \nto admit. She is trying her best, but she has had some tough times. She \ngot some tough cards dealt to her. But she is really interested in \neducation. I know that. She is a Democratic Governor.\n  I know some of our Republican Governors--John Roland, from \nConnecticut, he has dedicated an immense amount of thought and \ncreativity to being a leader on education. I will bet there is not a \nGovernor here, not one of these enemy Governors, who has not got a very \ncreative idea on education moving in their State, an extremely creative \nidea, something we have not thought about here in the Federal \nGovernment but something that is actually producing academic \nachievement by the kids in that State, something that is actually \nproducing results.\n  That is an ironic concept for us in Washington. We don't necessarily \nwork on results. We spent 35 years on title I, spending $130 billion. \nWe did not care about results. We did not care if the kids did any \nbetter. We wanted to get them in the school systems, and that worked, \nbut we didn't really care whether they did any better. So now we bring \nforward a bill which says we care about the kids and we want \nachievement, and how is it attacked? It is attacked on the grounds it \nis going to give more power to the Governors and the Governors are \nreally not responsible people and should not be given that power.\n\n  I have to say, I find that extremely disingenuous, just on the face \nof it. But I also find it inappropriate on the grounds that Governors \nreally do care. They are pretty close to the people. They are elected \njust as we are. Some of them are elected more often than we are--in \nfact, I think most of them--so they are answerable to the people a few \nmore times than we are.\n  I do think this response, which is essentially: you can't do anything \nbecause it might be a block grant to the Governors, is inappropriate. \nBy the way, nothing we have in here is really a block grant at all \nbecause there is tremendous accountability pressure. The fact is, we \nset this up as a cafeteria line so States can go through and pick out \nwhat program they think is going to work best for them. But that gives \ntoo much authority to the States, to choose something that might \nactually work, because the Governors cannot be trusted.\n  This attack on this bill, which is quite honestly the gravamen of the \nopposition, is that we are taking the power out of Washington. Although \nI put it in humorous terms, that really is the gravamen of the \nopposition. We are taking the power out of Washington; we are taking \nthe strings away from Washington; we are returning the authority back \nto people actually giving the education in expectation, with \naccountability standards, that we expect achievement.\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\n  That is the difference here. There is a lobby in this city that wants \nto maintain control over these dollars at all costs, even if it means \nthe dollars are not producing any results or any significant results \nthat benefit the kids to whom they are directed. We have 35 years of \nrecord that show us these kids have lost out; we have lost generations \nof young children who were low-income, who were not able to pursue the \nAmerican dream because they could not read and they could not write. We \ncannot tolerate that any longer.\n  I believe, very strongly, we should give authority back to these \nfolks subject to the conditionality that they produce achievement. That \nis a reasonable approach, in my opinion. I am interested that the other \nside has rejected this approach and basically looks at the Governors as \nthe opposition.\n  Another way you could look at this is, what do you get for Federal \ndollars that are controlled by the Federal Government versus what you \nget for State dollars controlled by State governments--these Governors, \nthese people who do not know how to administer their programs and \nclearly are going to be inefficient?\n  Let's look at it at the State levels. It takes 25 people in the State \ngovernment in Georgia to administer $1 billion of Georgia's State \nmoney. It takes 116 people to administer the $1 billion that comes from \nthe Federal Government--more than four times the number of people it \ntakes to administer State dollars. That is people sitting at desks, \nanswering mail, doing forms, who are not teaching, who are not helping \nkids get a better education but who are simply pushing paper through \nthe system.\n\n  It gets even worse for the State of Florida. For every $1 billion \nspent, it takes 46 State employees in Florida for Florida State \ndollars; for every $1 billion of Federal money spent, it takes 297 \nemployees to manage that money--46 to 297.\n  So these terribly inefficient folks who really should not be given \nthe authority to manage the money because they really do not know what \nthey are doing, at least with their dollars they appear to know what \nthey are doing. They are getting their dollars out to the kids. Their \ndollars go to the classrooms. They don't end up in some room in some \nbig building in Tallahassee for filling out forms. Most of the people \nin the big room in Tallahassee filling out forms are doing it to \nfulfill Federal responsibilities.\n  You do not have to look at just Florida and Georgia. The commissioner \nof education in Colorado said the involvement of the Federal Government \nhas served ``only to confuse almost everyone.'' Actually, he used the \nwords ``nearly everyone.''\n  Lisa Graham Keegan, the superintendent of public education in \nArizona:\n\n       Every minute we spend making sure we're in compliance with \n     all those pages of Federal regulations means one less minute \n     we can spend to help teachers with professional development, \n     improving curriculum, developing our own testing standards \n     and insuring all the children are getting the help they need \n     to succeed.\n\n  That pretty much sums it up. I think there is a good case you could \nmake, and I believe we have made it, that the States, local school \ndistricts, the principals, the teachers, and the parents are just as \nconcerned about education as anybody in this room, and maybe even more \nso because they have actually got the kid in the school in which they \nhave to invest.\n  The case can also be made--and I think we have made it--that these \ndollars will be effectively and efficiently handled because they are \ngoing to be subject to conditions which are reasonable, which basically \nrequire academic achievement to improve amongst our low-income \nchildren.\n  I believe the case can be made, looking at the statistics, that the \nStates are already doing the job better than we are doing; that they \nare not absorbing huge amounts of the dollars in bureaucracy but, \nrather, are putting those dollars into the classroom, which is where \nthey should end up.\n  When I hear the other side talk about the poor suffering Governors as \nbeing the problem, I shake my head and think, what can they be \nthinking, because clearly they are inaccurate. I believe our approach \nto this bill is the right approach. Let's give the Governors, the local \nschools, parents, and teachers some flexibility, and let's expect them \nto produce results.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take about 3 minutes because we do \nwant to hear particularly from the cosponsors. Since I was mentioned in \nthe remarks of my good friend from New Hampshire, I think I should \nrespond.\n  I have been listening for the last 4 days in the Senate to how the \nschools that are serving underserved children and disadvantaged \nchildren are in crisis in America. We have heard that in speech after \nspeech on the other side of the aisle and many on this side as well as \nfrom myself because of the challenges we are facing. The fact remains \ntoday the Governors have 96 cents out of every dollar. Do my colleagues \nunderstand that? The Federal Government has maybe 6 or 7 cents out of \nthe dollar. They have 96 cents. If the schools are not working well, I \nbelieve perhaps we ought to have educational recommendations in \nprograms that have been tried and tested and are working. The Governors \nhave had their chance, and they have come up short on this issue. We \nhave been making that case.\n  Finally, on title I funds, 98.5 cents out of every title I dollar \ngoes to the local level; 1 percent is retained at the State level. I \nwould like to hear from my friend from New Hampshire what the basis of \nhis study is, but we have the GAO reports, studies, and allocations. I \nknow, for example, with respect to the old block grants that used to go \nto the States in higher education, very little of that ever got out of \nthe State offices because the Governors in those States, including my \nown State of Massachusetts, used that money to fund the departments of \neducation for child and maternal care. I doubt a nickel of that ever--\nalso in my own State of Massachusetts--helped people because it was all \nabsorbed as a result of the flexibility. We are trying to get away from \nthat.\n\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Indiana for his patience.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask the Senator for 10 seconds. My \nunderstanding is that following the Senator from Indiana, the Senator \nfrom North Carolina is going to speak. I ask unanimous consent that I \nfollow the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am somewhat disappointed that our \ncolleague from New Hampshire has left the floor and taken with him the \nchart with the pictures of the 50 Governors of the States. For 8 years, \nmy picture would have been on that chart, and, I must say, it is a much \nbetter looking group now that I am no longer there.\n  All joking aside, if we are going to make progress on this very \nimportant issue, it is necessary for us to stop pointing fingers and \ninstead work together to make progress.\n  There was always a tendency, when we gathered as Governors, to point \nto Washington as the source of many of our problems. Now that I have \nthe privilege of serving in this body, I see from time to time there is \na tendency to look at the State and local levels in a similar spirit. \nThe truth is, we need cooperation to make progress on this critical \nissue.\n  I begin my remarks by giving credit to those who helped us lay the \nfoundation for progress on the Lieberman amendment, which I believe \nvery strongly offers our best chance for a bipartisan compromise and \nprogress to help improve the quality of education for our students.\n  I am pleased my colleague from Connecticut has returned to the floor. \nWithout his courage, dedication, and devotion to this issue, we would \nnot be here today, nor have the opportunity for the progress we now \nhave. I publicly salute Senator Lieberman for his commitment to this \nvery important issue.\n  Secondly, I thank our colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nwho is still with us on the floor, and Senator Daschle, our Democratic \nleader, for their cooperation in including our accountability \nprovisions within the Democratic alternative that was voted on last \nweek. Also, I thank them for their understanding of our commitment to \nthe importance of targeting\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\nresources to those children who are most in need and making progress on \nthat very critical issue in the days and years ahead.\n  I thank our colleagues on this side of the aisle, the moderate \nDemocrats, the so-called new Democrats, cosponsors on this amendment \nwith Senator Lieberman and myself who have now constituted a critical \nmass which has moved the discussion beyond stale partisanship and \ninstead into a realm of reconciliation and progress that will enable us \nto make advancement in the cause of improving the quality of our \nchildren's education.\n  Finally, to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I thank \nthem for accepting our outstretched hands. We have had ongoing fruitful \nnegotiations. They are not completed yet. There are still significant, \noutstanding issues that need to be resolved, but I hope we have helped \nclear the air around this place to create a climate in which real \nprogress can be made and discussions can take place. We had cordial, \nsubstantive discussions on a bipartisan basis, leaving politics at the \ndoor and instead focusing on the challenge that concerns us all: \nproviding a quality education for all of America's children, \nparticularly those less fortunate.\n  I care deeply about this issue because I believe improving the \nquality of education for all of America's children, along with the \ncause of keeping our nuclear arms under control and addressing the \ndisintegration of the American family, is one of the greatest \nchallenges of our time. It is one of the greatest challenges of our \ntime because it is intricately tied up, bound up with addressing the \nimportant factors that face the American people today.\n\n  First, the economy. In an information age, in a globalized world \neconomy, premium upon knowledge, skills, and know-how is more critical \nto economic success than ever before. Money flows around the globe, \ntechnology flows around the globe, and information flows around the \nglobe. People do move but not as much as those other factors I \nmentioned. If one looks at the long-term competitive advantage of \nnations, one of the very best things we can do to ensure the future \neconomic vitality of our country is to guarantee that we have a \nworkforce with the skills necessary to compete successfully with our \ncompetitors from abroad.\n  I once heard Alan Greenspan speaking to the 50 Governors saying the \nsingle most important factor in determining the long-term productivity \ngrowth rate which, more than anything else, determines whether we are \ngoing to be prosperous as a country or not, is the skill levels of our \nworkers today and the education levels of our children, the workers of \ntomorrow. So improving the quality of education is critically important \nto our long-term economic well-being as a society.\n  What kind of society we will be will also be determined by whether we \nmeet the education challenge today. The growing gap between haves and \nhave-nots in our country is really an education gap, a knowledge gap, a \nskills gap, and if we are going to avoid, for the first time in our \nNation's history, being divided into a country of haves and have-nots \nwith an upper class and the lower class almost permanently shut out of \nopportunity, if we are going to avoid that, it will be because we give \nevery child growing up in our country--even those from the wrong side \nof the tracks, even those growing up in homes less fortunate than \nothers--the skills necessary to compete and succeed in the world in the \n21st century.\n  Finally, the vitality of our democracy is at stake. I believe \nstrongly in something Thomas Jefferson, one of the founders of the \nDemocratic Party, once said. Thomas Jefferson happened to be our very \nfirst education President as well. He was the founder of the University \nof Virginia. Thomas Jefferson once said that a society that expects to \nbe both ignorant and free is expecting something that never has been \nand never shall be.\n  Jefferson was right when he spoke those words in the early 1800s. If \nhe were alive today, he would realize they resonate with more truth \nthan even when he spoke them.\n  The complexity of the issues we face today, the critical decisions \nthat face the American people require an even greater level of \nunderstanding and knowledge than in Thomas Jefferson's day.\n  Our economy, the nature of our society, and the very vibrancy of our \ndemocracy are all bound up in the way in which we resolve the \neducational challenges facing our Nation. This is why many of us have \nconcluded we need to do better. The status quo is not good enough. The \nsolutions of yesterday are inadequate to meet the challenges of \ntomorrow and the 21st century.\n  My colleague from Connecticut spoke eloquently to many of these \nfactors. I have behind me a chart representing some of the NAEP scores. \nAs you can see, we must do better. Sixty percent of America's \nchildren--at least 60 percent--are below proficient when it comes to \nreading, the very gateway to opportunity and literacy. Seventy-five \npercent of America's children are below proficient in mathematics, the \ngateway to sciences and the hard disciplines.\n  For America's less fortunate children, as the chart behind me \ndemonstrates, the progress we need to make is even more significant if \nthey, too, are to share in the fruits and the bounties that constitute \nthe American dream.\n  I used to be amazed at the number of freshmen entering college, \nparticularly in our 2-year institutions and those that are not the \nflagship sites for our State universities, who, of course, had received \nhigh school diplomas but who had to go back in their first year of \ncollege matriculation to do high school work. Something had broken \ndown. Something wrong had taken place that they received a high school \ndiploma and yet had to go back and do high school work upon entering \ncollege.\n  We are resolved we will do better. Our approach represents not only a \nsignificant break from business as usual when it comes to national \neducation policy; it represents a significantly increased national \ncommitment to the cause of improving America's education system for \nevery child with a significantly stepped up Federal commitment.\n  It is woefully inadequate that only one-half of 1 percent of Federal \ninvestment today goes into our schools. We must do better. Yet we do \nnot want Federal micromanagement or intrusive Federal control. It has \nto be a cooperative effort with State and local communities.\n  That is where our approach embodies what I would like to call the \nsensible center. Let's start with investment. We disagree with those \nwho say no additional resources are necessary because we know we cannot \nexpect our local schools to do the job unless we give them the tools \nwith which to get that job done.\n  Resources. Dollars are an important part of those tools to ensure \nthat they can meet the challenge of giving every child a quality \neducation. But we also disagree with our colleagues who say just more \nmoney is the only thing that needs to be done to meet the challenges in \neducation.\n  Instead, we combine significantly increased Federal investment in \neducation with significant accountability and insistence upon results. \nWe provide for a 50-percent increase every year in title I investment; \na 90-percent increase in investment for professional development, to \nensure that there are qualified, highly motivated teachers in every \nclassroom; a 30-percent increase in investment for innovation, trying \nnew ways to meet the challenges that confront us; and a 50-percent \nincrease in investment for charter schools, magnet schools, and public \nschool choice.\n  We have struck the sensible center: Increased investment, yes, not \njust throwing more dollars on the problem but insisting upon better \neducation for all of America's children.\n\n  Accountability. We have also chosen the sensible center there between \nthose who would have no additional accountability and those who would \nseek micromanagement from Washington, DC.\n  Our approach focuses upon outcomes rather than inputs. We focus upon \nhow much our children can read and write, add and subtract, rather than \njust how Federal dollars happen to be spent. Accountability is one of \nthe linchpins in educational progress. It is at the heart of our \napproach.\n  Streamlining. Some would call it consolidation. Again, we struck the \nsensible center between those who would seek no accountability for the\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\nexpenditure of Federal dollars whatsoever--block grants; that is not \nsomething we support--and those, on the other hand, who would seek \nFederal micromanagement.\n  Ours is the solution for the information age. We get away from an \nindustrial age model in which the Federal Government would seek to find \none or two solutions that work and impose them upon everyone.\n  Instead, in an era of flexibility and speed, to meet the necessity of \nrapid change and innovation, we provide for dollars to be targeted at \nless advantaged students, spent in five broad categories keenly related \nto academic success but then allowing for the flexibility to tailor-\nmake those investments in ways that will be most meaningful and most \nproductive at the local level because every school district across \nAmerica is not exactly alike, and, we, at the Federal level, need to \nrecognize that.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have spoken of the targeting. It is vitally \nimportant. Again, we need to target the additional investment at those \nchildren who are most in need. We provide a factor in our formula that \nwill guarantee that no school district would see their title I funding \ncut. That, too, defines the sensible center.\n  Finally, let me touch upon a couple of other factors.\n  The importance of competition. We rejected the thinking of those who \nwould go to a purely market-based system of vouchers because in a \npurely market-based system there are winners and losers. What of the \nlosers? What of them? We have a national commitment to them to ensure \nthat they, too, get the education they need because it would be a \ntragedy not only for them but for the rest of us if we allowed them to \nfall through the cracks of educational and lifetime opportunity. But at \nthe same time, we embrace the forces of the marketplace in competition \nbecause we know that will provide for more parental choice, greater \ninnovation, and, ultimately, more productivity within the public school \nsystem.\n  So we have provided for the forces of the marketplace while retaining \nthe genius of the public education system, which is a commitment to a \nbetter education not just for the few, not just for those who would \nsucceed competitively in a marketplace but for everyone.\n  Finally, let me say, once again, I am grateful for the progress that \nhas been made. The seeds of progress have been firmly planted. We \ncannot yet tell whether they will bear fruit in this session of \nCongress or in the next. But I thank my colleagues who have brought us \nto this point, both within my own caucus and those on the other side of \nthe aisle. If we are going to make progress on this important subject, \nit will be by working together, not pointing fingers or seeking to \nassign blame.\n\n  So I will conclude by citing some words spoken by Winston Churchill, \nin a moment more dramatic than this, when he said: We have surely not \nreached the end, nor perhaps have we reached the beginning of the end, \nbut at least--at least--we have reached the end of the beginning.\n  So let us begin to make progress for America's schoolchildren. Let us \nagree, on a bipartisan basis, to increase our commitment to their \nacademic future. Let us agree on the importance of accountability, the \nforces of competition within the public school system, and the need for \nprofessional development. Let us agree upon these things.\n  Let us begin to move forward. If we do, it will not only improve the \nfuture for our children and the institutions of academic success across \nour country, but we will also begin to reinstill the confidence and \ntrust of the American people in their ability to govern themselves. And \nthat, perhaps, is the most important beginning of all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will take a second. While the Senator from Indiana \nand the Senator from Connecticut are here, I would like to state that \nthere are ongoing discussions, on a bipartisan basis, to try to see if \nthis can be brought together. While we do not know what the conclusion \nis, the beginning of the end is certainly here. They are fruitful, no \nmatter what happens in the long-term nature of the debate.\n  I compliment both Senators for the effort they have extended to reach \nout, along with Senator Gregg, Senator Gorton, and others, who have \nbeen instrumental in this ongoing work. I commend you to keep at it and \nsee if we cannot come to a resolution.\n  I thank the Senator from North Carolina for giving me a moment to \ncompliment these two Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to deliver my \nremarks seated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair if it is in \norder for me to offer an amendment to the bill under the existing \nunanimous consent agreement? I believe it is not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would not be.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is my understanding. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I genuinely regret that it is not possible for me to \noffer an amendment at the present time, but I do wish to raise an issue \nthat continues to cause confusion and frustration and hard feelings in \nthe schools and in the courts at all levels. It involves an issue that \ndeserves careful consideration by the Senate, and it seldom comes up; \nbut I have made the decision that I am going to bring it up from time \nto time and have the Senate vote on it. All of us should be willing to \nstop pussyfooting and take a stand, unequivocally, clearly and honestly \non the issue of school prayer.\n\n  There is no question about the absurdity of the Senate remaining \nsilent while some judge somewhere says that a high school football team \ncannot even engage in a simple prayer before the whistle blows the \nstart of the game.\n  Equally absurd is the denial of a valedictorian of a high school of \nthe right to include a brief invocation in her remarks. But that sort \nof thing is going on all over the country.\n  I believe Benjamin Franklin and the other patriots, whom we refer to \ntoday as our Founding Fathers, made clear the power of--and the need \nfor--prayer when they met at Philadelphia to set in motion this great \nland of freedom. It is very clear what Benjamin Franklin meant when he \nlectured his fellow colleagues. He said, ``We should close the windows \nand the doors and get down on our knees and pray for guidance.''\n  I have lived a large part of my life believing there should never be \nany limits on the right of public prayer. I never heard of a high \nschool student being debased or deprived of his rights, or having any \nproblem as a result of school prayer. We had prayer every day in every \nschool I attended, and my recollection is that all of us got along \npretty well. No student was ever shot, or raped, or found to have drugs \non his or her person, let alone a gun, in any school that I attended. \nBut then along came Madalyn O'Hair and her crusade against school \nprayer. That was in 1962 when she stirred up a few atheists and \nagnostics, and ultimately some judges, who contrived out of the whole \ncloth a fanciful argument that somebody's rights might be violated if a \nsimple prayer were allowed in school. It was always allowed every day \nin the schools of America until Madalyn O'Hair came along. Since the \nsystematic removal of nearly all aspects of religious expression from \nthe schools, there have been repeated disasters of all kinds, \ncataclysmic things we never believed would happen.\n  From teen crime to teen pregnancy, so many young people are sinking \nin a quicksand of immorality. Would these heartbreaking events have \noccurred if prayer had not been banned from the schools? I don't think \nthey would. When that question is raised, my response is that such \nthings didn't happen before prayers and religion were banned from the \nschools.\n  There is still time to fix this problem. We can restore prayer in \nschool. By the way, the distinguished occupant of the Chair this \nmorning may have recalled that I offered this same amendment I am \ndiscussing right now to the Senate in 1994. It passed overwhelmingly, \nwith 74 other Senators agreeing that a more sensible policy regarding\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\nprayer in schools is essential and necessary. But that amendment was \ngutted--gutted--at the eleventh hour for partisan reasons, which I am \nnot going to get into now. On some occasion, I may describe exactly how \nthat happened.\n  In any event, the amendment I would like to have offered this morning \nallows students to exercise their first amendment prerogative of \nprayer.\n  Under the amendment:\n\n       No funds made available through the Department of Education \n     shall be provided to any State, or local educational agency, \n     that has a policy of denying, or that effectively prevents \n     participation in, prayer permissible under the Constitution \n     in public schools by individuals on a voluntary basis.\n\n  I must say that once more my amendment clearly states that:\n\n       No person shall be required to participate in prayer in a \n     public school.\n\n  If a student doesn't want to pray, he or she, under no circumstances, \nwill be required to do so. Therefore, I regret the parliamentary \nsituation under which the Senate is operating this morning, which \nprevents my calling up this amendment for consideration.\n  Let me say this: I steadfastly believe that any education bill that \ndoes not protect the first amendment rights of students to engage in \nvoluntary prayer is incomplete, and I intend to raise this issue \nsubsequent to this morning as often as it takes until the right to \nvoluntary school prayer is guaranteed once and for all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my amendment, No. 3128, now \nat the desk, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 3128\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. FUNDING CONTINGENT ON RESPECT FOR CONSTITUTIONALLY \n                   PERMISSIBLE SCHOOL PRAYER.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Voluntary School Prayer Protection Act''.\n       (b) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no funds made available through the Department of \n     Education shall be provided to any State, or local \n     educational agency, that has a policy of denying, or that \n     effectively prevents participation in, prayer permissible \n     under the Constitution in public schools by individuals on a \n     voluntary basis.\n       (c) Special Rules.--No person shall be required to \n     participate in prayer in a public school. No State, or local \n     educational agency, shall influence the form or content of \n     any prayer by a student that is permissible under the \n     Constitution in a public school.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, without losing my right to the floor, I \nyield for a moment to my colleague from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for the purposes of a unanimous consent \nrequest, I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from Minnesota, \nthe Senator from Louisiana be recognized next, and then an intervening \nRepublican, and then myself to be the next Democrat, and then Senator \nLincoln be the next Democrat after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think \nI heard it correctly. The Senator from Florida said that following the \nnext Republican he would be in order, and then Senator Lincoln would be \nthe next Democrat following the next Republican; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Senator Landrieu is the first, I will be the next, \nSenator Lincoln would be after myself, with the intervening \nRepublicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The way the Chair understands the unanimous \nconsent request, Senator Wellstone is the present Senator, and then \nSenator Landrieu, and then the Senator said there would be a \nRepublican, and then there would be himself and Senator Lincoln; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the idea would be that these would be the \nnext three Democrats, and if there were Republicans, they would be \nintervening in order to maintain the alternating nature of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object--I will not object--\nhistorically, although we get away from the history, those who are the \nprincipal proponents are generally recognized to make the case before \nopposition speaks. So we have tried to go back and forth. We have done \npretty well. Since there are a number on our side who are prime \nsponsors, generally, as a courtesy, we have followed that historically \nand traditionally. We have gotten away from that.\n  I think the proposal is eminently fair. If it is all right, we might \nlet them go in order to make the presentation, and then I would be glad \nto hear from two or three on the other side. These are all prime \nsponsors. Generally, in order to be able to make the case, I think we \nought to have a chance to hear from them, certainly before the noon \nhour. I ask that we extend the time a bit before going into recess \nbecause I think they ought to be heard in outlining the presentation on \nthe agreement. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I shall be brief because a number of \nSenators are here who want to get the floor. I want to respond briefly \nto Senator Gregg. Then I want to raise one question for Senator \nLieberman. I wanted to speak to his amendment. I thought that was one \nway of being respectful. Then I want some Senators who are sponsoring \nthis amendment, sometime after they make their presentation, to speak \nto the concerns I will raise in a moment.\n  First of all, however, I want to respond to the Senator from New \nHampshire because all of this is a matter of record. The Senator \nbrought out pictures of Governors and talked about when he was \nGovernor. I think that is sort of beside the point. I don't remember \nanybody using such language, and I don't know that anybody implied such \na thing. But I will say that when I talk about grassroots, I kid around \nabout the Governors. People say: Let's hear from the grassroots.\n  Let me give you an example of what I consider grassroots--the \nNational Campaign for Jobs and Income Support. This is a coalition of \nabout 1,000 community groups, including faith-based and neighborhood \norganizations.\n  I had a chance to speak at their gathering in Chicago. Most of them \nare of color, and many are of low- to moderate-income.\n  They just released a study which I think speaks to one of the issues \nhere. This is not, I say to Senator Graham and others, responding to \nhis amendment but in response to Senator Gregg's comments.\n  First of all, when we went through the debate on the welfare bill, I \nheard the discussion about this many times. Those who were for it said \nthey didn't want the bill to be punitive. They talked about child care, \nfood stamps, transportation, and health care. This study was just \nreleased this past weekend by this coalition. The problem, according to \nthe study, is that many States are denying working poor families \nbenefits to which they are legally entitled. That, of course, \nundermines the very incentives that Congress had in mind on behalf of \nthe working poor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article entitled \n``Fair Deal for the Poor'' by E.J. Dionne, Jr. be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Washington Post, May, 2000]\n\n                         Fair Deal for the Poor\n\n                           (E.J. Dionne, Jr.)\n\n       It's fashionable to talk about poor Americans left out of \n     the economic boom. It's not fashionable to do much about \n     their problems.\n       In Congress and on the campaign trail, a favorite pastime \n     for members of both parties is to brag about the welfare \n     reform bill passed in 1996. The bragging is over the sharp \n     drop in the welfare rolls brought about by a prosperity that \n     has created so many new jobs, and also by the bill's tough \n     welfare-to-work provisions.\n       George W. Bush regularly boasts about the decline in \n     Texas's welfare rolls, while Al Gore trumpets his premier \n     role in pushing welfare reform against the wishers of some of \n     the leading voices in his own party.\n       It's hard to oppose the core principle behind the welfare \n     bill: Public assistance should be temporary and the system \n     should help the poor find jobs and pursue independence.\n       But supporters of the bill insisted they weren't just being \n     punitive. They said they wanted benefits--Medicaid, food \n     stamps, child care, transportation assistance and\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\n     children's health insurance--to follow poor people off the \n     rolls and help support them as they found their footing in \n     the workplace. These benefits are especially important to the \n     children of the poor, and no member of Congress likes to look \n     mean to kids.\n       The problem, according to a new study released this past \n     weekend, is that many states are denying the working poor \n     benefits to which they are legally entitled. That undermines \n     the incentives Congress pledged to put in place on behalf of \n     the working poor.\n       ``Even if you're a proponent of welfare reform, you'd be \n     shocked at what's happening,'' says Lissa Bell, policy \n     director of the Seattle-based Northwest Federation of \n     Community Organizations. If the purpose of welfare reform is \n     ``self-sufficiency,'' that idea is ``not being adequately \n     reflected'' in actual administration of the programs, she \n     says.\n       What Bell and her co-author, Carson Strege-Flora, found \n     were many cases of states and localities violating federal \n     rules by imposing waiting periods for programs that are \n     supposed to have none; creating cumbersome application rules \n     to make it hard for eligible people to get benefits; and \n     misinforming the working poor about what help was available \n     to them.\n       Now, if there is good news in any of this, it is that \n     community groups around the nation are organizing to put the \n     cause of the working poor at the center of the national \n     debate. Paradoxically, those who were most critical of the \n     welfare bill when it passed may end up saving welfare reform \n     by insisting that those willing to labor hard for low wages \n     be lifted out of poverty.\n       ``The people who are being denied access to these programs \n     are people who work,'' says Deepak Bhargava, director of the \n     National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support, which \n     sponsored the study. The Campaign is a coalition of about \n     1,000 community groups, including faith-based and \n     neighborhood organizations. ``Its goal is to put poverty back \n     on the national agenda,'' he says.\n       The devolution of power to the states, an idea associated \n     with conservatives, is unleashing a wave of activism by the \n     poor and their supporters. ``The interesting thing about the \n     devolution phenomenon,'' Bhargava says, ``is that it's really \n     put the ball in the court of the community organizations.'' \n     They are demonstrating ``a new level of sophistication about \n     public policy politics.''\n       But in the end, he says, these groups will also look to \n     Washington to make sure states run programs for the working \n     poor by the rules. And Washington will necessarily play a \n     large role in any serious expansion of benefits for those who \n     work but are still trapped in poverty. Universal health care \n     would be a nice place to start.\n       ``Poverty is the great invisible problem in the national \n     discourse,'' Bhargava says. ``. . .There hasn't been much \n     political pressure from the people affected. And the problem \n     is usually defined by the success of welfare reform in \n     getting people off the rolls, as opposed to the failure to \n     make much of a dent in the poverty rate.''\n       This ought to be the most promising of times for programs \n     to alleviate poverty. Public coffers at all levels are \n     bulging, thanks to good economic times. The old welfare \n     system is dead, and most government assistance is now flowing \n     to those who work--meaning that the vast majority of voters \n     approve of the values now embedded in the programs.\n       If we're not willing to do more to help the working poor \n     what does that say about our much-advertised commitment to \n     the value of work? And how devoted are we to that sentiment \n     now roaringly popular on the campaign trail compassion?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I quote from the article:\n\n       ``Even if you're a proponent of welfare reform, you'd be \n     shocked at what's happening,'' says Lissa Bell, policy \n     director of the Seattle-based Northwest Federation of \n     Community Organizations. If the purpose of welfare reform is \n     ``self-sufficiency,'' that idea is ``not being adequately \n     reflected'' in actual administration of the programs, she \n     says.\n       What Bell and her co-author, Carson Strege-Flora, found \n     were many cases of states and localities violating federal \n     rules by imposing waiting periods for programs that are \n     supposed to have none; creating cumbersome application rules \n     to make it hard for eligible people to get benefits, and \n     misinforming the working poor about what help was available \n     to them.\n\n  Here is my point to my colleague, Senator Gregg, and to others. The \npoint is this: There are many fine Governors, but there is a reason why \nover 30 years ago we said there are certain core standards. We used the \nword ``accountability''--a certain core accountability when it comes to \nthe poorest children in the country. And we are not about to support \nlegislation that does away with a commitment to migrant children, a \ncommitment to homeless children, a commitment on the part of the \nFederal Government that says to every State and school district there \nwill be programs that will respond to the special and harsh \ncircumstances of these children's lives. We are not going to leave this \nup to the States because even if there is some abuse and that is all \nthere is, it is too much.\n  That is the point, I say to Senator Gregg.\n  Second, very briefly on the amendment that is before us, I thank my \ncolleagues for their good work. I wanted to express the main concern I \nhave. This is the one provision of this legislation which troubles me.\n  Could I ask my colleagues to shut that door at the top, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sergeant at Arms will restore order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  One of the provisions in this amendment says if there has not been \nadequate progress on the part of title I children--there is a 4-year \nperiod that you look at, and then we do this assessment, and if there \nhas not been adequate progress, then 30 percent of the funds which are \ntitle VI funds, as I understand it, are withheld from these school \ndistricts.\n  I just want to say to my colleagues that I think this is a mistake. I \nthink we should have the assessment. I think we should know. But, as I \nsee it, when you hold back the funds--and I think we can talk about how \nwe may need to have different teachers; we may need to have different \nprincipals, but when we actually cut the funds in a variety of these \ndifferent programs, I think the children are the ones who are paying \nthe price.\n  This is near and dear to my heart. I think this is a mistake.\n  Here is the parallel that I would draw. I have been trying over the \nlast month to come to the floor and say: Look, when we have these high-\nstakes tests for third graders and whether they go on to fourth grade, \nfor God's sake, let's also make sure they have the resources to be able \nto pass these tests and that each of these children has the same \nopportunity to achieve. If we don't do that, I think this will be \npunitive.\n  I don't understand what some of my colleagues are doing. I think it \nis a big mistake to basically say to these schools and these school \ndistricts, especially when I see that they are the ones--I heard this \ndebate this morning. I heard the Senator from Indiana. I thought it was \nkind of interesting. He said, you know, I heard the debate. Is it the \nGovernors' fault or is it not the Governors fault?\n  I think in many ways we are at fault. I think it is pathetic how \nlittle of the National Government budget--I heard anywhere from one-\nhalf of 1 percent to 2 percent of our overall budget--goes to \neducation. I still argue, look, we should be a player for \nprekindergarten, and we are not doing it. It is as if we forgot. It is \nas if we will jump on a bandwagon and get off of it quickly. A year ago \nall of us were talking about the development of the brain. You have to \nget it right by the age of 3. Some of these kids come to school way \nbehind. They fall further behind. Let's get that right. Let's do that.\n\n  We know from all of the research that has been done--whether we like \nit or not--that probably the two most important variables above and \nbeyond a good teacher are the educational attainment and the income \nattainment of families. We are doing precious little, even with all of \nthese surpluses and a booming economy, to change any of these \ncircumstances that would so crucially affect how well children do.\n  The assumption is, if you are not trying hard enough, we are going to \ncut off the money. I think it hurts the kids.\n  I don't mind where Senator Bingaman and others are going on \naccountability. I think there are ways in which we can make it clear \nthat there may have to be some reconstitution in terms of some of the \npersonnel, albeit even there I am a little wary because I don't accept \nthe assumption that the big problem is the teachers aren't trying hard \nenough or the principals are not trying hard enough or there isn't \nenough commitment. But, in any case, I don't like the sanction part. I \nthink that is a big mistake because the kids are the ones who pay the \nprice on this, as I understand this provision.\n  That was one concern I wanted to raise. I want my colleagues to speak \nto it because that is the way this debate should take place.\n  The only other concern I want to register, because there are plenty \nothers who want to speak--some have said don't even raise it because we \ndon't want to get into a big debate about it. But on paraprofessionals, \nI like some of\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\nthe changes that have been made with the language on this. There is \nlanguage that I think says the only way you can hire paraprofessionals \nis to replace paraprofessionals.\n  I know what you are trying to get at, which is we don't want \nparaprofessionals actually doing the teaching. The teachers should be \ndoing the teaching, and we don't want poor school districts to have the \nparaprofessionals who aren't certified and other school districts to \nhave more.\n  On the other hand, it seems to me this may be a little bit too \ninflexible because as long as we make sure the teachers are doing the \nteaching, sometimes additional teaching assistants can make a huge \ndifference in general above and beyond title I.\n  The second point I want to make is if we are going to talk about \nprofessional development for paraprofessionals--this happened, I say to \nSenator Lieberman, about 3 weeks ago. I was back home. Sheila and I \nwent to a gathering of cafeteria workers. We flew halfway across the \nState to be there. Sheila was a teaching assistant 19 years ago when we \nwere married. She dropped out of school to put me through school. All \nthe kids thought she was a librarian; she didn't have a college degree. \nShe was a teaching assistant.\n\n  In addition, there were food service workers, teaching assistants, \ncustodians, and the bus drivers. One of the things they said: We don't \nmind more professional development, and we don't mind saying go back \nand get an associate degree, but please remember, many of us who have \nthese jobs don't have a lot of income. We can't just give up a job to \ngo back to school. We can't just take a sabbatical.\n  We ought to be very careful, as we talk about this for these \nparaprofessionals. If we want them to receive more training, if we want \nthem going back to school, make sure they are able to do so; many can't \nright now.\n  Those are the two questions I raise. I am prepared to yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DODD. I know the sponsors are here. I know there is a limited \namount of time. The sponsors of the amendment want to be heard.\n  I rise to commend Senator Lieberman and the others--Senators Bayh, \nGraham, Lincoln, Landrieu, Bryan, Kohl, Robb, and Breaux--who have \noffered this amendment. I want to commend them on their commitment and \ntheir ideas in working toward the goal before all of us today--\naccelerating the pace of reform in our schools.\n  We have worked hard together on this issue for months, and in some \ncases, for years. Senator Lieberman and I are fortunate to come from \nthe same state, Connecticut, which is a national leader in school \nreform and student achievement and a constant source of ideas for both \nof us--so we have worked together on this issue for some time.\n  And contrary to what some may have heard, there is significant \nagreement among all of us about the direction of federal education \npolicy. As is always the case, we hear more about the planes that don't \nfly and the issues that divide us than the planes that do fly and the \nissues that unite us.\n  Our agreements are many and significant. First and foremost, we all \nagree the status quo is not good enough for our schools, our children, \nour nation, or for us. We agree that the federal government must be a \nleader, a partner and a supporter of local, public schools. We agree \nthat federal dollars and efforts must be targeted on the neediest \nstudents and work to address the achievement gap that plagues too many \nof our schools and communities.\n  Beyond policy goals, we agree on many specifics of this proposal--a \nstrengthened, reform-oriented Title I program; accountability for \nfederal dollars and for progress in increasing student achievement; \npublic school choice; a clear class size authorization; targeting of \ndollars to needy children; and a significant reinvestment in the public \nschools. These are the core issues of the debate before us--and core \nareas of agreement that unite all Democrats.\n  In particular, they unite us against the bill before us, S. 2. A bill \nwhich abandons the federal commitment to needy students, to high \nstandards for all children, and to the goals and progress of school \nreform. We all stand against this vision for America's children.\n  I do, however, differ with my colleagues on the extent of \nconsolidation they propose in their substitute--the other issues can \nand were worked out in our alternative. On consolidation, I believe it \nis appropriate to carefully examine programs and focus our federal \nprograms on areas that demand a national response. I supported many of \nthe provisions of S. 2 which eliminate a significant number of \nprograms--Goals 2000, School to Work--but I cannot go quite as far as \nmy good friends go in their proposal.\n  I think what is lost is that all-important support of local programs \nin areas like after-school, school safety, education technology, \ncharacter education, school readiness, and literacy. The efforts that \nfocus attention, attract dollars and produce results.\n  Let me give you one example that I know well--after-school programs. \nThe 21st Century Community Learning Centers program was created in 1994 \nand was first funded at $750,000 in FY 1995; it has grown to $453 \nmillion in FY 2000. It grew because it is focused on after-school, \nwhich we know is desperately needed, so we funded it, and funded it \nsubstantially. Thousands of grants of significant size flow to needy \nschool districts to support strong, comprehensive after-school \nprograms.\n  The proposal before us would eliminate this strong program and \ninstead have a small portion of the dollars that reach the local level \ngo to support after-school programs. I believe this would not leverage \nchange in this area; it would not attract the dollars needed and it \nwould not meet our goals in as targeted a way. I believe we better \nleverage our dollars through our federal partnership directly with \nlocal schools in these areas than we would through a more generic \nfunding approach such as offered in this bill.\n\n  So I cannot support this substitute today. I want to continue to work \nwith my colleagues on these issues--their ideas have contributed a \ngreat deal to this debate. We made substantial progress putting \ntogether the Democratic Alternative, which we all supported. Our \nschools need many voices, many supporters and I welcome my colleagues \nto these issues, to this debate and ultimately to the effort to better \nserve our children.\n  We have had 25 or 30 hearings over the last year and a half or 2 \nyears on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, trying to get at \nthe very issues and develop consensus. Participation is strongly \nwelcomed. I look forward to an ongoing process.\n  This does not end today, tomorrow, or the next day but will take some \ntime to reach the level of success we want accomplished in our public \neducation environment in this country.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding, and my compliments to the authors.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, briefly, if I may respond to the two \nquestions, and I appreciate the comments of my colleague from \nConnecticut.\n  It has been a pleasure, as always, to work with the Senator and \nothers. We have made progress. I am grateful for his acknowledging \nthat. I am also grateful for his long-time progressive leadership in \nthis whole area of public education. I thank my friend from Minnesota \nfor his kind words about the bill.\n  I respond briefly to the two good and fair questions. We struggled \nwith both of them, particularly the question that if we set up a system \nwhere we give more money for education, and we want to reorient the \nprogram so we are not just arguing about how much money we will send \nor, when the auditors come from Washington, they do not just ask if we \nare spending the money in the particular paths we were told to spend it \nin, but that somebody asks: What is the result? Are the kids educated?\n  That is what we want to see happen, to put teeth into it. We believed \nwe had to reward and punish. We have bonuses for schools and States \nthat do well. How do we have answers without punishing the kids? That \nis a struggle. One answer is that the kids, particularly poor kids, are \ntoo often punished by the status quo because they do not get a good \neducation and they are trapped by income. They have nowhere else to\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\ngo even though their parents clearly want a better way.\n  We have set this out over a period of years and allowed the States \nthemselves to set the standard of adequate, clear progress. We are not \nsetting an absolute standard. We are saying: You set the standard for \neach school district, for each school. The standard is, how much do you \nwant to improve each year from the base, where they are now--not where \nan idealized base might be but where they are now.\n\n  Our first sanction: When a school fails to achieve its adequate clear \nprogress for 2 years, it goes on to a ``troubled\" list and extra money \ncomes in to help the school. If after 4 years it does not get raised--\nthe kids are the victims, they are being punished--at that point, the \nbill says the school system has a choice: Radically restructure the \nschool into a charter school, perhaps, or something similar within the \npublic school system, or close it and give every child and their \nparents the right to go to a higher performing public school in the \ndistrict.\n  Beyond that, if the State continues not to make the adequate yearly \nprogress, the Senator is right, after 3 years they get 50 percent taken \nfrom the State administrative budgets. That was our attempt to impose \npenalties without hitting the kids.\n  Finally, after 4 years, if there is no adequate yearly progress, \nsomething is really wrong, then we take 30 percent of title VI, the \npublic school innovation title. Yes, that reduces some programs that \ncould be enrichment and improvement programs, but at some point we have \nto put teeth in the system to make it work.\n  In no event, I stress to my friend from Minnesota, do we ever take \nany money away from title I for disadvantaged kids. That, we thought, \nwould be unfair. We will not touch the basic program to help \ndisadvantaged kids learn better.\n  I was surprised that in my State of Connecticut when we introduced \nthe bill, the area of the bill that got the most concern was from the \nparaprofessionals themselves who feared we were going to force them to \nget a college degree or put them out of jobs. Our aims are exactly what \nthe Senator has said. I was surprised to learn that 25 percent of title \nI money around the country is spent on paraprofessionals. Some of that \nis very well spent because they supplement what the teacher is doing or \nthey provide nonteaching support for children which can be critical to \nthe child's ability to learn.\n  Our basic aim is what the Senator from Minnesota said. Let's not \nshortchange poor kids by asking paraprofessionals who are not trained \nto be teachers to be their teachers. Suburban schools would not accept \nthat. We shouldn't accept it for our poorest children. Let's try to \nhelp them upgrade themselves. Also, we provide State-adopted \ncertification programs for the paraprofessionals.\n  I hope my answers have been responsive.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, since the Senator was responding to my \nconcerns, I have a couple of comments.\n  First, I absolutely meant to thank the Senator for his effort. I \ndon't want this to be a deal where I love you on the floor and then \nvote against your amendment. I want to make it clear I am thinking it \nthrough before the final vote. I appreciate what the Senator said, but \nI still think it doesn't speak to the concern I am trying to register.\n  For example, if you don't get it right in terms of these kids, then \nyou are going to be cut. The problem is, there are other kids in the \nschools who may not be title I kids but they also need the help. The \nreason for that is title I is funded at the 30-percent level. In \nMinnesota, in St. Paul, when you get to a school that has fewer than 65 \npercent low-income kids, they don't get any of the money. All other \nschools get some of the money. There are a lot of other kids affected \nby cuts in the programs.\n  I am all for putting ``teeth'' into this. Again, I think the Bingaman \namendment goes in the direction of accountability, and he talks about \nreconstitution. There are some definite proposals that do have teeth \nthat say, look, we have to be accountable. I think ultimately it is a \nmistake to have your sanctions and trigger the cuts in what little \nassistance we give. We will end up cutting some of the scant resources \nwe do give to schools which help kids.\n  I do not believe we should do that. I am going to make that point \nagain, especially since I do not think we have in the Congress done \nanywhere close to what we should do to live up to our national vow of \nequal opportunity for every child. I believe this is a mistake. We are \nhurting the wrong people on this.\n  On professional development, again I appreciate the sensitivity of my \ncolleague's response, but I actually was saying one other point, which \nwas I still think we can make it crystal clear. The Senator has the \nteachers doing the teaching when they should be doing the teaching, but \nI do not understand why we have such an inflexible requirement that the \nonly additional paraprofessionals hired would be hired to replace \nparaprofessionals. Some school districts say they need additional \nassistants who can help them do more one-on-one work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Connecticut \nfor his leadership on this issue, and I also commend my colleague from \nIndiana, whose insights as a former governor have been invaluable. A \ngroup of us have joined with them to call for a change in the role the \nFederal government plays in its partnership with our States and local \ngovernments in the area of education.\n  Before I begin, I would also compliment our great colleague from the \nState of Massachusetts for his leadership over the years --actually \nover the decades and throughout his entire lifetime --for being a \ntireless champion for education, particularly the education of children \nwho are poor, children out of the mainstream, and children who are \ndisabled. I thank him for his leadership.\n  There is a growing number of us in Congress who feel the need to \nstand up and say no to maintaining the status quo; that the status quo, \nwhile there is some incremental progress across the board in education, \nis not enough, is not happening quickly enough, and is leaving behind \nmillions and millions of children, many of whom are least equipped with \nresources and families to help to educate them.\n  As I said a few weeks ago, in 1965, when the Federal Government first \nstepped up to the plate, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as \nsigned by President Johnson, was 32 pages long and contained 5 \nprograms. Today, the current law is 1,000 pages long--1,000 pages of \ninstructions, prescriptions, unfunded mandates and micromanagement from \nthe Federal level. It contains over 50 programs, 10 of which are not \neven funded.\n  At that time, the world of education was much different. In 1930, \nthere were 260,000 elementary and secondary schools. Today, there are \n89,000. Schools were smaller. Children were given more individual \nattention. Despite the tremendous increase in population, one can see \nthe numbers of schools have declined.\n  Years ago, there were qualified teachers in the classrooms, because, \nto be very honest, while teaching was and still is wonderful, the fact \nis, laws, customs, and traditions barred many exceptional women and \nexceptional minorities from any other line of work. So the profession \nof teaching was the great beneficiary.\n  Today, that is no longer the case. Women and minorities are moving \ninto different fields. Our schools have become larger and the demands \non teachers have become greater. As a result we have less qualified \nindividuals attracted to the field of teaching when the need for high \nquality teachers is even greater than ever before.\n  Years ago--and not that long ago--school violence meant a fist fight \non the school playground. Today, unfortunately, it means a loaded \nautomatic weapon in a cafeteria. The use of drugs in schools is \nincreasing. A lot has changed in education over the last 35 years.\n  People say the prize belongs to those who are the quickest, the \nswiftest, and the smartest. I think the prize belongs to people most \nable to adapt to change, and that is really the argument. It is about \nchange. It is about the status quo not working for the vast majority\n\n[[Page S3642]]\n\nof our children. It is about the fact the world has changed. The facts \nsupporting public education have changed. Yet we find ourselves in \nCongress, at least too much to my mind, arguing for more of the same: \nmore programs and more money, not recognizing these fundamental shifts \nthat have occurred.\n  The prize belongs not always to the swiftest and the smartest, but \nthose most able to change. The Lieberman-Bayh amendment is about \nchanging these 1,000 pages to give more flexibility to local \ngovernments to make better decisions about how to reach the children \nwho need to be reached. It is about targeting the money to needy kids. \nWhen the first bill was passed by this Congress and signed by President \nJohnson, the intention was excellent, to bridge the gap between the \nadvantaged and the disadvantaged. The intention was to use Federal \ndollars to invest in the education of poor children. This intention has \nbeen lost in these 1,000 pages. Under the present title I formula, a \nschool need only have 2% of their children in poverty to be eligible \nfor title I funding. As a result, 1 in 5 schools with between 50% and \n75% poverty receive no funding at all. Our formula would do what Title \nI funding was intended to do, serve poor children.\n\n  Our amendment, the Three R's proposal, is about increasing \nflexibility and accountability at the local level. If we try to provide \nmore flexibility to the States, but we also do not provide, along with \nthat accountability, increased investments, at best it is an unfunded \nmandate, at worst it is a hollow promise.\n  We are actually doubling the funding, as the Senator from Connecticut \nhas pointed out, for title I and targeting the money to be sure the new \nmoney is getting to the poor children, the disadvantaged children, and \nthe children for whom we need to close the educational gaps. Along with \nthe increased funding comes real accountability. The taxpayers will \nappreciate the fact we are not just dumping more money into a growing \nproblem, but we are securing our investment in education and rewarding \nstates who make real strides in closing the achievement gaps are closed \nquickly and in a more appropriate fashion.\n  Senator Bayh made reference to these numbers but did not focus on the \nspecifics of this chart. I believe it is important for the American \npeople to know the reason some of us refuse to accept the status quo. \nMr. President, I am sure you will agree that test scores are quite \nstartling; they are quite troubling.\n  This chart shows, the performance scores of several minorities on the \n1996 NAEP. One will notice that under the status quo, under these 1,000 \npages, while there have been some improvements, only 26 percent of the \nwhite children are proficient level in math, only 8 percent of Native \nAmericans, 7 percent of Latinos, and 5 percent of African American \nchildren.\n  If we are not satisfied with these numbers--which I am not, and I do \nnot think there are many in this Chamber on the Republican or \nDemocratic side who are satisfied with these numbers--we need to do \nsomething different. Funding more programs with more money is not going \nto work.\n  In response to something Senator Kennedy said--and I think he is \naccurate on this one point--money from the Federal Government \nrepresents only 7 percent. If these test scores are what is happening \nwith 92 percent of the funding, then let's not continue to do the same \nthings or give it all to the Governors. He is absolutely correct.\n  Obviously, the money is not targeted to help these kids increase \ntheir student performance; the State dollars, the 92 percent, is not \ntargeted, because if it was, these numbers would be improving \nsignificantly. The answer is not to sit by and do nothing; the answer \nis to lead by example. Let the Federal Government begin by taking its 7 \npercent and targeting the poor children so these test scores can \nimprove, and we hope the States, the Governors, and the local education \nauthorities will take their money and do the same thing so we can \nimprove these test scores.\n  This next chart shows the eighth grade math scores: 23 percent of all \nchildren, at the eighth grade level, are scoring at the proficient \nlevel; only 4 percent of African Americans; 8 percent of Latinos; 14 \npercent of Native Americans; and 30 percent of the Caucasian children.\n  But I would like to do more than show you the numbers. Here is a \nchart showing an excerpt from the recent NAEP writing test. I have \nheard too much on this floor that you cannot test kids, that the tests \nare too high stakes. I want to share this with you so you can \nunderstand how dire this situation is. I am a strong believer in tests. \nI believe we have to have some objective measure to see how well our \nchildren are doing or how poorly they are doing.\n  Perhaps the tests should not serve as 100 percent of what we use to \njudge whether a child should be moved forward or not, but clearly, we \nhave to have, as well as parents and taxpayers have to have, some way \nto judge if the children are doing well or not.\n  For those who say we cannot test them, let me just read from a real \ntest. This is from a fourth grader whose writing is rated \n``unsatisfactory.'' I am going to read it for you because you can \nhardly interpret it. But this represents what the National Assessment \nof Educational Progress rates as ``unsatisfactory.'' This was written \nby a fourth grader. He was asked to communicate a minimal description \nof his room. He writes:\n\n       My room is very cool it white I got wester picture I got a \n     king sides bed I have wester toys I got wester wall paper on \n     my wall. I got wester t-shirt on my wall. I got\n\n  That is a writing sample of a fourth grader whose writing was rated \n``unsatisfactory.''\n  Let me give you a sample of writing that is rated as ``approaching \nbasic'' for a child in the fourth grade. This would be at a minimum. \nAll States are different, but these are the kinds of tests we are \ntalking about supporting in this amendment. This fourth grader is \n``approaching basic,'' is not at ``basic'' yet. But this fourth grader \nwrites:\n\n       there to the left is my jeep and my cat. there to the right \n     is my swimming pool and my dog and my waterguns. And to my \n     left of my bed is my trampoline and maid. And by the wall is \n     my roller blades and my nantendo--\n\n  spelled N-A-N-T-E-N-D-O--\n\n       60 four.\n\n  These two samples represent the writing skills of over 50% of those \nin public schools. 50% of these kids can't master spelling or \nformulating sentences. We have to do better than this in our public \nschools.\n  So I just want to argue that life is high stakes. We have to be \nsupportive of tests--not a Federal test, not something mandated from \nWashington--but we have to be about accountability, about real testing, \nso we can tell whether our children are reading, whether they are able \nto compute. We have to be able to identify what schools are not \nperforming, not so we can punish the children or punish the parents, \nbut so we can help them.\n  In conclusion, let me say, again, times have changed. The status quo \nis not sufficient. The amendment we have outlined, the Three R's, gives \ngreater investment, greater accountability, greater flexibility, and \nmore choice. Hopefully, it will spur greater outcomes faster so that \nchildren do not lose the only opportunity they have--one life, one \nchance at education--so they can graduate with a diploma that means \nsomething and go on to have a job, a career, and build a life they can \nbe proud of in the greatest democracy on the face of the Earth. To do \nany less is falling down on our job.\n  No system is perfect. I will only conclude by saying that perhaps the \namendment we offer is not perfect, but it is offered with great \nsensitivity and great commitment and great dedication, to urge both \nsides to try to move away from the rhetoric and move to recognizing the \nfailings of the current system.\n\n  We do not want to abandon public schools and move to total block \ngrants or total vouchers, but we want to move to a bill that creates \nthe right kind of partnership, where kids can learn, parents are happy, \ntaxpayers are happy to give money because the system is working, \nteachers are feeling fulfilled--most importantly, children are \nlearning. That is what our amendment attempts to do.\n  I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, with all due \nrespect to the other issues that have been talked about, to adopt our \namendment, to move us in a new direction, away from the status quo, to \na chance where children can actually learn to read, to\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\nwrite, and to compute, and to take advantage of the tremendous, \nunprecedented, historic opportunities that exist in the world today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for \nher insightful remarks, and particularly with regard to what is too \ncommon, where our schools are not performing and our students are not \nperforming at the level at which they need to perform.\n  We have a responsibility to make sure what we do in this body \nfacilitates improvement in the system we have today--a system that has \nbeen in place for 35 years and is producing the kind of results that \nhave been shown.\n  This is certainly a time for review and change, for altering and \nimproving. To suggest we cannot do that is beyond credibility. We \nabsolutely can improve what we are doing. We need to. We have to make \nsure that what the Federal Government does is a positive event with \nregard to actual learning in the classroom--which is what this is all \nabout--and not a negative impact on learning in the classroom.\n  In a minute, I am going to share some examples of a Federal law that \nis absolutely undermining the ability of local school systems to \neducate, to create a learning environment where kids can reach their \nmaximum potential. Wouldn't it be awful if we passed a law in \nWashington that actually made it more difficult to create a learning \nenvironment in the classrooms of America? The truth is, we have. We \nneed to change that.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from Louisiana said about testing. \nThere are limits to what testing can show, but when you test thousands \nand thousands of kids all over a State, you can know whether or not \nthose kids are basically performing at the grade level at which they \nought to be performing. We can learn that from a test.\n\n  I do not believe in a Federal test. That would be the Federal \nGovernment saying to the 50 States, that provide 94 percent of all the \nmoney for education in America: This is what your students must learn. \nIf they don't pass this Federal test, they are not learning adequately, \nand therefore we have in Washington this school board of 100 Senators \nwho would have to decide what is important and crucial in America.\n  I do not believe in that. I think that would be against our history. \nIt would be against the policy of this Nation since its founding \nbecause schools have been a State and local instrumentality. The \nFederal Government has only been able to assist marginally. In some \nways, we have contributed to its downfall in undermining education.\n  The test scores are important. Over a large number of people--not for \nevery child--they give us very accurate indications of whether learning \nis occurring. I support that. In fact, I have been on the Education \nCommittee a little over 1 year. We have many debates about \naccountability. Our friends on the other side of the aisle say: We need \nmore accountability. Your plan, Sessions--this idea of turning more of \nthe money over to the schools so they can use it as they see fit within \ntheir system--lacks accountability.\n  But I say to you, the present system totally lacks accountability. \nThe system that has been proposed by the Members on this side has \nabsolutely the kind of accountability that should be part of an \neducation bill.\n  For example, we have approximately 700-plus education programs in \nAmerica. Do you think that is not true? Would you dispute that with me? \nWe have over 700 education programs in America, according to the \nGeneral Accounting Office. Isn't that stunning? If a school system \nwants some money out of a program, they have to have a lawyer and a \ngrant-writing expert just to find out where the money is and how it \nmight be available to them. Many of these programs are ineffective and \nshould not be continued.\n  We have all of these programs. What our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle are saying, too often, is--I don't think my friend from \nLouisiana is saying this, perhaps--if you don't have strict rules about \nhow this money is spent, and you can only spend it for a specific \nthing, you don't have accountability.\n  What do we have today in America? We have the Federal Government \nspending billions of dollars on education. We are pouring that money \ninto schools right and left, and many of the school systems have a \ntotal inability to create a proper learning environment, and education \nand learning is not occurring.\n  Is that accountability? They may be following all the paperwork and \nspending the money just as they said, but the fundamental question of \neducation is learning. If learning is not occurring, then we are not \nhaving accountability, are we?\n  What this program says to every school system in America--at least \nthe 15 that choose it, and perhaps others in different ways, but 15 \nStates in this country, if they choose it, would be able to have a \nsubstantial increase in their flexibility to use Federal money, with \nless paperwork, less rules, and less complaints about how they handle \nit. The only thing they would be asked to do is to create a testing \nsystem and an accountability system in their school system that can \ndetermine at the beginning of the year where children are academically, \nand go to the end of the year and see if they have improved.\n  What else are we here about? What is education about if not learning? \nThat is the only thing that counts. That is the product of all of our \nefforts. It is not how many teachers, how many buildings, how many \ntextbooks, or how many football fields they have. The question is, Is \nlearning occurring? This way we would have that. The school systems \nwould basically say to the Federal Government: Give us a chance. You \ngive us this money and let us run with it. Let us create a learning \nenvironment we think is effective. Give us a chance and we will put our \nnecks on the line. We tell you we are going to increase learning in the \nclassroom and we are going to have an objective test to show whether or \nnot we are doing it. If we don't do it, we will go back under all your \nrules and paperwork.\n  There is a myth here, and some have denigrated the role of Governors. \nBut I don't know a Governor in America who isn't running for office and \npromising to lead and do better in education.\n  I see the Senator from Georgia. Do we have a time problem?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We are under a little bit of a constraint.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will finish up soon.\n  In Alabama, our general fund budget, where all the funds are \nappropriated, is $1.2 billion. The education budget in Alabama is \nalmost $4 billion. Do you hear that? In Alabama, we spent almost $4 \nbillion on education and $1 billion on everything else. Do you think \nthe Governor isn't concerned about that? Do you think the State \nlegislature is not concerned about that? The primary function of State \ngovernment in Alabama, and in every State in America, is education. \nThat is where the responsibility needs to be, and that is where we need \nto empower them to use creative ideas to improve the system.\n  I have offered an amendment on the subject of special education; IDEA \nregulations are disrupting our classrooms. We have examples in our \nState of two people bringing a gun to school and one being put back in \nthe classroom because he is a special student. The other was kicked out \nfor the year as is every other student. We have created a separate rule \nof law, a separate rule of discipline, by a Federal mandate from \nWashington, in every schoolroom in America.\n  I have been in 15 schools this year in Alabama. This is one of the \ntop concerns I hear from teachers and principals everywhere. They are \nconcerned about that. I think I will talk about that later. I talked \nabout it previously. I will also talk about this regulation, this \nFederal mandate, that is clearly not a help to the States but a major \ndetriment. It is bigger and stronger and more burdensome than most \npeople in this country have any idea. I think we need to talk about it \nmore.\n\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, to clarify the sequence of events, we \nhad a unanimous consent agreement that recognized Senators back and \nforth. We got off of it. I am going to suggest this.\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\n I have talked to the Senator from Florida, and we will hear from \nSenator Collins for a few minutes, then Senator Graham, then a \nRepublican, and then Senator Lincoln. Then we will be back in order.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, are we going to break at 12:30?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think we will try to accommodate \nanother 5 or 10 minutes so these Senators can be heard. I think the \nappropriate recognition would now be the Senator from Maine, briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida. I rise \nto commend the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from Florida, the \nSenator from Arkansas, the Senator from Louisiana, and all of those who \nhave been involved in putting together the Lieberman amendment, for \ntheir efforts. It is a typical approach taken by the Senator from \nConnecticut to so many legislative issues, in that he is looking for a \nresponsible and responsive approach that is innovative and attempts to \nbridge the partisan gap.\n  I don't support all of the provisions of the Lieberman amendment, but \nI commend the Senator and his cosponsors for recognizing that we do \nneed to take a new approach, that we need to focus on whether or not \nour students are learning, rather than focusing on whether paperwork \nand regulations are complied with.\n  I commend the authors of this legislation for their efforts to focus \nthe debate on giving States and local school boards more flexibility in \nusing Federal funds to meet the greatest need in their communities. I \nalso commend them for focusing on accountability, for making sure our \nFederal education efforts bear the fruit of increased student \nachievement, and help to narrow the gap that troubles all of us in the \nlearning of poor children versus those from more affluent communities \nand affluent families.\n  One of the reasons we need more flexibility in using Federal funds \ncan be found in Maine's experience under two Federal programs. Maine is \nfortunate in having small classes. In the classes in Maine, on average, \nthe ratio is only 15 to 1.\n  So our problem and challenge is not class size. Yet Maine had to get \na waiver to use the Federal class size reduction moneys for \nprofessional development which is, in many schools in Maine, a far \ngreater need than the reduction of class size. One school board chair, \nfrom a small town in eastern Maine, wrote to me that they have received \n$6,000 under the Federal Class Size Reduction Program. Clearly, that is \nnot enough to hire a teacher. They did receive permission from the \nFederal Government to use that effectively for professional \ndevelopment.\n  But my point is, why should this school system, or the State of \nMaine, have to get permission from the Federal Government to use those \nfunds for the vital need of professional development?\n  The second example I have discussed previously, and it has to do with \nMaine's effort to narrow the achievement gap between poor and more \nwealthy students in high schools. Maine has done an outstanding job--\nand I am proud of this--in narrowing the achievement gap between \ndisadvantaged and more advantaged children in the elementary schools. \nIn fact, it has virtually disappeared. So that is not the need under \ntitle I funds for the State of Maine right now. We still, however, have \na considerable gap when those title I children get to high school.\n  Maine came up with a very promising approach that was put out by the \nMaine Commission on Secondary Education that set forth a plan for \nnarrowing the achievement gap among high school students. But, here \nagain, it required a waiver from Federal regulations for Maine to use \nits funding for this purpose.\n  So, again, I do think we need more flexibility and accountability. I \ncommend my friends on the other side of the aisle for their steps in \nthat direction. I hope we can continue to work and see if it is \npossible for us to come up with a bipartisan package we could support \nthat would help bridge the partisan gap and make a real difference in \nthe futures of our students.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with the consent of my friend, Senator \nCoverdell, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \nscheduled vote at 2:15 there be 2\\1/2\\ hours remaining for debate on \nthe Lieberman amendment, to be equally divided in the usual form, and \nthat following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to \nvote in relation to the pending amendment without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Maine for her \nvery thoughtful remarks. She focused on the large issues that are \nappropriate for the Senate, and she spoke in the spirit of the \nimportance of what we are dealing with, the future of American \nchildren, and the necessity that we approach it with a level of \nseriousness and bipartisanship. I thank her for her very succinct, \nextremely valuable contribution to this debate.\n  In that same vein, I wish to share an observation that some of us \nheard recently by a prominent American historian, Steven Ambrose. He is \nbest known for his numerous books on military history, particularly on \nWorld War II, but he has also written a Pulitzer prize-winning book on \nthe Lewis and Clark Expedition--an expedition which opened up much of \nAmerica to serious study and exploration. It was an expedition that \ntook place between 1804 and 1806. It comprised traversing some 7,600 \nmiles of the recently acquired Louisiana Purchase in the northwest \ncorner of the United States. What Mr. Ambrose pointed out is that the \naverage length of each day of the Lewis and Clark Expedition was 15 \nmiles. But the techniques used by Lewis and Clark between 1804 and 1806 \nwere exactly the techniques that Julius Caesar would have used if he \nhad the same assignment, which is to say that for a period of over \n2,000 years their had been virtually no progress in man's mastery of \nthe field of transportation. Since Lewis and Clark, in less than 200 \nyears, we have had an explosion of transportation advancement. We are \nnow in the process of building in space an international space station \nwhich will become the platform for which we will explore the universe.\n  That is how much progress we have made in 200 years after 2,000 years \nor more of stagnation. What is the explanation? What has happened that \nlast allowed us to make this much progress?\n  According to this eminent historian, the single most significant fact \nthat has allowed the 200 years of progress has been the fact that we \ncommitted ourselves as a nation--and much of the world--to the \nproposition of universal education; that we are allowing, for the first \ntime in the history of mankind and in the last 200 years of America, \nhopefully, every human to reach their full potential.\n  He used the example of the Wright brothers. If the Wright brothers \nhad been born 100 years earlier--just four generations earlier than in \nfact they were born--by all accounts, given the nature of their family \nand its economic and social standing, both of the Wright brothers would \nhave been illiterate, and therefore the world would have been denied \nthe ingenuity which played such a critical part in all of these great \nadvancements which now benefit all of us.\n  We are not talking about a trivial issue. We are talking about a \nfundamental issue that has reshaped America and reshaped the world in \nthe last two centuries, and which will reshape us again in this new \n21st century and the centuries beyond. We are dealing with one of the \nmost basic issues facing the world and America.\n\n  I am pleased that the Senate's new Democrats, with much of the \nmembership having spoken on the floor this morning, have taken on this \nissue as our first contribution to the policy today in the Senate. That \nis, I hope, illustrative of the seriousness of our group and its desire \nto be a constructive part of helping the Senate and the American people \ndevelop policy in basic areas such as education.\n  I think we would all agree that there are certain important \nprinciples that\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\nwe should look at as we approach what the Federal role should be in \neducation. Those would include words such as ``accountability,'' \n``reward,'' ``excellence,'' and ``resources.''\n  On February 5, I asked a group of Florida educators to meet together \nin Tampa to discuss what they believe, based on their professional \nexperience, to be some of the priorities the Congress should look at as \nit reauthorizes the fundamental education act for our Nation, the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Here are some of the responses from this group of educators.\n  First, not necessarily in priority on their points, was the \nimportance of additional resources; that if we are going to achieve our \npurposes, we must have a Federal commitment as well as a State and \nlocal commitment which is commensurate to the challenge that is before \nus.\n  The RRR response to this request: It will increase the Federal role \nin education by more than $30 billion over the next 5 years, the most \nsignificant increase in funding since the program was established in \n1965.\n  To underscore the importance of this, we talked about the \nimplications of this chart. This chart is an attempt to indicate what \nhas happened in America over the last 150 years in terms of the \nrequirements for self-sufficiency by an older adolescent or young adult \nin America.\n  In 1850, there was a relatively limited amount of knowledge required \nto be self-sufficient. Literacy was not such a requirement. Many \nAmericans functioned very effectively at a high level of self-\nsufficiency without being able to read or write in 1850.\n  Today, there has been a four-time explosion in the requirements of \nknowledge for an American to be self-sufficient. That explosion has not \nbeen a straight line. It has been an explosion driven by technology. \nNote the major increase in the knowledge demands that occurred in the \nlate and early 20th century commensurate with the movement of America \nfrom a rural economy to an industrial economy. But the big increase has \ncome well within our lifetime.\n  Coincidentally, it almost starts at the time the first Elementary and \nSecondary Act was passed in the mid-sixties with an explosion of \nknowledge requirements as Americans entering the workforce had \nsignificantly greater expectations of what their skill level would be, \nparticularly in areas of mathematics and communication skills.\n  Mr. President, the second aspect of this chart is an attempt to \nindicate that one of the fundamental relationships in the acquisition \nof knowledge by Americans has been the relationship between what the \nfamily can contribute to that knowledge and what is provided by a \nformal educational institution, which we typically refer to as a \nschool.\n  In the 1850s, the family provided more than half of the knowledge of \ntheir children. Typically, they were doing so by educating the children \nto be able to read and write to achieve that level of literacy.\n  It was the development of science and technology that began to effect \nthe relationship of what a family and what a school was expected to \nprovide to children's education. As science and technology has become \nmore pervasive and more complex, the relative proportion of knowledge \nprovided by the school and that which could be provided by the typical \nfamily has altered.\n  Whereas, in 1850 the family was providing two-thirds of the \neducation, today the school is providing about two-thirds of the \neducation.\n  The significance to me of this chart is the challenge that we as a \nsociety have to assure that all American children have an opportunity \nto acquire this much greater level of education; that our schools which \nare being called upon to provide a larger and larger share have the \nnecessary resources--human resources, financial resources, and \nresources of support by the community--in order to carry out their \nresponsibility.\n  We are going to be voting shortly on some major trade agreements with \nCaribbean countries--Central American countries, African countries, and \nChina. One of the recurring realities of all of those trade agreements \nis that we are opening our markets broader and broader to countries \nwhose standard of living and whose per capita annual incomes are \ndramatically lower by factors of 20, 30, 40 times what they are in the \nUnited States.\n  The only way the United States is going to be able to compete and \nmaintain our standard of living is to assure that all Americans are \ngetting this level of knowledge so that they can be full participants \nin the most effective and most competitive economy in the world--the \neconomy of the United States of America.\n  Again, this chart underscores the seriousness of the issue we are \nconsidering.\n  We spent a good deal of time at that Tampa meeting with educators \ndiscussing this chart and its implications. The educators told me in \naddition to resources, they wanted more flexibility, the opportunity to \nadapt to the specific needs of the communities and the children they \nserve. That is the approach taken in the RRR program. We focus on \nresults more than process and, thus, allow more flexibility to achieve \nthose results. The educators said they don't mind accountability if \nthere are resources there to realistically achieve the goals that have \nbeen sought. RRR demands accountability but provides the resources \nneeded to accomplish these goals.\n  Not only do we increase the total amount of resources by some $30 \nbillion over 5 years, we also target these resources to the children \nwho are most in need. When President Johnson talked about America's \nrole in education, he was specifically talking about the chasm that \nexisted between the abilities of poor children and more advantaged \nchildren to achieve what would be required to be competitive in the \nworld.\n  The Federal role has been targeted at these at-risk children. We need \nto refocus our commitment. I am sorry to say there has been a tendency \nfor the formulas that distribute Federal education money to succumb to \nthe temptation to have everybody get some piece of the Federal dollar. \nThe consequence of that is the funds have been so diluted we have been \nunable to focus a sufficient quantity on those children who need it the \nmost and who are most dependent upon that additional Federal support in \norder to be able to achieve their educational needs.\n  Our very focused and stated position in the RRR legislation is that \nwe believe, as a nation, this Congress needs to recommit ourselves to \nthe proposition that the purpose of Federal assistance is to aid those \nchildren who are most at risk and that we should demonstrate that \ncommitment by having a formula that targets the money to those children \nwho are greatest in need. With that, we can then talk seriously about \naccountability.\n  The Senator from Alabama talked about what I call process or product \naccountability where we count the number of books in the library. There \nare other forms of accountability that assess overall student \nperformance. The type of accountability we are advocating is an \naccountability that focuses on what the school and what the local \neducational agency can do to contribute to a student's educational \nattainment. It is what I describe as a value-added approach. How much \ndid the school experience add to the educational development of the \nchild?\n  I have been very critical of the educational assessment program which \nis currently being used by my State, by the State of Florida. The basis \nof my criticism is it does not assess the value added by schools; \nrather, it is an assessment of the total influences that have affected \na student's performance. The most fundamental of those influences has \nnothing to do with what the school contributed but, rather, relates to \nthe socioeconomic status of the family from which the child came.\n  I spoke on an earlier date and submitted for the Congressional Record \na very thoughtful analysis of the Florida plan by a professor at \nFlorida State University, Dr. Walter Tshinkel. In that assessment, Dr. \nTshinkel took the schools in Leon County, FL, which is the county of \nwhich Tallahassee, the State capital, is the county seat, and observed \nthat if you looked at the affluence and poverty statistics of the \nvarious neighborhoods in Tallahassee and Leon County and assigned a \nletter grade based on that data alone without testing a single student, \nthat 26 of the\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\n33 school districts in the Leon County School District would have \nreceived exactly the same grade as they did when student test scores \nwere taken into account.\n\n  That says to me what we have been essentially testing in Florida is \nnot what the school contributes, but the socioeconomic status of the \nchildren who come into that school.\n  Professor Tshinkel went on to say if, in fact, you did assess on \nvalue added, what the school had contributed, you had almost a reversal \nof results. Schools that got F's actually should have gotten A's \nbecause they did the most to advance the students for which they had \nresponsibility, and the schools that got A's should have gotten F's \nbecause they started with a very advantaged group of students and did \nnot make that great of a contribution to their educational advancement.\n  RRR provides accountability for what the schools can be held \naccountable for, what they can reasonably contribute to a student's \ndevelopment and hence a student's performance.\n  Another topic discussed at our Tampa roundtable was professional \ndevelopment. It was very helpful that most of those who participated \nwere current classroom teachers. These teachers are yearning for new \navenues for professional development, for the time to be able to take \nadvantage of these opportunities. The RRR will allow this to happen \nwith a major new national focus on seeing that all of our teachers--\nthose who are entering the profession and those who are at an advanced \nposition as professional educators--have an opportunity to continue \ntheir professional development and enhancement. We can only do this in \na comprehensive manner.\n  We believe strongly these principles are a key to achieving the \nchallenge that America faces to provide the knowledge necessary for all \nAmericans to be able to compete effectively in this rapidly changing \nworld in which we live.\n  If this line on the chart of the increased need for knowledge to be \nself-sufficient in the world as it exists today is a harbinger of where \nthat line would go in the 21st century, the challenge for American \neducation and the challenge for this Congress to be responsive to the \nFederal role in education is a stunningly great challenge that requires \nthe most serious attention of the Senate.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have contributed to this debate, who \nhave worked to bring forward to the Senate a proposal I believe is \nworthy of our task. Every 6 years we have a chance to analyze the \nprograms that affect American children, from kindergarten to the 12th \ngrade. This should be an opportunity not just to tinker around the \nedges, not just to make minor course corrections, but to look at the \nchallenge we face to assure all American children, particularly those \nwho enter the classroom with the least advantages, will have an \nopportunity to be successful, and through their success to contribute \nto the success of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3646-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. I also would like to thank \nall of my colleagues who have worked so diligently on these issues, and \nparticularly Senator Lieberman and Senator Bayh who I have been working \nalongside on the proposal that is before us right now. I also would \nlike to compliment Senator Kennedy's staff for all the work they have \nput in, as well as the wonderful bipartisan spirit that has been shown \nby Senators Gregg, Collins, Gorton, and Hutchinson in trying to bring \nabout this issue of great importance on behalf of our Nation and on \nbehalf of our children.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues on the floor today to talk about a \nbold, new education plan that we hope will provide a way out of the \ncurrent stalemate over reauthorizing ESEA. I must admit that I am \ndisappointed because so far we have turned one of the most important \nissues we will debate this year into yet another partisan standoff.\n  I can't tell you how frustrated I am that we face the real \npossibility that our children will be forced once again to the back of \nthe bus while partisan politics drive the legislative process off a \ncliff.\n  I would like to focus on a comment that was made by one of my \ncolleagues earlier in this debate. Senator Landrieu mentioned that we \nhad one chance at reaching each of these individual children in our \nNation who are the greatest blessings in this world.\n  Each year we fall behind in making the revolutionary changes to move \nour educational system to where it needs to be in order to provide our \nchildren with the source of education they need in order to meet the \nchallenges of the coming century. Each year that we fail to do that--if \nthat happens this year--is one year in a child's life that we cannot \nreplace; one year in a child's life that cannot be reproduced or given \nback to them in terms of what they need to know to be competitive.\n  If I have learned one thing since my first campaign for Congress in \n1992, it\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\nis that when voters send you to Washington to represent them they mean \nbusiness. They expect leadership and they want results, and rightly so \nbecause they deserve it.\n  As parents, we certainly all understand one of the things that we \nwill fight the hardest for, and that is benefits for our children.\n  The American people want us to get serious about educating our \nchildren in new and innovative ways that will allow them to learn and \nmeet the challenges of the future.\n  I firmly believe we have a responsibility to pass a reauthorization \nbill this year that will improve public education for all children. \nThat means working together until we reach an agreement a majority on \nboth sides can support. Waiting to see what happens in the next \nelection should not be an option.\n  Last week, I supported one alternative to S. 2 offered by Senator \nDaschle. It didn't contain everything I wanted, but after I and other \nMembers expressed some initial concerns, we reached an agreement that \nreflected my key priorities on accountability, public school choice and \nteacher quality. Every Senator on this side of the aisle supported that \nproposal, but we didn't get one Republican vote.\n  At the same time, I don't know any Member on our side who is prepared \nto support the underlying bill that the President has indicated he will \nveto unless substantial changes are made. So it is clear that both \nsides have to give some ground in this debate if we have any chance of \ncrafting a compromise proposal that the President will sign into law.\n  The Three R's amendment we proposed today helps bridge the gap on \nboth sides of the debate over the role of the federal government in \npublic education. Our bill synthesizes the best ideas of both parties, \nI believe, into a whole new approach to national education policy.\n  It contains three crucial elements to improve public education--tough \naccountability standards to ensure students are learning core academic \nsubjects, a significant increase in federal resources to help schools \nmeet new performance goals, and more flexibility at the local level to \nallow school districts to meet their most pressing needs.\n  Essentially, under our proposal, the federal government would \nconcentrate less on rules and requirements and focus instead, on what I \nknow every Member of this body can and will support--higher academic \nachievement for every student.\n  In addition to being smart national policy, the Three R's proposal \nwould dramatically improve education in my home state of Arkansas.\n  As I noted earlier, the RRR bill significantly increases the Federal \ninvestment in our public schools and carefully targets those additional \ndollars where they are needed the most. We, as a moderate group, find \nourselves in an unusual position of trying to change the law to \nactually enforce the original intent of that law--title I funds \nactually being targeted to the schools and to the students who need \nthose resources the most. There is no doubt that we can only be as \nstrong as our weakest link. That is why it is essential that in those \npoor school districts we make sure title I dollars actually get to \nwhere they were intended to go.\n  Statistics consistently demonstrate that, on average, children who \nattend low-income schools lag behind students from more affluent \nneighborhoods.\n  This is certainly true in Arkansas where the most recent test results \nindicate that students in the economically prosperous northwest region \nof the state outperform students in the impoverished Delta. These \nresults also indicate that the disparity in student achievement between \nminority and non-minority students in Arkansas continues. It proves \nthat in the past several decades we have not been eliminating the gap \nand disparity between haves and have nots.\n  I believe strongly that every child deserves a high-quality education \nand that the federal government has a right to expect more from our \nnation's schools. But we also have a responsibility to give public \nschools the resources they need to be successful.\n  The ``Three R's'' acronym can also apply to our efforts to improve \nteacher quality. In fact, this plan can best be summed up by Four R's: \nrecruiting, retention, resources, and above all, respecting our \nteachers.\n  The difficulty schools experience today in recruiting and retaining \nquality teachers is one of the most enormous obstacles facing our \neducation system.\n  In my State of Arkansas, somewhere around 30 percent or more of our \nteachers are under the age of 40. We are going to hit a brick wall \neventually as our teachers begin to retire with no more younger \nteachers in our school systems.\n  If we do not provide the funds in order to make sure that teacher \nimprovement and quality and retention are there, we will not have the \nteachers. We cannot expect students to be successful if they don't work \nwith quality teachers. We can't expect quality teachers to stay in the \nprofession if they don't get adequate training, resources, or respect.\n  In our bill, we include a 100-percent increase in funding for \nprofessional development for teachers. I think that is absolutely \nessential in supporting our educators for them to be able to provide \nfor our students. That is why I believe we in Congress must do our best \nto help schools meet the challenges we are setting forth today.\n  Most experts agree teacher quality is as important as any other \nfactor in raising student achievement. The amendment we are debating \nwould consolidate several teacher training initiatives into a single \nformula grant program for improving the quality of public school \nteachers, principals, and administrators. This proposal would increase \nprofessional development funding by more than 100 percent, to $1.6 \nbillion annually, and target that funding to the neediest school \ndistricts. In my home State of Arkansas, this will mean an additional \n$12 million for teacher quality initiatives. In my book, that is \nputting your money where your mouth is.\n  In addition, the RRR would give State and school districts more \nflexibility to design effective teacher recruitment and professional \ndevelopment initiatives to meet their specific needs. No two school \ndistricts are alike, and there is no one size fits all for the school \ndistricts of this country.\n  One overreaching goal we propose today is to require all teachers be \nfully qualified by 2005. Even the best teachers cannot teach what they \ndon't know or haven't learned themselves. To be successful, we must \nwork harder to reduce out-of-field teaching and require educators to \npass rigorous, State-developed content assessments in the subject they \nteach, not a Federal test but those that are designed by the State.\n\n  I have the highest respect for the teachers, principals, and \nsuperintendents who dedicate their talent and skills every day to \nprepare our children for tomorrow. I think they have some of the \nhardest and most important jobs in the world. Our Nation's future, in \nlarge part, depends on the work they do. We should be reinforcing them. \nOur teacher quality proposal is an example of how, by combining the \nconcept of increased funding, targeting flexibility, and \naccountability, we can join with States and local educators to give our \nchildren a high-quality education.\n  There is much more to say today about this approach of the amendment \nof Senator Lieberman and Senator Bayh that Members such as myself have \nsponsored. I know there are others who want to speak.\n  Before I close, I truly think this is the question we must ask \nourselves: What, honestly, is the best thing for our children in this \ncountry? I say to my colleagues, if you want accountability from local \nschools, our proposal has it. If you want more targeted, effective \nnational investment, take a look at the amendment that was produced by \nSenator Lieberman. Do we want more qualified, better trained teachers, \ninvesting in their professional development, with flexibility at the \nlocal level? Do you want higher minority student retention rates, which \nshould be the objective of all Members? We have those answers in this \namendment and in our bill.\n  We have one chance at producing something on behalf of our most \ntreasured blessing in all this world, our children. Please, colleagues, \nlet's don't lose that chance. Let's not disappoint our children in this \ncountry and, more importantly, the future of this country. Let's put \nparty politics aside. I think\n\n[[Page S3648]]\n\nthe RRR in the Lieberman-Bayh proposal is the right approach to improve \nstudent achievement in every classroom.\n  I thank my colleagues for their involvement in this amendment and \ncertainly in this debate. More importantly, I encourage all Members to \nremember what it is we are here to do and who, more importantly, we are \nhere to do it on behalf of, our children.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself a moment.\n  I commend my friend from Arkansas. The Senator from Arkansas has a \nvaried and wide agenda of public policy issues. I think all Members in \nthe Senate know the issue of teacher quality and recruitment and also \nhow to get quality teachers in rural areas and underserved areas. That \nhas been an area of great specialization. Those who had the alternative \nhave benefited from her knowledge, including Senator Lieberman, as well \nfrom her energy in these particular needs and by the very sound \njudgment of her positive suggestions. I thank the Senator. She has \nplaced the important aspect of education on her agenda and we have \nbenefited from her interaction and her recommendations.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Bunning.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent the principal author of the \namendment be recognized for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln, not \nonly for a superb statement on behalf of this amendment but for the \nwork the Senator has done as we developed the proposal, for the \npractical experience and common sense she brought, specifically for her \ngenuine advocacy for children, particularly rural poor children.\n  I thank the Senator for that and for her excellent statement.\n  I ask that Senator Feinstein of California be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this brings to double figures the \ncosponsors. We now have 10 cosponsors. We are proud to have the Senator \nfrom California with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, we have been debating the future of the \nFederal role in education. Specifically, we are looking at who will \ntake the lead role in educating our children. Will it be the Federal \nbureaucrats in Washington, DC, or will it be the teachers and parents \nwho are closer to the children and understand their needs better?\n  Last week, President Clinton went on an education tour that I think \ncan answer those questions. His tour took him to four cities: \nDavenport, IA; St. Paul, MN; Columbus, OH; and Owensboro, in my home \nState of Kentucky.\n  That is, we think the President visited Owensboro. I am one \nKentuckian who is not sure the President ever made it there. The \nPresident's web site has something of a travelogue on his trip, the \nsupposed trip the President made, that says President Clinton's school \nreform tour started in Owensboro, KY. Look closer and one will notice \nsomething is wrong. Apparently, Owensboro is not in Kentucky anymore. \nIn fact, it looks like Kentucky isn't Kentucky anymore; it has moved to \nTennessee. I find this terribly interesting.\n  We Kentuckians have nothing against Tennessee except, of course, when \nthe Wildcats are playing the Volunteers. We like Owensboro in Kentucky, \nright where it is.\n\n  While he was in Owensboro, if that is where he really was, the \nPresident spoke about his Federal programs that require States to spend \nFederal money on Washington's priorities. The President thinks this is \na good approach. When I look at the President's map that approach \ntroubles me, and it is not just because the White House cannot tell \nKentucky from Tennessee. If you will notice, western Kentucky is no \nlonger there; it has been annexed by Illinois: No more Paducah, no more \nMayfield, no more Murray.\n  I have some good news for my friends down there, and I have some good \nfriends down there who have sent me word that they want to stay in \nKentucky. I wonder if they know this administration sold them off to \nIllinois. The truth is, some of us do not know where President Clinton \nwas for sure. We know we have newspaper stories and video clips which \nreport that he was seen in Owensboro plain as day.\n  But, on the other hand, we have the Federal Government, the source of \nall wisdom, which the President would have us entrust with the \neducation of our children, telling us the President and the entire city \nof Owensboro, KY, is actually in Tennessee.\n  I trust the teachers and the parents in Owensboro, KY, with the \neducation of their children. They know what is what.\n  When presented with a choice between handing over control of their \nchildren's education to the Federal bureaucracy in Washington, DC, or \nletting those decisions be made by someone who personally knows the \nnames of those children, I trust they will make the right choice.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I will, after I have finished.\n  This administration says they care for the children in Owensboro, KY, \nbut they do not even know their names. Parents and teachers know their \nnames and the needs of their children and students. I trust them. As \nthe Senate continues this debate on this education bill, I urge my \ncolleagues to support education policies that truly return power to the \npeople and away from the Federal bureaucracy.\n  Of course, it is very obvious there is one new Federal program \nneeded, a program that is desperately needed--a geography class for \nthis White House--because, quite literally, this administration cannot \nquite find Owensboro, KY, on the map.\n  Now I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I will take 2 \nminutes. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I had the pleasure of talking with the President of the United States \non Wednesday evening after he came back from his trip. He told me about \nthe school in Owensboro. I want to just give the assurance to the \nSenate that he told me it is one of the schools with the highest number \nof children receiving nutrition programs, which defines the \ndisadvantaged children. They have a superb literacy program. They had \nsmall class size. They had a great emphasis on teacher training. It \nmoved from one of the lower level schools, in terms of academic \nachievement, up to one of the top ones in Kentucky.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. BUNNING. That is very accurate. It is also accurate, there are \nvery many other schools, not only in Owensboro but down along the \nborder at Williamsburg and throughout many counties in Kentucky that \nhave improved their educational facilities.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on my time, I welcome that fact. I think \nit is worthwhile to take note about what has been happening in \nOwensboro and to try to share that kind of success story, which the \nPresident of the United States was extremely impressed with and quite \nwilling to talk about. I have the notes back in my office about the \npercentage of progress that was made.\n  What he was talking about was well trained teachers, smaller class \nsize, and support programs for children who are in need. Those are \nconcepts we have tried to have in this program. I know we have some \ndifferences on that, but I wanted any reference to the President's trip \nto Owensboro also to relate the quality and very strong improvement in \nthe education he witnessed down there. I think it is worthwhile taking \nnote. We all ought to know what works and be encouraged by it.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I would like to conclude by saying a former colleague of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts is a little struck also, Senator Wendell \nFord, because Owensboro happens to be his hometown. It is definitely in \nKentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if there are no supporters of the bill, \nI would like to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I understood we would go back and forth.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I think I represent those in opposition. If the Senator \nis in support of the amendment, then I believe he is right.\n  Mr. REED. I would like to speak about the amendment, not necessarily \nin support but speak about the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to object. I thought we might be going back and \nforth on this. If the Senator is on a particular schedule, I will ask \nthe Senator from Rhode Island to withhold, but he indicated to me a \npreference.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be glad to yield 5 minutes on the other side's time \nand be happy to follow that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, then, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Senator Frist, Senator Kennedy, and \nSenator Jeffords.\n  I commend Senator Lieberman and his colleagues for presenting a very \nthoughtful and principled alternative to discuss today. There are \nelements in this legislation which I support enthusiastically, and then \nthere are other elements I do not accept and have great questions \nabout. But the proposal of Senator Lieberman along with colleagues \nunderscores some critical points.\n  First of all, they underscore that the approach of S. 2--simply \ntransferring money with very limited and ambiguous accountability \nprovisions of the State--is not the way to reform accountability. Also, \nthey recognized there is a legitimate State and local partnership that \ncould be maintained and should be maintained, particularly in the \ncontext of title I.\n  They are also advocating a greater investment in education. That is \nsomething I know I agree with and I know many, if not all, of my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side passionately agree with. Also, they \nadvocate greater targeting of these funds into those low-income schools \nthat need more assistance and, in fact, represent probably the best \nexample why unconstrained State and local policy sometimes leads to bad \noutcomes.\n  If you look at the funding and the performance of schools in urban \nareas and low-income rural areas, you will see the combination of the \nproperty tax and local policies will lead to results, to outcomes we do \nnot want. We at the Federal level have the opportunity and the \nresources to help a bit, at least, to change that outcome. Also, it \nrecognizes the importance of class size reduction and school choice. \nAll of these are very important.\n  In addition, it recognizes very strongly the notion and the need for \naccountability. Senator Bingaman has offered an amendment. He worked on \nthis measure, not just in this Congress but in the preceding \nreauthorization. I joined him in that work as a Member of the other \nbody. This provision is an important one. It is not part of the \nLieberman proposal. I think it is something we should emphasize.\n  I do, though, disagree with the approach they are taking to \nconsolidate certain programs because one of the issues with \nconsolidation is that you tend to lose both the focal point and also we \ntypically design specific targeted programs to do those things which \nStates are unwilling to do or are not doing at the same level of \nresources which are necessary to accomplish a national purpose.\n  We can see examples throughout our policies. School libraries, I use, \ninevitably, to point out the fact that back in 1965 we did have direct \nFederal resources going to help collections of school libraries. In \n1981 we rolled them into a consolidated block grant approach, and, \nfrankly, if you spoke to school librarians, they would point out the \nstatus of their collections, which are very poor, with out-of-date \nbooks, and they would also say how difficult it is to get any real \nresources from the localities or States. Frankly, that is the type of \nacquisition they can always put off until next year and next year, and \nbefore you know it, it is 5 and 10 years and these books are out of \ndate.\n  I believe, too, the proposal the Senator from Connecticut and his \ncolleagues are advancing does not recognize some of the other \nchallenges facing our schools. The fact is, we do need to help the \nStates and localities, apparently, to fix crumbling schools. One of the \nthings I hear repeatedly from the other side is the wisdom of State and \nlocal Governors about public education. If that is the case, why are \nthere so many decrepit school buildings throughout our country? Why are \nthere so many children going to schools to which we would be, frankly, \nembarrassed to send children? It is not because people are either \nignorant or evil at these local levels. It is because when you have a \nlimited tax base, when you have many other priorities, when most of the \nlocal budgets are consumed by personnel costs, it is awfully difficult \nwithout some outside help--i.e., Federal help--to do certain things. \nOne of them, apparently, is to ensure that school buildings are \nmaintained at a level where we would not be embarrassed to send \nchildren.\n\n  There are schools in Rhode Island that are over 100 years old. They \nare crumbling. They need help. Every time I go into these communities, \nI do not have local school committee people and mayors saying: Go away; \ntake your terrible, terrible Federal rules and regulations away from \nus. I have them imploring me: Can you help us get some resources from \nthe Federal Government to fix up our schools? That is the reality, not \nthe rhetoric and mumbo jumbo about big education bureaucrats and \neverything else. There is potential in the Lieberman amendment. \nUnfortunately, this aspect of putting all these programs together \ndefeats the purpose.\n  I have two other quick points.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I request 1 more minute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and the \nSenator from Tennessee for their graciousness.\n  I commend them particularly for bringing up the issue of increased \nresources and targeting. One of the ironies is, we who have been doing \nthis over the last few years fought through the last reauthorization. \nTargeting of resources of title I programs is intensely divisive \npolitically. Particularly Members of the other body do not want to see \ntheir allocation in title I funds decreased, even if they represent \nfairly affluent communities. It is one thing to talk about targeting, \nbut it is something else to have the political will to engage in that. \nI tried it in 1994, along with others. We made moderate success. I \nwould be happy to join the battle of targeting again, but I would be \nremiss if I did not point out the real challenges of getting a bill \nsuch as this through both Houses of the Congress.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his graciousness, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Tennessee 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Lieberman \namendment, although let me say right up front that there are several \nprinciples that are underscored in the amendment in which I believe \nwholeheartedly and that are reflected in the underlying bill to \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The whole idea \nof being able to collapse programs into a manageable number and the \nemphasis on student achievement are two concepts which are very \nimportant as we look forward to how best to educate the current and \nfuture generations of children in areas in which we are failing.\n  I remain very concerned, though, with the specifics of the Lieberman \namendment in terms of the formula, the impact it has on a number of \ndistricts in Tennessee. The focus on teachers, which I believe is \nappropriate, in terms of it being critical that we develop an \nopportunity for every child to be in a classroom with an excellent \nquality teacher is an important one, although maintaining this whole \napproach of 100,000 teachers and dictating that from above is something \nI simply cannot support.\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\n  We just voted on an amendment which I believe directs us in a much \nbetter, more optimistic, potentially more beneficial direction, and \nthat is empowering teachers, attracting teachers, and recruiting \nteachers through the alternative certification process in that \namendment. Careers to Classrooms is what it is called.\n  We have not had the opportunity to adequately explain the importance \nof this now-accepted amendment, but it is important to understand and \nfor us to spend a few minutes on it because it does underscore the \nimportance of having high-quality teachers, attracting teachers, \nkeeping them in that position because of the demographics and the shift \nwe are going to see in teachers and retiring teachers.\n  This careers-to-classrooms approach complements what is in the \nunderlying bill, that part of the bill that applies to teachers and is \ncalled the Teacher Empowerment Act. I have worked carefully and closely \nwith Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas in crafting this careers-\nto-classroom aspect of the bill.\n  As we look forward, it is important to understand the importance of \nthat high-quality person, not just a person at the head of the \nclassroom, but that high-quality teacher.\n  This aspect of the bill expands the national activities section of \nthe underlying bill to allow additional funds for States that want, \nthat wish, that choose to attract new people into the teaching \nprofession through what is called an alternative certification process.\n  We have all heard about the impending teacher shortage. It is \nsomething that has been discussed on the floor. It is something that \nAmericans today do understand. The Department of Education estimates we \nwill need about 2.2 million new teachers over the next decade. That 2.2 \nmillion is necessary for two reasons: No. 1, because of enrollment \nincreases and, No. 2, to offset the large number of teachers, the so-\ncalled baby boomer teachers, who will be retiring over the next several \nyears.\n  It is interesting to note that the severe shortages tend to be in \nareas that are either the most urban or the most rural. Even more \ninteresting is if you look at the alternative certification processes \nthat have been in effect, for example, in New Jersey, where there has \nbeen such a program for 15 years, it is in those most urban areas and \nthose most rural areas that the alternative certification process has \nhad the most beneficial and the most powerful impact. The underlying \nfocus in the bill, made stronger by this amendment, is that it is not \nonly numbers of teachers but, indeed, it is the quality of those \nteachers we have in the classrooms.\n  This amendment, and now the bill, directs resources to strengthen and \nimprove teacher quality. There is a professor at the University of \nTennessee whose name is William Sanders. He pioneered this concept of a \nvalue-added system of measuring the effectiveness of a teacher. His \nresearch clearly demonstrates that it is teacher quality more than any \nother variable that can be isolated, including class size, including \ndemographics, that affects student achievement. He says the following:\n\n       When kids have ineffective teachers, they never recover.\n\n  At the University of Rochester, Eric Hanushek has said, and I begin \nthe quotation:\n\n       The difference between a good and a bad teacher can be a \n     full level of achievement in a single year.\n\n  The research of the importance of the quality of the teacher goes on \nand on. Again, as the statistics have shown, we have 12th grade \nstudents in the United States ranking near the bottom of international \ncomparisons in math and science; where today most companies that are \nlooking for future employees dismiss the value of a high school \ndiploma; where we know that high school graduates are twice as likely \nto be unemployed as college graduates.\n  The statistics go on and on. No longer can we afford as a society to \nhave this increasingly illiterate population continue.\n  It comes back to having a good quality teacher in the classroom, and \ntoday too many teachers in America lack proper preparation in the \nsubjects they teach. Tennessee, my State, actually does a pretty good \njob overall, I believe, because they say a teacher has to have at least \na major or a minor in the subject they are going to teach. Therefore, \nwhen we have these gradings of States on how well they do, we always \nget an A in this category of having a major or a minor.\n  Even in Tennessee, 64 percent of teachers teaching physical science \ndo not have a minor in the subject. Among history teachers, nearly 50 \npercent did not major or minor in history. Other States do much worse.\n\n  Mr. President, 56 percent of those teaching physics and chemistry, 53 \npercent of those teaching history, 33 percent of those teaching math do \nnot have a major or minor in the field they teach. We know this content \nis critically important to the quality of that teacher.\n  In closing, let me again say what this amendment does. It seeks to \nposition a State, if they so wish, to have as good an opportunity as \npossible to recruit teachers. It actually helps States to recruit \nstudents and professionals into the teaching profession if they have \nnot been in the teaching profession--both top-quality students who have \nmajored in academic subjects as well as midcareer professionals who \nhave special expertise in core subject areas. We want teachers teaching \nmath to have majored or have an understanding of the content of math. \nWe want teachers teaching science who have majored in and truly love \nscience. It makes for a better teacher.\n  What this amendment does is help draw students and professionals into \nteaching, attracting a new group, a new pool of people into the field \nof teaching, different kinds of people, all through this alternative \ncertification process.\n  We all know it is hard today, among our graduates, to attract the \nvery best into teaching, given the barriers that are there, given the \ntraditional certification process. Through this amendment Senator \nHutchison and I have drafted, we provide resources to States that wish \nto offer these alternative certification programs to help them \nestablish such new programs to recruit students, professionals, and \nothers, into the teaching profession.\n  I am very excited that this amendment has strengthened the underlying \nbill. These alternative certification stipends will help provide a \nseamless transition for students and professionals who make that \nchange, that movement from school or careers, and embark upon a new \ncareer in teaching.\n  Shortly, this afternoon, Senator Hutchison will come down and \nelaborate on this particular program. Again, I am very proud to be a \npart of helping this new generation of teachers and future teachers \naddress the problems we all know exist in our education system today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if we go into a quorum call, is the time \nequally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to equally \ndivide it. Is the Senator requesting unanimous consent?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes under the time \nallotted to the manager of the bill on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to be opposing the amendment \noffered by my colleague, Senator Lieberman. He, I know, has thought a \ngreat deal about education issues. I admire his commitment to \neducation. But we come at this from slightly different perspectives.\n  I want to speak not so much about the amendment that is before us but \na bit more about the underlying issue that brings us to this \nintersection of the debate on this bill.\n  We know that in this country the education system needs some repair\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\nand adjustment. I happen to think many schools in this country perform \nvery well. As I have said before on the floor of this Senate, I go into \na lot of classrooms, as do many of my colleagues. I challenge anyone to \ngo into these classrooms and come out of that classroom and say: Gee, \nthat was not a good teacher. I have deep respect and high regard for \nmost of the teachers I have had the opportunity to watch in the \nclassrooms in this country.\n  But there is almost a boast here in the Senate by some that we do not \nwant to have any national aspirations or goals for our education \nsystem. I do not know why people do that. Our elementary and secondary \neducation system is run by local school boards and the State \nlegislatures. That is as it should be.\n  No one is proposing that we transfer control of school systems to the \nfederal government. But we are saying that, as a country, as taxpayers, \nas parents, as a nation, we ought to have some basic goals of what we \nexpect to get out of these schools. Yet there are people who almost \nbrag that we have no aspirations at all as a country with respect to \nour education system.\n  I would like to aspire to certain goals of achievement by our schools \nand by our kids across this country, so I am going to later offer an \namendment, part of which is embodied in the Bingaman amendment, dealing \nwith accountability, saying that every parent, every taxpayer ought to \nget a report card on their local school. We get report cards on \nstudents, but we ought to get a report card on how our schools are \ndoing. It is one thing to tell the parents the child is failing. We \ncertainly ought to know that as parents. But what if the school is \nfailing? Let's have a report card on schools, so parents, taxpayers, \nand people in every State around this country can understand how their \nschool is doing compared to other schools, compared to other States.\n  The issue of block granting, with all due respect, I think is ``block \nheaded.'' Block granting is a way of deciding: Let's spend the money, \nbut let's not choose. We know there are needs, for example, for school \nmodernization.\n  I heard a speaker the other day at an issues retreat I attended who \nmade an appropriate point that I know has been made here before. Not \nmany years ago, we had a debate in the Senate about prisons and jails. \nSome of the same folks who stand up in this Chamber and say, we cannot \ncommit any Federal money to improve America's schools, were saying, we \nwant to commit Federal money to help State and local governments \nimprove their jails.\n  Why is it the Federal Government's responsibility to help improve \njails and prisons for local government, but when it comes to improving \nschools, we say that is not our responsibility? I do not understand \nthat. Jails and prisons take priority over schools? I do not think so. \nIt seems to me there is a contradiction here.\n  All of us have been to school districts all over this country. We \nhave seen young children walk into classrooms we know are in desperate \nneed of remodeling and repair. Some of them are 40, 50, 60, 80 years \nold. I was in one the other day that was 90 years old. The school is in \ndesperate disrepair, and the school district has no money with which to \nrepair it. What are we going to do about that?\n  Are we going to say those kids don't matter? Are we going to say that \nwe are going to commit Federal dollars to education, but we don't want \nto know where those dollars are going? Are we going to say we don't \nwant to direct funding to deal with the issues we know are important, \nsuch as school renovation and repair or decreasing class size by adding \nmore teachers? Are we going to say we don't want to reach some sort of \nnational goals because we are worried someone will mistake that for \nFederal control of local schools?\n  Hear it from me. I do not think we ought to try to have Federal \ncontrol of local schools. The school boards and State legislatures do \njust fine, thank you; but there are areas where we can help, and school \nmodernization is one of them. We were perfectly willing to jump in and \nrenovate prisons and jails for State and local governments, but now it \ncomes to schools and we say, no, that is not our job. It is our job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Schools are certainly more important than prisons and \njails when it comes to the subject of renovation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. We are awaiting \nSenators either on that side or on this side. I will withhold when they \narrive. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I have heard the Senator from North Dakota speak to this issue about \nthe General Accounting Office report that estimates we have about $110 \nbillion worth of modernization or rehabilitation of schools. Is the \nSenator familiar with that report?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I sure am. The GAO reported about the disrepair of \nschools, on Indian reservations, in inner cities, all across the \ncountry. You go to poor school districts that don't have a large tax \nbase, and you find that we are sending kids into classrooms in poor \nshape. We can do better than that. The GAO documents that very \ncarefully in study after study. We must, as a nation, begin to make \ninvestments in our schools.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator not agree with me that we tell \nchildren every single day that education is important, a high priority, \nthe future of our country depends upon it, your future is essential to \nthe meaning of this country and what this country is going to be \nthroughout the world? What kind of message does the Senator think a \nchild gets who goes to a school that has windows open in the \nwintertime, an insufficient heating system, or a dilapidated electrical \nsystem so they can't plug in computers? What kind of subtle message \ndoes the Senator think that sends to the child where, on the one hand, \nwe say it is important to get a good education, but on the other hand \nthe child goes to a crumbling school, whether it is in the urban or \nrural areas, or Indian reservations?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The message is pretty clear. We talk about education, but \nthen if the schools are in disrepair and adults do not seem to care \nabout it, students feel that education and they themselves do not \nmatter. I toured a school about a week ago with 150 kids. It had two \nbathrooms and one water fountain. It was in terrible disrepair.\n  The teacher said, ``Children, is there anything you would like to ask \nSenator Dorgan?'' One of the little kids who was in about the third \ngrade raised his hand and said, ``Yes. How many bathrooms does the \nWhite House have?'' Do you know why he asked that? I think it was \nbecause that is an issue in their school. They have long lines to wait \nto go to the bathroom--150 kids and two bathrooms. Why is that the \ncase? Because these kids are sent to an old school. The school district \nhas no tax base. When we send them through the classroom door, we \ncannot, as Americans, be proud of that school. We must do better than \nthat.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his comments. I agree with them \n100 percent. We will have an opportunity to consider this in amendment \nform. Senator Harkin intends to address this issue in an amendment \nlater in this debate--hopefully soon, if we can move along on some of \nour votes.\n  Again, as the good Senator has mentioned, what we are trying to do is \ntarget scarce resources on problems that we know exist, and with scarce \nresources we can make a difference that is going to enhance academic \nachievement. I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending \nLieberman amendment. Senator Lieberman is a friend of mine, and I know \nhe has spent a lot of time with many colleagues trying to put together \na substitute that could have bipartisan agreement. I think the \nSenator's amendment does make some good attempts, but there are \nconcerns that will also force me to vote against his amendment.\n  I think the amendment is overly prescriptive. The reason I feel so \nstrongly about this is that the amendment we just passed--Senator \nLott's amendment--which included my and Senator Frist's careers-to-\nclassroom provision--the whole purpose of that is to give more \nflexibility. I think what we are doing is drawing the bright red line\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\nbetween the philosophy of what the Democrats are hoping to do and what \nthe Republicans are hoping to do. The Republicans are trying to \nwithdraw a lot of the redtape that we hear complained about by teachers \neverywhere we go in our States. When I go to a town hall meeting, in an \nurban or rural area, they complain about the redtape and the \nregulations that keep them from being able to do the job they want to \ndo, which is to teach children in the classroom.\n  I think Senator Lieberman's amendment fails to provide the \nflexibility and the accountability for our States and public schools, \nwhich really is the hallmark of the bill that is before us today. I am \nconcerned about the revised formula for title I. I am concerned because \ntitle I will take millions of dollars from many of the rural and other \nschools in Texas and across America.\n  While I certainly understand the goal of providing money for low-\nincome schools, I don't think it should come at the expense of our \nNation's rural schools. They also have a great need, and oftentimes \nthey lack the resources to give the quality education they need and \nwant for their children.\n  I am also concerned about the provision in the Lieberman substitute \nthat effectively requires certification for teachers' aides and other \nparaprofessionals. I think this is something best left to the States \nand the local districts. In fact, to go back to the amendment we just \npassed, Senator Frist and I have been working, along with Senator \nGraham from Florida, on a different concept that goes away from the \novercertification issue and says we want professionals in the \nclassroom, and we want to encourage school districts to put \nprofessionals in the classroom, even if they didn't major in education \nin college.\n  Now, I have to take a step back and say that I am very proud that my \nalma mater, the University of Texas, is actually beginning to do some \ntesting on education degrees to see if we can focus more on the area of \nexpertise that is going to be taught in the classroom and less on the \n``how to make lesson plans'' part of the education degree. So far the \ntests have been very positive of the students who have gone more in the \narea of expertise for which they are going to be the teachers and less \ninto the ``how to be a teacher''--not that you do away with that \nbecause it is important; but you lessen the focus on that and go more \nfor the actual expertise that is going to be transferred to the \nchildren in the classroom. That is the exact concept of the careers-to-\nclassroom amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator Frist and myself.\n  It is very similar to what Senator Bob Graham and I had worked on as \nwell. Basically, it says to the midlevel professional who may be \nlooking for a career change or who may be retiring because they have \ndone well in their field, we want you to come into the classroom and \ngive the benefit of our knowledge and expertise to children who are in \nschools that have teacher shortages or are in rural areas.\n  Here is an example. A friend of mine majored in French in college and \ntaught French in private schools. She moved to a small school district \nin Greenville, TX. They wanted to offer French in Greenville High \nSchool. She wanted to teach it, but she didn't have a teacher \ncertification. So she was not able to be put into the classroom in \nGreenville High School, and the students in that high school were \ndeprived of that option because she was not certified.\n  Now, what she did--because she wanted to do this so much--she \ncommuted 30 miles to the nearest teacher college and she eventually got \nher certification; but it took her several years because she was also \nraising children. During that period, those children who wanted to take \nFrench could not have that option at Greenville High School.\n  I think that is wrong. I don't want her to have to jump through that \nmany hoops in order to give a great opportunity to that school district \nthat they otherwise would not have. So our careers-to-classroom \nprovision takes rural schools and schools that have teacher shortages \nand matches them with people who have professional expertise--\nespecially in the fields of math, science, and languages. We can \nenhance education to a greater degree if we have qualified teachers.\n  We give encouragement. We give authorization for funding for school \ndistricts that will give alternative certification, which is expedited \ncertification to these teachers who want to go into the classroom and \nhelp enrich the experience that our children will have all over our \ncountry.\n  We hear a lot on the Senate floor about the need to hire more \nteachers and reduce class size. There is a growing problem in America.\n  It has been estimated by the National Council on Education Statistics \nthat the United States will need an additional 2 million teachers in \npublic schools over the next decade. During the 1970s and 1980s, the \nAmerican school age population grew at a relatively slow rate. But \nincreased immigration and the new baby boomers have turned these \nnumbers around. In 1997, a record 52.2 million students entered our \nNation's public schools. Between 1998 and 2008, the population of \nsecondary schools is going to increase an additional 11 percent. This \nis most pressing in our inner cities and rural communities.\n  We are trying to address these concerns by giving more flexibility \nand taking away some of these disincentives to get good professionals \ninto the classrooms. I think our amendment, which has been agreed to by \nthe Senate, is a better concept than the Lieberman approach, or Senator \nKennedy's approach, which I think have the effect of putting more \nrestrictions and more redtape in the system.\n  I think we have tried the other way. While I believe Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Lieberman are very sincere in wanting better public \neducation, I think we diverge on how we get there. I think we have \ntried the ``everything emanates from Washington'' approach to get \nFederal funding. I think now we ought to try something new. Let's try \ngiving States flexibility by putting the money into the classroom where \nit does the most good rather than building up the Federal bureaucracy \nthat has the effect of retarding the ability to be creative. Let's have \nthe capability to put more teachers in to fill the teacher shortage \nwith qualified teachers as well.\n\n  I want to end by saying that I believe in public education. I am a \ntotal product of public education. I know that is what makes America \ndifferent from other countries in the world because we don't say to \ncertain people: you will get a good education but other people in \nsociety will not have the same opportunity.\n  We have said in America that we want every child to reach his or her \nfull potential with a public education. We want every child to have a \nchoice. Many children choose private education. I support that, too. \nBut it is our responsibility to have public education for children who \ncannot afford a private education or who do not want that kind of \nexperience to be able to succeed and be the best with that public \neducation.\n  The underlying bill and the Lott-Gregg-Hutchison-Frist amendment \ngives the tools to our country to create the public education system of \nexcellence that is required to keep America a meritocracy and not an \naristocracy.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume from the amendment. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and \ncolleague from Texas for her thoughtful statement. I would like to \nrespond to it.\n  It is interesting in this debate how common the usage of terms is on \nboth sides. You have to really get down into the details.\n  The Senator from Texas talked about her support of flexibility for \nschool systems at the local level. That is a centerpiece of the \namendment that is now before the Senate, which is to consolidate a \nwhole series of current Federal categorical grant education programs \nand give the local school systems some flexibility in the use of that \nmoney. But I think the difference between our proposal, the proposal \nbefore the Senate now, and the underlying bill is the difference \nbetween flexibility with purpose and essentially a blank check.\n  In our proposal, we have taken a series of categorical grant programs \nand put them together into four broad titles. We call them performance-\nbased\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\npartnership grants--not block grants. As I understand block grants, \nthey are basically pooling money and sending it back to the States and \nlocalities to be spent for education as they would wish.\n  As others have pointed out before, and Senator Kennedy particularly, \nat the outset of the ESEA program, the Federal Government essentially \ngave block grants to the communities and States. It was found that the \nmoney was being spent for what most in Congress at that time did not \nthink were priority educational goals. They were not being spent for \nthe focused purpose of the ESEA, which was to help disadvantaged \nchildren. Block grants don't target the disadvantaged children, and \nthey don't have enough accountability for results that are ongoing. \nThere is no guidance from the Federal Government. I think this is a \nbroad category of how the money should be spent. This is the difference \nbetween the underlying bill and the amendment before us now.\n\n  Yes, we believe that Washington doesn't have all the answers. Yes, we \nthink that some of the current categorical grant programs are too \nfocused with too much micromanagement. So we fold them together. But we \nfeel very strongly that if we in Congress and the Federal Government \nare authorizing and appropriating literally billions of dollars to be \nspent by the States and localities on education, it is not just our \nright but our responsibility to set overall standards, categories, and \ngoals for how that money should be spent.\n  When we say we create performance-based partnership grants, that is \nwhat we mean. They are partnerships between the Federal, State, and \nlocal governments to achieve national educational goals.\n  I will get to that in a minute.\n  They are performance-based because there is an annual measurement of \nhow students are doing. That is what this is all about. Is adequate \nyearly progress being made on these various proposals? If not, we ought \nto rush in with some extra help. If it continues to not be made, then \nwe ought to impose some sanctions.\n  We have taken these four titles and asked that the localities spend \nin areas that we think enjoy broad support in the Nation as priority \neducational areas.\n  First and foremost, I think we granted title I for disadvantaged \nchildren. But of the other four, first and foremost, here is more money \nthan the Federal Government has ever sent to the States and localities \nbefore for the purpose of improving teacher quality.\n  Second, here again, it is more money than the Federal Government has \never sent back before for the purpose of improving programs in limited-\nEnglish proficiency, commonly known as bilingual education. It is a \ncritical need. Too many children for whom English is not the first \nlanguage are not getting the education they should get.\n  Third, public school choice--a great concept that is being adopted at \nthe local level; again, a new funding stream to create new charter \nschools and to create new experiments in public school choice. Let \nparents and children have some choice within the public school setting \nby creating competition and forces that will improve the overall \nquality of education.\n  Finally, a broad category of what might be called public school \ninnovation, including afterschool programs, summer school programs. \nWhatever the localities may decide is an innovative idea, we want them \nto be able to test.\n  There is a big difference between sending a blank check from \nWashington back to the States and localities, saying here is a \nsubstantially increased check but we are asking that localities spend \nit in one of these four priority areas and we are going to hold \nlocalities accountable every year for the results of that spending.\n  Ultimately, that is what matters. It is interesting and not \nunimportant to talk about performance-based partnership grants, but \nultimately it is important to consolidate categorical grants. What is \nmost important is, What is the result? Are our children being better \neducated? If not, we in Washington will set up a system that does not \naccept failure, that does not allow the Federal Government to sit back \nand accept failure, but pushes into the debate and the action to \nencourage success for our children.\n  The second broad point of response is on the question of teacher \nquality. As we all know, we have a rising need for new teachers--2 \nmillion over the next decade. We also want to make sure those teachers \nare the most able. There are a lot of ways to do this. In my State of \nConnecticut, the legislature adopted a program a decade or more ago \nthat has worked. It begins with the State of Connecticut setting \nstandards for paying teachers more money. It is true we get what we pay \nfor. There are a certain number of people who have devoted themselves \nto teaching, regardless of salary, because they had a sense of mission. \nIt is what gave them satisfaction. In an increasingly competitive \neconomy, one of the ways we make it easier to attract the best people \nto teach is by paying more money.\n  The second is to create opportunities in midcareer for people to come \ninto teaching. I point out to my friend from Texas, title II of our \nproposal on teacher quality specifically urges the States to open up \nalternative paths for people. In our proposal, title II encourages the \nlocalities to do exactly what Senator Hutchison advocates, which is to \ncreate alternative paths to teacher certification for people in \nmidcareers so we can get the best people to better educate our \nchildren.\n  We think this is a balanced proposal. We ask our colleagues to \nconsider it and hopefully support it as we come close to the time for \nvoting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Washington 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am delighted to be on the floor in the \npresence of my friend, the Senator from Connecticut, the primary \nsponsor of this proposal. For well over a year, the Senator has shared \nhis thoughtful ideas with me and with other Members on this side of the \naisle.\n  While this is certainly not my proposal--it is not Straight A's by \nany stretch of the imagination--it does represent, in the view of this \nSenator, a genuine and thoughtful approach to the proposition that we \nhaven't been doing everything right for the last 10, 20, 30, 35 years \nand that there is a newer and better way to provide education services \nto our children directed at seeing they get a better education and \ntheir achievement improves.\n  The proposal the Senator from Connecticut has before the Senate is a \nthoughtful and imaginative approach to our innovation in education. \nThere have been a number of comments during the course of the day and \nearlier that the Senator from Connecticut and some of his friends and \nallies have been working with this Senator and others to see if we \ncould marry most or many of the propositions contained in the current \namendment--relating to Straight A's, to the Teacher Empowerment Act, \nand to portability --in a way that would reach across the aisle not \nwith a half a dozen Members on each side of the aisle supporting the \nproposition but perhaps with a majority of the Members of the Senate.\n  While I can't say I am a supporter of the proposition exactly as it \nappears before the Senate, it does offer very real possibilities not \nonly for a constructive debate on education policy but for a \nconstructive resolution to the better education that every Member in \nthis body, whatever his or her philosophy, seeks. I hope there may this \nafternoon even be a symbol of the fact we are beginning to work \ntogether.\n  I must say, there are clear differences even in negotiations over a \nmiddle ground. It is certainly possible they will not be surmountable. \nThis Senator, however, hopes they will be. I think the Senator from \nConnecticut does. At the same time, there may be Members who do not \ndesire a partnership that has involved matters other than this from \ntime to time in a way that has upset certain Members of this body.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his thoughtful and sincere \nefforts and express the hope publicly that they may lead to something \nwhich will unite, rather than divide, members of both parties.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague \nfrom the State of Washington for his gracious words and for the \ndiscussions we have been having for almost 2 years about this \nparticular reauthorization,\n\n[[Page S3654]]\n\nin which I have learned a lot. I appreciate his openmindedness.\n  These discussions continue more broadly now. As he said, there are \ngaps remaining, but it has been a very good faith and worthwhile \nprocess. I look forward to continuing it with him and others in the \ndays ahead toward the aim, which we hope is not going to elude us, of \nhaving a bipartisan reauthorization of ESEA.\n  I am grateful that the Senator from Virginia has come to the floor to \nspeak on behalf of the amendment that is before the Senate. Senator \nRobb is a cosponsor. He has been very active in our discussions of this \nproposal and, as always, he brings to these discussions the clear-\nheaded vision based on experience-- in this case, not only his \nexperience as the Senator but valuable experience as the Governor of \nVirginia.\n  I yield whatever time Senator Robb needs to discuss this proposal.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, so Members will know what is happening here, \nthe minority and majority have agreed there will be a vote at 4:50, and \non our side, the Senator from Virginia would have 20 minutes, Senator \nEdwards would have 10 minutes, Senator Kennedy 5 minutes, and the \nmajority would have 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, we may not have any more important debate \nthis session than the one we are having now on the reauthorization of \nthe major piece of federal legislation affecting K-12 education, the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. I was pleased to support the \nDemocratic alternative last Thursday because it contained many of my \nhighest priorities for education. It continues our commitment to class \nsize reduction, an initiative that will give our children more \nindividualized attention with a qualified teacher. It provides \nsubstantially more money for professional development for teachers and \nadministrators, so we can help build our teachers up, rather than tear \nthem down. It contains more money for schools to make urgently needed \nsafety-related repairs to their facilities, so our children are not in \nschools with leaky roofs or fire code violations. It contains increased \ninvestments in equipping our schools with modern technology, so our \nchildren can learn the language of the new economy--the information \ntechnology language. It contains increased funding for school safety \ninitiatives, because we can't have good schools, unless we have safe \nschools. I am pleased that the New Democrats were able to work with our \nDemocratic Caucus to significantly enhance and strengthen the \naccountability measures contained in the Democratic alternative. \nAlthough the amendment was defeated, I believe it contained a better \napproach, frankly, to the reauthorization of ESEA than that which has \nbeen offered by our distinguished colleagues on the other side of the \naisle.\n  The Senate new Democrats under the leadership of the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and the Senator from \nIndiana, Senator Bayh, and others, as has already been stated, have \nbeen working for many months on a proposal to reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act in a way that will truly help \nour Nation's students and improve our Nation's schools. We have offered \nthis proposal as an alternative to the way we think about the Federal \nrole in K-12 education. The goal of this alternative approach is the \nprinciple reason why we should have an Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act at all: to improve student academic performance and \nreadiness. Two critical factors on the federal level in achieving this \ngoal are investment and real accountability.\n  In 1994, Congress took a monumental step toward encouraging \nstandards-based reform across the states--a movement which really began \nin 1989 when President Bush convened a summit in Charlottesville, VA \nwith our Nation's Governors to explore ways to improve our public \neducation system. When we considered the Goals 2000 legislation in \n1994, we reiterated the principle of that summit: that education is \nprimarily a State and local responsibility, but it is also a national \npriority. We recognized that if the Federal Government is to be a \nmeaningful partner in education reform, we must give greater \nflexibility to States in the use of their funds in order to foster \ninnovation and to help States design their own standards-based reform \nplans.\n  During the floor consideration of Goals 2000, I voiced my support for \nGoals 2000 funding and said:\n\n       [w]ith this new funding States can, if they choose, work to \n     establish tough academic standards, create a system of \n     assessments to put real accountability into our schools, and \n     expand efforts to better train teachers and give them the \n     tools they need to teach our kids.\n\n  As a result a result of Goals 2000, 48 States have now developed \nstandards and many are in the process of aligning their curricula and \nassessments to those standards. But we need to help even more than we \nare now, because only about half of the States this year will meet \ntheir student performance goals. And what is more troubling is that \nthere continues to be a startling achievement gap between low-income \nstudents and more affluent students.\n  Now that the vast majority of our States have standards in place, we \nneed to help them meet those standards. Our Three R's amendment \nemphasizes the need to reinvest in our schools, to reinvent the way \nthat we partner with States and localities, and to recognize that we, \nas a Nation, have a responsibility to ensure that our children are \nreceiving the very best education that all levels of government can \ncollectively provide. For the first time, this amendment attempts to \nhold States accountable not for filling out the right forms or for \nwriting good grant proposals, but for actual increases in student \nachievement.\n\n  The Three R's approach ensures that States are held accountable for \nyearly improvement in student academic performance. States will set \ntheir own yearly targets for improvement. Our hope is that these \nperformance goals will help all children become proficient in reading, \nmathematics, and science. States will be required to take dramatic \ncorrective action in the event that school districts in their States \nchronically fail to make the grade. Failing schools can be shut down. \nThey can be reconstituted with new administrations. They can be turned \ninto charter schools. There are a variety of options available, but the \npoint is simple: failing schools are failing our children, and our \nchildren deserve more. States that meet or exceed their performance \ntargets will be rewarded with even more flexibility in the use of their \nfunds.\n  But a demand for more accountability must be accompanied by increased \ninvestment--increased investment in our students, increased investment \nin our teachers, increased investment in our administrators, and \nincreased investment in our schools themselves. This amendment calls \nfor an unprecedented $35 billion increase in elementary and secondary \neducation funding over the next 5 years. Currently, the Federal \nGovernment only spends $14.4 billion per year on K-12 education. To put \nthat in some perspective, last year we spent $230 billion to pay \ninterest on the national debt. The fact that we pay 15 times more money \non debt that is akin to bad credit card debt, when we could be building \nschools, or training teachers, or hiring school safety officers, is \nshameful.\n  Our amendment would increase our current spending by $7.2 billion \nnext year alone. Instead of pumping this money into more programs, our \namendment distributes most of the new Federal funds to States based \nupon a formula, rather than to those States and localities who can \nafford to hire savvy grant writers. The distribution of funds is \ntargeted to where the funds are needed most--to our neediest schools \nand students, that are so often left behind. The Three R's approach \nincreases teacher quality funding to $1.6 billion, which is a $1 \nbillion increase from our current spending. It substantially increases \naid for economically disadvantaged students by 50 percent--from $8 \nbillion to $12 billion. We continue our commitment to reducing class \nsize by providing a guaranteed stream of funding for this important \ninitiative which has so far provided States with enough funding to hire \nover 29,000 new teachers. And we get serious about helping Limited \nEnglish Proficient students not only master English, but achieve high \nlevels in core subjects as well. Our funding for LEP students is \nincreased\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\nfrom $380 million to $1 billion. Finally, we provide $2.7 billion to \nexpand after-school and summer-school opportunities, to enhance school \nsafety, to improve the technological capabilities of our students, \nteachers, and schools, and to fund innovative school improvement \ninitiatives designed at the local level.\n  We need to invest in our teachers so they are the best in the world. \nWe need to invest in our schools so they are safe and modern. We need \nto invest in our students so they will develop the skills they need to \nsucceed. The Federal Government can provide these resources and we \nbelieve that it should. At the same time that we do this, we need to \nensure that the Federal role in K-12 education is one that actually \npromotes improvement in academic achievement.\n  That is accountability with real meaning.\n  This amendment is also meant to provide a starting point for a \nbipartisan effort. Our education debate has a tendency to devolve into \npartisan battles with the extremes on both sides drawing hard and fast \nlines that either abandon public schools by promoting vouchers or \ncontinue the status quo by funding myriad small programs--programs \nwhich, however well intentioned, often dilute the effectiveness of the \nlimited Federal dollars we have to spend on education. We have to get \nbeyond these differences to better serve our children.\n  There is more to the education debate than just these priorities. \nLast month, the Senate new Democrats held a hearing about the RRR \napproach. The panelists were former Reagan Education Secretary William \nBennett; former Chief Domestic Policy Advisor to President Clinton, \nWilliam Galston; Seattle Superintendent Joseph Olchefske; Amy Wilkins, \nprincipal partner of the Education Trust, an organization dedicated to \nthe education of disadvantaged children; and Robert Schwartz, president \nof Achieve, Incorporated, an organization formed by the Nation's \nGovernors and corporate leaders to improve public education.\n  Despite the philosophical diversity among the panelists in many \nareas, all of the panelists agreed that focus on increased investment \nin exchange for real accountability was necessary and prudent.\n  Perhaps William Bennett summed it up best by saying:\n\n       The Three R's has the potential to bring about a new era \n     for the Federal Government and education, an era that \n     actively emphasizes results over process and favors success \n     over failure.\n\n  I believe our RRR amendment combines the principles upon which so \nmany of us can and do agree. It is perhaps more aptly described as the \n``III''--investment, innovation, and improvement. This really should be \nthe model for the Federal role in elementary and secondary education in \nour country. I hope colleagues from both sides of the aisle will \nseriously consider this approach.\n  I yield the floor and reserve any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak to three subjects today: first, to the \nsubject of education in general; second, to some of the things we have \ndone in North Carolina in the area of education of which we are very \nproud, particularly in our public schools; and, third, to talk \nspecifically about the Lieberman-Bayh amendment.\n  First, the single test we should apply in determining what to do with \nour public school system is what is in the best interest of the kids--\nnot what is in the best interest of either political party, not what is \nin the best interest for either candidate for the President of the \nUnited States, but what is in the best interest in improving the lives \nand education of our young people.\n  Anywhere one goes in North Carolina, if one were to ask folks what is \nthe most important thing we do as a Government, they would tell you \nover and over: Educate our young people. If one were then to tell them \nthe reality, which is that we spend less than 1 percent of the Federal \nbudget on over 50 million school children in the United States, they \nwould be absolutely flabbergasted. The single issue that the American \npeople believe is the most important thing their Government does takes \nless than 1 percent of the Federal budget. They believe more needs to \nbe done.\n  I believe strongly that our school systems should be run at the local \nlevel, that people at the State and local level know much better than \npeople in Washington how our school systems should be run. That does \nnot mean, however, there are not things we can do as the Federal \nGovernment to partner with State and local government officials in \neducating young people. That is what we need to be doing.\n  There is nothing in our Constitution that says we cannot devote more \nthan 1 percent of the Federal budget to public education. We have to be \nwilling to devote the resources to make education the priority it is \nfor the American people, to put the resources into it, to put the \neffort into it, and to help State and local officials do the job they \nso desperately want to do.\n  I will say a word about some of the things we have done in North \nCarolina. We believe North Carolina is, in fact, the education State. \nFor example, we started a program in early childhood development called \nSmart Start. The basic idea of Smart Start, which now exists in every \ncounty in North Carolina, was to get all kids into an early childhood \ndevelopment program and to get them on the right track so they later \ncould be kept on the right track. Smart Start got them at a time when \nit had the most influence over them, which is before they reach the age \nof 6 or 7 and begin elementary school.\n  Smart Start has worked. It has had a dramatic effect in our State of \nNorth Carolina. Smart Start, most importantly, is an example of what \nhappens when we are willing to think outside the box. We have to be \nwilling to constantly examine whether what we are doing is working, \nwhether there are new, innovative, more creative ways to educate our \nyoung people. Again, the test ought to always be the same: What is in \nthe best interest of the kids? What is going to be most effective in \ngiving our kids the best education we can possibly give them?\n  Smart Start is a perfect example of that. It is new. It was \ninnovative when it came into play. It has worked. We have to be willing \nto continue to think about programs such as Smart Start.\n  The way we dealt with failing schools in North Carolina is another \nexample. We went across the State and identified those schools that \nwere failing; that is, they were not doing the job that needed to be \ndone. Talk about accountability, this is accountability in its purest \nform. If a school was failing, we essentially replaced the \nadministration of that school. In other words, we put people in charge \nof running the school for the purpose of turning it around.\n  The results have been absolutely phenomenal. Almost \nwithout exception, those schools have been turned around, the kids' \ngrades have improved, and their performance has improved. Again, this \nis another example of being willing to think outside the box, to think \ncreatively and innovatively.\n\n  Recently, I was in North Carolina meeting with some folks who were \nworking on the cutting edge of public education. They showed an example \nof a computer program that can be used by kids in the early grades of \nelementary school.\n  They can take kids, particularly disadvantaged kids, and put them in \nfront of a computer in an environment where they feel safe, where they \ndo not have to perform in front of the other children so they do not \nfeel as if they are a failure from the very beginning. It gets them \nengaged. The single most important thing with young kids is to get them \nengaged, to make them believe they have some control over their own \ndestiny; that they can, in fact, compete; that they can effectively \ncompete against all the kids; and, more important, it gives them self-\nesteem. It makes them feel as if they can actually do something about \ntheir lives.\n  This computer program had a phenomenal effect on the performance of \ndisadvantaged kids. Once again, the test remains the same: What is in \nthe best interest of the children? Are we willing to constantly \nchallenge our approaches, how they can be better molded to fit the \nneeds of the children? The computer program I just described does that; \nSmart Start does that; that is\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\nwhat our mechanism for dealing with disadvantaged and failing schools \ndid in North Carolina.\n  That brings me to the Lieberman amendment, which is just another \nexample on the national level of being willing to address issues \ncreatively, innovatively, and to think outside the box, to think about \nwhat is in the best interest of the kids and what is the most effective \nway of addressing the needs of kids.\n  I will freely admit there are some provisions in the Lieberman \namendment which caused me some concern when I first saw them, but it \ndoes many positive, creative things. First and foremost for me is the \nwillingness to invest in title I, to provide more resources and more \nfunding and to target those funds to the kids who most need the help.\n  If my colleagues do what I have done over the course of the last 2\\1/\n2\\, 3 years and go to schools across my State of North Carolina, the \none thing that becomes immediately apparent is our kids do not compete \non a level playing field. That was the original idea behind title I: \ntrying to create a level playing field so no matter where a kid went to \nschool, no matter where they were enrolled in school, whether it was in \nthe country in rural North Carolina or Charlotte, Raleigh, or \nGreensboro, they had an equal opportunity to achieve and equal \nopportunity to learn.\n  I have to give tremendous credit to Senator Lieberman, Senator Bayh, \nand all the moderate Democrats who worked so hard on this amendment. \nWhat they have done is identified the kids who most need the help--the \nplace where the achievement gap exists--and gone about thinking \ncreatively how we can make these kids achieve, how we can give them the \nbest possible chance to be able to perform because we have to be \nwilling to do something.\n  We have consistently underfunded title I in the past. There has been \na lot of rhetoric about our willingness and interest in helping \ndisadvantaged kids. Now we get a chance to step up to the plate. That \nis exactly what Senator Lieberman and Senator Bayh have done. They have \nsaid: We are willing to put our money where our mouth is. We are \nwilling to put the resources in place that need to be there to help \nthese kids, these disadvantaged kids, to give them a chance to compete.\n  That is all they ask for. That is what the computer program is about. \nThat is what reducing class size is about. We have to give these \nchildren, who have not been achieving, who have not been responding to \nthe traditional ways of educating young people, a chance to compete. We \nhave to be willing to think outside the box. We have to be willing to \nsay to ourselves that maybe we have been wrong in the past, maybe there \nare new and better ways to do this.\n  That is exactly what the Lieberman amendment is aimed at doing. That \nis the reason the Lieberman amendment is supported by the moderate \nDemocrats. The Lieberman amendment is just another in a long line of \nexamples--except in this case it is at the national level--of new and \ncreative ways of addressing the needs of our young people.\n  As we go forward with this debate, and as we go forward with \naddressing the needs in educating our young people, we have to be \nwilling to do what has been done in my home State of North Carolina, \nwhat has worked so well--programs such as Smart Start, programs dealing \nwith failing schools, these computer programs that have been so \neffective, and now, in this case, on a national level, the Lieberman \namendment.\n  We have to be willing to question ourselves. We have to be willing to \nput the money in place that is needed to educate our young people, \nwhich is more than 1 percent of the national budget, and that, \nultimately, we are committed to making the first decade of this century \nthe education decade, and that we are committed to making our schools \nthe envy of the world. We have the best economy, the best roads, the \nbest technology in the world; it is high time we be able to say to the \nworld, our schools are the envy of the world.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Arkansas 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to my \ndistinguished colleague from North Carolina. I applaud his willingness \nto look at new and innovative approaches. I think his embrace of the \nLieberman amendment is reflective of that desire for change.\n  I note, as I listened to the Senator's comments, he spoke of the \nNorth Carolina experience and some of the things they have done in \nNorth Carolina--some of the innovative, creative, and constructive \nprograms in North Carolina.\n  I applaud the State of North Carolina. And I think that makes our \ncase for Straight A's. I think the idea of giving those kinds of States \nwhich are doing good and innovative things more flexibility in carrying \nout those programs is exactly the direction we ought to be moving.\n  I believe the Lieberman proposal moves us in that direction, that it \nis a constructive effort, that it has been a positive effort, that \nthere has been, on the part of the moderate Democrats who have spoken \non behalf of the Lieberman amendment, a recognition of the need for \nchange. There has been a candid recognition of the failure of the top-\ndown, one-size-fits-all approach that we have taken for 35 years to the \nFederal role in education.\n  I must say that I still have a number of concerns and reservations, \nand have opposition to some of the provisions in the Lieberman \nproposal. I still think there is too much regulatory effort from \nWashington. I think there is a failure to embrace the kind of bold \nsteps we need that are in the underlying Educational Opportunities Act \nand that it would be a shame for us, while recognizing the need for \nchange, recognizing the need for adequate funding, to only take a half \nstep or a baby step in the direction of reform. That is why I believe \nthe underlying bill is far preferable.\n  I am pleased, however, that there have been ongoing discussions among \nthose who believe that we need change on both sides of the aisle, that \nwe need to provide greater flexibility, that we need to consolidate \nprograms, that we need to streamline programs, and that there has been \nan effort to accomplish that. But I am very concerned that we still \ncentralize too much power in the name of accountability. We still give \ntoo much authority to the Department of Education.\n  Members have been talking about the importance of accountability all \nweek and last week. If we are to have accountability for Federal \neducation funds, we must first ensure that accountability is occurring \nnot only at the local level but at the Federal level as well.\n  So when I heard Senator Lieberman earlier say these are billions of \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars that we are sending back to the States and \nto the schools; therefore, we have a right and a responsibility to \nrequire specifics on how that money is spent, that sounds very good, \nbut I say that we should require the same kind of accountability from \nthe Department of Education which oversees these programs that it \nadministers.\n  For the second year in a row, the U.S. Department of Education has \nbeen unable to address its financial management problems. Those \nmanagement problems are very serious. In its past two audits, the \nDepartment was unable to account for parts of its $32 billion program \nbudget and the $175 billion owed in student loans. They were unable to \naccount for parts of that budget. Before we entrust the Department with \nadministering more funds and creating more new programs, we must ensure \nthat they are properly accounting for the funding they already have.\n\n  The Lieberman amendment, though a step in the right direction, still \nleaves more power in the hands of the Federal Department of Education \nand provides a modicum of improvement for State flexibility that, in my \nopinion, is not enough.\n  The House Education Committee has been holding hearings on the \nfinancial problems at the Department of Education and has found \ninstances of duplicate payments to grant winners and an $800 million \ncollege loan to a single student. That is rather amazing.\n  In its 1998 audit, the Department blamed its problems on a faulty new\n\n[[Page S3657]]\n\naccounting system that cost $5.1 million, in addition to the cost of \nmanpower to try to fix the system. A new accounting system will be the \nthird new accounting system in 5 years.\n  The most recent 1999 audit showed the following: The Department's \nfinancial stewardship remains in the bottom quartile of all major \nFederal agencies. If you stack them all up, you find the Department of \nEducation down toward the bottom in the job they are doing in fiscal \nresponsibility. The Department sent duplicate payments to 52 schools in \n1999, at a cost of more than $6.5 million. And perhaps most \nsignificant, none of the material weaknesses cited in the 1998 audit \nwere corrected when the Department was reaudited in 1999.\n  So they have failed to take the kind of corrective measures that \nmight reestablish confidence and faith in the Department of Education. \nThese problems make the Department vulnerable to fraud, waste, and \nabuse. I have submitted an amendment to this bill that would require an \ninvestigative study by the GAO into the financial records of the \nDepartment of Education.\n  No one is suggesting we should eliminate the Department. No one is \nsuggesting that having a voice for education at the Cabinet table is \nnot critically important. But it is equally important that we require \nhigh standards of fiscal responsibility for the Department that \noversees billions of dollars in taxpayer money. We entrust them with \nfunding. We expect local schools to handle their funds properly. We \nshould have the same kind of demand on the Department of Education.\n  In addition, I have an amendment to provide increased flexibility \namong Federal formula grant programs for States and local school \ndistricts. It is identical to language included in legislation in the \nHouse to reauthorize ESEA.\n  One of my concerns about the Lieberman amendment, although I do \nbelieve it is a step in the right direction and will provide expanded \nflexibility, is that it does not provide the kind of flexibility the \nStates and local school districts are crying out for.\n  This amendment would give States and local school districts the \nauthority to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs to address \nlocal needs as they see fit. Covered programs would include \nprofessional development for teachers, education technology, safe and \ndrug-free schools, title VI innovative education block grants, and the \nEmergency Immigrant Education Program.\n  In addition, States may transfer funds into, but not away from, title \nI funding for disadvantaged students. So they would have the ability to \ntake funds from these other programs and move them into title I for the \nbenefit of disadvantaged students, but not the other way around.\n\n  It would not be only money flowing into the title I but would provide \ngreater flexibility for the local school district to move money between \nprograms--transferability. States may transfer all of the program funds \nfor which they have authority, except for the administrative funds. \nLocal school districts may transfer up to 35 percent of the funds they \nreceive without obtaining State permission, and all other funds under \nthese programs, if their State approves.\n  So this would provide for all of those States that are not fortunate \nenough to be included in the Straight A's Program, which the Presiding \nOfficer has authored and expended so much energy and resources in \npromoting, but we still know that we have only 15 States in the \nunderlying bill that are going to be able to participate in that \nprogram. So for those States not fortunate to be in the Straight A's \nProgram, this would give them the ability to have some increased \nflexibility in devoting funds to arising needs in their schools. Local \nschool boards know that needs often change from year to year. This \ngives them the authority to flexibly use their Federal funds to address \nthose changing needs. As we all know, these local school boards are \nelected by the people just as we are in the Senate. I trust them to \nknow the specific needs of their schools from year to year.\n  I believe that the debate for now more than a week has been very \nilluminating to the American people. The course of the debate has moved \nus a long way toward reaching, if not consensus, at least a strong \nmajority of this body recognizes what we sought to do in the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee in producing the Educational \nOpportunities Act, which is supported by the American people and what \nwe need to do--greater flexibility, greater local control, more child \ncentered in our effort, high-performance expectations, a determination \nto see the achievement gap close between advantaged and disadvantaged \nstudents. And while initially we heard many on the other side simply \ndefend the status quo in very plain terms, saying that we had to stick \nwith the tried, true, and tested programs that have ``worked so well'' \nduring the past 35 years, though with the expenditure of $120 billion, \nwe cannot show that the achievement gap is closed.\n  I believe the debate has moved a long way, and I look forward to \nseeing the opportunity to pass the Educational Opportunities Act, \nincluding the Straight A's provision.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nLieberman amendment. I want to be sure that all my colleagues \nunderstand that what the amendment would do is wipe out everything in \nS. 2--the bill we have been debating for the past week. The amendment \nwould put in the provisions of S. 2254, a bill which was introduced \nabout two weeks after the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions completed its work on S. 2.\n  I believe that my colleagues should also understand that, if the \nLieberman amendment is adopted, all amendments which were approved over \nthe past week will be discarded along with S. 2. Moreover, no further \namendments would be in order. I know that many members have prepared \namendments which they wish to see considered. Should a substitute \namendment be adopted, this will simply not be possible.\n  There may very well be ideas in the Lieberman amendment which are \nworth considering, but using it as the basis to scrap 18 months worth \nof hearings and other committee deliberations and to rewrite the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act on the floor of the United \nStates Senate is hardly the way to pursue those ideas.\n  A major function of the committee system in Congress is to assure \nthat a bipartisan group of members have the opportunity to devote extra \ntime and study to particular issues.\n  There may be disagreements among committee members and Members who do \nnot serve on the committee may disagree with some of the conclusions \nreached by those who present a bill for the consideration of the full \nSenate. Nevertheless, there is a clear understanding of the issues at \nhand--so that a rational debate of differences can be held.\n  The danger in dismissing the work of a committee entirely in order to \nadopt something which may appear more appealing is that serious \nproblems may well go unnoticed. I believe there are numerous aspects of \nthe substitute amendment which illustrate this point.\n  For example, the amendment makes significant changes to the title I \nformula. Proposals to alter the formula by which title I funds are \ndistributed are among the most difficult to analyze.\n  Changes which at first glance appear to represent sound policy often \nhave unintended consequences that do not become evident until actual \nruns are performed.\n  Senator Lieberman has proposed a significant change to the way that \ntitle I funds are to be distributed within states. Currently, the vast \nmajority of funds are distributed through the Basic Grant Program 85%, \nand the Concentration Grant Program, 15%.\n  No funds have been made available for either the Targeted Grant \nProgram or the Education Finance Incentive Grant Program. Importantly, \nthe amount received by each state is determined by totaling amount that \neach eligible school district within the state is eligible to receive.\n  If the Lieberman amendment were adopted, the most dramatic changes \nwould be experienced at the school district level. Under current law, \nthe states distribute 85% the money to local educational agencies, \nLEAs, in\n\n[[Page S3658]]\n\naccordance with the Basic grant formula and 15% of the money through \nthe Concentration Grant formula. This structure is retained under the \ncommittee bill. Importantly, the amount of funding to each state is \nbased upon the amount that eligible school districts within the state \nare entitled to receive.\n  Under the Lieberman proposal, money would be received by the state on \nthe basis of one formula and then distributed to LEAs on the basis of a \nmodified version of the Targeted Grant Program. This establishes a new \nprecedent and raises basic questions of fairness. For the first time, \nthe amount that a state receives will be based upon the eligibility of \nschool districts which shall not be given the funds. Let me state this \nagain. States will receive money on the basis of the eligibility of \ncertain school districts. These school districts will not, however, \nreceive the money. The money that the state received on the basis of \ntheir eligibility will be diverted to other school districts within the \nstate.\n  It may be argued by some that this improves targeting by sending \nmoney to high-poverty school districts. An examination of the actual \nnumbers reveals that the proposal would establish deep inequalities \namong school districts across the Nation. It turns out that not all \npoverty is treated equally. In fact, it depends upon which state you \nhappen to be fortunate enough to reside in and even which school \ndistrict governs your school.\n  Let me provide some examples. These examples were selected simply by \ngoing through the LEA lists in alphabetical order to select districts \nwith comparable poverty rates.\n  In Alabama the Thomasville City School District has a poverty rate of \n30.3% and would lose 21.6% of its title I funding. In California, Burnt \nRanch with a poverty rate of 30.5% would only lose 16% of its funding. \nNew London School District in Connecticut with a poverty rate of 30.6% \nwould receive an increase of 11.9% while Bridgeport with a poverty rate \nof 35.5% would be cut by .5%. The disparity in the dollar amounts of \nthe reductions is even greater.\n  My point is this. Many school districts which currently receive \nfunding under the Basic and Concentration Grant Programs would receive \nsteady annual cuts in their title I funds under this proposal. These \nwould not be potential cuts--these would be real cuts. Cuts that would \nhave to be made up by raising property taxes or cutting services.\n  The Congressional Research Service has done runs for each LEA in each \nstate. These runs reflect annual projected increases or decreases for \neach of the next three years. There is nothing magic about three years. \nDistricts which are gaining funds would presumably continue to gain \nthem and districts which are losing funds would presumably continue to \nlose them until an equilibrium is established in the out years.\n  Our goal during this reauthorization should be to strengthen \neducational opportunities for all students. This proposal pits poor \nchildren in one school against poor children in another and should be \nsoundly rejected.\n  Proponents of the Lieberman substitute have spoken to the need to \nincrease accountability. I do not believe there is any disagreement at \nall in this body that recipients of federal education funds must be \nheld accountable. As I noted in my opening remarks when we began floor \nconsideration of this bill, through a bipartisanship effort in 1994, we \nin the Congress decided that title I should carry out its mission of \nimproving learning by assisting state and local efforts in the \ndevelopment of standards and assessments.\n  Congress completely rewrote Title I in 1994 and made the program more \nrigorous--requiring States to develop both content and student \nperformance standards and assessments.\n  Congress gave the states seven years to complete this difficult task. \nWe are mid-stream in this process.\n  In the name of accountability, the Lieberman substitute rewrites many \nof the standards, assessment, and school improvement provisions that \nwere included in the 1994 law. I fear that rewriting these sections \nwill not lead States down the path toward greater accountability, but \nrather will create detours for the states and school districts that \nhave already spent several years going in the right direction. \nDeveloping and implementing standards-based reform and assessments is \nnot a simple task. It requires sustained and consistent effort. Loading \nup States and school districts with new regulations, new reporting \nrequirements, and more mandates is a distraction at best and a step \nbackward at worst.\n  Finally, I believe it is important to point out that most of the \nindividual programs authorized under the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act outside of title I are repealed by the Lieberman \nsubstitute. A notable exception is that the amendment does authorize \nthe President's class-size reduction program as a separate activity. \nApparently, some merit is seen for that separate program which is not \nseen for programs such as the Reading Excellence Act, Gifted and \nTalented Education, Reading is Fundamental, or Character Education--to \nname just a few of the programs which are repeal by the substitute \namendment.\n  It is my understanding that the funds from the various programs which \nare repealed are to be used within four general categories: school \nimprovement, innovative reform, safe learning environments, and \ntechnology.\n  For example, the substitute amendment would repeal title IV of ESEA , \nthe Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities program. title IV funds \nwould be pooled with the other funds allocated to repealed programs, \nand 15% of the funds in the pool are to be used for safe learning \nenvironments. The substitute amendment completely tosses overboard the \nTitle IV reforms in S. 2 which were developed by a bipartisan group of \nmembers--spearheaded by Senators DeWine, Dodd, and Murray. These \nreforms were designed to assure that drug-free schools funds are used \nfor proven, effective programs--rather than being used in some of the \nfrivolous ways we have seen in the past. The Lieberman amendment sets \nback the clock on these important revisions to the bill.\n  As I indicated at the outset, it is important that we take great care \nin crafting changes to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The \nprograms in this Act represent virtually all the support provided by \nthe Federal Government in support of elementary and secondary schools. \nAlthough the federal share is small relative to the contributions made \nby States and localities, it is a substantial investment--approaching \n$15 billion a year.\n  I believe that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions has taken its responsibilities seriously in developing S. 2 \nover the past 18 months. We held 25 hearings on all aspects of the Act \nand have spent considerable time discussing the issues it includes--\nwith much of this work being done on a bipartisan basis. I am pleased \nto have heard so much today about bipartisan cooperation with respect \nelementary and secondary education. Although the final vote out of \ncommittee was on a party-line basis, the fact of the matter is that \nmuch of the bill was developed through bipartisan discussions.\n  I have spoken many times on this floor on behalf of bipartisan \nefforts to help our nation's school children, and I remain willing to \nengage in such efforts. I am not, however, willing to turn my back on \nthe work the committee has put into S. 2 in order to embrace a proposal \nwhich reduces title I funding for many school districts throughout the \ncountry, imposes additional reporting burdens on States and localities, \nand repeals many programs which have been of value to our nation's \nschools and students.\n  I want to say again that I strongly oppose the Lieberman amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the \nLieberman amendment, which is based on our bill ``The Public Education \nReinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act of 2000''--better \nknown as ``Three R's.'' I believe that this bill represents a \nrealistic, effective approach to improving public education--where 90% \nof students are educated.\n  For the past 35 years, when the time has come for the Senate to \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, it has done so \nwith bipartisan support. However, over the past week, most of what \nwe've seen on the Senate floor has been partisan wrangling--from both \nsides of the aisle--over how to reform education. I think\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\nthat's tragic. Our nation's children deserve a serious debate and real \nreform--not partisan bickering and election-year gamesmanship.\n  Mr. President, addressing problems in education is going to take more \nthan cosmetic reform. It will require some tough decisions and a \nwillingness to work together. We need to let go of the tired partisan \nfighting over more spending versus block grants, and take a middle \nground approach that will truly help our States, school districts--and \nmost importantly, our students.\n  During the past several weeks, I am pleased to have been part of a \nbipartisan group of Senators who have put partisan politics aside and \nare seeking to find such a middle ground. Our group has been working to \nmeld the best parts of all of our plans--in the hope that we can \nactually get a bill passed this year. In a short period of time, we \nhave made tremendous progress and found more agreement between our two \nparties than the past week's floor debate has shown. I am hopeful that \nwe will soon reach agreement on a bipartisan compromise, but even if we \ndo not, we have laid the groundwork for the future. At some point, the \nentire Senate will have to put politics aside and deal with education \nreform. Our plan can serve as the foundation for that compromise--and I \nlook forward to working with our group to make that happen.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Federal government must continue to be a \npartner with States, school districts, and educators to improve public \neducation. But it is time to take a fresh look at the structure of \nFederal education programs--building upon past successes and putting an \nend to our past failures.\n  The amendment before us now--our ``Three R's'' bill--does just that. \nThree R's makes raising student achievement for all students--and \nclosing the achievement gap between low-income and more affluent \nstudents--our top priorities. To accomplish this, our bill centers \naround three principles.\n  First, we believe that we must provide more funding for education--\nand that Federal dollars must be targeted to disadvantaged students. \nFederal funds make up only 7% of all money spent on education, so it is \nessential that we target those funds on the students who need them the \nmost.\n  Second, we believe that States and local school districts are in the \nbest position to know what their educational needs are. Three R's gives \nthem more flexibility to determine how they will use Federal dollars to \nbest meet those needs.\n  Finally--and I believe this is the lynchpin of our approach--we \nbelieve that in exchange for this increased flexibility, there must \nalso be accountability for results. These principles are a pyramid, \nwith accountability being the base that supports the federal \ngovernment's grant of flexibility and funds.\n  For too long, we have seen a steady stream of Federal dollars flow to \nStates and school districts--regardless of how well they educated their \nstudents. This has to stop. We need to reward schools that do a good \njob. We need to provide assistance and support to schools that are \nstruggling to do a better job. And we must stop subsidizing failure. \nOur highest priority must be educating children--not perpetuating \nbroken systems.\n  Mr. President, the ``Three R's bill takes a fresh look at public \neducation. I believe it represents a real middle ground, building upon \nall the progress we've made and tackling the problems we still face. \nThis bill--by using the concepts of increased funding, targeting, \nflexibility--and most importantly, accountability--demonstrates how we \ncan work with our State and local partners to make sure every child \nreceives the highest quality education--and a chance to live a \nsuccessful, productive life. I urge my colleagues to support the \nLieberman-Bayh amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the quality of education in this country is \nof enormous concern to the American people, and is a defining issue in \nCongress this year. I believe that few priorities are more important \nthan the future of our Nation's youth. When Americans lack education \nand skills, demands on Government support rise, and the long-term \nfinancial costs to the Nation are enormous. Our primary goal during \nthis debate is to find the best way to bring every one of our students \nup to a high level of academic performance, in order that they may be \nsuccessful, contributing members of the national and global economy.\n  As a former Governor of Nevada, I believe that education is first a \nState and local responsibility. Creative and innovative education \nprograms have been initiated by many governors at the state level, and \nthe local school districts who interact with students and families in \ntheir communities on a daily basis are better positioned than federal \nbureaucrats to identify their schools' specific needs, and to target \nthe appropriate resources to meet these needs.\n  The primary purpose of the New Democrat amendment to the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, introduced by Senators Lieberman and Bayh \nand of which I am a cosponsor, is to deliver better educational results \nby helping states and local school districts raise academic achievement \nfor all children. The amendment recognizes that the Federal Government \nhas an important role to play in working with states and localities on \neducation. It also calls on the Federal Government to work with states \nto strengthen the standards by which states and local districts are \nheld accountable for increased student achievement, and at the same \ntime, to give states the flexibility to choose the programs that work \nbest for their districts and schools.\n  The Federal Government has assumed the specific responsibility of \nensuring that all students, especially those students who face \nsignificant disadvantages, receive a quality education, thereby \npreparing them to function as successful adults and to lead fulfilling \nlives. The Lieberman/Bayh amendment fulfills this responsibility by \nsetting clear national goals. These goals are to increase targeting to \nschools with highest poverty concentrations; to consolidate \nprofessional development and teacher training initiatives to improve \nteacher, principal and administrator quality; to help immigrant \nstudents become proficient in English and achieve high levels of \nlearning in all subjects; and to stimulate ``High \nPerformance Initiatives'' by giving states money to choose what \nprograms work best for raising the academic achievement of their \nstudents. States can use this ``High Performance Initiatives'' money to \nfocus on priorities they deem necessary to the education of their \nstudents; priorities such as innovative school improvement strategies, \nexpanding after-school and summer school opportunities, improving \nschool safety and discipline, and developing technological literacy. \nThese are all important goals.\n\n  More specifically, the Lieberman/Bayh amendment operates under the \nphilosophy that getting money to those students who need it the most is \ncrucial, and it strengthens our national commitment to targeting aid to \ndisadvantaged students and schools. Under title I, the New Democrat \nalternative's formula sends 75 percent of new money to states and local \ndistricts with the highest concentrations of poverty. The amendment \nalso distributes teacher quality money based on poverty and student \npopulation, and distributes money to help immigrant students become \nproficient in English and achieve high levels of learning by targeting \naid to states with high concentrations of student with limited English \nproficiency.\n  Within the parameters of the Lieberman/Bayh amendment, states and \nlocalities get flexibility to choose what programs and strategies work \nbest to raise their students' achievement. The amendment strengthens \nthe decisionmaking authority of state and local officials by \neliminating some of the strings that come attached to federal dollars. \nUnder this new approach, states develop their own academic standards, \ntheir own assessments for measuring annual progress in student \nachievement, and their own goals for improving school performance. \nStates also choose which initiatives and programs are of priority, and \nwhich will work best to raise academic achievement.\n  At the same time that states have this new flexibility, national \ninterests and federal goals are protected and advanced, both fiscally \nand educationally. The new Democrat alternative does this by holding \nstates accountable\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\nfor meeting the standards they set. Money is not enough to raise \nstudent achievement. Along with the added money and flexibility in the \namendment, states and districts are given the responsibility of setting \nperformance goals for their students, and of demonstrating clear \nprogress towards these goals.\n  Not all currently funded educational programs produce the great \nresults we are looking for. The Lieberman/Bayh amendment sets \nmeasurable standards so that  states and local districts can evaluate \nthe programs they are using, and see what is and what is not raising \ntheir students' academic achievement. The states have the flexibility \nto choose the programs that work best for their student populations, \nbut the Federal Government, under the Lieberman/Bayh amendment, holds \nthem accountable for raising student achievement.\n\n  Under the new Democrat alternative, there are real consequences for \nchronic failure. For the first time ever, states that fail to meet the \nperformance objectives under any title would be penalized. After 3 \nyears of failure, a state's administrative funding would be cut by 50 \npercent, and after 4 years of failure, programming funds to the state \nunder the ``High Performance Initiatives'' title would be cut by 30 \npercent. The Lieberman/Bayh amendment also requires states to impose \nsanctions on local school districts that fail to meet annual \nperformance goals, and rewards states who exceed their goals by \nreceiving even greater flexibility in using their program funding to \nmeet their own specific priorities. In this way, Federal funding is \ndirectly linked to the performance of schools in meeting the goals the \nschools themselves have set.\n  In summary, the new Democrat alternative was written with the \nunderlying philosophy that state and local officials are better \npositioned than Federal bureaucrats to identify their specific needs, \nand to target the appropriate resources to meet these needs. At the \nsame time, the amendment sets clear national goals and holds states \nresponsible for producing progress toward these goals. The current \nsystem is far less fiscally responsible than the Lieberman/Bayh \napproach because it does nothing to ensure that taxpayer dollars are \ngetting a real return on their investment. In the Lieberman/Bayh \namendment, the Federal Government maintains control and plays a role in \nsetting national priorities in education. It also strengthens our \nnational commitment to target aid to disadvantaged students and \nschools, and holds states accountable for producing results in exchange \nfor the flexibility. In conclusion, I would like to express my support \nfor the new Democrat alternative amendment, introduced by Senators \nLieberman and Bayh, because I believe it will significantly and \npositively reform the current education system, while successfully \nraising the academic achievement of all students.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Lieberman amendment \nto ESEA. I am very supportive of the efforts of the Senator from \nConnecticut and my other colleagues who have worked so diligently on \nthis amendment. This amendment is based upon a theory that I am very \nsupportive of: increased flexibility in exchange for increased \naccountability. This means that States and school districts should have \nmore flexibility in using Federal funds, but they must meet certain \nachievement measures, and most important, those achievement gains must \nhold true for children of all races, all ethnicities, and regardless of \ngender. Therefore, I am sorry that I am not rising in support of this \namendment, because it includes many components of education reform that \nI firmly believe are necessary to improving the public education system \nfor all students.\n  The Lieberman amendment would target the title I formula even more to \nthe most highly disadvantaged students. This amendment would also \ndramatically increase our investment in the title I program. The \nFederal Government's number one priority should and must be to ensure \nthat economically disadvantaged students are provided with \nsupplementary educational resources, and I commend my colleagues for \nincreasing this critical investment in this program.\n  The Lieberman amendment would also increase the accountability of \nFederal dollars, a component of education reform that I know is \ncritical to improving the public education system. The Federal \nGovernment has an obligation to ensure that we are getting the most \nfrom our investment in public education, by holding our teachers, our \nschools, and our students accountable to the highest standards. This \namendment would make a great step toward increasing the Federal \nGovernment's investment in accountability. Accountability is the third \nside of an education triangle that also includes standards and \nassessments. Now that many states have adopted high standards and tests \nto measure students' progress toward those benchmarks, they have turned \ntheir attention to making sure that performance matters. Achieving real \naccountability in our schools is a large part of what this amendment is \nall about and I believe increased accountability is critically \nimportant for the state of public education in this country. Again I \ncommend my colleagues for focusing their amendment on this important \nelement of public school reform.\n  The Lieberman approach focuses on public school choice, another \nelement of public education reform that I support and know to be \ncritical to improving educational attainment for all children. Public \nschool choice is becoming more and more a part of the American \neducational system. In 1993, only 11% of students attended schools \nchosen by their parents. In 1999, 15% of students attended schools \nchosen by their parents. While still serving a relatively small \npercentage of students, charter schools and magnet schools are becoming \nan increasingly common tool to improve the education of our nation's \nchildren. In 1994, there were only 100 charter schools in this country. \nToday, there are 1,700. Currently there are over 5,200 magnet schools \nserving approximately 1.5 million students. Magnet schools foster \ndiversity and promote academic excellence in math, science, performing \narts and marketable vocational skills.\n  Parents deserve more choice in their children's public schools. \nIncreasing parental choice will allow healthy competition between \npublic schools. Choice, of course, necessarily implies that one thing \nis being chosen over another. As a result, choice means competition \nwhich is a force that often hastens change and improvement in any \norganization or system. All schools, district and charter, are forced \nby competition to examine why parents, students, or prospective \nteachers might be choose to go to other schools. Even teachers' unions \nand school board associations are signing on to the concept of publicly \nfunded schools that operate outside most state and district \nregulations. In early 1996, the National Education Association promised \n$1.5 million to help its affiliates start charter schools in five \nStates and to study their progress. I am pleased that my esteemed \ncolleagues have made public school choice a primary component of this \namendment.\n\n  This amendment also deals with an issue we have frequently discussed \nduring this ESEA debate: the consolidation of many Federal programs. \nLet me say that I am not opposed to consolidating some Federal \nprograms. I do believe that there are important programs that are not \noverly burdensome on states and schools and that have proven \nsuccessful, and I believe that the success of these programs is due in \npart on the competitive grant process and Federal guidelines of the \nprograms. I know the Federal Government does not have all the answers \nand that we cannot always anticipate the needs of states and local \nschool districts throughout this country, and though I have some \nspecific concerns about the level of consolidation in the Lieberman \namendment, I support the streamlining of Federal programs and providing \nflexibility to states and school districts.\n  Despite my support for so many things in this amendment, I am \nultimately unable to support the Lieberman approach. The Federal \nGovernment is the only entity that ensures funding is provided to the \nmost disadvantaged populations in this country, like migrant children, \nhomeless and runaway youth, and immigrant children. I am greatly \nconcerned about the loss of Federal support for these vulnerable youth. \nTherefore, I cannot support the Lieberman approach despite my \ncommitment to so many of its\n\n[[Page S3661]]\n\nprovisions. The Federal Government's involvement in education has \nalways been to ensure that vulnerable populations are provided the \nadditional funds that are necessary to their educational success. And I \nhave heard from those people in Massachusetts who work with homeless \nyoung people and with troubled youth. And they have told me how \nincredibly important this Federal money is to these children. These \nchildren have so much going against their ability to succeed, I believe \nwe must maintain our commitment to those children.\n  I am encouraged by the work my colleagues have done on this \namendment. I am supportive of their new approach to public education \nreform and their attempt to draft legislation that would attract the \nsupport of both Republicans and Democrats. I am frustrated and saddened \nby the very partisan nature of this year's ESEA debate, and commend my \ncolleagues for their fresh approach to ESEA reauthorization and their \nattempts to attract support from both sides of the aisle.\n  I regret that I cannot support this amendment, but I look forward to \nworking with many my colleagues to address the concerns that I and \nother Senators have. I hope we can resolve these concerns and that we \ncan bring this divided Senate together on the issue of public \neducation. I look greatly forward to working with my colleagues in the \nfuture and deeply appreciate their hard work and new perspective on \nthis critically important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 5 minutes before the \nvote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Lieberman and his \ncosponsors for the focus and attention they have given to really the \ncentral priority for all families in this country in the area of \neducation. The restlessness those Senators and others have with regard \nto making sure we are going to try to reach every needy child in this \ncountry is something we all should embrace and support.\n  I am not sure at this hour of the day, so to speak, in terms of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, if it is possible to bring \nabout the kind of change and focus that is desirable. But there are \nbroad areas of support and agreement for that concept in terms of \nenhanced resources and enhanced accountability.\n  I certainly look forward to working with him in the future on this \nwhole area of education.\n  I think the ideas that have been out there in terms of Safe and Drug-\nFree Schools, which has been basically a bipartisan effort in giving \nnational focus and attention to that, and a sense of urgency, are still \nimportant to preserve. Senator DeWine and Senator Dodd worked out an \neffort in that area in our committee. I think it is important to \npreserve it. The progress we have made in technology I think is worth \npreserving. The afterschool programs are really the most heavily \nsubscribed programs. They also have bipartisan support and are a matter \nof national urgency. I don't think they have gotten the kind of \nattention they should have in the Lieberman amendment.\n  Finally, there are several programs that are working very well in \nterms of being included in the consolidation program. One of them I \nhave particular interest in is ``Ready to Learn.'' There is $11 million \non ``Ready to Learn.'' It is done through the Public Broadcasting \nSystem. It reaches 94 percent of the country, 87 million homes, 37 \nmillion children, and received 57 Emmys. If you ask any public \nbroadcaster in the 130 stations nationwide what the best children's \nprogram is, they will mention this one. I don't want to see that lost \nand sent back to any State thinking that could be recomposed.\n  The Star Schools Program works through nonprofits, again, led by \nstrong bipartisan support, to try to reach out to schools that may not \nhave a math and science teacher and up-to-date educational programs, \nand has been done through a number of States. It has been very \neffective through nonprofits. That is another program. It is a small \nprogram, but it has enormous educational values.\n  With reluctance, because I have great friendship and affection for my \nfriend from Connecticut, I will not vote in support of it. But I want \nto certainly guarantee to him and to all of those who have been \nuniformly strong sponsors in our committee that I want to work closely \nwith our colleagues on the other side to try to give greater focus and \nattention to the problems of the neediest students in the country.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded.\n  Do the Senators wish the vote to begin early?\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

If I could get this unanimous consent request in, then we \nwould understand what the procedure would be for today and tomorrow and \neven Thursday morning. So if my colleagues will bear with me one \nmoment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 a.m. on \nWednesday, the Senate proceed to the conference report to accompany the \nAfrica trade bill, that the report be considered as having been read, \nand the vote occur on adoption of the motion to proceed immediately, \nand following the vote and the reporting by the clerk, I be immediately \nrecognized to send a cloture motion to the desk. I also ask unanimous \nconsent that the cloture vote occur on Thursday, May 11, at 10:30 a.m., \nwith the mandatory quorum having been waived.\n  This has been discussed with the Democratic leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I would like to see if we \ncould give at least some assurances to the Members about when we would \ncome back to deal with the education legislation.\n  As the Senator himself knows, this is our one chance every 5 or 6 \nyears to try to deal with this issue. We have been making some progress \nduring the course of these last few days. We do not have a whole long \nlist of amendments, and we are prepared to deal with short time limits.\n  I am wondering now whether the leader could give us at least some \nidea when we are going to come back to it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me again emphasize, first, that this would provide for \na vote at 9:30 in the morning on the motion to proceed to the Africa \nand CBI trade bill. If it is agreed to, then the cloture vote, by \nagreement, will be Thursday morning at 10:30.\n  With regard to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, our \ncolleagues probably are aware we have already agreed that there are two \nmore amendments that, by unanimous consent, we would go to next--the \nStevens-Jeffords and others amendment; to be followed by a Kennedy \namendment. So we have the next group of two amendments that would be in \norder.\n  I have discussed this with Senator Daschle. It is our intent, now \nthat we have appropriations bills that are becoming available, that, \nfor probably now on into the summer, we are going to be dual-tracking \nbills wherever it is necessary, so we can get an appropriations bill \ndone or an urgent bill such as the conference report on Africa trade \nand CBI. There is a belief we should go ahead and get that done and \nmove to appropriations bills when they are available, and then come \nback to the authorizations, whether it is the elementary and secondary \neducation bill or trade bill or whatever it may be.\n  So it is our intent to come back to ESEA and proceed with the \namendments that it is already been agreed we will consider next while \nwe work to see if we can get another grouping of two or more amendments \nto be considered.\n  I agree, there has been good debate. The amendments have been focused \non elementary and secondary education, and we have amendments still \npending on both sides that relate to that. As long as there is that \nkind of cooperation and progress being made, I think we should continue \nto pursue it.\n  So it is my intent to come back to elementary and secondary \neducation, if not later on this week, then next week, when we have a \nwindow.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator has said. \nAs I understand, he will make the best effort to come back to it this \nweek, but we will have an opportunity to come back to it next week. Is \nthat the leader's plan?\n\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my hope and intent. We should be able to do that \nand continue to move appropriations bills, also.\n  Again, it will take cooperation on the MILCON construction \nappropriations bill, which does have the military funding for Kosovo \nand for the fuel costs. We have the agriculture bill that is available \nthat has, I believe, the disaster funding in it in addition to the \nregular agricultural appropriations programs. And the Foreign \nOperations bill has been reported.\n  But we will work with the leadership as to exactly when those will \ncome up. We will try to move through those three as quickly as we can \nand try to move the Africa trade bill with the CBI provisions, and the \nESEA. I think those three appropriations bills and these two--the \nconference report and this authorization bill--will take the remainder \nof the time probably for the next couple weeks. We are going to stay on \nit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just further reserving the right to \nobject, and I will not object, I take the assurances of the leader that \nwe will return to this in every expectation next week. I think there \nare many of us who believe this issue is of equal importance to a \nnumber of the appropriations bills, since we are talking about \nappropriations next fall, next October, and we are running late in \nterms of the ESEA. So there is a real sense of urgency about it. But I \nam grateful to the leader for giving us those assurances.\n  I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could go further, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time between 9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. on Thursday be \nequally divided in the usual form on the subject of the African and CBI \ntrade bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, a rollcall vote will occur at 9:30 a.m. on \nWednesday, and a vote is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Thursday. There \nmay be additional votes after that.\n  I think Members should expect additional votes on Thursday, although \nwe have not agreed to what they would be at this point.\n  I do want to note that I certainly believe the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act is very important. That is why we have been on \nit the second week. We have given a lot of time to it. I think that is \nfine. This is a high priority in the minds of the American people and \nevery State in the Nation, and with us.\n  However, the appropriations bills each have emergency provisions in \nthem--an emergency for the Kosovo funding and the fuel costs for our \nmilitary; the agriculture bill has the emergency disaster funding in \nit, though some of it for North Carolina, and expected disasters; and \nthe Foreign Operations bill has funding in it for the very dangerous \nsituation involving Colombian drugs. That is why we are going to be \ntrying to move those as quickly as possible.\n  I thank my colleagues and announce there will be no further votes \nthis evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3662-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate Appropriations Committee today \nadopted, by a very strong bipartisan vote, an amendment authored by \nSenator Warner and myself that addresses the ongoing role of United \nStates participation in the Kosovo peacekeeping operation. Our \namendment, which was attached to a Kosovo supplemental appropriations \npackage, is cosponsored by Senator Stevens and a number of other \nSenators on both the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees.\n  The Byrd-Warner amendment goes to the heart of the constitutional \nresponsibility of Congress to address issues involving the deployment \nof U.S. military troops to politically unstable and potentially \ndangerous war-ravaged nations overseas.\n  I am troubled by the trend that has developed in recent years to de \nfacto authorize military operations through appropriations bills \nwithout further congressional discussion or debate on the policy. Under \nthis practice, the Executive Branch determines how and\n\n[[Page S3663]]\n\nwhere it will spend the money, and how much money it will spend, and \nthen presents the bill to Congress. We saw it happen in Bosnia, in \nHaiti, in Somalia, and now it is happening in Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that such a back-door authorization \nprocess is what the founding fathers had in mind when they delegated to \nCongress alone the power of the purse.\n  By continuing to allow the Executive Branch to deploy U.S. troops \noverseas and merely send the bill to Congress later, Congress is \neffectively abrogating its responsibility under the Constitution and to \nthe American people.\n  The Byrd-Warner amendment restores congressional oversight to the \ncalculation. Our amendment cuts off funding for the continued \ndeployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, \nunless the President seeks and receives congressional authorization to \ncontinue such deployment. At the same time, the amendment requires the \nPresident to develop a plan to turn the Kosovo peacekeeping operation \nentirely over to our allies by July 1, 2001.\n  The amendment provides ample time and an orderly process for this \nPresident, and the next President, to either develop a plan to turn the \nground troop element of the Kosovo peacekeeping operation entirely over \nto the Europeans, or to seek congressional authorization to keep United \nStates ground troops in Kosovo.\n  As an interim step, the amendment withholds 25 percent of the Kosovo \nmoney included in the supplemental appropriations package pending \ncertification by the President that America's allies are making \nadequate progress in meeting their monetary and personnel commitments \nto the Kosovo peacekeeping operation. The certification is due by July \n15. If the President cannot make the certification, the funds held in \nreserve can only be used to withdraw United States troops from Kosovo \nunless Congress votes otherwise.\n  Mr. President, this is a reasoned and reasonable approach to dealing \nwith foreign peacekeeping operations. Senator Warner and I believe that \nit can be executed without major disruption to the NATO peacekeeping \nmission in Kosovo. We are not turning our backs on Kosovo. We are not \nattempting to micromanage the Pentagon. We are merely attempting to \nrestore congressional oversight to the peacekeeping process.\n  When it comes to exercising its constitutional authority, Congress \nhas been sleeping on its rights. This amendment is a long overdue wake-\nup call. I thank Senator Warner for his work on the amendment, and for \nhis unswerving dedication to the nation and to the Senate, and I look \nforward to continuing to work with him on this very important issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ndistinguished colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, as his \nprincipal cosponsor on this important Kosovo amendment which was \nadopted this morning by the Appropriations Committee. We have worked \ntogether as partners on this endeavor for the past several weeks, and I \nhave confidence that the outcome of our efforts is sound precedent for \nour Nation's security policy.\n  The amendment which will soon be before the full Senate is a true \ncollaboration--a melding of the original Warner certification amendment \nand the long-standing efforts of Senator Byrd to ensure that Congress \nexercises its constitutional role in decisions to deploy U.S. troops \ninto harm's way.\n  There are two main goals that we are seeking to accomplish: first, to \nensure that our allies are shouldering their commitments, their fair \nshare of the burden for implementing stability and peace in Kosovo; \nand, second, to require the Congress to fulfill its constitutional \nresponsibility to vote on the continued deployment of U.S. ground \ncombat troops in Kosovo.\n  I would like to address--up front--what we are not doing with this \namendment. We are not doing a ``cut and run'' from Kosovo. We are not \ndeserting our NATO allies. I want to be very clear on these points. We \nare simply saying that our allies must fulfill the commitments which \nthey made--I repeat, which they made--to provide assistance and \npersonnel to rebuild the civil society in Kosovo; and that the Congress \nmust take action--vote--to specifically authorize the continued \npresence of United States ground combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, \n2001.\n  These are not precipitous or ill-conceived measures. They are \nsupported by a respected group of cosponsors who are all strong \nsupporters of NATO and who are determined not to let the United States \nmilitary simply drift into an endless presence in Kosovo. The vote in \nthe Appropriations Committee was overwhelmingly in favor of the Byrd-\nWarner amendment--23 to 3.\n  I would like to address in detail the certification requirement \ncontained in this amendment, as it is an updated version of an \namendment I originally put before the Senate on March 9. Subsection (d) \nof the Byrd-Warner amendment would provide 75 percent of the over $2 \nbillion contained in the Supplemental for military operations in Kosovo \nimmediately--no strings attached. The expenditure of the remaining 25 \npercent of the funding would be dependent on a certification by the \nPresident that our allies had provided a certain percentage of their \ncommitments of assistance and personnel to Kosovo. If the President is \nnot able to make that certification by July 15, 2000, then the \nremaining 25 percent of the Kosovo funds contained in the fiscal year \n2000 supplemental could be used only to conduct the safe, orderly and \nphased withdrawal of our troops from Kosovo. This limitation could be \novercome by a vote of the Congress--under expedited procedures--to \nallow the money to be used for the continued deployment of our troops \nin Kosovo, despite the lack of the Presidential certification.\n  Why do I feel so strongly about our Allies meeting their commitments \nin Kosovo? Because of the sacrifices of our brave men and women in \nuniform who bore the major share of the burden for the air war in \nKosovo, and the continuing sacrifices of our troops, today and for the \nfuture, on the ground in Kosovo. As my colleagues know, the United \nStates flew almost 70 percent of the total number of strike and \nsupport sorties in Operation Allied Force, at great personal risk, \nparticularly to our aviators, and at a cost of over $4 billion to the \nU.S. taxpayers.\n\n  In return, the Europeans have promised to pay the major share of the \nburdens to implement and secure the peace. So far, they have committed \nand pledged billions of dollars and thousands of personnel for this \ngoal. The problem is that not enough of the money or the necessary \npersonnel have made it to Kosovo.\n  Since I first signaled my intentions on this amendment several months \nago, considerable progress has been made--I gratefully acknowledge \nthis. There has been a positive response from our allies. But more \nneeds to be done, particularly in the areas of police and \nreconstruction.\n  What is happening as approval of this assistance for Kosovo is slowly \nworking its way slowly through the bureaucracies in Europe? Our troops, \nand the troops of other nations, are having to make up for the \nshortfall--by performing basic police functions, running towns and \nvillages, guarding individual homes and historic sites, escorting \nethnic minorities--all functions for which they were not specifically \ntrained and which increase their level of personal risk. When will this \nend? Time is of the essence as our troops stand in harm's way until \nrelieved, in large measure, by civilians specially trained.\n  General Klaus Reinhardt, the fine German general who recently \nrelinquished command of KFOR, said that he expects military elements of \nKFOR to be in Kosovo for a decade. I find this unacceptable, but I can \nsee how it is possible if we do not move quickly to establish the basic \neconomic and security infrastructure in Kosovo that is essential for \nlong-lasting stability in that troubled region. That is one of the main \ngoals of this amendment--to spur our allies on to quickly fulfill their \ncommitments.\n  What we cannot--must not--allow to happen is for the current \nsituation in Kosovo to drift on. There are problems. They must be \naddressed and addressed in a timely manner.\n  The principal sponsor of this amendment, the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia and noted historian has eloquently addressed \nthe constitutional responsibility of the Congress in deploying U.S. \nmilitary forces overseas. I would simply add that it is\n\n[[Page S3664]]\n\ntime--past time--for the Congress to fulfill its obligations regarding \nour deployment to Kosovo. Since last June, the United States has had \nthousands of troops engaged in a dangerous operation in Kosovo, and \nthus far Congress has taken no action, other than emergency \nsupplemental appropriations, on this deployment.\n  This is disappointing, but not surprising. The last time the Congress \nexercised its constitutional responsibility to declare war was during \nWorld War II. Since that time, the United States military has been \ninvolved in over 100 military deployments--including the Korean \nconflict and the war in Vietnam. and where has the Congress been during \nall of that time? We occasionally pass resolutions authorizing the use \nof force--as we did for the Persian Gulf conflict--but more often than \nnot, we simply fail to act. That must stop. We owe it to our brave men \nand women in uniform to act on their behalf. They are fulfilling their \nresponsibilities; we must fulfill ours.\n  This amendment does not say we must leave Kosovo. This amendment does \nnot mean that we are shirking our NATO responsibilities. This amendment \nsimply says that Congress--as a co-equal branch on foreign policy \nmatters--must exercise its constitutional responsibilities and \nauthorize the continued deployment of United States ground combat \ntroops in Kosovo.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in our effort to prevent an open-\nended United States military commitment in Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, in summary, the Byrd-Warner amendment was today \nadopted by an overwhelming majority of 23 to 3 in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  This is an amendment on which Senator Byrd and I have worked for the \nbetter part of 2 months. We have had extensive consultations with a \nnumber of our colleagues, and thus far we have, as cosponsors, Senators \nStevens, Inouye, Thurmond, Roberts, Snowe, Inhofe, Gregg, Smith of New \nHampshire, and Sessions. There are others who will be added in due \ncourse.\n  Senator Byrd and I are concerned about two things: The indefinite \ncommitment of our troops into the Kosovo situation and that indefinite \ncommitment not being backed up by an affirmative action of the Congress \nof the United States, which has a clear responsibility to act when we \nsend young men and women into harm's way.\n  This is not a cut-and-run amendment. This is simply an assertion that \nthe United States together with its allies is trying to bring about \npeace and stability in that region. We have succeeded after an \nextensive 78-day combat mission, 70 percent of which missions were \nflown by the U.S. airmen. It is time to address the future and to have \nour allies meet their commitments in a timely fashion, commitments they \nmade prior to the combat action and shortly thereafter.\n  Secondly, we believe there should be some certainty as to how long \nour troops must remain in this commitment. It cannot be indefinite. We \nare, as a nation, now with troops all over the world. And we are \nstretched. We are having problems with retention, problems with \nrecruiting because of the overextension of the U.S. military forces.\n  What Senator Byrd has emphasized--and many times on the floor of the \nSenate--is it is the duty of the Congress of the United States, through \na vote, to affirm the policies of the executive branch as we deploy our \ntroops into harm's way.\n  So those are the basic elements of this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the amendment be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Byrd-Warner Amendment\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ____.

I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding the time. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3665-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3665-S3676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I have \nintroduced with 27 cosponsors, and we invite other Members to join us. \nIt is an amendment to deal with early learning opportunities of our \nchildren.\n  Research shows that children's brains are wired--literally wired--\nbetween the ages of birth and 6 years of age. The number of synopses \nthat the brain forms, that is, the connections in the brain, depends \nupon the level of brain stimulation. The capacity to learn and interact \nsuccessfully in society is determined even before children begin \nschool. Long-term studies looking at data over 30 years show that \nchildren who participate in early learning programs are less likely to \nrequire special education, less likely to suffer from mental illness \nand behavior disorders, less likely to become pregnant before they are \nmarried, more likely to graduate from high school and college, less \nlikely to be arrested and incarcerated, have lower recidivism rates if \nthey are incarcerated, less likely to be violent and engaged in child \nor spousal abuse, and they earn higher salaries when they become \nadults. Both the General Accounting Office and the Rand Corporation \nmade studies which showed that for each dollar invested in early \nlearning programs, taxpayers saved between $4 and $7 in later years.\n  This amendment provides for block grants to States. States will work \nwith local governments, nonprofit corporations, and even faith-based \ninstitutions to determine what is needed most at their own local level. \nLocal entities can use the funds to expand Even Start, the program for \nchildren from birth to 3 years of age; expand Head Start to more \nchildren, expand it to full day or year-round coverage; offer nursery \nand preschool programs; train parents and child care professionals in \nchild development, and provide parent training and support programs for \nstay-at-home moms and dads.\n  The amendment provides set-asides for Indian tribes and Native groups \nand provides for a small State minimum of 0.4 percent. This amendment \nhas been endorsed now by the Christian Schools International, by \nParents United, United Way, some 1,400 local organizations, Fight \nCrime-Invest In Kids, 700 police chiefs, and the National Association \nfor the Education of Young Children, Children's Defense Fund, Child \nCare Resource Center, National Black Child Development Institute, and \nthe National Education Association.\n  As a father of six children, I come to this amendment late in my \nlife. I only wish I had had the opportunity to have had this type of \ninformation available to me and my wife when we, as a very young, newly \nmarried couple, decided to have our family very quickly. We had five \nchildren in less than 5 years, and there is a lot we had to learn along \nthe way.\n  This is a bill to try to make America think about what we want to be. \nWe have invested heavily in science, and through the decade of the \nbrain that was stimulated by our late departed friend, David Mahoney, \nand the group of scientists he put together with Dr. Jim Watson, who \nworked with him, we now know a lot more about the brain than we did a \ndecade ago. Basically, we learned of the fantastic capability of young \npeople to absorb knowledge and to be stimulated to develop the \nabilities to absorb even more knowledge as they grow older. I think \nthis is one of the most important things I have been involved in during \nmy life.\n  I believe it is a time for change, a time for us to recognize that \nyoung children--little babies--can be stimulated in a way that will \nassure their capability will be improved to learn and to be good \ncitizens and, in particular, to be able to lead the kind of lives their \nparents dreamed they would lead. I thank every Member who has \ncosponsored this amendment, and I hope for its early adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I express my appreciation \nfor the excellent statement that the Senator from Alaska has just given \nand thank him for his leadership on this issue. I also thank the \nchairman, Senator Jeffords, for his hard work on this issue as well. \nBoth of them have helped us understand how parents and other caregivers \ncan have a very positive impact on children and infants at very early \nages. I thank colleagues on our side, including my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator John Kerry, who has been particularly interested \nin this issue and has spent a great deal of time on it, and also the \nSenator from Connecticut, Senator Chris Dodd, who has\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\nled our efforts on issues involving children for many, many years. \nFinally, I want to thank Stephanie Robinson of my staff, who is sitting \nhere on my left, for her insight and diligence as we have worked \nthrough the details of this early learning proposal.\n  I think the Senator from Alaska has really outlined a compelling case \nfor this issue. If we go back a little while and think of the first \nstudies--the Perry Preschool Program, which Senator Stevens mentioned--\nalmost 30 years ago, where the results have been followed over a period \nof years and have documented how early interventions for children \nresulted in more positive academic and lifestyle outcomes for many \nchildren.\n  I think that the Perry Preschool study caught the attention of a lot \nof educators. Then we had the meeting in 1990 when the Governors were \ntogether--the Charlottesville meeting. Many of the issues we have been \ntalking about these past few days recall the discussion surrounding \nearly learning that the Governors initiated back in 1990. And there the \nRepublican and Democratic Governors together announced that our first \npriority should be to have children ready to learn when they enter \nschool. They understood what was happening in the States, and that \nearly learning was a matter of enormous positive consequence for all \neducational and social service efforts. Even before brain research \nprovided a clear medical basis, Governors sensed that ``the earlier the \nbetter'' in terms of early interventions.\n  Then we had the studies done by the Carnegie Commission in 1993, \nwhich focused on impacts of these early interventions. Later, when we \nhad the Year of the Brain in 1996, I believe, we found further \ninformation as described by the Senator from Alaska, about the \nimportance of proper stimulation to the formation of brain synapses in \nyoung children. Important work continued throughout the 1990's by Dr. \nBrazelton and Dr. Zigler, who are really the godparents of this concept \nof early intervention.\n  The bottom line is that quality early learning experiences help \nchildren develop self-confidence, curiosity, social skills, and motor \nskills. These are the building blocks that children use to expand their \ninterest in learning when they get to school. They may also develop a \nsense of humor. They certainly learn consideration of others. These are \nbasic benefits of early learning, and they last a lifetime. They are \nabsolutely essential in terms of learning and academic achievement, but \nalso essential in terms of interpersonal skills, their own personal \nhappiness, and their own productivity and contributions as members of a \nsociety.\n\n  As we debate education policy, we must continue to find common ground \nthat enables us to act effectively. One of the most important \nopportunities is in early learning. Last month's Senate Budget \nResolution included a bipartisan amendment that reserved $8.5 billion \nto improve early learning services throughout the Nation. The Senate is \nclearly moving toward a commitment to ensure that each of the 23 \nmillion American children under age six is able to enter school ready \nto learn.\n  Senator Stevens and I worked together to build a strong bipartisan \ncoalition for this reserve fund in the Senate resolution, and now is \nthe time to continue these efforts. As we consider the investments that \nare needed in education, we cannot ignore early childhood learning.\n  Education occurs over a continuum that begins at birth and extends \nthroughout life. The need to do more to make greater educational \nopportunities available in a child's very early years is clear. Study \nafter study proves that positive learning experiences very early in \nlife significantly enhance a child's later ability to learn, to \ninteract successfully with teachers and peers, and to master needed \nskills. It is long past time to put this research into practice.\n  Just last week Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a 700-member bipartisan \ncoalition of police chiefs, sheriffs, and crime victims, released yet \nanother convincing report. It finds that children who receive quality \nearly learning are half as likely to commit crimes and be arrested \nlater in life.\n  Early learning programs are good for children, good for parents and \ngood for society as a whole. Unfortunately, far too many parents lack \naccess to quality early learning activities for their children while \nthey work. Although two thirds of mothers work outside the home, only \n58% of 3- and 4-year-olds living above the poverty level, and 41% of \nthose living below the poverty level, are enrolled in center-based \nearly learning programs.\n  A dramatic recent survey found that more parents are satisfied with \nHead Start than any other federal program. But only two in five \neligible children are enrolled in Head Start - and only one in 100 \neligible infants and toddlers are enrolled in Early Head Start. As a \nresult, literally millions of young children never have the chance to \nreach their full potential. What a waste! We must do better. We can do \nbetter.\n  The Committee for Economic Development reports that we can save over \nfive dollars in the future for every dollar we invest in early learning \ntoday, the investment significantly reduces the number of families on \nwelfare, the number of children in special education, and the number of \nchildren in our juvenile justice system. Investment in early learning \nis not only morally right - it is economically right.\n  We must steadily expand access to Head Start and Early Head Start. We \nmust make parenting assistance available to all who want it. We must \nsupport model state efforts that have already proved successful, such \nas Community Partnerships for Children in Massachusetts and Smart Start \nin North Carolina, which rely on local councils to identify the early \nlearning needs in each community and allocate new resources to meet \nthem. We must give higher priority to early childhood literacy. In ways \nsuch as these, we must take bolder action to strengthen early learning \nopportunities in communities across the Nation.\n\n  The Rand Corporation reports: ``After critically reviewing the \nliterature and discounting claims that are not rigorously demonstrated, \nwe conclude that these [early learning] programs can provide \nsignificant benefits.'' Governors, state legislatures, local \ngovernments, and educators have all called for increased federal \ninvestments in early learning as the most effective way to promote \nhealthy and constructive behavior by future adults. As we strengthen \neducation policy, we cannot lose sight of the evidence that education \nbegins at birth--and is not a process that occurs only in a school \nbuilding during a school day.\n  We must examine children's experience during the five or six years \nbefore they walk through their first schoolhouse door. Our goal is to \nenable all children to enter school ready to learn, and maximize the \nimpact of our investments in education.\n  It is especially important that low-income parents who accept the \nresponsibility of work under welfare reform to have access to quality \nearly learning opportunities for their children. The central idea of \nwelfare reform is that families caught in a cycle of dependence can be \nshown that work pays. Today I am proud to stand with so many Senators \nwho agree that children's development must not be sacrificed as we help \nfamilies move from welfare to work.\n  A decade ago the Nation's Governors agreed that helping children \nenter school ready to learn should be America's number one priority. We \nhave made some progress since then, but we are still falling far short \nof our goal.\n  In Massachusetts, the Community Partnerships for Children Program \ncurrently provides quality full-day early learning for 15,300 young \nchildren from low-income families. Yet today in Massachusetts over \n14,000 additional eligible children are waiting for the early learning \nservices they need--and some have been on the waiting list for 18 \nmonths. A 1999 report by the Congressional General Accounting Office on \nearly learning services for low-income families was unequivocal--\n``infant toddler care [is] still difficult to obtain.''\n  Even as the need to provide these opportunities increases, it is \nclear that many current facilities are unsafe. The average early \nlearning provider is paid under seven dollars an hour--less than the \naverage parking attendant or pet sitter. These low wages result in high \nturnover, poorer quality of care, and little trust and bonding with the \nchildren.\n  Here in the Senate, we have worked together for several months on a \nproposal to enable local communities to\n\n[[Page S3667]]\n\nfill the gaps that impair current early learning efforts. Our amendment \nprovides $3.25 billion for early learning programs over the next three \nyears. Local councils will direct the funds to the most urgent needs in \neach community. The needs may include parenting support and education--\nimproving quality through professional development and retention \ninitiatives--expanding the times and the days children can obtain these \nservices--enhancing childhood literacy--and greater early learning \nopportunities for children with special needs. These funding priorities \nare well-designed to strengthen early learning programs in all \ncommunities across the country, and give each community the opportunity \nto invest the funds in ways that will best address its most urgent \nneeds.\n\n  I urge the Senate to approve it as a long overdue recognition of this \nimportant aspect of education reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several letters of \nsupport for this amendment be printed in the Record immediately after \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered. (See Exhibit \n1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, when the Senator brings this to the \nattention of the Senate, it is a matter of enormous importance and \nsignificance. I pay tribute to him and to our chairman, Senator \nJeffords, who has been a strong supporter. I know there are others on \nthat side, but they have been real giants in this area of concern and \nhave been enormously constructive and helpful in moving us towards a \nlegislative initiative in this area.\n  I am very grateful to my colleagues, Senator Kerry and Senator Dodd, \nfor the extraordinary work they have done.\n  I am very hopeful that at an early time we can have favorable \nconsideration.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\n\n\n                                      Department of Education,\n\n                                          Malden, MA, May 5, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I want to express my strong support \n     for the Early Learning Opportunities Act as an amendment to \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. High quality \n     early care and education programs are vital to children's \n     development as well as to the national goal for all children \n     to enter school ready to learn. It is also essential that the \n     methods used to increase support for families and young \n     children be flexible and responsive to the diverse needs and \n     resources of communities and families across the country.\n       The program outlined in this proposal is quite consistent \n     with our state preschool program, Community Partnerships for \n     Children. For example, Massachusetts has many local councils \n     working collaboratively to design comprehensive early care \n     and education programs that ensure that funds are used in \n     ways that are consistent with local needs. Our programs also \n     conduct many family support and family literacy activities \n     such as those described in your plan. Through our experience \n     with Community Partnerships, we know that these elements as \n     well as transportation and professional development are \n     essential to helping early childhood programs achieve their \n     potential to support young children and families.\n       With the in mind, I would like to express one concern. As \n     is, the program is created within Health and Human Services \n     and is ``entirely independent of ESEA.'' Historically, child \n     care has been administered through human services agencies \n     and it is likely that the program would be passed on through \n     the states' social services infrastructure. At the same time, \n     many of the program's purposes are based on the potential of \n     early childhood programs as educational for children and \n     parents. Based on many years of watching how our local \n     collaborations evolve, it is clear that state and local \n     linkages among Head Start, private child care and public \n     preschools and elementary schools are becoming increasingly \n     important, but are not easy. I believe the separation from \n     ESEA at the national and state levels would not encourage \n     these linkages. Although the program should support the \n     growth and improvement of private child care and Head Start \n     programs, a close connection with ESEA at the national and \n     state levels would model the educational intention of the \n     program and would build on existing Title I preschool \n     programs programs at the local level.\n       To reiterate--the plan that has been proposed is very \n     promising and I strongly support this amendment.\n           Secerely,\n                                                David H. Driscoll,\n     Commissioner of Education.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 4, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to urge you to support the Early \n     Learning Opportunities Act, sponsored by Senators Kennedy, \n     Stevens, Jeffords and Dodd, as an amendment to the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act. This Early Learning Amendment \n     would help states to create and enhance the programs and \n     services that infants and toddlers, and their parents, \n     urgently need to ensure that young children will enter school \n     ready to learn.\n       As you know, research clearly shows that the first few \n     years of a child's life set the stage for a lifetime of \n     learning. Time and again we see that healthy children who \n     have formed secured and loving attachments to adults grow up \n     to be hard working, productive members of society. But \n     children cannot develop in a healthy manner without access to \n     early learning programs, quality child care and health care, \n     and special services for children and families at risk. \n     Furthermore, a recent report issued by Fight Crime: Invest in \n     Kids concludes that federal, state, and local governments \n     could greatly reduce crime and violence by assuring families \n     access to quality, educational child care program.\n       Equally important is parent education. All parents, but \n     especially those in at-risk populations, need to know not \n     only how to effectively bond with their young children, but \n     how to access programs and services that help them to raise a \n     healthy child.\n       The Early Learning Amendment is an important step toward \n     improving the lives of America's youngest citizens. Not only \n     does it provide and vital funding for early childhood \n     programs and services, it gives states and localities the \n     flexibility to creatively meet the needs of their \n     populations.\n       Again, I urge you to support America's youngest children \n     and their families by voting for the Early Learning \n     Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rob Reiner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Parents United for Child Care,\n\n                                          Boston, MA, May 8, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the membership of Parents United \n     for Child Care (PUCC), I am writing to urge you to support \n     the Early Learning Opportunities Act sponsored by Senators \n     Stevens, Kennedy, Jeffords and Dodd. This amendment would \n     take important steps to ensuring the availability of high \n     quality early care and education experiences for millions of \n     American families.\n       PUCC is a grassroots membership organization of low- and \n     moderate-income parents committed to increasing the supply of \n     quality, affordable child care in Massachusetts. A small \n     group of Boston parents founded PUCC in 1987 with the mission \n     of creating and mobilizing a vocal constituency of parents to \n     impact child care policy in their communities and on the \n     state level. Since its founding PUCC has been working in \n     neighborhoods through Massachusetts to provide a parent voice \n     on public policy issues related to children families. A local \n     and national model of successful parent empowerment and \n     leadership, PUCC employs cutting edge organizing and \n     leadership development strategies to provide parents with the \n     necessary tools to take the lead in advocating for their own \n     child care needs.\n       As you know, recent research about the impact of the first \n     three years of life on children's brain development testifies \n     to the importance of a high-quality early care and education \n     experience, especially for children who are growing up in \n     poverty. In addition, policy makers--at the state and \n     national level--are increasingly acknowledging the importance \n     of child care an essential tool for building the economic \n     stability of working families. Finally, the implementation of \n     Education Reform across the country has focused a spotlight \n     on the importance of quality early learning opportunities in \n     preparing children for school. Unfortunately, too many \n     parents do not have access to the type of high quality early \n     care services that will allow them to go to work and help \n     their children to learn, play and thrive.\n       By supporting the Early Learning Amendment, you can make \n     children and families a priority and help parents, providers \n     and educators promote healthy physical and emotional \n     development for our children. Please do not hesitate contact \n     me for further information about Parents United for Child \n     Care. Thank you in advance for your consideration of this \n     request.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     Elaine Fersh,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Women's Law Center,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: We are writing to express our support \n     for your Early Learning Amendment to be offered to the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n       Research on early brain development and school readiness \n     demonstrates that the experiences children have and the \n     attachments they form in the earliest years of life have a \n     decisive, long-lasting impact on their later development and \n     learning. Yet, despite the importance of early childhood \n     learning, scarce resources limit the early childhood learning \n     opportunities of many children. Your Early Learning \n     Opportunities Amendment would provide grants to states and \n     communities to help ensure that significantly more children \n     across the country have positive early learning experiences. \n     The added resources that your amendment offers will allow \n     communities to improve and expand quality early childhood \n     programs, and\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\n     assist parents and early childhood providers meet the diverse \n     developmental needs of young children.\n       We appreciate your efforts to increase the availability and \n     quality of early childhood learning for children, and look \n     forward to working with you on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Nancy Duff Campbell,\n                                                     Co-President.\n     Judith C. Appelbaum,\n                                    Vice President and Director of\n     Employment Opportunities.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Black Child\n\n\n                                  Development Institute, Inc.,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to urge your support for the \n     Stevens-Kennedy-Jeffords-Dodd Early Learning Amendment to \n     ESEA.\n       Early care and education have been a leading tenet of the \n     National Black Child Development Institute since its \n     inception thirty years ago. Then, as now, we hold that there \n     is no more effective way to prepare children to succeed in \n     school and break the cycle of poverty than quality, \n     accessible early care and education. Recent studies have \n     shown that quality early education also reduces the \n     likelihood that a child will later be involved in the \n     juvenile justice system.\n       Despite its proven track record, Head Start is unable to \n     serve all the eligible children. Less than 1 in 10 children \n     eligible for the Child Development Block Grant are currently \n     served. While Head Start has a comprehensive program with \n     education and parental involvement, the programs funded under \n     CCDBG could be greatly enhanced with community-based \n     collaborations around parent training and developmentally \n     appropriate learning programs.\n       The Early Learning Amendment provides support for \n     communities to improve the quality of child care programs; to \n     provide parent education and training independent of a child \n     care setting; to provide training and professional \n     development for providers of early care and education.\n       These are important goals that will improve the quality of \n     life for our children and their communities for generations. \n     When we strength a child, we shape the future of our nation.\n       I urge your support for the Early Learning Amendment to \n     ESEA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Andrea Young,\n     Director of Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Child Care Resource Center, Inc.,\n\n                                       Cambridge, MA, May 4, 2000.\n       Dear Senators: The Child Care Resource Center (CCRC) in \n     Cambridge, MA, is one of 13 child care resource and referral \n     agencies across the state of Massachusetts. Agencies like \n     CCRC strive to strengthen the field of child care in four \n     ways: 1) we work with child care providers to increase the \n     quality of child care, 2) we work with parents to provide \n     consumer education, information and referrals to local child \n     care programs, 3) we work with low-income families to ensure \n     that they have access to quality affordable care and 4) work \n     with communities to utilize child care demand and supply data \n     for community planning purposes.\n       Working for a child care resource and referral agency \n     provides a unique perspective on the child care system as a \n     whole because we have the opportunity to work and interact \n     with all aspects of this system, including the \n     administration, the child care industry and families of all \n     incomes who are struggling to make ends meet and find a safe \n     nurturing environment for their child. From this \n     vantagepoint, we see first hand what is and is not working \n     with our system and where there are gaps in the services that \n     are offered.\n       Based on this knowledge and experience, I am writing today \n     in support of the Stevens-Kennedy-Jeffords-Dodd ``Early \n     Learning Opportunities'' amendment to ESEA. Recent research \n     has highlighted the importance of providing adequate \n     stimulation to children between the ages of 0 and 5 in order \n     to ensure the optimal physical and emotional development of a \n     young child's brain. This development can not be recaptured \n     during later years. Brain synopses that are not developed are \n     lost forever.\n       The Early Learning amendment is an important step towards \n     ensuring the availability of high-quality educational child \n     development programs to both child care providers and to \n     parents, two equally important components of the lives of our \n     children. As a country, we need to make a stronger investment \n     into supporting the healthy development of our youngest \n     resources. Children do not begin the learning process at the \n     age of five when they enter kindergarten. We must lay the \n     groundwork earlier to ensure that children not only develop \n     appropriately, but more importantly, thrive.\n       If you need any information or other materials to help you \n     in this important debate, please do not hesitate to contact \n     me at (617) 547-1063 ext 217 or CCRC's Public Policy Manager \n     Jennifer Murphy at (617) 547-1063 ext 234.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Marta T. Rosa,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Fight Crime: Invest in Kids,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: As an organization led by over 700 police \n     chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, leaders of police \n     organizations, and crime survivors, we write in strong \n     support of the Stevens-Kennedy-Jeffords-Dodd ``Early Learning \n     Opportunities'' amendment to ESEA.\n       The evidence is clear that well-designed early learning \n     programs for kids can dramatically reduce crime and violence, \n     and keep kids from becoming criminals. But these programs \n     remain so under-funded they reach only a fraction of the \n     youngsters who need them. For example:\n       A High/Scope Foundation study at the Perry Preschool in \n     Michigan randomly chose half of a group of at-risk toddlers \n     to receive a quality Head Start-style preschool program, \n     supplemented by weekly in-home coaching for parents. Twenty-\n     two years later, the toddlers left out of the program were \n     five times more likely to have grown up to be chronic \n     lawbreakers, with five or more arrests.\n       A new study of 1,000 at-risk children who attended the \n     Chicago Child Parent Centers found that the children of a \n     similar background who were left out of the program were \n     almost twice as likely to have two or more juvenile arrests.\n       Yet inadequate funding for these high quality child \n     development programs like these leaves millions of at-risk \n     children without critical early childhood services. Making \n     sure all children have access to educational childcare is one \n     of the four points of our School and Youth Violence \n     Prevention Plan, the key components of which have been \n     endorsed not only by each of Fight Crime's 700 law \n     enforcement leaders and victims of violence but also by the \n     National Sheriffs Association; the Major Cities [Police] \n     Chiefs Organizations; the Police Executive Research Forum; \n     the National District Attorneys Association--and dozens of \n     state law enforcement associations.\n       The Early Learning amendment is an important step towards \n     ensuring the availability of high-quality educational child \n     development programs. Those on the front lines of the battle \n     against crime know these investments are among our most \n     powerful weapons against crime.\n       For more information on the studies mentioned above, please \n     see our new report America's Child Care Crisis: A Crime \n     Prevention Tradegy co-authored by Dr. Berry Brazelton, Edward \n     Zigler, Lawrence Sherman, William Bratton, Jerry Sanders and \n     other child development and crime prevention experts.

Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of 1,400 United Ways across \n     the country, United Way of America (UWA) urges you to support \n     the Early Learning Amendment to the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act (ESEA) sponsored by Senators Stevens, Kennedy, \n     Jeffords, and Dodd. The amendment allots $6.25 billion over \n     five years to create a new program within the Department of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS) that will improve \n     opportunities for early learning and school readiness among \n     young children from birth through age six.\n       For the past ten years, United Ways have been committed to \n     early care and education through Success By 6', an \n     initiative that convenes local leadership (corporate, \n     government and nonprofit) to leverage resources, raise \n     awareness and impact policy on behalf of our youngest \n     citizens. In over 300 communities, Success By 6' \n     helps ensure a safe and nurturing environment for our \n     children. Early childhood development is critical to an \n     effective future workforce. Recent brain research has \n     confirmed that investing early has lifetime benefits and \n     positive implications for a child's success. The early \n     learning amendment will allow local communities to take to \n     scale existing early childhood initiatives and stimulate the \n     creation of new ones.\n       An investment in early learning and development is a \n     critical investment in our future. United Way of America \n     hopes that the Senate will make a renewed commitment to \n     America's children by supporting this amendment. If you need \n     more information, please contract Ilsa Flanagan, Senior \n     Director of Public Policy, at (703) 683-7817.\n           With appreciation,\n     Betty Beene.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 2, 2000.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We urge you to support the following \n     amendments to S. 2, the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act reauthorization that is currently being debated by the \n     full Senate, to help ensure that young children have the \n     strong start they need and older children the positive and \n     safe after-school experiences and the comprehensive supports \n     they need to succeed in school.\n       Stevens/Jeffords/Kennedy/Dodd Early Learning Opportunities \n     Amendment. This amendment would provide grants to states and \n     communities to improve and expand high-quality early learning \n     programs serving children ages zero to five years old. This \n     amendment would offer local communities much needed funds to \n     help both parents and early childhood providers meet the \n     varying needs of young children. Research is clear that \n     children, particularly disadvantaged\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\n     children, who have the opportunity to participate in high \n     quality early childhood programs are more likely to succeed \n     in school and in life.\n       Dodd Early Childhood Education Professional Development \n     Amendment. This amendment would provide resources to local \n     partnerships to provide professional development for early \n     childhood educators with a focus on early literacy and \n     violence prevention. Given the low salaries of child care \n     providers across the country, providers must have access to \n     resources from their communities in order to grow \n     professionally and provide high quality care in their \n     programs. It is exceedingly important to offer new \n     opportunities to strengthen their ability to work with \n     children. Gaining early literacy skills is essential to \n     children's ability to start school ready to read. High \n     quality early childhood programs have also demonstrated that \n     they can be effective in reducing the violent behavior that \n     can lead to delinquency.\n       Reed Child Opportunity Zone Family Centers Amendment. This \n     amendment would provide resources to help schools coordinate \n     with other local health and human services at or near the \n     school site to support children's ability to come to school \n     each day ready to learn. This will ensure that children have \n     the health and other supports they need to be able to thrive \n     and take full advantage of their education.\n       Dodd 21st Century Community Learning Centers Amendment. \n     This amendment would strengthen the collaboration among \n     schools and community-based organizations and bolster their \n     ability to provide enriching and educational after-school and \n     other community education programs.\n       These amendment would help provide critical support to both \n     younger and older children and their families, helping to \n     ensure that their school experience is a success. We urge you \n     to support them.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     ------ ------.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Geresh and Sarah Lemberg\n\n\n                                      Children's Center, Inc.,\n\n                                                      Waltham, MA.\n     From: Howard Baker, Executive Director.\n     To: Stephanie Robinson and Rachel Price, Staff of Senator \n         Kennedy.\n     Subject: Amendments to Early Learning Part of ESEA.\n       Comments: Thank you for sending me a copy of your proposed \n     amendments ESEA. I support your addressing special \n     educational needs (Part V,B,5), increased hours of care (Part \n     V,B,6), and increases in compensation and recruitment \n     incentives (Part V,B,7). I am glad to see the wording \n     ``grants supplemental not supplant existing early learning \n     resources'' (Part VII, G). As for the Funding total of $6.25 \n     billion over 5 years, more is better.\n       Also, I spoke with Kimberly Barnes O'Connor, she said: \n     ``Bringing up rates and wages in the ESEA is the wrong place. \n     These are issues for the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant.'' Is this your position as well?\n       Thanks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his kind comments. I want to echo what he has said. Senator \nJeffords has been a great leader in this area. As a matter of fact, he \nsort of encouraged me to get involved. I am happy to have been able to \nget involved. I told him it should have been the Jeffords-Stevens \namendment. In his typical Vermont reticence--he is a Yankee as far as I \nam concerned--he said, no, that I should put in the amendment and be \nthe sponsor. I am proud to do that. But the real voice of reason in \nthis amendment has been Senator Jeffords.\n  I am pleased to yield to him, and I thank him for his cooperation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have an engagement pending, so I will \nproceed now. I would love to be able to stay and listen to my friends.\n  I certainly thank the Senator from Alaska for his very fine words. He \nhas been an inspiration to all of us in bringing this forward. Without \nhis help and support, I am not so sure that we would be here today. I \nappreciate his efforts in making sure that our amendment be heard in a \ntimely manner.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the lady who \nis responsible for the cooperation is sitting to my right, our deputy \nchief of staff. She started on the mommy track about a year ago and \ntaught me all I know. So thank you very much.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator very much. Mr. President, I am very \nhappy to join a strong bi-partisan group of my colleagues in \nintroducing the ``Early Learning Opportunities Act'' amendment. The \ntwenty-eight co-sponsors of the amendment are: Senators Stevens, \nKennedy, Jeffords, Dodd, Domenici, Bond, Kerry, Voinovich, Lautenberg, \nMurray, Cochran, Bingaman, Smith of Oregon, Durbin, Chafee, Baucus, \nMurkowski, Robb, Rockefeller, Roberts, Wellstone, Feinstein, Mikulski, \nSnowe, Boxer, Kerrey, Specter, and Warner.\n  In 1989, President Bush met with Governors from across the nation and \nidentified a set of educational goals for our nation's children. The \nfirst national educational goal was that ``By the year 2000, all \nchildren in America will start school ready to learn,'' We have \nunfortunately failed to meet that critical goal.\n  Early childhood learning plays a key role in a child's future \nachievement and is the cornerstone of education reform. I am absolutely \nconvinced that we must invest in early childhood learning programs if \nwe are to have every child enter school ready to learn and succeed.\n  We know that from birth, the human brain is making the connections \nthat are vital to future learning. We know that what we do as parents, \ncare providers, educators, and as a society can either help or hurt a \nchild's ability to gain the skills necessary for success in school--- \nand in life.\n  Many of America's children enter school without the necessary \nabilities and maturity. Without successful remediation efforts, these \nchildren continue to lag behind for their entire academic career. We \nspend billions of dollars on efforts to help these children catch up. \nAs we demand that students and schools meet higher academic standards, \nthese efforts become much harder. An investment in early learning today \nwill save money tomorrow. Research has demonstrated that for each \ndollar invested in quality early learning programs, the Federal \nGovernment can save over five dollars--spend one, save five.\n  These savings result from future reductions in the number of children \nand families who participate in Federal Government programs like Title \nI special education and welfare.\n  This amendment is designed to help parents and care givers integrate \nearly childhood learning into the daily lives of their children.\n  Parents are the most important teachers of their children. If parents \nare actively engaged in their child's early learning, their children \nwill see greater cognitive and non-cognitive benefits.\n  Parents want their children to grow up happy and healthy. But few are \nfully prepared for the demands of parenthood. Many parents have \ndifficulty finding the information and support they need to help their \nchildren grow to their full potential. Making that information and \nsupport available and accessible to parents is a key component of this \namendment.\n  For many families, it is not possible for a parent to remain home to \ncare for their children. Their employment is not a choice, but an \nessential part of their family's economic survival.\n  And for most of these families, child care is not an option, but a \nrequirement, as parents struggle to meet the competing demands of work \nand family.\n  Just as it is essential that we provide parents with the tools they \nneed to help their children grow and develop, we also must help the \npeople who care for our nation's children while parents are at work.\n  Today, more than 13 million young children--including half of all \ninfants--spend at least part of their day being cared for by someone \nother than their parents.\n  In Vermont alone, there are about 22,000 children, under the age of \nsix, in state-regulated child care.\n  This amendment will provide communities with the resources necessary \nto improve the quality of child care. Funds can be used for \nprofessional development, staff retention and recruitment incentives, \nand improved compensation. By improving local collaboration and \ncoordination, child care providers--- as well as parents--- will be \nable to access more services, activities and programs for children in \ntheir care.\n  Our ``Early Learning Opportunities'' amendment will serve as a \ncatalyst to engage all sectors of the community in increasing programs, \nservices, and activities that promote the healthy development of our \nyoungest citizens. The amendment ensures that funds will be locally \ncontrolled.\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\n  Funds are channeled through the states to local councils. The \ncouncils are charged with assessing the early learning needs of the \ncommunity, and distributing the funds to a broad variety of local \nresources to meet those needs.\n  Local councils must work with schools in the community to identify \nthe abilities which need to be mastered before children enter school. \nFunds must be used for programs, activities and services which \nrepresent developmentally appropriate steps towards acquiring those \nabilities.\n  This amendment will expand community resources, improve program \ncollaboration, and engage our citizens in creating solutions. It will \nwill help parents and care givers who are looking for better ways to \ninclude positive learning experiences into the daily lives of our \nyoungest children.\n  When children enter school ready to learn, all of the advantages of \ntheir school experiences are opened to them---their opportunities are \nunlimited.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote for the ``Early Learning \nOpportunities Act'' amendment.\n  I urge you to give our nation's children every opportunity to succeed \nin school and in life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to lend my support to a critical \ncomponent of our efforts to reform the public education system and \nensure that all children can learn to high standards: a collaborative \napproach to increasing the availability of high-quality early learning \ninitiatives for young children. The amendment before us today \nrecognizes the importance that the early years of a child's life play \nin his or her future learning and development. This amendment \nacknowledges what we know to be to true: children who begin school \nlacking the ability to recognize letters, numbers, and shapes quickly \nfall behind their peers. Students who reach the first grade without \nhaving had the opportunity to develop cognitive or language \ncomprehension skills begin school at a disadvantage. Children who have \nnot had the chance to develop social and emotional skills do not begin \nschool ready to learn. Mr. President, we have the opportunity here \ntoday in this bipartisan amendment to see to it that all of our young \nchildren have access to high-quality early learning initiatives and \nthat all of our children begin school ready to learn.\n  The beauty of the approach that I am advocating for here today, is \nthat it builds upon existing early learning and child care programs in \neach and every community in this country. Mr. President, this early \nlearning amendment would provide support to families by minimizing \ngovernment bureaucracy and maximizing local initiatives. This amendment \nwould support the creation of local councils that will provide funding \nto communities to expand the thousands of successful early care and \neducation efforts that already exist. It will establish an early \nlearning infrastructure at the local level. This infrastructure will \nestablish the necessary linkages between private, public, and non-\nprofit organizations that seek to provide a healthy, safe, and \nsupportive start in learning and in life for children of pre-school \nage. Mr. President, this amendment provides the Senate with a \ncritically important bipartisan opportunity to support early learning \ncollaboratives at the state level, in towns, in cities, and in \ncommunities throughout this country.\n  I can attest to the success and importance of this collaborative \napproach, because I have seen it work. I was so convinced by what I saw \nin Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, Mr. President, that I introduced \nlegislation in the 105th and the 106th Congresses that is very similar \nto the amendment before us today. Let me tell you about the Early \nChildhood Initiative (ECI) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania--an \ninnovative program which helps low-income children from birth to age \nfive become successful, productive adults by enrolling them in high \nquality, neighborhood-based early care and education programs, ranging \nfrom Head Start, center-based child care, home-based child care, and \nschool readiness programs. ECI draws on everything that's right about \nAllegheny County--the strength of its communities--neighborhood \ndecision-making, parent involvement, and quality measurement. Parents \nand community groups decide if they want to participate and they come \ntogether and develop a proposal tailored for the community. Regular \nreview programs ensure quality programming and cost-effectiveness. \nWe're talking about local control getting results locally: 19,000 pre-\nschool aged children from low-income families, 10,000 of which were not \nenrolled in any childcare or education program. Evaluations have shown \nthat enrolled children are achieving at rates equivalent to their \nmiddle income peers. And as we know, without this leveling of the \nplaying field, low-income children are at a greater risk of \nencountering the juvenile justice system.\n  In the United States, child care, early learning, and school-age care \nresult from partnerships among the public sector--federal state, and \nlocal governments; the private sector--businesses and charitable \norganizations; and parents. Both the public and the private sectors \nhelp children get a strong start in life by supporting and providing \nchild care, by enhancing early learning opportunities, and by supplying \nschool-age care. Attention to early childhood development by so many \norganizations and levels of government is important and appropriate. \nBut oftentimes, early care and education is a hodgepodge of public and \nprivate programs, child-care centers, family day-care homes, and \npreschools and ironically the widespread concern for the provision and \nquality of such programs has led to what some experts in this field \nhave called a non-system.\n\n  I'd like to tell you about one of the most ground-breaking studies in \nthe effectiveness of early learning programs, called the Abecedarian \nProject, that is taking place at the University of North Carolina \nChapel Hill. This highly-regarded study has found that low-income \nchildren who received comprehensive, quality early educational \nintervention had higher scores on cognitive, reading, math tests than a \ncomparison group of children who did not receive the intervention. \nThese effects persisted through age 21. The study also found that young \npeople who had participated in the early education program were more \nlikely to attend a four-year college and to delay parenthood. And the \npositive impact of the early learning program was not just limited to \nthe children, Mr. President. Mothers whose children participated in the \nprogram achieved higher educational and employment status as well, with \nparticularly strong results for teen mothers.\n  Community collaboration allows a vast array of people to assess what \nsupport children and families need, what resources are available in \ntheir own community, and what new resources are necessary. \nCollaboration is a way to meet the needs of parents who work full time. \nFor example, children who attend a state-financed half-day preschool \nprogram in a child-care center are able to remain in the center after \nthe formal preschool program has ended until a parent finishes working \nwhen linkages between disparate programs are made. This sort of \ncontinuity can eliminate transportation problems that often plague \nworking families and stressful transitions for parents and children.\n  Child care and early learning are necessities for millions of \nAmerican families. Children of all income levels are cared for by \nsomeone other than their parents. Each day, an estimated 13 million \nchildren under age six--including children with mothers who work \noutside the home and those with mothers who do not--spend some or all \nof their day being cared for by someone other than their parents. Many \nof these children enter non-parental care by 11 weeks of age, and often \nstay in some form of child care until they enter school.\n  I commend my esteemed colleagues, Senator Stevens, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Bond, Senator Dodd, and the senior Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, who, as you all know, is a true leader in this area, \nfor working so diligently on this amendment. And I'm pleased to have \nthe opportunity to be here on the floor to discuss this bipartisan \nlegislation. Indeed, supporting states and local early learning \ncollaboratives is not a partisan\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\nissue. In fact. Mr. President, the legislation that I introduced in the \n105th and 106th Congresses, the Early Childhood Development Act, would \nsupport a collaborative approach and sustain an early learning \ninfrastructure. My legislation has been supported by Senators on both \nsides of the aisle. I commend my colleagues--Senator Bond, Senator \nGordon Smith, Senator Snowe, Senator Collins, and the late Senator \nChafee, for supporting this important, non-partisan educational \npriority and approach to improving early learning opportunities for all \nchildren. And I particularly commend the bipartisan group of leaders on \nthis amendment.\n  Early childhood programs are cost effective and can result in \nsignificant savings in both the short- and the long-term. For example, \nthe High/Scope Foundation's Perry Preschool Study examined the long-\nterm impact of a good early childhood program for low-income children. \nResearches found that after 27 years, each $1.00 invested in the \nprogram saved over $7.00 by increasing the likelihood that children \nwould be literate, employed, and enrolled in postsecondary education, \nand making them less likely to be school dropouts, dependent on \nwelfare, or arrested for criminal activity or delinquency. A study of \nthe short-term impact of a pre-kindergarten program in Colorado found \nthat it resulted in cost savings of $4.7 million over just three years \nin reduced special education costs.\n  Child care and early learning are particularly important for low-\nincome children and children with other risk factors. Good early care \nand education programs help children enter school ready to succeed in a \nnumber of ways, and have a particularly strong impact on low-income \nchildren who are at greater risk for school failure. Mr. President, \nreading difficulties in young children can be prevented if children \narrive in the first grade with strong language and cognitive skills and \nthe motivation to learn to read, which are needed to benefit from \nclassroom instruction.\n  Law enforcement has attested to the importance of early learning \nprograms. A poll of police chiefs from across the country found that \nnearly none out of ten (86 percent) said that ``expanding after-school \nand child care programs like Head Start will greatly reduce youth crime \nand violence.'' Nine out of ten also agreed that a failure to invest in \nsuch programs to help children and youth now would result in greater \nexpenses later in crime, welfare, and other costs. Police chiefs ranked \nproviding ``more after-school programs and educational child care'' as \nthe most effective strategy for reducing youth violence four times as \noften as ``prosecuting more juveniles as adults'' and five times as \noften as ``hiring more police officers to investigate juvenile crime.''\n\n  I urge my colleagues to think about what is at stake here. Poverty \nseriously impairs young children's language development, math skills, \nIQ scores, and their later school completion. Poor young children also \nare at heightened risk of infant mortality, anemia, and stunted growth. \nOf the millions children under the age of three in the U.S. today, 25 \npercent live in poverty. Three out of five mothers with children under \nthree work, but one study found that 40 percent of the facilities at \nchild care centers serving infants provided care of such poor quality \nas to actually jeopardize children's health, safety, or development. \nLiterally the future of millions of young people is at stake here. \nLiterally that's what we're talking about. But is it reflected in the \ninvestments we make here in the Senate? I would, respectfully, say no--\nnot nearly enough, Mr. President. But today, during this debate on the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, we have a genuine opportunity \nto make a meaningful difference and contribution to the lives of poor \nchildren in this country.\n  I'd also like to discuss the results of a study conducted by the \nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development. This study \nhas been following a group of children to compare the development of \nchildren in high quality child care with that of children in lower \nquality child care. Researchers have thus far tracked the children's \nprogress from age three through the second grade. At the end of this \nmost recent study period, children in high quality child care \ndemonstrated greater mathematics ability, greater thinking and \nattention skills, and fewer behavioral problems. These differences held \ntrue for children from a range of family backgrounds, with particularly \nsignificant effects for children at risk.\n  Let me explain why this legislation is so fundamentally important and \nwhy it is clear we are not doing enough to ensure that our youngest \nchildren are exposed to meaningful learning opportunities:\n  A study in Massachusetts found that the supply of child care in \ncommunities with large numbers of welfare recipients was much lower \nthan in higher-income communities. The 10 percent of zip code areas \nwith the greatest share of welfare recipients had just 8.3 preschools \noperating per 1,000 children ages 3 to 5. This was one-third lower than \nin high-income communities.\n  Four out of five children already know what it means to be in the \nfull-time care of someone other than one of their parents.\n  A study by the U.S. Department of Education found that public schools \nin low income communities were far less likely to offer pre-\nkindergarten programs (16 percent) than were schools in more affluent \nareas (33 percent).\n  Kindergarten teachers estimate that one in three children enters the \nclassroom unprepared to meet the challenges of school.\n  Only 42 percent of low-income children between the ages of 3 and 5 \nare in pre-kindergarten programs compared with 65 percent of higher \nincome children.\n  Our country has struggled, and this body has struggled, with ways to \nimprove the lives of young, poor children in this country. The debate \nwe are engaged in today centers around how to more effectively educate \ndisadvantaged children, how to hold schools, administrators, and \nteachers accountable for providing a high-quality education, and \nensuring that all children are given the opportunities to learn. Mr. \nPresident, early learning is a critical element of the fundamentally \nimportant goal of ensuring all children learn to high standards. We \nmust go where the children are--in child care centers, in family-based \ncare--and guarantee support of meaningful early learning services.\n  The intent of a collaborative approach to early education and child \ncare is to create a system that supports children's development and is \nalso responsive to the needs of working parents. We need to take action \nin order to make a difference in the lives of our children before \nthey're put at risk, and this bipartisan approach is certainly a step \nin the right direction, I believe a step the Senate must take. We need \nto accept the truth, Mr. President, that we can do a lot more to help \nour kids grow up healthy with promising futures in an early childhood \ndevelopment center, in a classroom, and in a doctor's office than we \ncan in a courtroom or in a jail cell.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, for his \nextraordinary leadership in this arena, as well as in the entire area \nof education.\n  I think my colleagues will agree that there is no more forceful, \neloquent, or committed voice on the subject of children and of \neducation in the country. I am grateful for his leadership on their \nparticular issue.\n  I also join in thanking the Senator from Alaska for his passionate \nand very firsthand commitment to this subject. He comes to this from a \nplace of real understanding. And I hope his colleagues on his side of \nthe aisle will recognize that this is not partisan. This is something \nthat has the capacity to bring both sides together to the advantage of \nthe children of America.\n  I also thank my colleague, Senator Bond, who joined me several years \nago in what was then a ground-breaking effort in the Senate to try to \nrecognize the capacity of collaboratives in the local communities to be \nable to pick up much of this burden. For a long time, we spent an awful \nlot of energy in the Senate reinventing the wheel. I think what we did \nwas try to say how we solve the problem without necessarily creating a \nnew Federal bureaucracy and without creating additional administrative \noverhead. How do we play to the strengths of our mayors, of our local \ncharitable organizations, which do such an extraordinary job, and\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\nwhich in so many cases are simply overburdened by the demand?\n\n  I think there is not one Member who is not aware of a Boys Club, \nGirls Club, YMCA, YWCA, Big Brother-Big Sister, or any number of faith-\nbased entities, whether the Jewish community centers, the Catholic \ncharities, the Baptist Outreach--there are dozens upon dozens of \nefforts--that successfully intervene in the lives of at-risk or \ntroubled young people and who succeed in turning those lives around.\n  This should not be categorized as a government program with all of \nthe pejoratives that go with the concept of government program. This \nis, in effect, the leveraging of those efforts at the local level that \nalready work. The best guarantee that comes out of this amendment is \nthat it appeals to the capacity of the local communities to choose \nwhich entities work and which entities don't. There is none of the \nrhetoric that somehow attacks so easily the notions that seek to do \ngood and changes lives of people for the better, none of that rhetoric \nthat suggests that Washington is dictating this or there is a new \nbureaucracy, or this is the long reach of the government at the Federal \nlevel trying to tell the local level what to do. None of that applies \nhere.\n  This is a grant to local collaboratives with the Governors' input and \nthe input of those local charitable entities. They know best what is \nworking; they know best where that money can have the greatest return \non the investment. They will, therefore, decide what to do.\n  Let me address for a quick moment the common sense of this. Senator \nStevens talked about the science and brain development. Indeed, we have \nlearned a great deal about brain development. In fact, we are learning \neven more each day.\n  Just this year, new evidence about brain development has been made \npublic which suggests that not only is the early childhood period so \ncritical for a particular kind of discipline, but we are now capable of \nlearning about the brain's functioning at different stages of \ndevelopment through to the point of adulthood. A child in their early \nteens, for instance, may be particularly susceptible to language input \nand at a later stage of life to more analytical skills; at the earlier \nstage of life much more subject to the early socialization skills and \nthe early recognition, cognitive skills such as recognizing shapes, \nforms, numbers.\n  The problem in America is--every single one of us knows this--certain \ncommunities don't have the tax base, don't have the income, and we will \nfind parents have a greater struggle to provide for a safe, nonchaotic \natmosphere within which their children can be brought up. Find a place \nwhere children get the proper kind of early input and it makes a \ndifference in their capacity to go to school ready to learn. In an \naffluent community, almost by 2 to 1 we find many more children are in \nsafe, competent, early childhood environments where they are well \nprepared to go to school.\n  The consequences of not preparing a child to go to school at the \nearliest stage ought to be obvious to everybody, but they are not. I \nhave heard from countless first grade schoolteachers who tell me in a \nclass of 25 to 30 kids, they might have 5 to 10 kids who do not have \nthe early cognitive skills their peers have, so the teacher is then \nreduced in their capacity to be able to provide the accelerated effort \nto the rest of the class because they are spending so much time trying \nto help people catch up. Moreover, it takes longer for the children to \ncatch up.\n\n  There are a host of other disadvantages that come with the lack of \nthat early childhood education that often play out later in life, \nsometimes in very dramatic ways, when they get in trouble with the law, \nwhen they become violent, and when we spend countless billions of \ndollars, literally billions of dollars, trying to remediate things that \ncould have been avoided altogether in the first place.\n  That is what this is all about. This is common sense. There are two \nformer Governors who will speak on this. I know what the Senator from \nOhio did because I followed what he did when he was a Governor. We used \nsome of what he did, as well as some of what was done by Governor Hunt \nin North Carolina, as models for possibilities. There are Governors all \nacross this country who currently support wonderful, homegrown, locally \ninitiated, locally based efforts that save lives and change lives on an \nongoing basis.\n  We need to augment the capacity of all of those entities to reach all \nof the children of America. If we did that, we could provide a tax cut \nin the end to the American people. For the dollar invested at the \nearliest stage, there is a back-end savings of anywhere from $6 to $7 \nper child, and sometimes much greater percentages in terms of the costs \nof the social structure that we put in place to either mitigate, and \nsometimes simply to isolate, people from society as a consequence of \nthose early deprivations.\n  This is not ``goo-goo'' social work. This is not do-goodism. It \ndoesn't fit into any kind of ideological label. This is something that \nhas worked all across the country.\n  I close by pointing to one very successful initiative that I visited \nseveral years ago which became part of the basis of the collaboration \nin which Senator Bond and I engaged.\n  In Allegheny County, PA, there is a thing called the Early Childhood \nInitiative. This program helps low-income children from birth to age 5 \nto become successful, productive adults by enrolling them in high-\nquality, neighborhood-based early care and education programs ranging \nfrom Head Start to center-based child care, to home-based child care, \nto school readiness programs. It draws on all of the corporate \ncommunity. The corporate community matches funds. The corporations \nbecome involved with the charitable entities. The public sector becomes \ninvolved. They join together to guarantee there are regular review \nprograms ensuring quality programming and cost effectiveness.\n  We are now talking about 19,000 preschool age children from low-\nincome families, 10,000 of which were not enrolled in any children's \ncare or education program prior to the childhood education initiative \nbeing put in place.\n  May I add, this has been done to date with a small amalgamation of \nFederal money, principally with corporate and local match and State \nmoney.\n  This can be done. For a minimal amount of Federal dollars, you can \nleverage an extraordinary outpouring of local match, of corporate \nprivate sector involvement, all of which builds communities, all of \nwhich in the end would make this country stronger and significantly \naugment the capacity of our teachers, who are increasingly \noverburdened, to be able to teach our children adequately.\n  I really hope this will be one amendment that does not fall victim to \npartisanship or to predisposition. I think we ought to be able to come \nto common agreement and common ground on this. I really commend it to \nmy colleagues on that basis.\n  I thank my colleagues for their forbearance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators \nStevens, Kennedy and Jeffords and others in support of this amendment.\n  As we enter the new millenium, we have before us a unique opportunity \nto enact legislation that will give every child the chance for the \nright start in life.\n  Recent research on the brain has clearly demonstrated that the years \nfrom birth to school enrollment are a hotbed of neurological activity--\nan unparalleled opportunity for children to acquire the foundation for \nlearning.\n  While this seems to be common sense--and something that parents have \nalways know intuitively--in fact, it is only recently that parents' \nintuition has been backed by evidence.\n  Until only 15 years ago, scientists still assumed that at birth a \nbaby's potential for learning was pretty firmly in place. We now know \nthat to be untrue.\n  Now we know that just in the first few months of life, the \nconnections between neurons, or synapses, in a child's brain will \nincrease 20-fold, to more than 1,000 trillion--more than all the stars \nin the Milky Way.\n  In those months and years, the brain's circuitry is wired. With \nattention and stimulation from parents and other caregivers, we begin \nto see the permanent pathways for learning and caring forming in a \nchild's brain.\n  The downside to the plasticity of the brain is that it can be as \neasily shaped\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\nby negative experiences as positive experiences. Fear and neglect are \njust as readily wired into the brain as caring and learning.\n  Scientists have also found that the brain's flexibility in those \nearly years is not absolute. Some skills can only be acquired during \ndefined windows of opportunity. Abilities, like sight and speech, that \nare not wired into place within a certain critical period may be \nunattainable--a ``use it or lose it'' phenomenon.\n  We see this phenomenon played out in the classroom. Kindergarten \nteachers across the country tell us that as many as one in three \nchildren begins the first day of school unprepared to learn. Because \nthey have never been read to, basic literacy skills have not taken \nhold. Because they were never screened for health problems, they have \nundiagnosed hearing or vision impairments.\n  If we accept the science of brain development, it's clear that is \nwhere our investments should be.\n  The data is in and the facts are undisputable:\n  The experiences a child has in the years from birth to age 6 set the \nstage for that child's later academic success.\n  Investing in early learning saves us money in the long run.\n  It is very simple--if children enter kindergarten and first grade \nunprepared, they may never catch up. As a society, we pay dearly for \nthat lack of readiness. We pay in the lost potential of that child. We \npay in terms of higher special education costs. And we pay in terms of \nincreased juvenile justice costs.\n  There is no more fitting place for this amendment to be considered \nthan here as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--a very \nappropriate place to formally recognize the fact that learning starts \nat birth.\n  This amendment has two main objectives: To provide parents and others \nwho care for children with the skills and resources to support \nchildren's development and to engage communities in providing early \nlearning opportunities for all children.\n  Because parents are children's first and best teachers, this \nlegislation would support their efforts to create healthy and \nstimulating environments for their children.\n  But, knowing that more than 60 percent of children younger than age \nsix--regardless of whether their mothers work--are in some form of non-\nparental care, this legislation would also support the efforts of child \ncare centers and home-based child care providers to offer positive \nearly learning experiences.\n  Importantly, the delivery system for all of these investments is the \ncommunity. Under this legislation, local councils of parents, teachers \nand child care providers will assess the community's needs and \ndetermine how to allocate resources.\n  In addition to using funds to support parents and other caregivers, \nfunds could be used:\n\n       To increase access to existing programs by expanding the \n     days or times that children are served or by making services \n     available to children in low-income families.\n       To enhance early childhood literacy.\n       To link early learning providers to one another and to \n     health services.\n       To improve quality of existing early learning programs \n     through recruitment, retention, and professional development \n     incentives, and\n       To increase early learning opportunities for children with \n     special needs.\n\n  If this model sounds familiar to you, it should. The strategy of \ninvesting in early learning has been embraced in some form by over 42 \ngovernors.\n  In the laboratory of the states, governors, business leaders, \nparents, and kindergarten teachers have decided that they are convinced \nenough by the science and the facts to forge ahead.\n  In Connecticut, we are entering our third year of a wildly popular \nschool readiness initiative. As a result of this initiative, 41 cities \nand towns are now providing high quality preschool experiences to over \n6,000 children.\n  The results of this initiative in terms of improvements in school \nreadiness and reductions in special education costs have been so \nsignificant that the Governor and legislature have almost doubled \nfunding in three years to $72 million.\n  Interestingly, perhaps the strongest backer of this initiative has \nbeen the business community. The people who like to crunch numbers, to \nsee things in terms of costs and benefits looked at the facts and \ndecided that early learning was a wise investment. That says a lot.\n  States are doing their part. Many businesses are doing their part. \nThe federal government must do its part.\n  As we enter the 21st century, let's get our priorities straight.\n  We cannot and should not let this opportunity to make a real \ndifference in the lives of children and families across America pass us \nby.\n  Our children are priceless--we shouldn't ``nickel and dime'' them \nwhen it comes to providing the best possible start in life.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kerry for the work he and I \nhave done over the years on early childhood education. This amendment \nby Senators Stevens and Jeffords and others builds on that because we \nknow that early in a child's development is the best time to begin the \nprocess of assuring that child is well educated, well prepared--the \nvery earliest stages in life. This amendment recognizes if we do \neverything possible for our Nation's children in their overall \neducation, we should begin at the earliest years.\n  While most of the debate on this bill will be about elementary and \nsecondary education--the years of what we might call formal schooling--\nthe education and mental development of a child begins long before that \nchild enters kindergarten. In fact, the education and development of a \nchild begins practically at birth and continues at an extremely rapid \npace through the first several years of life.\n  This amendment recognizes this basic fact--that a child's education \nand mental development begins very early in life. Through this \namendment, we are seeking to support families with the youngest \nchildren to find the early childhood education care programs that can \nhelp those families and parents provide the supportive, stimulating \nenvironment we all know their children need.\n  This amendment recognizes that if we want to do everything possible \nfor our nation's children and their overall education, we need to focus \non the earliest years as well as the years of formal schooling. We can \ndo this--and this amendment proposes to do this--by supporting and \nexpanding the successful early childhood programs and initiatives that \nare working right now on the local level. These programs help parents \nto stimulate and educate their young children in an effort to make sure \nevery child enters kindergarten fully ready to learn.\n  I am pleased to say that this amendment is based on the basic ideas \nand principles I set forth in legislation that was first introduced \nseveral years ago with my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry.\n  Research shows that the first years of life are an absolutely crucial \ndevelopmental period for each child with a significant bearing on \nfuture prospects. During this time, infant brain development occurs \nvery rapidly, and the sensations and experiences of this time go a long \nway toward shaping that baby's mind in a way that has long-lasting \neffects on all aspects of the child's life.\n  And parents and family are really the key to this development. Early, \npositive interaction with parents, grandparents, aunts, uncle, and \nother adults plays a critical role.\n  Really we shouldn't be surprised that parents have known \ninstinctively for generations some of these basic truths that science \nis just now figuring out. Most parents just know that babies need to be \nhugged, caressed, and spoken to.\n  Of course, the types of interaction that can most enhance a child's \ndevelopment change as the baby's body and mind grow. The best types of \npositive interaction--which are so instinctual to us for the youngest \nbabies--may not be quite so obvious for two- and three-year-olds. \nRaising a child is perhaps the most important thing any of us will do, \nbut it is also one of the most complicated.\n  And parents today also face a variety of stresses and problems that \nwere unheard of a generation ago. In many families, both parents work. \nWhether\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\nby choice or by necessity, many parents may not be able to read \nmountains of books and articles about parenting and child development \nto keep perfectly up-to-date on what types of experiences are most \nappropriate for their child at his or her particular stage of \ndevelopment. They also must try to find good child care and good \nenvironments where their children can be stimulated and educated while \nthey work. Simply put, most parents can probably use a little help to \nfigure out how best to help a child's mind and imagination to grow as \nmuch as possible.\n  Many communities across the country have developed successful early \nchildhood development programs to meet these needs. Most of the \nprograms work with parents to help them understand their child's \ndevelopment and to discuss ways to help further develop the little \nbaby's potential. Others simply provide basic child care and an \nexciting learning environment for children of parents who both have to \nwork.\n  In a report released in 1998, the prestigious RAND Corporation \nreviewed early childhood programs like these and found that they \nprovide children, particularly high-risk children, with both short- and \nlong-run benefits. These benefits include enhanced development of both \nthe mind and the child's ability to interact with others. They include \nimprovement in educational outcomes. And they include a long-term \nincrease in self-sufficiency through finding jobs and staying off \ngovernment programs and staying out of the criminal justice system.\n  Of course, it's no mystery to people from my home state of Missouri \nthat this type of program can be successful. Missouri is the ``Show \nMe'' state, an we have been shown first-hand the benefit of a top-\nnotice early childhood program. In Missouri, we are both proud and \nlucky to be the home of Parents as Teachers. This tremendous \norganization is an early childhood parent education program designed to \nempower the parents to give their young child the best possible start \nin life. It provides education for the parent on a volunteer basis. \nOver 150,000 Missouri families are participating in it, with 200,000 \nchildren benefiting from it. It combines visits by the parent/educator \nin the home to see the progress of the child. It provides ideas and \ninformation to the parent to stimulate that child's learning curiosity. \nIt brings parents and children together in group sessions to discuss \ncommon problems.\n\n  This program has been shown, by independent tests, to improve \nsignificantly the learning capacity of children when they reach formal \nschooling years. In addition, it hooks the parents into their child's \neducation for the future years. I personally, from my visits to over \n100 of these sites around my State, can tell you it is clear to the \nteachers, to the administrators, to the school board members, children \nwho have been in Parents as Teachers have an excellent start and they \nare above and ahead of the other children who have not been so lucky.\n  This program is available through every school district in our State. \nI have talked to mothers coming off welfare who say it is the most \nimportant thing for their children. I have talked to farm families who \nare struggling to make a living off the farm, who say it is the best \nthing that can happen to their children. I have talked to economically \nsuccessful suburban families; mom and dad both have good jobs, not \nenough time, but Parents as Teachers gives them the direction and the \ntools so they can be the best first teachers of their children.\n  That is why it is called Parents as Teachers.\n  With additional resources, programs such as Parents as Teachers could \nbe expanded and enhanced to improve the opportunities for many more \ninfants and young children. And we have found that all children can \nbenefit from these programs. Economically successful, two-income \nfamilies can benefit from early childhood programs just as much as a \nsingle-parent family with a mother seeking work opportunities.\n  This amendment will support families by building on local initiatives \nlike Parents as Teachers that have already been proven successful in \nworking with families as they raise their infants and toddlers. The \nbill will help improve and expand these successful programs, of which \nthere are numerous other examples, such as programs sponsored by the \nUnited Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, as well as state initiatives such as \n``Success by Six'' in Massachusetts and Vermont and the ``Early \nChildhood Initiative'' in Pennsylvania.\n  The amendment will provide Federal funds to states to begin or expand \nlocal initiatives to provide early childhood education, parent \neducation, and family support. Best of all, we propose to do this with \nno Federal mandates, and few Federal guidelines.\n  Many of our society's problems, such as the high school dropout rate, \ndrug and tobacco use, and juvenile crime can be traced in part to \ninadequate child care and early childhood development opportunities. \nIncreasingly, research is showing us that a child's social and \nintellectual development as well as a child's likelihood to become \ninvolved in these types of difficulties is deeply rooted in the early \ninteraction and nurturing a child receives in his or her early years.\n  Ultimately, it is important to remember that the likelihood of a \nchild growing up in a healthy, nurturing environment is the primary \nresponsibility of his or her parents and family. Government cannot and \nshould not become a substitute for parents and families, but we can \nhelp them become stronger by equipping them with the resources to meet \nthe everyday challenges of parenting.\n  I believe this amendment can accomplish this and dramatically improve \nthe life and education of millions of the youngest Americans.\n  I invite any of my colleagues, or anyone else who wants to know more \nabout this program, to let me know because we have seen this program \ncopied in other States, in other countries. It really can make a \ndifference for children. I believe the support this amendment will \nprovide for early childhood education is one of the best things we can \ndo to assure the highest quality educational achievement for all of our \nchildren.\n  The screening for young children that goes along with it helps avoid \nproblems and more than pays for the cost of the education programs. I \nbelieve this amendment, if we adopt it, can be a tremendous boost for \nchildren of all walks of life throughout our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I have been very impressed with the \nwords of my colleagues, the two Senators from Massachusetts, the \nSenator from Alaska, the Senator from Vermont, and now the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  One of the things I decided on doing when I came to the Senate was to \nbring my passion for early childhood development to the Senate and to \nencourage my colleagues to give a much higher priority to children age \nprenatal to 3 than we have been giving in this country. Early childhood \ndevelopment, especially covering children age prenatal to 3, is \nfundamental if this Nation is to achieve the first of our eight \nnational education goals, and that is, ``all children in America will \nstart school ready to learn.''\n  There are great programs for children, such as Head Start, which \nCongress has supported for 35 years. I am proud that when I was \nGovernor of Ohio, we increased spending for Head Start by 1,000 \npercent. So in our State today, every eligible child whose parent wants \nthem in a Head Start Program has a slot for that child. Even though \nHead Start has made a tremendous impact on our children, we must \nrecognize that the program is designed for 3- and 4-year-olds. The \nperiod in a child's life in which we have not invested enough in this \ncountry, and the period on which we need to start concentrating, is the \nperiod in a child's life from prenatal to age 3. It is the time in a \nchild's life that has the most impact on their overall development.\n  Thanks to decades of research on brain chemistry, and through the \nutilization of sophisticated new technology, neuroscientists are now \ntelling us that within the first 3 months in the womb, children start \nto develop the 100 billion neurons they will need as adults. By the \ntime they reach the age of 3, children have all the necessary \nconnections--what we call synapses--between brain cells that cause the \nbrain to function properly.\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\n  What I am saying is almost frightening. If we do not create an \nappropriate environment for our children prenatal to age 3, they \nphysically do not develop these synapses in their brains, and they are \nincapable of using what God has given them in the most efficient way \npossible.\n  In terms of priorities, the experiences that fill a child's first \ndays, months, and years have a critical and decisive impact on the \ndevelopment of the brain and on the nature and extent of their adult \ncapacities--in other words, who they are going to become. The window of \nopportunity can be impacted by things that are within our control.\n  We found, for example, children who lack proper nutrition, health \ncare, and nurturing during their first years tend also to lack adequate \nsocial, motor, and language skills needed to perform well in school. \nThat is why all young children, parents, and care givers of those \nchildren should have access to information and support services \nappropriate for promoting healthy early childhood development in the \nfirst years of life, including child care, early intervention services, \nparenting education, health care, and other child development services.\n  This new revelation requires that States streamline and coordinate \nhealthy early childhood development systems. It also necessitates that \nthe Federal Government reorder its education priorities to reflect the \nimportance of a child's learning and growing experiences from prenatal \nto age 3.\n  This amendment responds to the obvious shortcomings of the Federal \nGovernment's partnership with State governments and encourages States \nto coordinate and galvanize all public and private assets on the State \nand local level.\n  The amendment authorizes the expenditure of some $3.2 billion over \nthe next 3 years to make grants available to our States, and \nsubsequently to the counties, in order to provide or improve early \nlearning services for young children.\n  I want to underscore, this is not a new entitlement. I want to \nemphasize, what we are trying to do is prioritize money we are already \nspending for education and put more of it into early development \nprograms where it is going to make the biggest difference for our \nchildren.\n\n  In order to receive this money, it does one other thing I think is \nvery important. In too many communities in the United States, local \nsocial service, public, and private agencies do not cooperate and \ncombine their resources. They do not collaborate enough to deliver \nservices to children in their community. This amendment will require \nthat:\n\n       A State shall designate a lead State agency . . . to \n     administer and monitor the grant and ensure State-level \n     coordination of early learning programs.\n\n  For their part, localities must also follow guidelines to be eligible \nto receive funds. Again, from the bill, ``a locality shall establish or \ndesignate a local council, which shall be composed of--representatives \nof local agencies directly affected by early learning programs; \nparents; other individuals concerned with early learning issues in the \nlocality, such as individuals providing child care resource and \nreferral services, early learning opportunities, child care, education \nand health services; and other key community leaders.'' This could also \ninclude faith-based community organizations.\n  We are saying that unless a State gets its act together and gets its \nagencies that deal with families and children into a lead state agency \nin order to coordinate activities, and unless local communities come \ntogether in collaboratives, the money will not flow to those \ncollaboratives.\n  In a way, it is an inducement for local private-public agencies to \nget together to talk about how they can look at the early period in a \nchild's life and make a difference and galvanize all the resources in \nthe community.\n  It will help eliminate some of the turf problems throughout this \ncountry where agencies do their own thing without working with other \nagencies.\n  It will encourage agencies to understand they have a symbiotic \nrelationship with each other, and by working together, they can make a \ndifference on behalf of the children in their respective communities.\n  In Ohio, we established the Ohio Family and Children First Initiative \nwhich was driven by locally based providers and not bureaucrats. The \ninitiative developed a plan to meet the health, education, and social \nservice needs of disadvantaged children and families and develop an \naction plan to meet those needs by eliminating barriers, coordinating \nprograms, and targeting dollars.\n  We started out in Ohio with only 9 programs in 13 of our 88 counties. \nWe put out an RFP and said those counties that get their act together \ncan participate in the program. It was such a success that today all 88 \ncounties that have these collaboratives that are making a difference in \nthe lives of our children.\n  In my own county, we have a wonderful example of what can happen when \nagencies work together. The Cuyahoga County Early Childhood Initiative \nhas undertaken a 3-year $40 million pilot program to promote and \nimprove effective parenting, healthy children, and quality child care \nin order to assure the well-being of all children in the county from \nbirth through age 5.\n  Under this collaborative partnership, which began last July, $30 \nmillion comes from a combination of local, State, and Federal sources, \nand $8.5 million has thus far been committed by 18 local foundations. \nIn other words, this is a program where we are combining local, State, \nand Federal resources and private resources to make an impact on these \nyoungsters.\n  One of the more innovative aspects of this initiative is that it \nguarantees a visit by a registered nurse, if requested, to every first-\ntime and teen mother in the county. These nurses help identify health \nand social service needs of both moms and babies, and link families \nwith services that underscore and highlight the importance of a child's \nfirst 3 years.\n  I will never forget when I was Governor, for my 1998 State of the \nState Address, I invited people who were benefiting from some of the \nprograms we instituted. One of the individuals I invited was a woman \nfrom one of our rural counties.\n  I asked her before the State of the State Address: What did this \nprogram do for you? This may sound elementary, but she said: I had my \nbaby, I came home, I put the baby in the crib, and I watched \ntelevision. When the nurse came out, she said that I should hold my \nbaby, I should sing to my baby, I should read to my baby. She taught me \nhow to use Ziploc bags to make picture books so that I could look at \nthose pictures with my baby. I was told the more I stimulated and spent \ntime with that baby, the more that baby would develop the brain power \nthat God had given her.\n  Another program we put in place was Help Me Grow, which gives new \nmothers in Ohio a wellness guide, an informational video, and access to \na telephone helpline so that, right from the beginning, new mothers can \nget the information they need and know where they can turn for help.\n  Again, it is a private sector initiative that came about as a result \nof the Family and Children First Initiative. In other words, a woman \nhas a baby at the hospital. She gets a 30-minute video which tells her \nhow to be a better mother. A nurse spends time with her. It is a ``how \nto do it'' initiative.\n\n  This may be hard to believe, but women all over this country are \nhaving babies and need help in what to do when that child is born. This \nprogram is going to help make that possible.\n  The amendment from the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nVermont will expand the collaborative effort nationwide. This amendment \nconditions the Federal dollars that localities receive through the lead \nState agency on the ability of communities to come together and \nestablish collaborative efforts. That means, as I said, putting aside \nthe ``turf battles'' and galvanizing the resources.\n  I want to emphasize how important this is. These Federal dollars will \nbe what I refer to as ``the yeast that raises the dough.'' In other \nwords, these funds will act as seed money generating additional local \nand State resources, and better use of Federal resources, as well as \nprivate sector and foundation funds, all to help our children. I know \nthis program is going to work because of the way it has worked in the \nState of Ohio. Early childhood has been a passion of mine since my\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\nfour children were enrolled in a storefront Montessori school when they \nwere just out of diapers.\n  On the Federal level, the Governors understand how important this \nprogram is. In 1998, some 42 Governors chose to highlight early \nchildhood development as a major portion of their State agendas. With \nthis amendment, we will make the Federal Government become a more \neffective partner with State governments. It will kick start the local \nand State agencies to better coordinate and collaborate so we can \nmaximize all the resources that are available in the community.\n  More important, this will give us the opportunity to take the God-\ngiven qualities of our most important resource in this country--our \nchildren--and provide them the environment they need to fully develop \nduring their most crucial period in life.\n  Finally--and again I underscore for my colleagues--this is not a new \nentitlement. It is my hope that my colleagues on the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations Subcommittee will reprioritize some of the funds we \ncurrently spend on education and other health and social services \ntoward early childhood development.\n  To track what happens with these Federal funds, the amendment \nrequires that States report back on what they have been able to \naccomplish, ensuring there is accountability for these resources.\n  This amendment is about our children's future. It is about our \ncountry's future. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment on a \nbipartisan basis. Of all of the things we can do for children in this \ncountry, the most important thing we can do is impact on them during \nthis most important period in their life, and what we do during this \nperiod in a child's life, in my opinion, is going to be the best \ninvestment we can make in our children. All the research shows that for \nevery dollar we invest during a child's earliest years, we save $4 and \n$5 later on in their lives.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Kennedy asked me about \nthe source of one of the statistics I quote during the debate on S. 2. \nI am pleased to provide the Senator from Massachusetts with the source \nfor my statistics.\n  During the 105th Congress, the House Subcommittee on Oversight and \nInvestigation of the Committee on Education and the Workforce prepared \nan excellent report, entitled, ``Education at a Crossroads: What Works \nand What's Wasted in Education Today.'' I am pleased to share an \nexcerpt from it with my colleagues. This report concludes that:\n\n       One of the main problems with delivering federal education \n     aid to states and communities through such a vast array of \n     programs is the added cost of paperwork and personnel \n     necessary to apply for an keep track of the operations of \n     each of these programs. Many of the costs are hidden in the \n     burdens placed on teachers and administrators in time and \n     money to complete federal forms for this multitude of \n     overlapping federal programs.\n       In 1996, Governor Voinovich of Ohio noted that local \n     schools in his state had to submit as many as 170 federal \n     reports totaling more than 700 pages during a single year. \n     This report also noted that more than 50 percent of the \n     paperwork required by a local school in Ohio is a result of \n     federal programs--this despite the fact that the federal \n     government accounts for only 6 percent of Ohio's educational \n     spending.\n       The Subcommittee has attempted to quantify the number of \n     pages required by recipients of federal funds in order to \n     qualify for assistance. Without fully accounting for all the \n     attachments and supplemental submissions required with each \n     application, the Subcommittee counted more than 20,000 pages \n     of applications.\n       So how much time is spent completing this paperwork? In the \n     recently released strategic plan of the Department of \n     Education, the administration highlights the success of the \n     Department in reducing paperwork burdens by an estimated 10 \n     percent--which according to their own estimates accounts for \n     5.4 million man hours in FY 97. If this statistic is \n     accurate, it would mean that the Department of Education is \n     still requiring nearly 50 million hours worth of paperwork \n     each year--or the equivalent of 25,000 employees working \n     full-time. [page 15]\n\n  Mr. President, this paper chase, as I suggested yesterday, has our \nnation's teachers and administrators spinning their wheels on the \nrequirements of a federal education bureaucracy instead of \nconcentrating on teaching and meeting the needs of students. Our \neducational system has been taken over by a federally driven emphasis \non form rather than substance.\n  While I commend Secretary Riley's 10 percent reduction effort, we \nneed to go much further in order to put our education emphasis where it \nneeds to be--in classrooms, not on process requirements. I am committed \nto helping reduce the amount of paperwork teachers and administrators \nmust fill out. S. 2 goes a long way to easing this burden.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3676-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3676-S3679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REAUTHORIZATION OF THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is the ninth reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Regrettably, the \nreauthorization, as reported by Committee, is not in my view in the \nbest interest of our Nation's children. Established as part of \nPresident Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty, the original bill offered \nFederal support, for the first time, to schools in low-income \ncommunities. It underscored the importance of ensuring that all \nAmerican children have access to quality education.\n  As the time has come to again reauthorize this important legislation \nthat provides opportunity and hope to so many citizens, the \nnegotiations have taken a drastically partisan turn. Members of the \nMajority have argued that, because states have paramount \nresponsibilities for education, the role of the Federal Government \nshould be diminished. However, that argument ignores our Nation's \ninterest in ensuring an educated citizenry which is vital to the \nstrength of our country, the continued health of our economy, and our \nability to compete internationally.\n  On previous occasions, we have worked together to provide the Federal \nGovernment's 7 percent share of elementary and secondary education \nfunding to the citizens of our country. We came together, despite our \ndifferences, to provide for the less fortunate in society. We came \ntogether to make progress on strengthening and improving public schools \nin every community, while ensuring that the Federal Government retained \nits mission of targeting the neediest communities.\n  The Congress and the President showed leadership in the last \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and with \nthe passage of the GOALS 2000 legislation, which established a new \nbenchmark in setting higher standards and moving our educational system \nin a new direction. Now, after years of tested programs and studies, \nthe Majority wants to go back to the days of block grant funding to \nstates and remove the Federal Government's ability to ensure that we \nhave a targeted and responsible use of our citizens' tax dollars.\n  At a time when the Nation is enjoying remarkable economic prosperity, \nwe should be working to increase the Federal investment in education to \nhelp states, communities, and schools meet the demands of higher \nstandards of achievement, and address the challenges of diversity, \npoverty, and the lack of technology advancements in some communities. \nWe need to do all we can to target resources to the neediest \ncommunities so that the most disadvantaged students get a good \neducation.\n  During the last two years, we have been able to come together as a \nCongress and support the President's proposal to provide more teachers \nto the classrooms to lower class sizes. Over $2.5 billion has been \nprovided for the purpose of recruiting, hiring, and training teachers. \nNow the Majority would have us retreat from this critical effort to \nprovide more qualified teachers and reduced class sizes. And it is well \nsettled that smaller class sizes enhances student achievement. Smaller \nclasses enable teachers to provide greater individual attention and \nassistance to students in need. Smaller classes enable teachers to \nspend more time on instruction, and less time on discipline and \nbehavior problems. In smaller classes, teachers cover material more \neffectively, and are able to work with parents more effectively to \nenhance their children's education.\n\n  Mr. President, the Majority's centerpiece for this legislation, the \nso-called ``Straight A's program'', whether in the 50-state or the 15-\nstate form--abandons our commitment to help the Nation's most \ndisadvantaged children receive a good education through proven and \neffective programs. The bill before\n\n[[Page S3677]]\n\nus would give states a blank check for over $12 billion--and then turns \nits back on holding states accountable for results.\n  In addition, the Majority undermines the cornerstone of our education \nreform by making Title I funds ``portable.'' Portability dilutes the \nimpact that Title I funding has on individual public schools that serve \nall children. Supporters go to great lengths to avoid admitting that \nthis funding could be used for private, religious, or for-profit \nservices in the form of vouchers, but indeed, this is the case. \nVouchers threaten to drain public schools of greatly needed public tax \ndollars and send the message that when public schools, which educate 90 \npercent of American children, do not work, they should be abandoned \nrather than fixed.\n  As we confront a world that is increasingly complex both \ntechnologically and economically, it is critical that we continue to \nmeet the educational needs of our Nation's young people. It is in my \nview imperative that we maintain strong Federal support to ensure the \nsuccessful continuation of education programs serving our country's \nyoung people. The legislation as submitted by the Majority diminishes \nthe Federal role and does not provide accountability for education \nstandards. This is an unfortunate departure from years of bipartisan \nsupport and movement towards higher achievement for all of our young \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I have a longstanding and deep commitment to the goal \nof ensuring a quality education for all citizens. The bill before us \nwould retreat from that goal by sharply reducing the Federal role in \neducation--a role, that while narrow in scope, is critical to ensuring \nreform in our schools and real improvements in student performance, \nparticularly among our neediest students and in our neediest \ncommunities.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senate's consideration of \nelementary and secondary education policy offers us an opportunity to \nbegin to institute some fundamental reforms of American public \neducation.\n  I fervently hope that the Senate does just that. I hope we will send \nto the President promptly a bill that brings about real change.\n  In the past week, we have debated several approaches and today we \nwill debate another.\n  First, let me say that federal education funding is only 6 percent of \ntotal spending for elementary and secondary education. So in terms of \ndollars, the federal role is small. Public education spending and \npolicy are largely set by local and state governments and that is the \nway it should be.\n  Nevertheless, federal dollars can and should leverage other dollars \nand in writing legislation to revamp federal education policy, we have \nthe opportunity to stimulate some real reforms.\n  Why do we need reform? The numbers tell us a sad story.\n  American students lag behind their international counterparts in many \nways. American twelfth grade math students are outperformed by students \nfrom 21 other countries, scoring higher than students from only two \ncountries, Cyprus and South Africa.\n  Three-quarters of our school children cannot compose a well-\norganized, coherent essay.\n  U.S. eighth graders score below the international average of 41 other \ncountries in math. U.S. twelfth graders score among the lowest of 21 \ncountries in both math and science general knowledge.\n  Three-quarters of employers say that recent high school graduates do \nnot have the skills they need to succeed on the job. Forty-six percent \nof college professors say entering students do not have the skills to \nsucceed in college, according to a February Public Agenda poll.\n  These statistics speak for themselves. Our schools are failing many \nof our youngsters. It is not the students' fault. It is our fault.\n  We need major change.\n  Our changing economy, particularly in my state, poses huge challenges \nfor public education. Our young people must be able to compete not just \nnationally, but in the world because the economy today is a global \neconomy.\n  Here are a few examples:\n  Our state's economy has moved away from manufacturing toward more \nhigher-skilled, service and technology jobs. Since 1980, employment has \nincreased in California by nearly 28 percent, but growth in the \ntraditional fields, such as manufacturing, has been only six percent. \nJobs in the ``new economy,'' fields such as services and trade, have \njumped nearly 60 percent.\n  California employers say job applicants lack basic skills. High tech \nCEOs come to Washington and ask us to increase visas so they can bring \nin skilled employees from overseas because they cannot find qualified \nemployees in our state.\n  Nationally, over the next 10 years, computer systems analyst jobs \nwill grow by 94 percent; computer support specialists, by 102 percent; \ncomputer engineers, 108 percent. Jobs for the non-college educated are \nstagnating.\n  Our economic strength is in large part dependent on how well we \nprepare our youngsters. And today, sadly, we are not preparing them \nvery well by most measures.\n  California's public schools have gone from being among the best to \nsome of the worst. California has 5.8 million students, more students \nin public school than 36 states have in total population! California \nhas 30 percent of the nation's school-age immigrant children. We have \n41 percent (1.4 million) of the nation's students with limited English \nproficiency.\n  We've gone from near the top rank in per pupil spending (we were 5th \nin the nation in 1965) to near the bottom. California ranks 46th today. \nIn the 1960s California invested 20 percent above the national average \nper student in K-12 education. Today, California averages 20 percent \nbelow the national average.\n  We have low test scores, crowded classrooms, uncredentialed teachers, \nteacher shortages, growing enrollments, decrepit buildings.\n  Let's look at how California's students perform academically:\n  In fourth grade math, 11 percent of students score at or above \nproficiency levels--11 percent In fourth grade reading, 20 percent.\n  California ranks 32nd out of 36 states in the percent of eighth \ngraders scoring at or above ``proficient'' on reading. For fourth grade \nreaders, we rank 36 out of 39 states in reading.\n  California ranks 34th out of 40 states in the percent of eighth \ngraders scoring at or above ``proficient'' on science.\n  California ranks 37th among the states in the high school graduation \nrate.\n  Forty-eight percent of freshman students enrolling in the \nCalifornia's State University system need remedial math and English.\n  California's students lag behind students from other states. Only \nabout 40 to 45 percent of the state's students score at or above the \nnational median, on the Stanford 9 reading and math tests.\n  These are dismal, disappointing and disturbing statistics.\n  What does this mean for California's future, when our high school \ngraduates cannot read, write, multiply, divide or add, find China on a \nmap, fill out an employment application or read a bus schedule? These \nare not abstract facts. These are real examples of the weaknesses in \nour education system.\n  The Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy--a \nhighly respected think tank--put it quite bluntly: ``Ranking in the \nbottom 20 percent of all states is simply not compatible with meeting \nthe requirements of industries which will lead California in a world \neconomy.''\n  In addition to low academic performance, we have a virtual litany of \nother problems:\n  California has one of the highest student-teacher ratios in the \nnation, even though we are reducing class sizes in the early grades.\n  We will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010. Currently, 11 percent or \n30,000 of our 285,000 teachers are on emergency credentials.\n  We're 50th in computers per child and 43rd in schools with Internet \naccess.\n  We need to add about 327 new schools over the next 3 years just to \nkeep pace with projected growth. We need $22 billion to build and \nrepair schools and $10 billion to install instructional technology, \naccording to the National Education Association report that just came \nout on May 3. Two million California children go to school today in \n86,000 portable classrooms.\n  Our Head Start programs serve only 13 percent of eligible children.\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\n  We have 40 percent of the nation's immigrants. We have 41 percent of \nthe nation's limited English proficient students. Some of our schools \nhave 50 languages spoken.\n  These challenges will be exacerbated multi-fold. California has \nnearly 34 million people today, with schools, and roads, and other \ninfrastructure that were built when the population was 16 million. And \nour population is projected to increase to almost 50 million over the \nnext 25 years. California's school enrollment rate between now and 2007 \nwill be triple the national rate.\n  But California's education system cannot be fixed with just bricks, \nmortar and electrical wiring. The problems are much, much deeper than \nthat. The bottom line is this: tinkering around the edges of a failing \nsystem is not meaningful change. Nothing short of a major restructuring \nwill turn around our schools.\n  The condition of public education in California troubles me greatly \nbecause this is an area of human endeavor that is critical to the \nfuture of our state. California's public school system can be turned \naround. It will be painful. It will not be easy. But it can be done. \nAnd we have to start.\n  So the question is, what should we do. In my view, we should base our \nefforts on two key principles: performance and accountability.\n  The success of our schools must be measured, not by what we put into \nour classrooms, but what comes out.\n  There several core elements of education reform:\n  That basic achievement levels be set for students for every grade in \nall core subjects. These standards should be phased in over a period of \nyears, and measured at key levels, such as 4th, 6th, and 10th grades.\n  That social promotion of students be ended. Promotion from one grade \nlevel to the next should be based on measured levels of achievement--\nperiod. Intensive intervention programs must be provided for those who \nfall short and who need extra help. Extra, intervention or remedial \nprograms must accompany the end of social promotion because clearly, \nretention should not replace the ending of social promotion.\n  That standards be set to measure a school's achievement.\n  That class size be reduced and phased in over 10 years.\n  That school size be reduced. Educators tell us that elementary \nschools should be limited to 450 students.\n  That the length of both the school day and the school year be \nincreased, thereby increasing both instructional time for students as \nwell as instructional development time for teachers.\n  In most states, the school year is 180 days. In other industrialized \nnations, students spend more time in the classroom, and teachers have \nmore time for instructional development each year. For example, in \nKorea the school year is 220 days. In Japan it is 220. In Israel it is \n216, and in Great Britain, 190.\n  That public school choice be increased.\n  And that teacher training and pay be improved, to elevate teaching to \na respected and competitive position. I have proposed, for example, \nmaster teachers who mentor and coach other teachers, especially those \nin their first year in the classroom and who get salaries commensurate \nwith that role.\n  Today, I intend to vote for Senator Lieberman's reform proposal \nbecause I believe it takes a fresh approach to federal education policy \nand will bring us ``more bang'' for our education bucks by linking real \nreforms to federal dollars.\n  Here is what the Lieberman amendment does. It does three things.\n  First, it takes almost 50 current, disparate federal education \nprograms and consolidates them into five performance-based grants:\n  educating disadvantaged children;\n  improving teacher quality;\n  teaching English to non-English-speaking children;\n  expanding pubic school choice; and\n  supporting high performance initiatives.\n  Second, the amendment increases authorized funding levels:\n  educating disadvantaged children (Title I), a 50 percent increase, \nfrom $7.9 billion to $12 billion;\n  teacher training, a 100 percent increase from $620 million to $1.6 \nbillion;\n  teaching English to non-English-speaking children, a 250 percent \nincrease, from $380 million to $1 billion;\n  public school choice, from $145 million to $300 million;\n  high performance initiatives, a new infusion of $2.7 billion.\n  Third, instead of the funds just going out the door without ever \nknowing any results, the Lieberman amendment requires for each of the \nfive areas, that states demonstrate improvement. How does it do that? \nAccountability. The amendment has several important elements.\n  It requires states to have content and performance standards in at \nleast English language arts, math and science. It requires states to \ndefine ``adequate yearly progress'' (AYP) and requires 90 percent of \nschool districts to meet AYP, and within school districts, 90 percent \nof schools to meet AYP.\n  It requires school districts to identify failing schools and after \ntwo years and requires those schools to develop an improvement plan. \nEvery school district must have a system of corrective action for \nfailing schools.\n  The amendment gives states three years to implement their own \naccountability systems; requires states to sanction districts that do \nnot meet their annual performance targets; cuts administrative funds if \nstates do not meet objectives; authorizes funds to correct low-\nperforming schools.\n  For Title I, each state must develop plans to ensure that all \nchildren are proficient in math and reading within 10 years. Each \nstates must set performance goals for increasing overall academic \nachievement and for closing the gap between high- and low-income \nstudents, minority and non-minority students, limited English \nproficient children and non-LEP students.\n  On teachers, it requires that states have all teachers fully \nqualified by 2005. It preserves the class size reduction program.\n  For non- or limited English-speaking children, it requires states to \ndevelop standards for measuring English proficiency, to set performance \ngoals and to require school districts to make adequate yearly progress \nin core academic subjects.\n  On public school choice, it requires states to hold charter and non-\ntraditional schools accountable to the same content and performance \nstandards as any other public school. It allows students in failing \nschools to transfer to another public school.\n  It requires states to have annual performance goals and a plan for \nholding local districts accountable. It rewards districts that meet or \nexceed their performance goals.\n  If states do not show improvement in three years, they lose \nadministrative funding. States must also hold school districts \naccountable and have sanctions for low performance.\n  I believe that this amendment represents a comprehensive, \nconstructive approach to real school reform.\n  In addition, the amendment increases authorized funding for \nelementary and secondary education by $35 billion. But it doesn't just \nadd money, it better targets funds to those truly educationally \ndisadvantaged children, such as poor students and limited English \nproficient students. According to tables prepared by the Congressional \nResearch Service, California would see increases in Title I, in teacher \ntraining, in programs for limited English proficient children and \ninnovative high performance grants.\n  Some may see it as tough. Some may see it as a too different. But we \nhave gotten to the point where we need to look at different ways. As \ndoctors say about an antibiotic, it must be (1) targeted; (2) of \nsufficient duration and (3) of sufficient dose. That is what this \namendment is.\n  By clearly linking federal dollars to results, we can begin to put in \nplace some real steps toward improving student achievement and making \npublic education produce real results.\n  My goal is not to be harsh, to ``dish out'' requirements, sanctions \nand penalties. Our schools are overwhelmed. Our teachers are \noverwhelmed. They are often asked to do the impossible.\n  But our few federal dollars--6 percent of total education spending--\ncan and should be used to produce results.\n  That is what this amendment does and that is why I support it.\n  I want to thank Senator Lieberman for including in his amendment two \nof my initiatives: one is on master teachers and the other is on use of \nTitle I funds.\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\n  In Title II of the bill, the title providing funds to strengthen \nteacher training, Senator Lieberman has added a master teacher section \nso that school districts can use these funds to establish master \nteacher programs. Under the language, a master teacher would be an \nexperienced teacher, one who has been teaching at least five years, and \nwho assists other (particularly new) teachers in improving their \nskills.\n  I have proposed creating master teacher programs because I believe \nthese ``senior teachers'' could enhance the profession of teaching and \nencourage people to stay in the classroom, as well as help the newer \nteachers ``learn the ropes.'' School districts could use these funds \nto, for example, increase teachers' salaries and that too could keep \nthem in the classroom instead of moving to an administrative job or to \nprivate industry.\n  In California, teachers' salaries average $44,585 which is $4,000 \nhigher than the U.S. average. But the schools cannot compete with \nprivate industry without some help. I believe starting master teachers \nshould earn at least $65,000 a year so that we can begin to reward \nexcellence and dedication and keep our teachers in the classroom. These \nprograms have proven to work in Rochester and Cincinnati and I believe \nother areas should be given the resources to try them too.\n  I am also grateful that Senator Lieberman has included language I \nsuggested to clarify and refine how Title I funds can be used. The goal \nof this amendment is to better focus Title I on improving students' \nacademic achievement. Under current law, there is little direction and \nno restrictions on how Title I funds can be used. Under this amendment, \nTitle I funds would have to be used for services directly related to \ninstruction, including extending instruction beyond the normal school \nday and year; purchasing books and other materials; and instructional \ninterventions to improve student achievement. Funds could not be used, \nfor example, for paying utility bills, janitorial services, \nconstructing facilities, and buying food and refreshments.\n  This amendment is needed because when my staff checked with a number \nof California schools, we learned that Title I funds have been used for \nvirtually everything, from clerical assistants to payroll \nadministration, from college counseling to coaching, from school yard \nduty personnel to school psychologists. Alan Bersin, Superintendent of \nthe San Diego Public Schools, found that Title I funds have been used \nto pay for everything from playground supervisors and field trips to \nnurses and counselors.\n  Many of these are no doubt worthy expenditures. But we have to \nrealize that Title I cannot do everything. With limited federal \ndollars, I believe we should focus those dollars on what counts--\nhelping students learn and helping teachers teach. Activities unrelated \nto instruction will have to be funded from other sources.\n\n  This debate is about the future of our nation. We must ask some \nfundamental questions about our schools.\n  Seventeen years ago, the nation's attention was jolted by a report \ntitled A Nation at Risk. In April 1983, the Reagan Administration's \nEducation Secretary, Terrell Bell, told the nation that we faced a \nfundamental crisis in the quality of American elementary and secondary \neducation. The report said:\n\n       Our nation is at risk. If an unfriendly foreign power had \n     attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational \n     performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it \n     as an act of war.\n\n  The report cited declines in student achievement and called for \nstrengthening graduation requirements, teacher preparation and \nestablishing standards and accountability.\n  Today, we still face mediocrity in our schools. While there are \nalways exceptions and clearly there are many excellent teachers and \nmany outstanding schools, we can do better. To those who say we cannot \nafford to spend more on education, I say we cannot afford to fail our \nchildren. Our children do not choose to be illiterate or uneducated. It \nis our responsibility and we must face up to it.\n  If we have failed, it is because as a society we have become \ncomplacent and have had low expectations. So we do whatever it takes, \nno matter how painful, to fix a system that is not only failing our \nchildren, but hurting our children.\n  If we are not willing to make the commitment to provide our children \na first-class education, we are failing as a society. What can be more \nimportant that giving our children a strong start, a knowledge base and \na set of skills that make them happy, productive and fulfilled \ncitizens?\n  I truly believe, if we expect our children to achieve, we must make \nit clear that we expect and support achievement in every way. That is \nwhy I support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for the next 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3679-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3679-S3681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INTERNATIONAL PARENTAL KIDNAPPING\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening \nbecause I want to draw my colleagues' attention to a very important \neditorial that appeared in this morning's Washington Post. This \neditorial concerns international parental kidnapping. I also call my \ncolleagues' attention to a feature article that appeared on the same \nsubject in Sunday's Washington Post.\n  Both Sunday's article and today's editorial are very critical of the \nway the Federal Government has been handling international parental \nabduction cases. In fact, the editorial today characterizes the \nGovernment's response to these cases as ``incomprehensibly \nlackadaisical.'' I could not have said it better myself.\n\n  This is an issue that I have spoken on this floor about on several \ndifferent occasions. It is a matter on which our committee has held \nseveral hearings. But despite those hearings and despite those \nspeeches, I do not think there has been anything that has explained it \nin as great a detail and in as heartbreaking a way as the article that \nappeared in Sunday's Washington Post.\n  That story involves the heartbreaking story of Joseph Cooke, who, for \nthe last 7 years, has been unable to retrieve his three children from a \nGerman foster home. In Mr. Cooke's case, his German-born wife had taken \ntheir three children on what was supposed to be a 3-week vacation to \nher homeland to visit her parents.\n  One day, though, during the trip, Mrs. Cooke took her children, \nboarded a German train, and essentially disappeared. She called her \nhusband and only gave him a cryptic explanation as to where she was \ngoing and what she was doing with their children.\n  Joseph contacted his wife's parents in Germany, but they gave him \nlittle help or information. What Joseph eventually discovered was that \nhis wife had checked into a German mental health facility and had \nplaced their children in the care of the German Youth Authority, who, \nin turn, put the children in a foster family. And even though Mrs. \nCooke eventually left the mental health clinic and returned to the \nUnited States, the children remained with the German foster family.\n  With very little information as to the whereabouts of his children, \nMr. Cooke tried desperately to get his children back. But despite the \nfact that the children are U.S. citizens, and were living in the United \nStates when they were taken--despite the fact that Joseph was awarded \neventual custody of the children by a U.S. court, and despite the very \nplain terms of the Hague Convention, an international treaty setting \nforth a process for the timely return of children wrongly removed or \nretained from their home country--German courts, in spite of that, \nruled that the children were to remain in Germany.\n  The Cooke case is a perfect example of how the Hague Convention, of \nwhich I point out Germany is a signatory, just isn't working. It isn't \nworking because the nations that have agreed to it, including the \nUnited States, refuse to make it work.\n  The United States complies with the Hague Convention. When another \ncountry makes an order, the United States, in over 80 percent of the \ncases, complies. That is not what I am talking about. What I am talking \nabout is we make no attempt to enforce it. It isn't working--let me \nrepeat--because the\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\nnations that have agreed to it, including the United States, refuse to \nmake it work.\n  Member countries are not complying, and, tragically, our State \nDepartment and our Justice Department are not doing anything about it. \nThe State Department is too reluctant to use the appropriate diplomatic \nchannels to encourage foreign nations to comply with the treaty.\n  As the Washington Post article pointed out on Sunday:\n\n       The State Department says it cannot enforce the Hague \n     convention or interfere in decisions overseas. ``There are no \n     consequences for noncompliance,'' said a U.S. official with \n     the embassy in Germany. ``I look at it as a voluntary \n     compliance sort of thing.''\n  ``I look at it as a voluntary compliance sort of thing.''\n  With that kind of attitude on behalf of our State Department, is it \nany wonder no country pays any attention to us?\n  ``. . . a voluntary compliance sort of thing.''\n  As a Senator and as a parent and as a grandparent, I find that kind \nof approach to treaty enforcement appalling and unacceptable. The fact \nof the matter is, international parental abduction goes far beyond \nJoseph Cooke's tragic situation.\n  Currently, the State Department has on file at least 1,100 cases of \ninternational parental kidnapping, when one parent illegally takes his \nor her child out of the United States and right out of the life of the \nparent left behind.\n  These kidnappings and ensuing custody battles devastate families. \nThey are devastating not only for the left behind parent but also for \nthe child who is denied what every child should have; that is, the love \nof one of his or her parents.\n  Equally devastating is that during the media hype surrounding the \nElian Gonzalez case, the State Department tried to use that case as a \npublic relations opportunity to boost their own miserable record on \ngetting our kids back from international parental abductions.\n  Amazingly, in one media account a State Department official actually \nsaid that in cases of international parental kidnappings: ``We don't \ntake no for an answer.'' That is simply not true. The sad reality is \nthat both our State Department and our Justice Department are, in fact, \ntaking no for an answer. Their actions or inactions are speaking a lot \nlouder than their words.\n  For example, the Justice Department rarely pursues prosecution under \nthe International Parental Kidnapping Act, and, in the last 5 years, \njust 62 indictments and only 13 convictions have resulted from \nthousands and thousands and thousands of cases of abductions.\n  Every parent who has been left behind when a spouse or former spouse \nhas kidnapped their children knows that our Government is not making \nthe return of those children a top and immediate priority. The message \nthis Government--our Federal Government--continues to send to these \nparents is that once their children are abducted and taken out of the \nUnited States, they just don't matter anymore.\n  When I have asked the State and Justice Departments about this, when \nI have asked repeatedly about why they are not doing more to help these \nparents get their kids back, all I get are excuses.\n  Contrast that message and that inaction toward American children with \nthe dramatic and very different message that those same officials sent \nby forcing, at gunpoint, the reunion of Elian Gonzalez with his dad. \nThat, indeed, paints a very different picture.\n  The excuses are endless. State and Justice blame their inaction on \ncomplicated extradition laws. Other times, they say these cases are \nprivate disputes between parents so the Federal Government should be \nleft out of such matters. They figure, too, that these children are \nreally not being kidnapped by strangers --they are with a parent, after \nall, so what is the big deal?\n  Taken all together, these factors suggest that the State Department \nis more interested in maintaining positive relationships and diplomatic \nties with foreign governments than in helping American parents. In \nessence, these agencies are saying: You may steal American kids and get \naway with it.\n  Quite frankly, when it comes to a stolen child, there should be no \nexcuses. Our Federal agencies must make these abductions a top \npriority. They need to coordinate efforts to offer more assistance to \ndistraught parents seeking a safe return of their children from abroad. \nThey should begin a training program for U.S. attorneys and designate \none attorney in each of their offices across our country to be \nresponsible for these international abduction cases.\n  Additionally, I am writing to President Clinton about his upcoming \nmeeting with the German Chancellor and am encouraging him to discuss \nJoseph Cooke's case, and the other cases that we have pending in \nGermany, as well as the overall pattern of German noncompliance with \nthe Hague Convention.\n  Further, with regard to the Hague Convention, specifically, in March, \nI submitted a resolution which now has the support of 35 Senate \ncosponsors to encourage all of the countries that have signed the Hague \nConvention, particularly those countries that consistently violate the \nconvention--namely, Austria, Germany, and Sweden--to comply fully with \nboth the letter and the spirit of their obligations under the \nconvention that they signed.\n  This resolution we have introduced urges countries to return children \nunder that convention without reaching the underlying custody dispute \nand to remove barriers to parental visitation. I am pleased to report \nthat the resolution has been approved by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and is awaiting floor consideration.\n  Governance is about setting priorities. Policymaking is about setting \npriorities. Yes, our State Department has a lot to do and, yes, our \nJustice Department has a lot to do and, yes, there is no real teeth in \nthe Hague Convention, other than international opinion, other than \ngood, hard negotiations between countries. What I am asking the State \nDepartment and the Justice Department to do is begin to prioritize \nthese cases.\n  The Attorney General of the United States should say to every U.S. \nattorney across this country that parental kidnapping cases should be \nat the top of the list of your priorities. Pay attention and deal with \nthese cases. The Secretary of State should say to our embassies \noverseas, to our ambassadors, yes, trade is important; yes, immigration \nissues are important; yes, whatever is the topic of the day is \nimportant as you sit down and discuss these issues with the President \nof the country you are dealing with, or the Prime Minister; these are \nall important things; but also don't forget the children who have been \nstolen from their parents in the United States are important, also, and \nthey should have a high priority.\n  So it is not an excuse that should be accepted by the parents of \nthese children, nor by this Senate, by this Congress, nor by the \nAmerican people, that we just don't have time to do this, or it just \ncan't be enforced or other things are going on. This should be a \npriority.\n  I am calling on our Government today to make judgments and set \npriorities. Our children should always be our first priority. I think \nit is ironic that it is easier today to get our ambassadors and our \nState Department engaged on a trade matter than it is on a matter \nregarding the stealing of one of our children. The stealing of our \nchildren is important, and it is equally as important, I hope, and \nwould be so considered by the Justice Department and by the State \nDepartment as a trade matter or the enforcement or the prosecution of \nany number of other types of cases.\n  In the end, we are succeeding in bringing parentally abducted \nchildren back to their homes in the U.S. Our Federal Government must \ntake an active role in their return. Ultimately, our Government has an \nobligation to these parents and, more important, to the children who \nhave been kidnapped. It is time our Government agencies put American \nparents and their children first.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, May 9, is the 200th anniversary \nof the birth of a famous American who remains probably the most \ncontroversial figure in U.S. history. On May 9, 1800, John Brown was \nborn. It is his birth and his life and the institution of slavery that \nI will speak about this evening for a few minutes.\n  I grew up in eastern Kansas. As a child, I played on the ground where \nJohn Brown stayed most often while he was in Osawatomie, KS. He was \nknown as Osawatomie Brown for his fighting during the early phases of \nwhat led to be the Civil War. He stayed at the Adaire cabin. His \nbrother-in-law was a minister in Osawatomie. It was on property which \nmy grandparents owned that the cabin was later moved, to the park where \nthe Battle of Osawatomie took place. That park was dedicated by Teddy \nRoosevelt. Such was the importance of what took place there in the epic \nstruggle in this country to end the institution of slavery.\n  John Brown, the renowned abolitionist, was hanged for his attempt to \nincite a slave rebellion at Harper's Ferry, VA. Yet even though \neveryone objects to his tactics, his death has become ``the symbol of \nevery element opposed to slavery.'' His contemporary, Frederick \nDouglass, the great African American abolitionist, acknowledged that \n``John Brown began the war that ended American slavery and made this a \nfree Republic.''\n  This 200th anniversary is a reminder of the heartache wrought by \nslavery in America. It is a humble tribute to the suffering of millions \nof African Americans who lived and died under dehumanizing bondage. \nJohn Brown is a part of that story.\n  He was born in Litchfield County, CT, on May 9, 1800, and absorbed a \ndeep hatred of the pervasive institution of chattel slavery early in \nhis life. Once, while herding his father's cattle to market a long \ndistance, he watched as a slave boy his age, whom Brown had befriended, \nwas violently beaten with an iron shovel. He was acquainted with the \ncommon forms of punishment wherein ``slaves were stripped of their \nclothing, faced against a tree or wall, tied down or made to hang from \na beam, their legs roped together with a rail or board between them, \nand severely beaten.'' Such things surely motivated his increasing \ndisdain. He internalized a passage from the Bible, Hebrews 13:3, which \nsays:\n\n       Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and \n     them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the \n     body.\n\n  The English Parliamentarian, William Wilberforce, and other people of \ncourage, had ended slavery in Great Britain by 1807. Yet in John \nBrown's America, slavery thrived and grew as the American cotton trade \nboomed from 1815 until 1860, aggressively capturing the European \nmarket. By 1860, there were 4 million slaves in America. No one knows \nthe total number of slaves from the time of the first settlers in 1619 \nto the end of the Civil War in 1865, but the number is staggering--in \nthe several millions.\n  Particularly during the 17th and 18th centuries, multitudes of people \nhad been abducted from Africa to America. Their month-long passage \nepitomized the degradation to follow:\n\n       Segregated by gender, the blacks were chained together and \n     packed so tightly that they often were forced to lie on their \n     sides in spoon fashion. Clearances and ships' holds often \n     were only two to four feet high. In bad weather or because of \n     some perceived threat, they had to remain below, chained to \n     one another, lying in their own filth. ``The floor of the \n     rooms,'' one 18th-century ship observer wrote, ``was so \n     covered with blood and mucus which had proceeded from them \n     in consequence of dysentery, that it resembled a slaughter \n     house.'' Slave ships were smelled before they were seen, \n     as they entered the harbor in heinous conditions.\n\n  It is said that slavery contemporary to this time was the largest \nmanifestation of human bondage in the history of mankind. I ask, how \ncould this great nation, birthed in freedom, systematically and \nshamelessly reap great fortunes, in part, on the backs of abducted, \nbrutalized people? How could human beings be branded like cattle, \nbought and sold at will in the middle of a busy market place, ripped \nfrom their families, raped with impunity resulting in children who were \nthen also enslaved, lashed with bullwhips, murdered without \nconsequence, worked to death, their very humanity mocked in every \npossible way? One American commenting on our slave trade overseas \nremarked, ``We are a byword among the nations.'' It was in this evil \ntime that John Brown began to champion political and social equality \nfor African-Americans, as did a growing number of abolitionist \nsocieties which mushroomed in the 1830's.\n  In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed by Congress whereby \nharboring people escaping from slavery, even to the free states, became \na Federal crime. This crime carried a penalty of up to 6 months of \nincarceration and a $1,000 fine, which was a substantial sum \nconsidering that the average daily wage was $1.50. Moreover, the act \nprovided that Federal agents would not be charged in tracking escapees, \neven in the North, forcing slaves back to their masters. Consider that \nAmerican taxes were paying for this wretched service of slave catching, \nin a country whose revolution was synonymous worldwide with a renowned \nliberty.\n  In protest, John Brown, like many abolitionists of his day, provided \nassistance to fugitive slaves seeking freedom in the northern United \nStates and Canada. Also, fugitive slaves lived with him and his family, \ndespite the threatened penalties. At one point, he moved his family to \nNorth Elba, NY, to live with a community of escaped and redeemed \nslaves, to teach reading and faming.\n  Another blow occurred in 1854 when the Kansas and Nebraska Act was \npassed by Congress, repealing earlier legislation which had outlawed \nslavery in the territory from which Kansas was created. This new act \nallowed residents to vote on whether or not slavery would be adopted by \nthe new state, making it an option for the first time. so Kansas and \nNebraska could be slave States.\n\n  It was the common thinking of the time that actually what would \nhappen was Nebraska would become a free State and Kansas a slave State; \nthat Iowans would pour over into Nebraska, making it a free State; \nMissourians would pour over into Kansas, and Kansas would become a \nslave State; thus, the balance would be maintained.\n  In response, John Brown and family members moved to Kansas in 1855 to \noppose the expansion of slavery into the western territories, as did a \nflood of Free Soilers, as free state advocates were called, from the \nEast. The free state epicenter was the city of Lawrence, which \nattracted many Eastern anti-slavery people and became a target for \ndestruction by the Border Ruffians.\n  During this time, pro-slavery forces terrorized Kansan free state \nsettlers with beatings, shootings, looting, and ballot stuffing. An \nEnglish traveler observed that ``murder and cold-blooded assassination \nwere of almost daily occurrence . . . Murderers, if only they have \nmurdered in behalf of slavery, have gone unpunished; whilst hundreds \nhave been made to suffer for no other crime than the suspicion of \nentertaining free-state sentiments.'' Numerous Kansas conflicts \nincluded the Wakarusa War, the sacking of Lawrence, and the battles of \nBlack Jack, Osawatomie, and the Spurs. In this brutal period, Brown \nbecame a national symbol of ``Bleeding Kansas'' and the free state \nstruggle. During his 3 years of activity in the Kansas Territory, he \norchestrated offensives against the Border Ruffians, and helped to \nliberate dozens of enslaved African-Americans by force from Missouri \nfarms. Sadly, he participated, tacitly or overtly, in the killing of 5 \nmen at Pottawatomie Creek in a shameful incident which\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\nstill haunts his legacy today. These were dangerous times generating \nextreme responses from both sides.\n  During the presidential elections of 1856, the conflict crescendoed, \nand the central debate was slavery in Kansas. That year, the new \nRepublican party ``emerged with a single plank in its platform: Stop \nthe bloody struggle in Kansas; stop the spread of slavery in the \nterritories.'' Finally, Kansas was birthed a free state in 1861. Her \nmotto, Ad Astra Per Aspera--To the Stars Through Difficulty, is an \nhistoric truth, reflecting a people whose freedom had been won through \nunusual hardship and conflict. This is the extraordinary heritage of \nKansas, and it is linked with John Brown.\n  His actions in Kansas, followed by his attempt to incite a slave \ninsurrection at Harper's Ferry, Virginia on October 16, 1859 forced a \nrenewed examination of the institution of slavery and strengthened the \nresolve of the North to resist further expansion. President Abraham \nLincoln, condemned the tactics of John Brown at the time of his death \nas we all do now and did not object to his execution on December 2, \n1859 for treason against the state. Nevertheless, Lincoln told an \nAtchison, Kansas audience that Brown had ``shown great courage, rare \nunselfishness'' and ``agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong.'' On \nthat December day of his execution, his words rang prophetically true, \nforetelling the coming Civil War, when he stated, ``I, John Brown, am \nnow quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be \npurged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered \nmyself that without very much bloodshed it might be done.''\n  Those were his words on the way to the gallows.\n  In this fight for which he had sacrificed everything, John Brown's \nexcesses were as extreme as his hatred of slavery. His willingness to \nshed blood is wrong, should not be romanticized, nor justified, no \nmatter the cruelty of the circumstances. Yet we should remember the \nsacrifices that he, and others like him, both black and white, made to \nprocure the freedom of an entire people. A contemporary, Franklin \nSanborn, summarized this best: ``We saw this lonely and obscure old man \nchoosing poverty before wealth, renouncing the ties of affection, \nthrowing away his ease, his reputation, and his life for the sake of a \ndespised race and for zeal in the defense of his country's ancient \nliberties.''\n  Therefore, let us remember this 200th anniversary of John Brown and \nthe crooked path we walked as a nation towards freedom for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3682-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN WILLIAM H. LEWIS, CIVIL ENGINEER CORPS, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the \nexemplary service and career of an outstanding naval officer, Captain \nWilliam H. Lewis, upon his retirement from the Navy at the conclusion \nof more than 27 years of commissioned service. Throughout his \ndistinguished career, Captain Lewis has truly epitomized the Navy core \nvalues of honor, courage, and commitment. It is my privilege to commend \nhim for a superb career of service he has provided the Navy and our \ngreat Nation.\n  Captain Lewis is a native of Newburgh, New York. He studied civil \nengineering at the Ohio State University on a Naval Reserve Officer \nTraining Command scholarship. He also received his Master's degree in \nCivil Engineering at Ohio State on an Environmental Protection Agency \nFellowship before being commissioned as a Navy Civil Engineer Corps \nofficer in 1973. Captain Lewis later attended L'Universita di Perugia, \nItaly, and the Executive Program at the University of Michigan.\n  His first tour of duty was at Naval Station Treasure Island as the \nAssistant Public Works Officer. He became Treasure Island's first Staff \nCivil Engineer with the commissioning of Public Works Center San \nFrancisco Bay. He also had tours as an Assistant Resident Officer in \nCharge of Construction (ROICC), ROICC San Francisco Bay Area, with \nWestern Division (WESTDIV), Naval Facilities Engineering Command \n(NAVFAC), San Bruno, California; an instructor at the Civil Engineer \nCorps Officers School at Port Hueneme, California; and as the Flag Aide \nto the Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command and Chief of \nCivil Engineers.\n  In 1980, he served with the Seabees as the Alfa Company commander for \nU.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) SIXTY-TWO homeported in \nmy great State of Mississippi. The MINUTEMEN were deployed to Rota, \nSpain where they won the Battle E and Peltier Award as the best Seabee \nbattalion in the Atlantic Fleet and entire fleet respectively. NMCB-62 \nalso served in Roosevelt Roads where they redeployed to build a Cuban-\nHaitian refugee camp at Fort Allen and was the last full battalion \ndeployed to Diego Garcia. In 1982, he returned to WESTDIV as the \nAssistant Head of the Acquisition Department. In that capacity, he \nserved as the Air Force Program Coordinator for the Space Shuttle \nfacilities for the military Space Transportation System program and the \ndesign of the $220 million David Grant Medical Center at Travis Air \nForce Base, Fairfield, California. In 1985, he was selected to be the \nDeputy Officer in Charge of Construction at Travis AFB on the largest \nfirm fixed price construction contract awarded by NAVFAC that year. In \n1986, he became the Staff Civil Engineer for Commander, Fleet Air \nMediterranean in Naples, Italy responsible for the Navy's NATO \nInfrastructure Program and Project PRONTO. In 1989, he returned to Navy \nPublic Works Center San Francisco Bay as the Production Officer and \nparticipated in the disaster recovery operations from the Loma Prieta \nearthquake. In 1992, he became Vice Commander at the Western Division, \nNaval Facilities Engineering Command, San Bruno, California. In 1994 he \nbecame the Commanding Officer, Engineering Field Activity, \nMediterranean, Naples, Italy in support of the Fifth and Sixth Fleets \nand the Department of Defense's largest overseas construction program, \nincluding the Naples Improvement initiative, the bed down of the \n31Tactical Fighter Wing at Aviano, Italy, and the force protection \nefforts at Bahrain. In 1997, he reported onboard as the Executive \nOfficer, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southern Division \n(SOUTHDIV), Charleston, South Carolina. On May 14, 1998, he became the \n27th Commanding Officer at SOUTHDIV.\n\n  Captain Lewis' awards include the Legion of Merit, Meritorious \nService Medal (third gold star), Navy Commendation Medal (second gold \nstar), Air Force Commendation Medal and Navy Achievement Medal (gold \nstar). He is a member of the Society of American Military Engineers and \nTau Beta Pi and is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of \nCalifornia. Captain Lewis is Seabee Combat Warfare qualified, a member \nof the Acquisition Professional Community and holds a Level III \n(unlimited) NAVFAC Contracting warrant as well as a Level III \n(unlimited) Real Estate Contracting Warrant.\n  Captain Lewis' visionary leadership, exceptionally creative problem \nsolving skills and uncommon dedication have created a legacy of \nachievement and excellence. The Great State of Mississippi has \nbenefitted immensely from Captain Lewis' engineering leadership, both \nduring his time as a junior officer serving with the Seabees in \nGulfport, Mississippi and in his present capacity as commanding officer \nof SOUTHDIV. As Commander, Southern Division, Naval Facilities \nEngineering Command, Captain Lewis was instrumental in completing \nprojects throughout the Great State of Mississippi, to include critical \nwaterfront projects at Naval Station Pascagoula; planning and design of \na future Warfighting Center at Stennis, Mississippi, and a major Navy \nFamily Housing complex in Gulfport.\n  Captain Lewis will retire on May 12, 2000 after 27 years of dedicated \ncommissioned service. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, I wish Captain Lewis fair winds and following seas. \nCongratulations on completion of an outstanding and successful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3682-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3682-S3683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MYRA LEONARD--A LEGENDARY LADY\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this is an occasion when I wish to attempt, \nwith a heavy heart, to pay my respects to a dear lady who last week \npassed away. Myra Leonard was a leader of the Polish-American community \nand the long-\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\ntime Executive Director of the Washington Office of the Polish American \nCongress.\n  For nearly 20 years Myra was a respected and tireless advocate of the \nties that bind the United States and Poland. During the 1980s, when \nPoland's Solidarity movement struggled under martial law, Myra \ngenerated great support for the movement by soliciting humanitarian \nsupport to Poland.\n  She coordinated the ``Solidarity Express''--a train of some 22 \nrailroad cars loaded with relief goods. At her suggestion, on the \nfirst-year anniversary of Solidarity, a Solidarity Convoy produced \nthirty-two container trucks bearing relief cargo.\n  Myra's initiatives contributed literally millions of dollars of \nhumanitarian support to the Polish people during that difficult decade, \nbut more recently, Myra played a pivotal role in the effort to \ntransform the Polish-American relationship from one of partnership to \nthat of allies. One cannot overestimate the energy and momentum she and \nher husband, Casimir, brought to the effort to bring Poland into the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. For her efforts, Myra and her \nhusband were both honored by the Polish Government with the Commanders' \nCross.\n  This year, Poland and the United States will, together, launch the \nPolish American Freedom Foundation. Myra's invaluable counsel and \npolitical judgment ensured that this initiative successfully navigated \nthe difficult path of transforming a grand concept into a real \nfoundation that will on a daily basis reaffirm the commitment of the \nUnited States and Poland to democracy and freedom.\n  So, we are deeply saddened by Myra's passing and we use this occasion \nto express to her husband, Casimir Leonard, and to the other members of \nher family, how much we will miss her. Our memory of Myra will be a \nlady of tireless energy and warmth who brought to Washington a genuine \ndevotion to the ties binding Poland and America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3683-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3683-S3684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REUNITING AMERICAN CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, throughout the dispute over Elian Gonzalez, \nI have argued that he should be reunited with his father Juan Miguel, I \nhave made this argument because I believe that children belong with \ntheir parents, barring evidence of unfitness. I also made this argument \nbecause I was concerned about how American parents are being treated \ninternationally.\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearing held on the Elian Gonzalez case on \nMarch 1, I also urged that we consider the potential impact of that \ncase on those of U.S. parents fighting to gain custody of their \nchildren in other countries. In fact, at that hearing I made sure to \ninvite a U.S. parent who has struggled for years just for the right to \nsee his children in Japan, and who believes, as do other American \nparents in similar circumstances, that to preserve American credibility \nwe must practice what we preach and reunite Elian Gonzalez and his \nfather.\n  I worked for months on such a case of an American child who was taken \nabroad by an estranged parent. Had it not been for the active \nintervention of the Government of Egypt, the child would not have been \nreunited with his American mother. Reuniting Elian and his father was \nthe best thing for Elian and also the best way to advance American \ninterests--and the interests of American parents whose children have \nbeen taken abroad without their consent.\n  At the March 1 hearing, I quoted Mary Ryan, the Assistant Secretary \nof State for Consular Affairs, who had testified in the federal court \ncase regarding Elian Gonzalez that a failure to enforce the INS' \ndecision that Elian Gonzalez should be reunited with his father would \n``be inconsistent with the principles we advocate on behalf of the \nUnited States and could have potentially lasting negative implications \nfor left-behind parents in the United States and for U.S. citizen \nchildren taken to foreign countries.''\n  I believe that the American government should stand behind that \nprinciple and seek to bring children and their parents back together. I \nam proud that the government has reunited Elian and his father, and I \nthink the pictures of the two of them together have proven beyond a \ndoubt that this was the right result.\n  But I am deeply concerned that the energy and effectiveness that our \ngovernment showed in reuniting Elian and his father does not always \nseem to apply to its attempts to reunite American children and their \nparents. Indeed, recent articles in the Washington Post indicate that \nour State Department should take a far more active role in helping \nAmerican parents who--in violation of international law--are being \ndeprived of custody of their children.\n  The Washington Post tells the story of Joseph Cooke, a New York man \nwhose then-wife took their two young children to Germany and, without \nMr. Cooke's consent, turned the children over to the state because she \nfelt unable to care for them. For a year and a half, Mr. Cooke was \nunable to find out what had happened to his children, as his wife \nrefused even to tell him where they were. When he finally was able to \nlocate them, he sought custody of them in both American and German \ncourts. Although he obtained a custody order from an American court, \nwhich under the Hague Convention is binding upon Germany since the \nchildren had resided in the United States for all of their young lives, \nthe German courts have refused to grant him custody. Instead, they have \nruled that the children should stay with their foster parents, in part \nbecause during the drawn-out German legal process, the children learned \nGerman, went to German schools, and grew attached to their foster \nparents. The court felt that reuniting these children with their father \nwould result in ``severe psychological loss.''\n  The State Department's reaction to this case hardly befits the \nimportance of the issue involved. Despite Germany's obligations under \nthe Hague Convention, a State Department spokeswoman told the \nWashington Post, ``We're not the courts. It's up to the courts to make \nthose kinds of decisions.'' The very point of the Hague Convention is \nto provide countries with a diplomatic opportunity to question the \nrulings of courts outside the country were the children habitually \nreside. The Convention is rendered meaningless if our State Department \nis not willing to act as a strong advocate for American parents. As the \nPost reported, only 80 out of the 369 children--22 percent--who were \nthe subject of Hague applications from American parents from 1990 to \n1998 have come back to the United States, and that number includes \nthose children who were voluntarily returned. Meanwhile, U.S. courts \nhave returned 90 percent of children who were the subject of Hague \napplications in other countries.\n  In other words, while America obeys its treaty obligations, it has \nfailed to enforce our own treaty rights. This is not a minor problem, \neither. The State Department says that it has 1,148 open international \ncustody cases, and there are surely far more cases that have not been \nreported to the government. The State Department should be doing \neverything within its power to help American parents. I implore our \ngovernment to pay more attention to this issue, and I ask our allies to \nabide by their own duties under the Hague Convention.\n  I ask unanimous consent to enter an editorial on this matter from \ntoday's Washington Post into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 9, 2000]\n\n                            Stolen Children\n\n       When Congress was considering legislation that would have \n     kept Elian Gonzalez in this country, State Department \n     officials argued that such a precedent could disrupt their \n     efforts to intervene in cases where American parents have had \n     children abducted abroad. A sound argument, with one big \n     problem: It turns out that in many of the 1,100 open cases in \n     which American parents are fighting to get their children \n     back from recalcitrant court systems in other countries, the \n     State Department isn't making much effort on the parents' \n     behalf. The heartwrenching story of Joseph Cooke and his \n     children, told Sunday in this newspaper by Post reporters \n     Cindy Loose and William Drozdiak, highlights an unusually \n     egregious problem with German-American custody battles in \n     particular: In at least 30 cases, advocates say, German \n     judges have flouted basic tenets of the 1980 Hague treaty on \n     international abductions, to which their country is a \n     signatory, and kept children from parents who had \n     overwhelming claims to them. But the Cooke story also reveals \n     an almost incomprehensibly lackadaisical U.S. Government \n     response to the\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\n     human tragedies that arise when a parent cannot get his or \n     her rights enforced.\n       The Hague Convention calls for quick resolution of custody \n     disputes in the country where a child ``habitually resides.'' \n     The law lacks teeth: An official at the U.S. Embassy in \n     Germany told a Post reporter that he viewed the Hague \n     Convention as ``a voluntary compliance sort of thing.'' Up \n     the ladder, it's the same: U.S. ambassadors fail to raise \n     individual cases or to make diplomatic noise over these \n     cases. German officials say they cannot intervene in the \n     court system. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, \n     meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright this week, \n     echoed that view when the secretary raised the Cooke case--\n     though Mr. Fischer said he was touched by the Cookes' \n     ``personal tragedy.''\n       American reluctance to apply diplomatic pressure makes no \n     more sense than German excuses about ``interfering'' in the \n     judiciary. Public and private pressure through diplomatic \n     channels on behalf of sundered families can indeed have an \n     effect; so could legislation to require judges to be trained \n     in the applicable laws. When an ally such as Germany flouts \n     good conduct in this regard, the issue should rise to the top \n     of the diplomatic agenda, not be shunted aside.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3684-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE QUARTERLY MAIL COSTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n THE CLINTON-GORE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS TO INVEST SOCIAL SECURITY \n                          INTO PRIVATE MARKETS\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I note with interest Vice President \nGore's recent attacks on Governor Bush's comments regarding Governor \nBush's thoughts on Social Security reform. In dismissing the Governor's \nsuggestions regarding Social Security reform, Vice President Gore \ndenied that the Clinton-Gore Administration ever proposed the dangerous \nidea of having the government invest Social Security surpluses in the \nstock market. According to the May 2, 2000 Washington Post, the Vice \nPresident claimed that the administration never made any such proposal, \nsaying ``We didn't really propose it.''\n  I find it surprising that the Vice President made this denial, \nespecially since the Clinton-Gore administration has indeed made this \nproposal, and done so a number of times. First, on January 19, 1999, \nwith the Vice President right behind him, President Clinton said in his \nState of the Union Address, and I quote, ``Specifically, I propose that \nwe commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 years to \nSocial Security, investing a small portion in the private sector, just \nas any private or state government pension would do.''\n  Just a few weeks later, the Clinton-Gore FY 2000 budget said quite \nclearly, on page 41, that ``The Administration proposes tapping the \npower of private financial markets to increase the resources to pay for \nfuture Social Security benefits. Roughly one-fifth of the unified \nbudget surplus set aside for Social Security would be invested in \ncorporate equities or other private financial instruments.''\n  When I read this proposal, I was extremely concerned and proposed an \namendment to the FY 2000 Budget Resolution that would express the Sense \nof the Senate that the government should not invest Social Security \nfunds in the stock market. My amendment passed the Senate unanimously. \nAfter this resounding statement by the Senate, I hoped that we had laid \nthe risky scheme to have the government invest Social Security funds in \nthe stock market to rest.\n  Despite the fact that we had sent the clearest possible signal on \nthis issue, the Clinton-Gore administration apparently did not get the \nmessage. On page 37 of the Clinton-Gore administration's FY 2001 \nbudget, they resurrected this risky scheme to have the government \ninvest the Social Security dollars in the stock market, saying, ``The \nPresident proposes to invest half the transferred amounts in corporate \nequities.'' The only concession that the Clinton-Gore administration \nappeared to make was writing this unpopular proposal in smaller type \nthan last year.\n  In response to this repeated proposal, I once again submitted an \namendment to the Budget Resolution expressing the Sense of the Senate \nthat the federal government should not invest the Social Security trust \nfund in the stock market. Once again this amendment passed with no \nvotes in opposition.\n  The Senate has twice unanimously passed an amendment rejecting the \nidea of having the government invest the trust fund in the stock \nmarket. I am pleased that the Vice President now agrees with us, but I \nfind it curious that he has failed to notice that it is his \nadministration that has repeatedly suggested this risky scheme.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration's repeated attempts to implement this \nplan violates U.S. law. For more than 60 years Social Security law has \nforbidden the trust funds from being invested in the stock market. This \nnew scheme is directly contrary to six decades of U.S. policy on Social \nSecurity.\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\n  In addition to the Senate and long-standing U.S. government policy \nopposing government investment of the trust funds in the stock market, \nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan opposes the idea as well. \nChairman Greenspan says that investing Social Security funds in the \nmarket is bad for Social Security and bad for our economy.\n  When Alan Greenspan talks, the Clinton-Gore administration ought to \nlisten. Chairman Greenspan has said this plan ``will create a lower \nrate of return for Social Security recipients,'' and he ``does not \nbelieve that it is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds \nfrom a governmental direction.''\n\n  In addition to these other concerns, I am also listening to the \nconcerns of Missourians. Last year I received a letter from Todd \nLawrence of Greenwood, Missouri, who wrote: ``It has been suggested \nthat the government would invest in the stock market with my Social \nSecurity money. No offense, but there is not much that the Government \ntouches that works well. Why would making MY investment decisions for \nme be any different. Looking at it from a business perspective, would \nthe owner of a corporation feel comfortable if the government were the \nprimary shareholder?''\n  Todd Lawrence understands what the Clinton-Gore administration does \nnot. No corporation would want the government as a shareholder, and no \ninvestor should want the government handling their investment.\n  Even if the government were able to invest without adding new levels \nof inefficiency to the process, the government's putting Social \nSecurity taxes in the stock market adds an unacceptable level of risk \nto retirement. This risk is a gamble I am unwilling to make for the one \nmillion Missourians who get Social Security.\n  It is hard to overestimate how dangerous this scheme really is. While \nindividuals properly manage their financial portfolios to control risk, \nthe government has no business taking these gambles with the people's \nmoney.\n  Just recently, the Microsoft case gave us a chilling illustration of \nthe potential conflicts of interest caused by the President's proposal. \nIf the government had invested Social Security funds in the stock \nmarket, the anti-trust suit against Microsoft would have put those \nfunds at risk. Whatever one may think of the wisdom of the case, we do \nnot want the federal government making law enforcement decisions based \non government's stock portfolio.\n  While Americans should invest as much as they can afford in private \nequities to plan for their own retirements, the government should stay \nout of the stock market. I am glad that the Vice President has finally \nrecognized that having the government invest the trust fund in the \nstock market, but I wish that he would remember that his administration \nhas been the most vocal proponent of this bad idea. If the federal \ngovernment tried to pick market winners and losers, all of us would end \nup as losers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3685-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, next month, friends, associates and \ncolleagues will gather at Utah State University to honor Mr. Marvin G. \nFifield, a remarkable man whose entire professional career has been \ndevoted to improving the lives of those with learning or developmental \ndisabilities. While I stand in tribute to my friend of many years, it \nis his body of work over the span of forty-four years that does him \nhonor.\n  At his retirement on July 1, Dr. Fifield will have served as the \nfounder and Director of the Center for Persons with Disabilities for \nthirty-three years. He wrote the grant application, saw it funded, and \ndirected the creation of the center. But it is not the Center alone \nthat owes its existence to Dr. Fifield. Over a thirty year period, he \nsucceeded in writing, achieving the approval and funding for over fifty \nprojects, with combined grants exceeding $60 million. Without his \nskilled direction, numerous regional mental health centers, \nrehabilitation and vocational services, studies and workshops would not \nnow be available. The Navajo Initiative in the Developmental \nDisabilities program, the Indian Children's Program, and the Native \nAmerican Initiative program all owe their start to this man.\n  Dr. Fifield's chairmanship and membership in professional and \ncommunity service organizations bridges more than three decades and \nforty organizations. To this day he chairs or serves on eight boards, \nincluding serving as Chairman of the Hatch Utah Advisory Committee on \nDisability Policy. He also serves on the innovative Assistive \nTechnology Work Group. Marv was the first to champion assistive \ntechnologies for people with disabilities--or at least I think he was \nthe first because he was the first to tell me about this exciting \nfield. Assistive technology comprises all devices that improve the \nfunctional capabilities of those individuals with disabilities.\n  Marv Fifield is so accomplished that his curriculum vitae is not so \nmuch measured in pages as in pounds.\n  In academe, an individual's worth is often measured by how widely \nthey have been published. Dr. Fifield has published seventeen books, \nchapters in books, or monographs; he has published twelve refereed \njournal articles and seven non-referenced journal articles; he has \npublished seven technical papers; he has submitted ten testimonies and \nreports to congressional and Senate subcommittees; published twenty-\nthree final reports and research reports; authored eleven instructional \nproducts, and has authored ninety-one selected unpublished conference \npapers.\n  Dr. Fifield has been a consultant to both national and international \norganizations including the World Health Organization. Among the richly \ndeserved honors bestowed upon him, he is the recipient of the Leone \nLeadership Award, the highest honor an administrator can receive. He \nwas presented the Maurice Warshaw Outstanding Service Award by the \nGovernor of the State of Utah and was twice called to serve as a staff \nmember on the Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n  Since 1981, Marv Fifield has provided leadership for my Utah Advisory \nCommittee on Disability Policy. The Disability Advisory Committee has \nbecome a model for encouraging constructive dialogue among diverse \ninterests and points of view. The committee has often been able to \ndevelop consensus recommendations, which have helped me a great deal \nover the years. I am most grateful to Marv for all his efforts with the \ncommittee.\n  I want to wish him well as he enters the next chapter in his already \nfull life. I hope he will find retirement rewarding. But, if he thinks \nhe can escape consulting with me and those in Utah who rely on his \nquiet and good-natured leadership to achieve consensus on matters of \nimportance in disability policy, he can forget it. I am here to \nannounce that we are not letting him off the hook. We need the benefit \nof Marv's knowledge, his humor, and his diplomacy to help us continue \nmoving forward.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise today to pay a well-deserved tribute to Dr. \nMarvin Fifield. But, I am not bidding him farewell. On the contrary, I \nwill be calling\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\non him often for the same solid advice and counsel he has given to us \nfor so many years.\n  The lives of countless thousands of disabled and disadvantaged \ncitizens have been enriched as a result of Marvin Fifield's work. As a \nresult, our nation will benefit for generations to come. It is a \nprivilege to honor him today. I am proud to call him a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3686-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SALUTE TO WE THE PEOPLE STUDENTS\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, over the past several days, more \nthan 1,200 students from across the United States are in Washington to \ncompete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that the class \nfrom Wyndmere High School from Wyndmere, North Dakota represents my \nstate in this national event. These young scholars have worked \ndiligently to reach the national finals and through their experience \nhave gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental \nprinciples and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The names of these students are: Brian Boyer, Mandy David, Julie \nDotzenrod, Elizabeth Foertsch, Alissa Haberman, Lindsey Heitkamp, Lori \nHeitkamp, Daniel Hodgson, Jesse Nelson, Kari Schultz, Amy Score, John \nTotenhagen, and Bobbi Ann Ulvestad. I would also like to recognize \ntheir teacher, Dave Hodgson, who deserves much of the credit for the \nsuccess of the class, Phil Harmeson, North Dakota's dedicated state \ncoordinator, district coordinator Dan Vainonen, and Kirk Smith, who \nserves as a judge for this year's competition.\n  One of the most memorable experiences of my life was when I was one \nof 55 people chosen to represent all Americans at a ceremony in the \nAssembly Room in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia to commemorate the \n200th anniversary of the writing of the Constitution. Our Constitution \nwas written by 55 white men, including some of the most revered men in \nour nation's history. In the Assembly Room, George Washington's chair \nis still sitting at the front of the room where he presided over the \nConstitutional Convention, along with Ben Franklin and James Madison.\n  Two hundred years later, the gathering was noticeably different--this \ntime it was 55 men, women, minorities. I got chills sitting in this \nroom because I had studied in a very small school the history about Ben \nFranklin, Madison, Mason, George Washington--just like those students \nparticipating in the We the People . . . program are doing now--and \nthere I was sitting in the very room where they wrote the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  I wish every American could have the same opportunity to visit \nConstitution Hall the way I did, but at the very least, every young \nAmerican student should learn about the history and importance of our \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. The We the People . . . The \nCitizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational \nprogram in the country developed specifically to educate young people \nabout the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Columnist David Broder \ndescribed the national finals as ``the place to have your faith in the \nyounger generation restored.''\n  The class from Wyndmere High School has worked hard to become \n``constitutional experts,'' and on behalf of my fellow North Dakotans \nand my colleagues in the Senate, I want them to know we are proud of \ntheir hard work and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3686-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3686-S3687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING NATIONAL EMS WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, almost one year ago today, I came to \nthe floor of the Senate to recognize a very important group of \nindividuals: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel.\n  I would like to take some time again this year to applaud the \nselfless efforts of the men and women who dedicate themselves to such a \nworthy cause day in and day out. For most of us, it is hard to imagine \ngoing to work every day not having any idea what kind of tragic \nsituations we may encounter or what kinds of dangers we might face. \nThese dedicated individuals overlook these challenges every day and \noften imperil themselves to help those in need of medical attention.\n  Unfortunately, especially given the important work they do, this \ngroup often goes unrecognized. I rise today in support of National EMS \nWeek and want to recognize EMS personnel by celebrating their selfless \nefforts with thanks and gratitude. My praise comes early; while \nNational EMS Week is observed during the third week in May, I felt it \nnecessary to make these remarks today, as many EMS personnel will be \nhonored this evening at a special reception held here in Washington, \nDC.\n  Mr. President, this year's National EMS Week theme, ``New Century, \nNew Hope,'' encourages a forward-looking, optimistic approach to \nidentifying and meeting newly emerging community challenges. EMS is a \ncomplex, integrated system of personnel in both ambulances and \nhospitals that provides excellent care in emergency medical situations \nby affecting safe and efficient transport and treatment until more \nadvanced medical care can be delivered. Importantly, EMS also includes \nthe person who recognizes an emergency and summons help through a phone \ncall to 9-1-1. This is the beginning of a very important chain of \ncommunication and care, which results in saved lives.\n  During both the 105th and 106th Congresses, I have come to the floor \nof the Senate to introduce the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency \nAct, S. 911. This bill was a product of the Emergency Medical Services \nAdvisory Committee that I formed in 1997 to evaluate some of the \nproblems facing EMS providers. Because I believe there is an overriding \npublic health interest in ensuring a viable and seamless EMS system, I \ncontinue to pursue passage of S. 911.\n  This legislation attempts to create acceptable government standards \nfor EMS providers and allows expansion in the next century to enable \nproviders to better serve their local communities. A first priority \nincluded in my bill is for ``prudent layperson'' language to accompany \nthe approval of EMS services under many medical plans, especially \nMedicare. One of the most fiscally disruptive forces is the denial of \nemergency transport due to a physician's reevaluation of what \n``seemed'' critical and is later labeled as being ``medically \nunnecessary.'' Portions of this legislation have already been approved \nby the Senate. In addition, S. 911 calls for EMS providers to play a \nrole in the process of providing recommendations on how federal \nregulatory policy is made. I think this makes sense, and most \nimportantly, it gives EMS providers a clear voice in identifying and \nfinding a solution to the most challenging aspects of critical care \ndelivery.\n  On an annual basis, the American Ambulance Association recognizes EMS \npersonnel from around the country for their selfless contributions to \ntheir profession, and presents them with the Star of Life Award. This \nyear, 94 individuals were chosen by their peers to receive this \nprestigious award. I would like to personally thank those honorees for \ntheir service, and commend them on the respect they have generated for \nthemselves and their profession amongst their peers and the public.\n  Again, I would like to applaud the efforts of all EMS personnel. They \nhave the sometimes unenviable task of cleaning up the messes that life \naffords every community, but they do it with pride and they do it well. \nI plan to do everything in my power to provide these individuals with \nthe additional tools and loud voice that they have earned through their \ndevotion to our local communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the names of the year 2000 American \nAmbulance Association's Star of Life honorees be printed in the Record.\n  The list of honorees follows:\n\n           American Ambulance Association--2000 Stars of Life\n\n       Dub Morris, Columbia County Ambulance Service, AZ.\n       Barbara K.

Mr. President, on Friday, May 12, 2000, Nevadans \nwill pause to honor the outstanding achievements and retirement of \nClark County Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Brian Cram. Throughout his \n34 years as an educator, Dr. Cram has touched the lives of hundreds of \nthousands of youth in the Las Vegas Valley as a teacher, assistant \nprincipal, principal, assistant superintendent and superintendent, all \nwithin the Clark County School District. He is retiring after serving \nmore than eleven years as superintendent. The fact that his tenure has \nbeen approximately nine years longer than the average for a \nsuperintendent demonstrates his excellence and commitment to our \ncommunity Southern Nevada.\n  Dr. Cram can be appreciated most for his outstanding management of \nthe fastest growing school district in the country. During his tenure, \nthe district has grown from 111,000 to more than 215,000 students, and \nis currently the eighth largest school district in the country. Dr. \nCram is a self-proclaimed ``poster boy for school bonds,'' having \nsuccessfully secured billions of dollars for the construction of more \nthan 100 new schools for the students, teachers and staff of the Clark \nCounty School District. He recently was successful in obtaining voter \napproval of school construction funding for the next ten years, a \nlegacy that will carry on well beyond his tenure. This achievement \ntakes on added significance when one considers that Nevada, as my \nSenate colleagues have heard me state on numerous occasions, must build \napproximately one school a month just to keep up with the unprecedented \ngrowth in the Silver State.\n  Although he spent many years in administration, Dr. Cram has always \nbeen happiest when working with children. He has never been one to sit \nbehind a desk, preferring instead to be out working with children, \nfamilies and staff. His tenure as superintendent will be characterized \nby strong personal relationships with the students, teachers, families \nand employees of the school district and the entire community.\n  Above all, Dr. Cram is a true believer in the value of education. He \nhails from a home which stressed the importance of sound learning and \nlifelong education, and he has been driven by a fundamental belief that \neducation is the great equalizer and provider in life.\n  It is my distinct pleasure and honor to join all Nevadans in wishing \nDr. Brian Cram all the best upon his retirement. His genuine commitment \nof the youth of Nevada will be appreciated for many generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3687-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3687-S3688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DANIEL AZZIZE SAMUEL\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding young Virginian, Daniel Azzize Samuel, who has been \nselected to receive the 2000 American Automobile Association Lifesaving \nMedal. This award is the highest honor given to members of the school \nsafety patrol.\n  Daniel is a member of the Kent Gardens School Safety Patrol in \nMcLean, Virginia. On January 12th of this year, he was on his way to \nhis post when he saw an eight-year-old student running back toward his \ndeparting bus. Quickly sizing up the danger, Daniel yelled at the \nstudent to stop. The bus driver also heard Daniel's yells and stopped \nthe\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\nbus, a mere three feet from the oncoming student who was approaching in \nthe driver's blind spot.\n  I salute Daniel and the other young recipients of this year's award, \nDaniel Rogers of Maryland and Greg Lawson and Tasha Tanner of Ohio, for \ntheir lifesaving contributions to the safety of their fellow students. \nAs members of their school safety patrols, these young people have made \ninvaluable contributions to their schools and communities. I also \ncommend the American Automobile Association for their sponsorship of \nthis valuable program to keep our nation's young people safe on their \ntrips to and from school.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3688-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REBIRTH FOR RUTLAND'S PARAMOUNT THEATER\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Saturday, March 18, the Paramount \nTheater opened its doors to the Rutland community for the first public \nperformance on its stage in nearly 20 years. This was a memorable night \nfor Vermonters who had the opportunity to see Arlo Guthrie perform with \nthe Vermont Symphony Orchestra. This grand reopening also marked the \nsuccessful completion of an important and historic restoration project.\n  The Paramount Theater is a Vermont treasure that was an icon of \ndowntown Rutland from the time it first opened its doors in 1914 to the \nday those doors closed in 1981. Founded by Rutland businessman George \nT. Chaffee, the Chaffee Playhouse served as a venue for the \nentertainers of the day, allowing Rutland area residents the \nopportunity to see the likes of Will Rogers, the Marx Brothers and \nHarry Houdini, among many others. As motion pictures moved into the \nspotlight in the 1930s, Chaffee's Playhouse was taken over by Paramount \nand became known as the Paramount Movie House.\n  Then times changed, and after years of screening movies for fewer and \nfewer patrons, the Paramount closed its doors to the public in 1981. \nThe ornate theater that had once served as a centerpiece for the \nRutland arts and social scenes had become only a fond memory for those \nwhose lives it had affected.\n  Now times have changed again, and over the past several years, \ndowntown Rutland has undergone remarkable growth and revitalization. As \nthe downtown community began to bustle with more and more visitors, \nlocal residents and merchants felt the time had come to reopen the \ndoors of the old Center Street theater.\n  Coming up with a good idea is often the easy part of a project. \nFinding a way to turn that idea into reality can be a much larger task. \nThat was the case with the project to reopen the Paramount Theater, \nwhich required significant renovation and restoration. Through the \ntireless efforts of community leaders, a major fund raising effort was \nlaunched with contributions from individuals and local businesses, with \ngrants also from the state and federal governments. More than 1500 \npeople made personal contributions toward the renovation project. My \ncolleague, Senator Jeffords, took the lead in making the case for the \nfederal contribution, and I was pleased to support that effort.\n  Nearly 20 years after it closed, and after more than $3.5 million in \nconstruction and renovation, the Paramount Theater has been restored to \nthe beauty and splendor enjoyed by those Vermonters who attended its \noriginal opening night on January 15, 1914. The reopening of the \nParamount Theater now will serve the Rutland community's need for an \narts center, and, for new generations of Vermonters, it will once again \nbe a focal point for the social life of a vibrant community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3688-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TAIWANESE-AMERICAN HERITAGE WEEK\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, this month I join people in New \nJersey and throughout the nation in celebrating Pacific-American \nHeritage Month. The Pacific-American community represents an important \npart of America's future and I applaud their proud celebration of \nheritage and community.\n  Taiwanese-American Heritage Week, from May 7 to May 14, celebrates \nthe unique and diverse contributions of the more than 500,000 \nTaiwanese-Americans in the United States. These Americans have played a \nsignificant role in our nation's life and their countless \naccomplishments can be found in every facet of American society. For \ninstance, Taiwanese-Americans have succeeded as notable artists, Nobel \nLaureate scientists, researchers, human rights activists, and business \nleaders.\n  In addition to recognizing these contributions, this is an excellent \nopportunity to celebrate the success of democracy on the island of \nTaiwan. Since 1987, the Taiwanese people have possessed the rights to \nselect their own leaders, practice the religion of their choice, and \nexpress their thoughts openly and freely. Taiwan is a vibrant and \ndemocratic participant in the family of nations.\n  The election on March 18 of opposition leader Chen Shui-bian as \npresident, and my friend Annette Lu as vice-president, represents the \ncrowning achievement of the struggle of the people of Taiwan for full-\nfledged democracy and freedom. While Taiwan has established a model \ndemocracy, there remain political challenges. Gaining worldwide \nrecognition of the legitimacy of Taiwan's government is paramount. With \nall that Taiwanese and Taiwanese-Americans have accomplished there is \nstill more work to be done before Taiwan's status and global \ncontributions are properly respected and appreciated.\n  Mr. President, Taiwanese-American Heritage Week recognizes the \nlongstanding friendship between the United States and Taiwan. I commend \nthe great accomplishments and contributions of the Taiwanese-American \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3688-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3688-S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HOSPITAL WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the work of \nMinnesota's hospitals and those across America as we recognize National \nHospital Week. This year's theme, ``Touching The Future With Care,'' \nfocuses on the heart of the hospital system: its people. For those \nMinnesota doctors, nurses, administrators, and volunteers who \nconsistently provide the highest level of quality health care in \nAmerica, I commend your selfless efforts. You are very deserving of our \nrecognition here today.\n  Hospitals are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, providing their \ncommunities with around-the-clock health care services. In my own state \nof Minnesota, 142 hospitals and 22 different health care systems \nprovide Minnesotans with one of the most efficient and effective health \ncare systems in the United States. This is not a result of mere chance. \nRather, it is the combined efforts of our health care professionals--\nthose men and women who devote themselves to the delivery of timely, \nquality health care, when and where it is needed.\n  As we all know, American hospitals have faced severe challenges over \nthe last several years due to rapidly declining reimbursement rates \nunder Medicare. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made dramatic changes \nto the payment rates to hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and \nindividual providers. In fact, Medpac, Congress' Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission, reported that profit margins for hospitals across \nthe country dropped nearly 40 percent between 1998 and 1999. This is \nthe lowest level in 20 years. And to add insult to injury, the \nCongressional Budget Office reported that Medicare payments, which \nserve as one of the largest revenue sources to hospitals, would realize \na 62% decrease over the next five years. Clearly, in an industry that \nis already running on fumes, we cannot afford to cut deeper into the \nmargins of hospitals and simply hope that they will be able to absorb \nthe added losses and continue to provide the quality health care that \nwe expect.\n  Last year, in an effort to reduce some of this burden, Congress \nattempted to address the problem with the 1999 Balanced Budget \nRefinement Act. This legislation restored some of the drastic cuts \ncalled for in 1997, and provided relief in payments for outpatient \nservices. This effort has already made a measurable difference and has \nenabled many hospitals and other providers to remain in business. Yet, \nthis is only half the problem.\n  The Balanced Budget Refinement Act addressed outpatient care provided \nby hospitals, and now, through legislation\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\nI cosponsored earlier this year called the American Hospital \nPreservation Act, we are addressing inpatient services. This is the \nother half of the equation. The American Hospital Preservation Act will \nhelp restore the scheduled 1.1 percent reduction in the inflation rate \nadjustment for in-patient services for years 2001 and 2002. Most \nimportantly, this legislation will allow hospitals to better keep up \nwith rapid increases in health-related costs.\n  Mr. President, we in Congress have a big task ahead of us. We need to \nremain steadfast in our commitment to these institutions and complement \nthe efforts of the people who devote so much of themselves to saving \nand preserving the lives of others. National Hospital Week exists so \nthat we may remember and recognize the efforts of these organizations, \nand more importantly, the people who work within them. I am proud of \nthe level of quality health care that is provided through our city and \nrural hospitals in Minnesota, and I am going to continue to do all I \ncan to help preserve the integrity of these institutions on which we \nall rely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3689-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF SAUL B. KATZ\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nSaul B. Katz; an outstanding member of the New York health care \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Katz has the distinction of serving as the first Chairman of the \nBoard of Trustees of the North Shore--Long Island Jewish Health System. \nAfter serving in various leadership capacities within the health system \nfor over a decade, Mr. Katz lead the development of a system that now \nincludes 13 hospitals, 2 skilled nursing centers and numerous \nambulatory programs which span across the New York Metropolitan area.\n  As Co-founder, President and Chief Operating Officer of Sterling \nEquities, Inc., a diversified investment and operating company, Mr. \nKatz was a member of the governing Board of the Community Hospital of \nGlen Cove, which became North Shore University Hospital at Glen Cove in \n1989. Mr. Katz served as the First Vice President of the Board of \nTrustees, as well as a member of the Finance, Planning, Development and \nBuilding committees.\n  In addition, Mr. Katz serves as a Director, Trustee and Member of \nnumerous trade and charitable organizations including the Jewish \nAssociation for Services for the Aging, the Brooklyn College Foundation \nand the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York.\n  The Katz family is a close-knit one. Saul and his wife Iris have \nenjoyed 40 years of marriage and spend as much time as they can with \ntheir grown children and their spouses: Heather Katz Knopf and Dan \nKnopf, Natalie Katz D'Amore and Al D'Amore and David Katz. Iris and \nSaul recently celebrated the arrival of their first grandchild Carly \nFrances Knopf.\n  The North Shore--Long Island Health System will certainly miss the \nexemplary leadership that Mr. Katz provided all these years and I \napplaud the significant improvements he has made to the state of health \ncare in the New York Metropolitan area.\n  Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr. Katz on his retirement from \nthe Board and wish him and his family well in his golden years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3689-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF DIANE RODEKOHR\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to \nexpress the heartfelt appreciation and gratitude I feel, along with my \nstaff and my wife Diana, for the hard work and determined effort Diane \nRodekohr has given the Senate and my office over these past few years. \nIf not for Diane, or Dee as she is known to her friends, we just could \nnot have accomplished as much for the people of Wyoming as we have been \nable to do since my election to the Senate four years ago.\n  When Diana and I arrived in Washington ready to take on this new \nadventure in our lives, knowing we already had staff in place with \nexperience who were committed to me and to Wyoming made all the \ndifference. The continuity that I benefitted from having a seasoned \nstaff helped to make a transition that was better than smooth--it was \nalmost seamless.\n  I'll always be grateful to Dee for staying on as State Director when \nshe could have ridden off into the sunset to enjoy her well deserved \nretirement. Instead she stayed with me and with Wyoming and continued \nto make a difference for me, for my constituents, and for her fellow \nstaff members who continued to look to her for her sage advice, counsel \nand support.\n  Now she has made a decision to turn her attention to tending \ndifferent areas of the garden of her life. I hope she fully enjoys \nwhatever challenges await her. The Bible tells us that ``to everything \nthere is a season''--and this is the season for Dee to enjoy her life \nto the fullest! May God continue to bless and watch over her. My wife, \nDiana, my staff and the people of Wyoming join in sending our best \nwishes to her for a life full of continued joy and happiness. Dee, you \nhave truly earned that and so much more!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3689-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3689-4", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1237.

Mr. Frist, \n        and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 2519. A bill to authorize compensation and other benefits for \nemployees of the Department of Energy, its contractors, subcontractors, \nand certain vendors who sustain illness or death related to exposure to \nberyllium, ionizing radiation, silica, or hazardous substances in the \nperformance of their duties, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pension.\n\n\n     ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, over the last half century, and at \nfacilities all across America, tens of thousands of dedicated men and \nwomen in our civilian federal workforce helped keep our military fully \nsupplied and our nation fully prepared to meet any potential threat. \nTheir success is measured in part with the end of the Cold War and the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union. However, for many of these workers, their \nsuccess came at a high price; the sacrifice of their health, and even \ntheir lives, for our liberty. I believe we have a federal obligation to \nlive up to our responsibilities with these Cold War veterans.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today, along with Senators Reid, DeWine, \nKennedy, McConnell, Bryan, Harkin, Thompson, Frist, and Bunning is \ntitled the ``Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act of \n2000.'' This bill will provide financial compensation to Department of \nEnergy workers whose impaired health has been caused by exposure to \nberyllium, radiation or other hazardous substances while working for \nthe defense of the United States. The bill will also provide \ncompensation to survivors of workers who have died while suffering from \nan illness resulting from exposure to these substances.\n  Many will express concern that it will be hard to prove if someone \nwas made chronically ill by their work environment, however, such \nconcerns can be refuted. For example, beryllium disease is a \n``fingerprint'' disease, in that it leaves no doubt as to what caused \nthe illness of the sufferer. Additionally, the only processing of the \nmaterials that cause Chronic Beryllium Disease is unique to our nuclear \nweapons facilities. Skepticism is understandable in many cases of \nradiation exposure at DoE facilities because the records may not \ngenerally reflect employee exposure to radioactive materials. However, \nconcerns have been raised that the DoE destroyed or altered workers' \nrecords. Additionally, dosimeter badges, which record radiation \nexposure, were not always required to be worn by workers. When they \nwere required to be worn, they were not always done so properly or \nconsistently. DoE plant management would even ``zero'' dose badges. \nTherefore, many records do not exist, and where they do exist, there is \nadequate reason to doubt their accuracy. That is why this bill places \nthe burden of proof on the government to prove that an employee's \nillness was not caused by workplace hazards.\n  As one who believes we should rely on sound science, I would \ncertainly support a method for compensation based on this principle if \nit was available. Unfortunately in this case, sound science either does \nnot exist in DoE facility records, or it cannot be relied upon for \naccuracy. That's precisely what happened in my state of Ohio.\n  In a series of newspaper articles from the Columbus Dispatch, it was \nshown that for decades, some workers at the Portsmouth Gaseous \nDiffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio--a plant which processes high-quality \nnuclear material--did not know they had been exposed to dangerous \nlevels of radioactive material. That's because until recently, proper \nsafety precautions were rarely taken to adequately protect workers' \nsafety. Even when precautions were taken, the application of protective \nstandards was inconsistent. In addition, workers at the Piketon plant \nhave stated that plant management not only did not keep adequate \ndosimetry records, in some cases, they changed the dosimetry records to \nshow lower levels of radiation exposure. If consistent, reliable and \nfactual data is not available, then it will be quite difficult to \nutilize sound science.\n  Similar occurrences have been reported at the Fernald Feed Materials \nProduction Center in Fernald, Ohio and the Mound Facility in \nMiamisburg, Ohio as well as other facilities nationwide.\n  The DoE has admitted that at some facilities, workers were not told \nthe nature of the substances with which they were working, nor the \nramifications that these materials may have on their future health and \nquality of life. It is unconscionable that DoE managers and other \nindividuals in positions of responsibility could be so insensitive and \nuncaring about their fellow man.\n  Last year, the Toledo Blade published an award-winning series of \narticles outlining the plight of workers suffering from Chronic \nBeryllium Disease (CBD). While government standards were met in \nprotecting the workers from exposure to the beryllium dust, many \nworkers still were diagnosed with CBD. The stories of these workers who \nare suffering from this often debilitating disease are heart-wrenching. \nIt is estimated that 1,200 people have contracted CBD, and hundreds \nhave died from it, making CBD the number one disease directly caused by \nour Cold War effort.\n  Title one of this bill provides compensation to individuals suffering \nfrom Chronic Beryllium Disease (CBD). Beryllium, which is a toxic \nsubstance, can cause major health problems if proper precautions are \nnot taken while it is being handled. Individuals who suffer from \nChronic Beryllium Disease experience a loss of lung function, and in \nmany cases face a painful death. While there is a blood test that can \ndetect CBD, and there are treatments for it, there is no cure. Under \nthis bill, if the disease is confirmed, it is presumed work-related and \nworkers compensation at benefit levels established under\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\nthe Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) is paid--roughly two-\nthirds of six years worth of wages and health care coverage. \nAlternatively, a claimant can elect a one-time lump sum payment of \n$200,000 (with healthcare benefits related to their disease) in lieu of \nwage replacement payments. Employees at DoE sites and DoE beryllium \nvendors would be covered under the bill.\n  Title two of this bill covers illnesses related to radiation and \nother hazardous substances. The first part of this title covers workers \nat all DoE sites who contract cancer that has been potentially caused \nby exposure to radiation (radiogenic cancer), worked at the site for at \nleast one year and wore a radiation dosimeter badge or should have worn \none. Causation is presumed if the covered cancer is a primary cancer. \nAgain, benefits are paid at FECA levels, or in the alternative, a \nclaimant can elect a one-time lump sum payment of $200,000 (with \nhealthcare benefits) in lieu of wage replacement payments. The \npresumption is modeled after the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. \nThis proposal incorporates all DoE sites across the nation, plus four \nvendor facilities.\n  The second part of this title covers workers at DoE sites for \nillness, impairment, disease or death, using a FECA level of benefits. \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to create a \npanel of occupational doctors to review the claims for the Department \nof Labor, and the threshold for eligibility is whether exposure was a \nsignificant contributing factor to a worker's illness. The bill allows \nclaimants to seek a second medical opinion. Further, the bill directs \nthe HHS to empanel occupational physicians to develop additional \npresumptions for use in guiding future HHS and Labor Department \ndecisions.\n  To obtain restitution under the bill, claimants would file with the \nDepartment of Labor's Office of Worker Compensation Programs under a \nFECA-like program but not FECA itself. The claims reviewer, after \nobtaining all the necessary information, would have 120 days to render \na decision. If a denial is issued, the claimant can appeal to an \nadministrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ has 180 days to render an \nopinion. If an opinion is not rendered, the appeal can be brought to \nthe federal Benefits Review Board (BRB). The BRB has 240 days to render \nan opinion, after which appeals can be brought to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals. Failure to meet deadlines by the DoL results in a default in \nfavor of the claimant. This approach is intended to remedy the major \ndefects in FECA, which excludes any rights to the Courts and results in \nyears of delay in many cases.\n  Mr. President, there may be some who will say that this bill costs \ntoo much, or we can't afford it so we shouldn't do it. I strongly \ndisagree.\n  Congress appropriates billions of dollars annually on things that are \nnot the responsibility of the federal government. And here we have a \nclear instance where our federal government is responsible for the \nactions it has taken and the negligence it has shown against its own \npeople. This is an issue where peoples' health has been compromised and \nlives have been lost. In many instances, these workers didn't even know \nthat their health and safety was in jeopardy. It is not only a \nresponsibility of this government to provide for these individuals, it \nis a moral obligation.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that a bill establishing this type \nof compensation program is necessary; it is little consolation for the \npain, health problems and diminished quality of life that these \nindividuals have suffered. These men and women who won the Cold War \nhave only asked that the United States government--the government of \nthe nation that they spent their lives defending--acknowledge that they \nwere made ill in the course of doing their job and recognize that the \ngovernment must take care of them.\n  Sadly, because of the government's stonewalling and denial of \nresponsibility, the only way many of these employees believe they will \never receive proper restitution for what the government has done is to \nfile a lawsuit against the Department of Energy or its contractors. \nThat should not have to happen and it is my hope that this legislation \nwill preclude any perceived need for such lawsuits.\n  I believe that all those who have served our nation fighting the Cold \nWar deserve to know if the federal government was responsible for \ncausing them illness or harm, and if so, to provide them the care that \nthey need. I encourage my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this \nlegislation and I urge the Senate to consider this bill during this \nsession of Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. \n        Collins):\n  S. 2520. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nallow for the importation of certain covered products, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              MEDICINE EQUITY AND DRUG SAFETY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we work to address the problems of \nhealth care in the new millennium, we are blessed and we are cursed: \nblessed with the promise of new research capabilities and the knowledge \ngleaned from the human genome, and cursed with the high costs of all \nmedicines, new and old. Today, I come to the floor to introduce a bill \nthat will help address the curse of out-of-control drug prices, the \nMedicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000, or MEDS Act.\n  There is no question that prescription drugs cost too much in this \nnation.\n  During a time when we are experiencing unprecedented economic growth, \nit is not uncommon to hear of patients who cut pills in half, or skip \ndosages in order to make prescriptions last longer, because they can't \nafford the refill. The question that we should ask is, can we put \npolitics aside and work in a bipartisan manner to deal with this \nnational crisis? I say we must. And I am hopeful we can.\n  Prescription medicines have revolutionized the treatment of certain \ndiseases, but they are only effective if patients have access to the \nmedicines that their doctors prescribe.\n  The best medicines in the world will not help a person who cannot \nafford them. And they can actually do more harm than good if taken with \nthe improper dosage.\n  Mr. President, it is well documented that the average price of \nprescription medicines is much lower in Canada than in the United \nStates, with the price of some drugs in Vermont being twice that of the \nsame drug available only a few miles away in a Canadian pharmacy. This \nis true even though many of the drugs sold in Canada are actually \nmanufactured, packed, and distributed by American companies that sell \nthe same FDA-approved products in both markets, but at drastically \ndifferent prices.\n  This pricing disparity unfairly places the heaviest burden on the \nmost vulnerable Americans--hardworking, but uninsured Americans who \nmake too much money to qualify for Medicaid, yet still cannot afford \nthe high cost of lifesaving drugs.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will allow pharmacists and \nwholesalers to get the same FDA-approved drugs sold at lower prices in \nother countries, and pass the savings on to consumers in the U.S.\n  This bipartisan proposal builds on legislation I introduced last \nyear, S. 1462, that would allow imports from Canada for personal use, \nand borrows from another bill cosponsored by Senator Wellstone, S. \n1191, that would allow reimportation of prescription drugs that were \nmade in U.S. facilities.\n  The most important aspect of this bill, Mr. President, is safety. We \nall want to find ways to bring drug costs down for all Americans, but \nthe concept of reimportation has been criticized as compromising the \nFood and Drug Administration's (FDA) world-renowned gold standard for \nsafety by opening the American market to foreign counterfeiters who \nwill attempt to flood the market with fake drugs.\n  This bill is simple in its approach. It would empower pharmacists and \nwholesalers to purchase FDA-approved medicines in Canada and pass the \ndiscounts along to American patients, and would let the experts at \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) determine the best mechanism for \nallowing such imports while preserving the gold standard for safety.\n  The discretionary authority granted to the Secretary of HHS would be \nsubject to a few important requirements,\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\nsuch as identification of the importer and the product, but would \nrequire the Secretary to promulgate regulations setting up a safe \nsystem for allowing the reimportation of prescription drugs as long as \nthe importer has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of HHS, that the \nproduct being reimported is safe, and is the same product that is being \nsold in the United States at a higher price.\n  Mr. President, I have said before and I will say again, this is not \nthe only solution, and it may not be the best solution to this problem.\n  I strongly believe we need to enact a broad prescription drug \nbenefit, and I believe we need to find ways to encourage more insurance \ncoverage for more Americans that covers the cost of drugs. But this is \na positive, bipartisan measure that we can implement now that will \nbring prescription drug prices down for all Americans, and I encourage \nyour support.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senator \nJeffords, Senator Collins, and Senator Snowe as a cosponsor of the \nMedicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000. As this bill demonstrates, \nconcern about the high price of prescription drugs in this country is a \nbipartisan issue. Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike suffer \nfrom the unconscionable behavior of American drug companies who \novercharge American consumers day in and day out, compared to prices \nthey charge in every other country of the world. Americans regardless \nof party have a fundamental belief in fairness--and know a rip-off when \nthey see one. This bill aims to end the rip-off, to end the choke hold \nthat the pharmaceutical industry has on America's seniors.\n  The Jeffords-Wellstone Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act will make \nprescription drugs affordable for millions of Americans by applying the \nprinciples of free trade and competition to the prescription drug \nindustry--without sacrificing safety. Senator Jeffords, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Collins and I have heard the first-hand stories from our \nconstituents--in Minnesota, in Maine and in Vermont--constituents who \nare justifiably frustrated and discouraged when they can't afford to \nbuy prescription drugs that are made in the United States--unless they \ngo across the border to Canada where those same drugs, manufactured in \nthe same facilities here in the U.S. are available for about half the \nprice.\n  This legislation provides relief from the price gouging of American \nconsumers by our own pharmaceutical industry. This price gouging \naffects all Americans, but especially our senior citizens who feel the \nbrunt of this problem more than any other age group because of the \nincreasing number of prescription drugs we all will take as the years \npass. Senior citizens have lost their patience in waiting for answers--\n-and so have I. That is why I have joined Senator Jeffords in this \nbipartisan effort to allow all Americans to have access to prescription \ndrugs at prices they can afford.\n  While we can be proud of both American scientific research that \nproduces new miracle cures and the high standards of safety and \nefficacy that we expect to be followed at the FDA, it is shameful that \nAmerica's most vulnerable citizens--the chronically ill and the \nelderly--are being asked to pay the highest prices in the world here in \nthe U.S. for the exact same medications manufactured here but sold more \ncheaply overseas.\n  Pharmacists could sell prescription drugs for less here in the United \nStates, if they could buy and import these same drugs from Canada or \nEurope. Now, however, Federal law allows only the manufacturer of a \ndrug to import it into the U.S. Thus American pharmacists and \nwholesalers must pay the exorbitant prices charged by the \npharmaceutical industry in the U.S. market and pass along those high \nprices to consumers.\n  The legislative solution is simple. The bipartisan Medicine Equity \nand Drug Safety Act does two things: first, it allows Americans to \nlegally import prescription drugs for personal use (which currently is \nallowed by FDA discretion), and more importantly, in the long run, it \nallows American pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA approved \nprescription drugs into the United States for resale. Only drugs which \nhave already been approved by the FDA for use in the United States \ncould be imported for resale. Thus, the existing strict safety \nstandards of the FDA will be maintained.\n  Pharmacists and wholesalers will be able to purchase drugs at lower \nprices and then pass the savings along to American consumers. To assure \nsafety, the bill requires the FDA to develop regulations to precisely \ntrack imported drugs and to issue any other safety requirements the FDA \ndeems necessary. It is time to tell the pharmaceutical industry: \nEnough! It is an industry that controls competition to keep prices so \nhigh that prescription drugs become unaffordable for the average \nAmerican. It is an industry that puts profits first and leaves patients \nto fend for themselves.\n  What this bill does is to address the absurd situation by which \nAmerican consumers are paying substantially higher prices for their \nprescription drugs than are the citizens of Canada, Mexico, and other \ncountries. This bill does not create any new federal programs. Instead \nit uses principles of free trade and competition to help make it \npossible for American consumers to purchase the prescription drugs they \nneed.\n  In summary, this bill brings competition into the price of \npharmaceuticals and extends the promise of America's medical and \npharmaceutical research to every American. It deserves bipartisan \nsupport, and I am glad to say it has it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Jeffords, \nWellstone, and Collins today as an original cosponsor of the Medicine \nEquity and Drug Safety Act of 2000.\n  There is no doubt that providing access to affordable prescription \ndrugs for American consumers is a very important policy issue. It seems \nthat everywhere we turn--from ``60 Minutes'' to Newsweek--we are \nhearing stories that our nation's patients face dramatically higher \nprices for their prescription medication than do our neighbors to the \nNorth.\n  In my view, a solution to the pressing problem of prescription drug \ncoverage can't come soon enough. In 1998, drug costs grew more than any \nother category of health care--skyrocketing by 15.4 percent in a single \nyear. And that's a special burden for seniors, who pay half the cost \nassociated with their prescriptions as opposed to those under 65 who \npay just a third.\n  Seniors are reeling from the burden of their prescription drug \nexpenses. The March/April 2000 edition of Health Affairs reports that \nthe average senior now spends $1,100 every year on medications. And \nwith the latest HCFA estimates putting the number of seniors without \ndrug coverage at around 31 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries--or \nabout 13 out of nearly 40 million Americans--it's not hard to see why \nwe can no longer wait to provide a solution. In fact, nearly 86 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries must use at least one prescription drug every \nday.\n  Who are these seniors who don't have prescription drug coverage? Who \nare the ones traveling by the busload to Canada to buy their \nprescription drugs? They are people caught in the middle--most of whom \nare neither wealthy enough to afford their own coverage nor poor enough \nto qualify for Medicaid. In fact, we know that seniors between 100 \npercent and 200 percent of the federal poverty have the lowest levels \nof prescription drug coverage. And these seniors who are just over the \npoverty level are the least likely to have access to either employer-\nbased coverage or Medicaid.\n  But even Medicaid is not the answer. According to the Urban \nInstitute, in 1996, 63 percent of beneficiaries eligible for QMB \n(Qualified Medicare Beneficiary) protections--that is, those under the \nfederal poverty level--actually receive those protections, while only \n10 percent of those between 100 and 120 percent of the poverty level--\nthose eligible for SLMB (Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary) \nprotections--are receiving that coverage. And only 16 states--including \nmy home state of Maine--have their own drug assistance programs.\n  The high cost of prescription medications in the United States is \nforcing many of our nation's seniors to make unthinkable decisions that \nare harmful to their health and well-being. It is simply unacceptable \nthat any person should have to choose between filling a prescription or \nbuying groceries.\n\n[[Page S3695]]\n\n  It is fundamentally unfair that a senior in Maine, Vermont, or \nMinnesota must drive across the Canadian border to be able to afford to \nbuy his or her prescription medications. And while it is illegal for \nAmericans to go to Canada and purchase drugs to be brought back to the \nUnited States, we know that this happens on a daily basis.\n  Mr. President, we are in a time of unparalleled prosperity. Almost \ndaily, it seems, we learn of astounding new breakthroughs in biomedical \nresearch and in new prescription medications. And there is no question \nin anyone's mind that we have the best--the very best--health care in \nthe entire world. But yet what does it say when our seniors are forced \nto go to Canada to purchase their prescription medications?\n  Mr. President, the legislation introduced today by Senator Jeffords \nwill allow Americans to legally purchase in Canada a limited amount of \ntheir medication for personal use. This will enable American patients \nto purchase their medications at the lower prices. In addition, \npharmacists and wholesalers will be allowed to reimport prescription \ndrugs that were made in the U.S. or in FDA-approved facilities.\n  Mr. President, I support this bill and believe that Senator Jeffords \nhas written a sound piece of legislation. But the fact of the matter is \nthat addressing the issue of seniors crossing the border to purchase \ndrugs is really only an interim approach--the real issue for America's \nseniors is the lack of comprehensive prescription drug coverage for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  This is why last August I introduced the Seniors Prescription \nInsurance Coverage Equity (SPICE) Act, S. 1480, with Senator Ron Wyden \nof Oregon. Our plan will give seniors coverage options similar to those \nenjoyed by Members of Congress and other federal employees, through a \nchoice of competing comprehensive drug plans. SPICE will prescribe \nprescription drug coverage for all Medicare-eligible seniors, with the \nfederal government covering all or part of the premiums on a sliding \nscale.\n  SPICE has the advantage of working with or without Medicare reform--\nsomething I've heard time and again is important to seniors, because it \nmeans that they don't have to wait for meaningful prescription drug \ncoverage. The SPICE gives us the best of all possible worlds--a system \nthat can exist outside of Medicare reform, co-exist with a new Medicare \nregime when it comes, and actually serve as a downpayment on \ncomprehensive reform.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Jeffords as an original \ncosponsor of this bill. He has written a bill with the needs of \nAmerican consumers in mind, and he is ensuring that Americans will have \naccess to safe and affordable prescription medications while Congress \nworks to devise a long-term solution to this very serious problem.\n  Thank you, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2524. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand coverage of bone mass measurements under part B of the Medicare \nProgram to all individuals at clinical risk for osteoporosis; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             MEDICARE OSTEOPOROSIS MEASUREMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMedicare Osteoporosis Measurement Act.\n  Three years ago Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In \ndoing so, we dramatically expanded coverage of osteoporosis screening \nthrough bone mass measurements for Medicare beneficiaries. Since we \npassed this law, we have learned that under the current Medicare law, \nit is very difficult for a man to be reimbursed for a bone mass \nmeasurement test. The bill I am introducing today, the Medicare \nOsteoporosis Measurement Act, would help all individuals enrolled in \nMedicare to receive the necessary tests if they are at risk for \nosteoporosis.\n  Currently, Medicare guidelines allow for testing in five categories \nof individuals--and most ``at risk'' men do not fall into any of them. \nThe first category in the guidelines is for ``an estrogen-deficient \nwoman at clinical risk for osteoporosis.'' The bill I am introducing \ntoday changes this guideline to say that ``an individual, including an \nestrogen-deficient woman, at clinical risk for osteoporosis'' will be \neligible for bone mass measurement. This change--of just a few words--\nwill vastly increase the opportunities for men to be covered for the \nimportant test.\n  Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 28 million \nAmericans, who either have the disease or are at risk due to low bone \nmass. Today, two million American men have osteoporosis, and another \nthree million are at risk of this disease. Osteoporosis causes 1.5 \nmillion fractures annually at a cost of $13.8 billion--$38 million per \nday--in direct medical expenses. In their lifetime, one in two women \nand one in eight men over the age of 50 will fracture a bone due to \nosteoporosis. Each year, men suffer one-third of all the hip fractures \nthat occur, and one-third of these men will not survive more than a \nyear. In addition to hip fracture, men also experience painful and \ndebilitating fractures of the spine, wrist, and other bones due to \nosteoporosis.\n  Osteoporosis is largely preventable and thousands of fractures could \nbe avoided if low bone mass were detected early and treated. Though we \nnow have drugs that promise to reduce fractures by 50 percent and new \ndrugs have been proven to actually rebuild bone mass, a bone mass \nmeasurement is needed to diagnose osteoporosis and determine one's risk \nfor future fractures. And we have learned that there are some prominent \nrisk facts: age, gender, race, a family history of bone fractures, \nearly menopause, risky health behaviors such as smoking and excessive \nalcohol consumption, and some medications all have been identified as \ncontributing factors to bone loss. But identification of risk factors \nalone cannot predict how much bone a person has and how strong bone is.\n  Mr. President, we know that osteoporosis is highly preventable, but \nonly if it is discovered in time. There is simply no substitute for \nearly detection. My legislation will ensure that all Medicare \nbeneficiaries at risk for osteoporosis will be able to be tested for \nosteoporosis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, and \n        Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2525.

Mr. President, on any given day in the United \nStates 80 people are killed by gun violence, 12 of them children. \nSeeking to bring an end to this senseless violence, supporters of \nsensible gun laws are coming together this Mothers' Day from all over \nthe country to participate in the Million Mom March and say to \nCongress: ``Enough is Enough.''\n  We share a common purpose: The passage of sensible gun laws that will \nhopefully help save lives.\n  This common goal includes moving forward with the four, common-sense \ngun measures passed by this body almost a full year ago--trigger locks, \nclosing the gun show loophole, banning the importation of large \ncapacity ammunition magazines, and banning juvenile possession of \nassault weapons.\n  And beyond those four common sense measures, the mothers flooding \ninto Washington are calling for legislation to license gun owners and \nkeep track of guns.\n  Earlier today, I stood with some of those moms, with Donna Dees-\nThomases, the head of the Million Mom March, with Chief Ramsey of the \nDistrict of Columbia Police Department, with representatives of Handgun \nControl and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and with several of my \ncolleagues to announce the introduction of a bill to take the next step \nin the fight to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and juveniles.\n  And so I now rise to introduce the ``Firearm Licensing and Record of \nSale Act of 2000,'' which I believe represents a common-sense approach \nto guns and gun violence in America.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Frank \nLautenberg, Barbara Boxer and Charles Schumer. And I am pleased that \nRepresentative Marty Meehan from Massachusetts will soon be introducing \nthis legislation in the House. I know that this will be an uphill \nbattle, and I don't expect this bill to pass overnight. But it is my\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\nhope that in the coming months, more of our colleagues in both Houses \nwill join us and help us to move this bill forward until we succeed.\n  Mr. President, in this country, when you want to hunt, you get a \nhunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license. But \nwhen you want to buy a gun, no license is necessary. That makes no \nsense.\n  We register cars and license drivers. We register pesticides and \nlicense exterminators. We register animal carriers and researchers, we \nregister gambling devices. And we register a whole host of other goods \nand activities--even ``international expositions,'' believe it or not, \nmust be registered with the Bureau of International Expositions!\n  But when it comes to guns and gun owners--no license and no \nregistration, despite the loss of more than 32,000 lives a year from \ngun violence.\n  To this end, I have worked with law enforcement officials and other \nexperts in drafting the bill we are introducing today.\n  Upon enactment of this legislation, anyone purchasing a handgun or \nsemi-automatic weapon that takes detachable ammunition magazines will \nbe required to have a license. Shotguns and a large number of common \nhunting guns are not covered by the requirements of this bill.\n  Current owners of these weapons will have up to 10 years to obtain a \nlicense.\n  The bill sets up a federal system, but allows states to opt out if \nthey adopt a system at least as effective as the federal program.\n  Under this bill, anyone wishing to obtain a firearm license will need \nto go to a federally licensed firearms dealer. There are currently more \nthan 100,000 such dealers across the country--to put that in some \nperspective, there are four times more gun dealers in America than \nthere are McDonald's restaurants in the entire world. Operating the \nfederal licensing system through these licensed dealers will minimize \nthe burden on those wishing to obtain a license.\n  If a state opts-out of the federal program, an individual will go to \na State-designated entity, like a local sheriff, local police \ndepartment, or even Department of Motor Vehicles. It will all depend on \nwhere the state feels is best.\n  Either way, the purchaser will then need to:\n  Provide information as to date and place of birth and name and \naddress;\n  Submit a thumb print;\n  Submit a current photograph;\n  Sign, under penalty of perjury, that all of the submitted information \nis true and that the applicant is qualified under federal law to \npossess a firearm; Pass a written firearms safety test, requiring \nknowledge of the safe storage and handling of firearms, the legal \nresponsibilities of firearm ownership, and other factors as determined \nby the state or federal authority;\n  Sign a pledge to keep any firearm safely stored and out of the hands \nof juveniles (this pledge will be backed up by criminal penalties of up \nto three years in jail for anyone failing to do so);\n\n  Undergo state and federal background checks.\n  Licenses will be renewable every five years, and can be revoked at \nany time if the licensee becomes disqualified under federal law from \nowning or possessing a gun.\n  And the fee for a license cannot exceed $25.\n  Once the bill takes effect, all future sales and transfers of \nfirearms falling within the scope of the bill will have to be recorded \nthrough a federally licensed firearms dealer, with an accompanying NICS \nbackground check. That way, law enforcement agencies will have easier \naccess to information leading to the arrest of persons who use guns in \ncrime.\n  The bill covers both handguns and other guns that are semi-automatic \nand can accept detachable magazines.\n  The legislation covers handguns because statistically, these guns are \nused in more crimes than any other. In fact, approximately 85 percent \nof all firearm homicides involve a handgun.\n  And the legislation also covers semi-automatic firearms that can \naccept detachable magazines, because these are the kind of assault \nweapons that have the potential to destroy the largest number of lives \nin the shortest period of time.\n  A gun that can take a detachable magazine can also take a large \ncapacity magazine. Combine that with semi-automatic, rapid fire, and \nyou have a deadly combination--as we have seen time and again in recent \nyears.\n  Put simply, this legislation will cover those firearms that represent \nthe greatest threat to the safety of innocent men, women and children \nin this nation.\n  Common hunting rifles, shotguns and other firearms that cannot accept \ndetachable magazines will remain exempt.\n  This represents a compromise between those who would rather not have \nthis bill at all, and those of us who believe that universal coverage \nof all firearms would be appropriate.\n  Penalties will vary depending on the severity of the violation. But \nin no case will gun owners face jail time simply because they forgot to \nget a license:\n  Those who fail to get a license will face fines of between $500 (for \na first offense) and $5,000 for subsequent offenses.\n  Failing to report a change of address or the loss of a firearm will \nalso result in penalties between $500 and $5,000, because this system \nworks best for law enforcement when the perpetrators of gun crime can \nbe quickly traced and arrested;\n  Dealers who fail to maintain adequate records will face up to 2 years \nin prison--dealers know their responsibilities, and this will give law \nenforcement the tools necessary to root out bad dealers and prevent the \nstraw purchases and other violations of law that allow criminals easy \naccess to a continuing flow of guns;\n  And adults who recklessly or knowingly allow a child access to a \nfirearm face up to three years in prison if the child uses the gun to \nkill or seriously injure another person. In this way, the bill truly \nputs a new sense of responsibility onto gun owners in America.\n  Mr. President, law enforcement in California tells me that a \nlicensing and record of sale system like the one I am introducing today \nwill help law enforcement, upon recovery of a firearm used in crime, to \ntrack the gun down to the person who sold it, and then to the person \nwho bought it.\n\n  And this legislation also sets in place a method through which we can \nbetter attempt to ensure that gun owners are responsible and trained in \nthe use and care of their dangerous possessions.\n  We have tried to minimize the burden of this bill at every turn:\n\n       The licensing process will take place through federally \n     licensed firearms dealers--as I mentioned earlier, there are \n     currently more than 100,000 in this country;\n       The fee for a license will be only $25;\n       Current gun owners will have ten years to get a license, \n     and guns now in homes will not have to be registered.\n       Future gun transfers will simply be recorded by licensed \n     dealers--as they are now--and a system will be put in place \n     to allow the quick tracing of guns used in crime. Gun owners \n     themselves will not have to register their old guns or send \n     any paperwork to the government.\n  Mr. President, this nation is awash in guns--there are more than 200 \nmillion of them in the United States. The problem of gun violence is \nnot going away, and accidental deaths from firearms rob us of countless \ninnocents each year.\n  Too many lives are lost every year simply because gun owners do not \nknow how to use or store their firearms--particularly around children. \nIn fact, according to a study released early last year, in 1996 alone \nthere were more than 1,100 unintentional shooting deaths and more than \n18,000 firearm suicides--many of which might have been prevented if the \nperson intent on suicide did not have easy access to a gun owned by \nsomebody else. It is my hope that the provisions of this bill, \nparticularly with regard to child access prevention, will begin the \nprocess of making it harder for children and others to gain easy access \nto firearms.\n  I know that this bill will not pass overnight. We have a long process \nof education ahead of us. But the American people are with us. The \nfacts are with us. And common sense is with us.\n  I thank the Senate for its consideration of this measure, and I look \nforward to working with each of my colleagues to move this bill forward \nin the coming months.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\n  S. 2526. A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nrevise and extend such Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n       INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT REAUTHORIZATION OF 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nInouye today in introducing a bill to reauthorize the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act (the ``IHCIA'' or the ``Act'').\n  The United States first began to provide health services to Indians \nin 1824 as part of the War Department's handling of Indian affairs. In \n1849 this responsibility went to the newly-created Interior Department \nwhere it rested until 1955 when it was transferred to the Public Health \nService's Indian Health Agency.\n  In 1970, President Nixon issued his now-famous ``Special Message to \nCongress on Indian Affairs'' laying out the rationale for a more \nenlightened Indian Policy--Indian Self Determination.\n  The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976, and the amendments to \neach over the years can be traced directly to the fundamental change \nproposed in 1970.\n  I am happy to say that legislation I proposed earlier this session, \nthe Indian Self Governance Amendments of 1999, have passed the House \nand the Senate and awaits final action.\n  With the introduction of this bill, we re-affirm the core principles \nthat were part of the 1976 legislation: (1) that federal health \nservices are consistent with the unique federal-tribal relationship; \n(2) that a goal of the U.S. is to provide the quantity and quality of \nservices to raise the health status of Indians; and (3) that Indian \nparticipation in the planning and management of health services should \nbe maximized.\n  First enacted in 1976, this IHCIA provides the authorization for \nprograms run by the Indian Health Service and is the legislation most \nresponsible for raising the health status of Indian people to a level \nthat, while still alarming, is not nearly as serious as it was just \ntwenty-five years ago.\n  Before the passage of the Act in 1976 the mortality rate for Indian \ninfants was 25% higher than that of non-Indian babies. The death rates \nfor mothers was 82% higher and the mortality rates from infectious \ndisease caused diarrhea and dehydration was 138% greater.\n  Today we can see marked improvements. Infant mortality rates have \nbeen reduced by 54%, maternal mortality rates have been reduced by 65%, \ntuberculosis mortality by 80% and overall mortality rates have been \nreduced by 42%.\n  While encouraging, these statistics mask the fact that the health \nstatus of Native people in America is still poor and below that of all \nother groups.\n  There are 3 issues in particular that need to be raised: urban \nIndians; Indian health facilities construction needs; and the booming \nproblem of diabetes.\n  As past censuses have shown, the 2000 decennial census is likely to \nshow that more than one-half of the 2.3 million American Indians and \nAlaska Natives reside off-reservation and are what commonly called \n``urban Indians.'' Though the health services framework that now exists \nhas slowly begun to acknowledge this trend, I am concerned that urban \nIndian health care needs require a more focused approach.\n  An ongoing problem that continues to confront the tribes, the IHS, \nand the Congress is the growing backlog in health care facilities \nconstruction. Recent estimates show that these needs top $900 million \nand federal appropriations simply will not satisfy these needs. I \nstrongly believe that innovative proposals need to be made, refined and \nperfected in order to accomplish our common goal. I am heartened by the \nsuccess of the Joint Venture Program and want to explore other \nproposals to get these facilities built.\n  Ailments of affluence continue to seep into native communities and \nerode the quality of life and very social fabric that holds these \ncommunities together. Alcohol and substance abuse continue to take a \nheavy toll and diabetes rates are reaching alarmingly high rates. Most \ntroubling is the increasing obesity and diabetes that is showing up \nwith alarming frequency in Native youngsters.\n  It is now time to take that extra step an to look at the positive \nthings we have accomplished and build upon them.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction. It is the product of \nmonths-long consultations by a group of very dedicated individuals \nconsisting of Indian tribal leaders, legal professionals and \nrepresentatives of the private and public health care sectors.\n  The group reviewed existing law and has proposed changes to improve \nthe current system by stressing local flexibility and choice, and \nmaking it more responsive to the health needs of Indian people.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs has already had one hearing on the \nbill and will continue to review it in the months ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2526\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my Chairman, Senator \nBen Nighthorse Campbell, in the introduction of a bill to reauthorize \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976, Public Law 94-437.\n  Mr. President, for the past two years, the leaders of Indian country \nhave been engaged in a consultation process with the Indian Health \nService in an effort to address changes to the Act which would hold the \npotential of improving and enhancing the ability of tribal health \nprograms, urban Indian health care programs, and the Indian Health \nService to provide comprehensive primary health care and public health \nservices to all eligible American Indian and Alaska Native patients \ncitizens.\n  The goal of the consultation process was to build a consensus on the \nbest means of addressing the health care challenges that confront \nNative America, so that the reauthorization bill could reflect a \nunified vision of the Indian Health Service, tribal governments and \nurban Indian health care programs. The tribal participants in this \nprocess appropriately named this comprehensive consultation process \n``Speaking with One Voice''.\n  Mr. President, this tribally-developed reauthorization bill is the \nmost comprehensive to date. The first step in the consultation process \nwas the convening of a roundtable discussion with tribal leaders, urban \nIndian health care providers, Indian Health Service health care \nprofessionals, national Indian health organizations, researchers, and \nother policy makers. Specific recommendations regarding the manner in \nwhich tribal consultation meetings would be carried out were developed \nat this Roundtable. From these recommendations, the Roundtable \nparticipants developed a consultation approach that included the \npursuit of consensus on what amendments to the Act were necessary and \nthe identification of opportunities for change, the identification of \narea and regional differences, the promotion of a partnership \nenvironment for tribes, urban Indians, and the Indian Health Service, \nand the establishment of a core group to review materials.\n  Beginning in the fall of 1998, tribal representatives participated in \ntwelve Area meetings to begin discussing concerns and recommendations \nrelated to the Act. Each of the twelve geographic Areas facilitated a \nconsultation process with health care providers in their respective \nAreas, and this process was completed in January 1999.\n  Four regional consultation meetings were held across the country from \nJanuary to April, 1999. Regional meetings were intended to provide a \nforum for tribes to provide input, to share the recommendations from \neach Area, and to build consensus among participants for a unified \nposition from each regional meeting. From these four meetings, a matrix \nof 135 recommendations for each of the sections in the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act was developed, as well as proposals for new \nprovisions. Over 900 health care providers participated in the four \nregional meetings.\n  Upon the completion of the four regional meetings, the Indian Health \nService convened a National Steering committee composed of elected \ntribal representatives and urban Indian health care program directors. \nMany of the members of the steering committee had participated in the \nArea and regional consultation meetings. The National Steering \nCommittee developed a draft consensus bill based on the Area and \nregional consultation meetings. The draft bill was mailed to every \ntribal government and urban Indian health care program in the nation \nwith a 30-day period for additional comments. The draft bill was then \npresented at a national meeting in Washington, D.C. in late July of \nlast year. Participants in this national meeting included tribal \ngovernment leaders, urban Indian health care providers, members of \nCongress and their staff, as well as several Administration and \ndepartmental officials.\n  The National Steering Committee has completed a monumental task with \nthe broad support of Indian Tribes and communities across the United \nStates.\n  With this in mind, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2527. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrant programs to reduce substance abuse, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              drug treatment and research enhancement act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am sending a bill to the desk to help \nreinforce our national drug control effort. I held a hearing earlier \ntoday on the domestic consequences of a new wave of heroin use. This is \na flesh and blood problem that touches all of us. What we see in our \nhomes and schools across the nation is the emergence of a new threat to \nour young people. A purer form of heroin is making its presence felt. \nIn rich neighborhoods and poor. In our cities and rural areas. In the \nlives of our young people and their families.\n\n  No heroin consumed in this country is made here. Every gram of it is \ngrown in some foreign field, processed in a distant, illegal lab, and \nsmuggled into this country. Yet, this heroin makes its way here by \nevery means possible. It walks, floats, flies, and sneaks across our \nborders.\n  While the heroin used here comes from overseas, the consequences of \nits coming are felt in our homes, in our schools, in our neighborhoods. \nIt is our young people who die. It is American families who bear the \nburden and pay the price. Heroin is an equal opportunity destroyer. It \nblights inner city streets, suburban neighborhoods, and rural \ncommunities alike. I fear that the problem is getting worse. And I am \nconcerned that our current policies are simply not up to the challenge.\n  Somewhere along the way, we lost the clear, consistent message that \nthe only proper response to drugs is to say an emphatic ``NO''. We're \nsupposed to be more sophisticated. More tolerant. More willing to \nlisten to notions of making dangerous drugs more available. What all of \nthis ``more'' has meant is that we have more young people using more \ndrugs at younger ages. Today's heroin is cheaper and purer and more \nwidely available. It is more aggressively marketed and it is presented \nas being safer, as ``user friendly''.\n  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, heroin had a bad rap. All drugs \ndid. That is less true today. In the last several years, heroin use \namong young people has doubled and attitudes about the dangers of the \ndrug have shifted. While it is true that most of our 12 to 20 year olds \nstill believe it bad, the new heroin that we see on our streets and in \nour schools is marketed to avoid this stigma. The chief reason that the \nold heroin was seen as bad was because you needed a needle to use it. \nWith the new heroin you can get high from smoking or inhaling, at least \nat first. And we now have well-moneyed think tank talking heads who \npreach that the only consequence of heroin addiction is a mild case of \nconstipation. That it is our drug laws that are dangerous not the \ndrugs. In such an environment, we should not be too surprised that an \nincreasing number of young people should be persuaded that heroin is \nokay.\n  Communities in Plano, Texas and Orlando, Florida learned this to \ntheir dismay when dozens of high school kids died from heroin \noverdoses. I can think of no pain greater than that of a parent who \nmust bid farewell forever to a child. It is somehow contrary to the \nnatural order for a parent to precede a child in death. But the pain of \naddiction is a spreading circle of hurt. The hearing I held today on \nthis problem brought this point home in the voices of those most \naffected: addicts and their families.\n  The legislation that I offer today will help us address this new \nproblem before it gets any worse. I am proposing that we look at the \nmeans to improve our prevention message to stop drug use before it \nstarts. I hope to revitalize community and parent involvement.\n  I am also proposing increased resources for addiction research and \nways to get the best information and best practices into the hands of \nthe professionals who must deal with addiction problems.\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\n  In addition, I am calling for a new initiative to support juvenile \nresidential treatment programs that work. Current research shows that \nwe need more focused, long-term critical intervention for young addicts \nto break the cycle of addiction today before it becomes a worse problem \ntomorrow. Investment now means better chances for young people and for \nall of us later.\n  It's not just a new heroin that plagues us. Designer drugs like \nmethamphetamine and now Ecstasy are flooding this country. Along with \nheroin, these are marketed to our young people as safe and friendly. \nLeft unanswered, we will see another generation of young lives \nblighted. We will see families torn up by a widening circle of hurt \nfrom drug use. We saw what a similar wave of drug use did to us and to \na generaton of young people in the 1960s and 1970s.

Mr. President, today I have the honor of submitting a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the Department of \nEducation develop and disseminate educational materials and programs \ndesigned to make students in elementary and secondary schools aware of \nthe contributions of veterans and their importance in preserving \nAmerican peace and prosperity. The resolution also designates the week \nthat includes Veterans Day as ``National Veterans Awareness Week'' to \nserve as a focus for these educational activities.\n  Why do we need such an educational effort? In a sense, this action \nhas become necessary because we are victims\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\nof our own success with regard to the superior performance of our Armed \nForces. The plain fact is that there are just fewer people around now \nwho have had any connection with military service. For example, as a \nresult of tremendous advances in military technology and the resultant \nproductivity increases, our current Armed Forces now operate \neffectively with a personnel roster that is one-third less in size than \njust 10 years ago. In addition, the success of the all-volunteer \ncareer-oriented force has led to much lower turnover of personnel in \ntoday's military than in previous eras when conscription was a place. \nFinally, the number of veterans who served during previous conflicts, \nsuch as World War II, when our military was many times larger than \ntoday, is inevitably declining.\n  The net result of these changes is that the percentage of the entire \npopulation that has served in the Armed Forces is dropping rapidly, a \nchange that can be seen in all segments of society. Whereas during \nWorld War II it was extremely uncommon to find a family in America that \ndid not have one of its members on active duty, now there are numerous \nfamilies that include no military veterans at all. As a consequence of \nthis lack of opportunity for contacts with veterans, many of our young \npeople have little or no connection with or knowledge about the \nimportant historical and ongoing role of men and women who have served \nin the military. This omission seems to have persisted despite ongoing \neducational efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the \nveterans service organizations.\n  This lack of understanding about military veterans' important role in \nour society can have potentially serious repercussions. In our country, \ncivilian control of the Armed Forces is the key tenet of military \ngovernance. A citizenry that is oblivious to the capabilities and \nlimitations of the Armed Forces, and to its critical role throughout \nour history, can make decisions that have unexpected and unwanted \nconsequences. Even more important, general recognition of the \nimportance of those individual character traits that are essential for \nmilitary success, such as patriotism, selflessness, sacrifice, and \nheroism, is vital to maintaining these key aspects of citizenship in \nthe Armed Forces and even throughout the population at large.\n  Among today's young people, a generation that has grown up largely \nduring times of peace and extraordinary prosperity and has embraced a \n``me first'' attitude, it is perhaps even more important to make sure \nthat there is solid understanding of what it has taken to attain this \nlevel of comfort and freedom. The failure of our children to understand \nwhy a military is important, why our society continues to depend on it \nfor ultimate survival, and why a successful military requires integrity \nand sacrifice, will have predictable consequences as these youngsters \nbecome of voting age. Even though military service is a responsibility \nthat is no longer shared by a large segment of the population, as it \nhas been in the past, knowledge of the contribution of those who have \nserved in the Armed Forces is as important as it has ever been. To the \nextent that many of us will not have the opportunity to serve our \ncountry in uniform, we must still remain cognizant of our \nresponsibility as citizens to fulfill the obligations we owe, both \ntangible and intangible, to those who do serve and who do sacrifice on \nour behalf.\n  The importance of this issue was recently brought home to me by \nSamuel I. Cashdollar, a 13-year-old seventh grader at Lewes Middle \nSchool in Lewes, Delaware, who recently won the Delaware VFW's Youth \nEssay Contest with a powerful presentation titled ``How Should We Honor \nAmerica's Veterans?'' Samuel's essay points out that we have Nurses' \nWeek, Secretaries' Week, and Teachers' Week, to rightly emphasize the \nimportance of these occupations, but the contributions of those in \nuniform tend to be overlooked and many businesses remain open on \nVeterans Day. In a time when, for some, Veterans Day has simply become \nan excuse for another department store sale, we need to make sure that \nwe don't become a nation where more high school seniors recognize the \nname Britney Spears than the name Dwight Eisenhower.\n  Now, it is appropriate to ask, ``We already have Veterans Day, why do \nwe need National Veterans Awareness Week?'' Historically Veterans Day \nwas established to honor those who served in uniform during wartime. \nAlthough we now customarily honor all veterans on Veterans Day, I see \nit as a holiday that is focused on honoring individuals, the courageous \nand selfless men and women without whose actions our country would not \nexist as it does. National Veterans Awareness Week would complement \nVeterans Day by focusing on education as well as commemoration, on the \ncontributions of the many in addition to the heroism and service of the \nindividual. National Veterans Awareness Week would also present an \nopportunity to remind ourselves of the contributions and sacrifices of \nthose who have served in peacetime as well as in conflict; both groups \nwork unending hours and spend long periods away from their families \nunder conditions of great discomfort so that we all can live in a land \nof freedom and plenty.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this resolution; our \nchildren and our childrens' children will need to be well informed \nabout what veterans have accomplished in order to make appropriate \ndecisions as they confront the numerous worldwide challenges that they \nare sure to face in the future. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof Samuel Cashdollar's essay be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the essay was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                How Should We Honor America's Veterans?\n\n                       (By Samuel I. Cashdollar)\n\n       The 11th of November each year is designated as Veterans \n     Day and is a Federal holiday. Employees of the U.S. \n     Government get the day off and post offices and most banks \n     are closed. The President visits Arlington National Cemetery \n     and lays a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Parades \n     are held in some places. This isn't adequate recognition of \n     the contribution veterans have made to America.\n       Each State is free to decide which Federal Holidays it \n     wants to recognize. In many States, government offices, \n     schools, and businesses remain open on Veterans Day. Even \n     where it's officially observed, Veterans Day comes and goes \n     with most people not even thinking about the tremendous \n     sacrifices made by the men and women who served in Armed \n     Forces and fought for America's freedom.\n       Today, people celebrate numerous weeks, such as Nurses \n     Week, Secretaries Week, Teachers Week, etc. These are \n     important events, but are they any more important than \n     honoring brave men and women who gave so much for their \n     country? America is free because of these courageous \n     individuals who should be honored with their own week.\n       The U.S. Congress should pass a law establishing a \n     ``Veterans Week''. All schools should be required to spend a \n     portion of each day reminding students that it was ordinary \n     people who fought, were wounded, and even killed in defense \n     of America. This could be done in each grade level so that \n     every student would learn something about the wars that our \n     nation has fought. It could be part of a history class as \n     well as a lesson about the responsibility of each person to \n     protect our country. Teachers could easily find stories to \n     share with students who have no idea what war is like. If \n     teachers needed help, I'm sure organizations like the VFW \n     would be glad to participate and even speak to the students.\n       Veterans Week should be given special attention on \n     television, too, just like Black History Month. I've learned \n     a lot about the history of Black Americans from the stories \n     they feature on television. Movies about heroic battles \n     should be broadcast all week long. Veterans could talk about \n     their experiences in those wars.\n       In conclusion, it's very sad that many Americans know \n     little or nothing about the great wars our country has fought \n     in. I believe Veterans Week would do a lot to change that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/09/senate-section/article/S3738-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3738-S3781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               LIEBERMAN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3127\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \nKohl, Mr. Graham, Mr. Robb, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Bryan, and Mrs. Feinstein) \nproposed an amendment to the bill (S. 2) to extend programs and \nactivities under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; as \nfollows:\n\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\n\n       Beginning on page 1, line 3, strike ``1.'' and all that \n     follows through line 18 on page 922, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     1.

DECLARATION OF PRIORITIES.\n\n       Congress declares that our national educational priorities \n     are to--\n       (1) introduce real accountability by making public \n     elementary school and secondary school education funding \n     performance-based rather than a guaranteed source of revenue \n     for States and local educational agencies;\n       (2) require State educational agencies and local \n     educational agencies to establish high student performance \n     objectives, and to provide the State educational agencies and \n     local educational agencies with flexibility in using Federal \n     resources to ensure that the performance objectives are met;\n       (3) concentrate Federal funding around a small number of \n     central education goals, including compensatory education for \n     disadvantaged children and youth, teacher quality and \n     professional development, programs for limited English \n     proficient students, public school choice programs, \n     innovative educational programs, student safety, and the \n     incorporation of educational technology;\n       (4) concentrate Federal education funding on impoverished \n     areas where elementary schools and secondary schools are most \n     likely to be in distress;\n       (5) sanction State educational agencies and local \n     educational agencies that consistently fail to meet \n     established benchmarks; and\n       (6) reward State educational agencies, local educational \n     agencies, and elementary schools and secondary schools that \n     demonstrate high performance.\n\n                      TITLE I--STUDENT PERFORMANCE\n\n     SEC. 101. HEADING.\n\n       The heading for title I (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) is amended \n     to read as follows:\n\n                   ``TITLE I--STUDENT PERFORMANCE''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS, POLICY, AND PURPOSE.\n\n       Section 1001 (20 U.S.C. 6301) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 1001. FINDINGS, POLICY AND PURPOSE.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) Despite more than 3 decades of Federal assistance, a \n     sizable achievement gap remains between low-income and \n     middle-class students.\n       ``(2) The 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 was an important step in \n     focusing our Nation's priorities on closing the achievement \n     gap between poor and affluent students in the United States. \n     The Federal Government must continue to build on these \n     improvements made in 1994 by holding States and local \n     educational agencies accountable for student achievement.\n       ``(3) States can help close this achievement gap by \n     developing challenging curriculum content and student \n     performance standards so that all elementary school and \n     secondary school students perform at an advanced level. \n     States should implement vigorous and comprehensive student \n     performance assessments, such as the National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress (NAEP) so as to measure fully the \n     progress of our Nation's students.\n       ``(4) In order to ensure that no child is left behind in \n     the new economy, the Federal Government must better target \n     Federal resources on those children who are most at-risk for \n     falling behind academically.\n       ``(5)(A) Title I funds have been targeted on high-poverty \n     areas, but not to the degree they should be as demonstrated \n     by the following:\n       ``(B) Although 95 percent of schools with poverty levels of \n     75 percent to 100 percent receive title I funding, 20 percent \n     of schools with poverty levels of 50 to 74 percent do not \n     receive any title I funding.\n       ``(C) Only 64 percent of schools with poverty levels in the \n     35 percent to 49 percent range receive title I funding.\n       ``(6) Title I funding should be significantly increased and \n     more effectively targeted to ensure that all low-income \n     students have an opportunity to excel academically.\n       ``(7) The Federal Government should provide greater \n     decisionmaking authority and flexibility to schools and \n     teachers in exchange for greater responsibility for student \n     performance. Federal, State, and local efforts should be \n     focused on raising the academic achievement of all students. \n     Our Nation's children deserve nothing less than holding \n     accountable those responsible for shaping our childrens' \n     future and our country's future.\n       ``(b) Policy.--Congress declares that it is the policy of \n     the United States to ensure that all students receive a high-\n     quality education by holding States, local educational \n     agencies, and elementary schools and secondary schools \n     accountable for increased student academic performance \n     results, and by facilitating improved classroom instruction.\n       ``(c) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are as follows:\n       ``(1) To eliminate the existing 2-tiered educational \n     system, which set lower academic expectations for \n     impoverished students than for affluent students.\n       ``(2) To require all States to have challenging content and \n     student performance standards and assessment measures in \n     place.\n       ``(3) To require all States to ensure adequate yearly \n     progress for all students by establishing annual, numerical \n     performance objectives.\n       ``(4) To ensure that all title I students receive \n     educational instruction from a fully qualified teacher.\n       ``(5) To support State and local educational agencies in \n     identifying, assisting, and correcting low-performing \n     schools.\n       ``(6) To increase Federal funding for part A programs for \n     disadvantaged students in return for increased academic \n     performance of all students.\n       ``(7) To target Federal funding to local educational \n     agencies serving the highest percentages of low-income \n     students.''.\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\n     SEC. 103.

FINDINGS, POLICY, AND PURPOSE.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1)(A) Congress embraces the view that educators most \n     familiar with schools, including school superintendents, \n     principals, teachers, and school support personnel, have a \n     critical role in knowing what is needed and how best to meet \n     the educational needs of students.\n       ``(B) Local educational agencies should therefore have \n     primary responsibility for deciding how to implement funds.\n       ``(2)(A) Since the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     was first authorized in 1965, the Federal Government has \n     created numerous grant programs, each of which was created to \n     address 1 among the myriad challenges and problems facing \n     education.\n       ``(B) Only a few of the Federal grant programs established \n     before the date of enactment of the Public Education \n     Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act can be tied \n     to significant quantitative results.\n       ``(C) Because Federal education dollars are distributed \n     through a patchwork of programs, with each program having its \n     own set of requirements and restrictions, local educational \n     agencies and schools have found it difficult to leverage \n     funds for maximum impact.\n       ``(D) In many cases, Federal education dollars distributed \n     through competitive grant programs are too diffused to \n     provide a true impact at the school level.\n       ``(E) As a result of the Federal elementary and secondary \n     education policies in place before the date of enactment of \n     the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and \n     Responsibility Act, the focus of Federal, State, and local \n     educational agencies has been diverted from comprehensive \n     student achievement to administrative compliance.\n       ``(3)(A) Every elementary school and secondary school \n     should provide a drug- and violence-free learning \n     environment.\n       ``(B) The widespread illegal use of alcohol and drugs among \n     the Nation's secondary school students, and increasingly \n     among elementary school students, constitutes a grave threat \n     to students' physical and mental well-being, and \n     significantly impedes the learning process.\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\n       ``(C) Drug and violence prevention programs are essential \n     components of a comprehensive strategy to promote school \n     safety, youth development, and positive school outcomes, and \n     reduce the demand for and illegal use of alcohol, tobacco, \n     and drugs throughout the Nation.\n       ``(D) Schools, local organizations, parents, students, and \n     communities throughout the Nation have a special \n     responsibility to work together to combat the continuing \n     epidemic of violence and illegal drug use, and should measure \n     the success of programs established to address this epidemic \n     against clearly defined goals and objectives.\n       ``(E) Drug and violence prevention programs are most \n     effective when implemented within a research-based, drug and \n     violence prevention framework of proven effectiveness.\n       ``(F) Substance abuse and violence are intricately related, \n     and must be dealt with in a holistic manner.\n       ``(4)(A) Technology can produce far greater opportunities \n     for all students to meet high learning standards, promote \n     efficiency and effectiveness in education, and help \n     immediately and dramatically reform our Nation's educational \n     system.\n       ``(B) Because most Federal and State educational technology \n     programs have focused on acquiring educational technologies, \n     rather than emphasizing the utilization of those technologies \n     in the classroom and the training and infrastructure required \n     efficiently to support the technologies, the full potential \n     of educational technology has rarely been realized.\n       ``(C) The effective use of technology in education has been \n     inhibited by the inability of many State educational agencies \n     and local educational agencies to invest in and support \n     needed technologies, and to obtain sufficient resources to \n     seek expert technical assistance in developing high-quality \n     professional development activities for teachers and keeping \n     pace with the rapid technological advances.\n       ``(D) To remain competitive in the global economy, which is \n     increasingly reliant on a workforce that is comfortable with \n     technology and able to integrate rapid technological changes \n     into production processes, it is imperative that our Nation \n     maintain a work-ready labor force.\n       ``(b) Policy.--Congress declares it to be the policy of the \n     United States--\n       ``(1) to facilitate significant innovation in elementary \n     school and secondary school education programs;\n       ``(2) to enrich the learning environment of students;\n       ``(3) to provide a

To find such a school, parents need a full \n     range of choice to determine where their children can best be \n     educated.\n       ``(c) Precedents.--The United States Supreme Court has \n     determined that programs giving parents choice and increased \n     input in their children's education, including the choice of \n     a religious education, do not violate the Constitution. The \n     Supreme Court has held that as long as the beneficiary \n     decides where education funds will be spent on such \n     individual's behalf, public funds can be used for education \n     in a religious institution because the public entity has \n     neither advanced nor hindered a particular religion and \n     therefore has not violated the establishment clause of the \n     first amendment to the Constitution. Supreme Court precedents \n     include--\n       ``(1) Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972); Pierce v. \n     Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); and Meyer v. \n     Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923) which held that parents have \n     the primary role in and are the primary decision makers in \n     all areas regarding the education and upbringing of their \n     children;\n       ``(2) Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983) which declared \n     a Minnesota tax deduction program that provided State income \n     tax benefits for educational expenditures by parents, \n     including tuition in religiously affiliated schools, does not \n     violate the Constitution;\n       ``(3) Witters v. Department of Services for the Blind, 474 \n     U.S. 481 (1986) in which the Supreme Court ruled unanimously \n     that public funds for the vocational training of the blind \n     could be used at a Bible college for ministry training; and\n       ``(4) Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, 509 \n     U.S. 1 (1993) which held that a deaf child could receive an \n     interpreter, paid for by the public, in a private religiously \n     affiliated school under the Individual with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.). The case held that \n     providing an interpreter in a religiously affiliated school \n     did not violate the establishment clause of the first \n     amendment of the Constitution.\n\n     ``SEC. 5962.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This part may be cited as the ``Early \n     Learning Opportunities Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) medical research demonstrates that adequate stimulation \n     of a young child's brain between birth and age 5 is critical \n     to the physical development of the young child's brain;\n       (2) parents are the most significant and effective teachers \n     of their children, and they alone are responsible for \n     choosing the best early learning opportunities for their \n     child;\n       (3) parent education and parent involvement are critical to \n     the success of any early learning program or activity;\n       (4) the more intensively parents are involved in their \n     child's early learning, the greater the cognitive and \n     noncognitive benefits to their children;\n       (5) many parents have difficulty finding the information \n     and support the parents seek to help their children grow to \n     their full potential;\n       (6) each day approximately 13,000,000 young children, \n     including 6,000,000 infants or toddlers, spend some or all of \n     their day being cared for by someone other than their \n     parents;\n       (7) quality early learning programs, including those \n     designed to promote effective parenting, can increase the \n     literacy rate, the secondary school graduation rate, the \n     employment rate, and the college enrollment rate for children \n     who have participated in voluntary early learning programs \n     and activities;\n       (8) early childhood interventions can yield substantial \n     advantages to participants in terms of emotional and \n     cognitive development, education, economic well-being, and \n     health, with the latter 2 advantages applying to the \n     children's families as well;\n       (9) participation in quality early learning programs, \n     including those designed to promote effective parenting, can \n     decrease the\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\n     future incidence of teenage pregnancy, welfare dependency, \n     at-risk behaviors, and juvenile delinquency for children;\n       (10) several cost-benefit analysis studies indicate that \n     for each $1 invested in quality early learning programs, the \n     Federal Government can save over $5 by reducing the number of \n     children and families who participate in Federal Government \n     programs like special education and welfare;\n       (11) for children placed in the care of others during the \n     workday, the low salaries paid to the child care staff, the \n     lack of career progression for the staff, and the lack of \n     child development specialists involved in early learning and \n     child care programs, make it difficult to attract and retain \n     the quality of staff necessary for a positive early learning \n     experience;\n       (12) Federal Government support for early learning has \n     primarily focused on out-of-home care programs like those \n     established under the Head Start Act, the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant of 1990, and part C of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and these \n     programs--\n       (A) serve far fewer than half of all eligible children;\n       (B) are not primarily designed to provide support for \n     parents who care for their young children in the home; and\n       (C) lack a means of coordinating early learning \n     opportunities in each community; and\n       (13) by helping communities increase, expand, and better \n     coordinate early learning opportunities for children and \n     their families, the productivity and creativity of future \n     generations will be improved, and the Nation will be prepared \n     for continued leadership in the 21st century.\n\n     SEC. 11402. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this part are--\n       (1) to increase the availability of voluntary programs, \n     services, and activities that support early childhood \n     development, increase parent effectiveness, and promote the \n     learning readiness of young children so that young children \n     enter school ready to learn;\n       (2) to support parents, child care providers, and \n     caregivers who want to incorporate early learning activities \n     into the daily lives of young children;\n       (3) to remove barriers to the provision of an accessible \n     system of early childhood learning programs in communities \n     throughout the United States;\n       (4) to increase the availability and affordability of \n     professional development activities and compensation for \n     caregivers and child care providers; and\n       (5) to facilitate the development of community-based \n     systems of collaborative service delivery models \n     characterized by resource sharing, linkages between \n     appropriate supports, and local planning for services.\n\n     SEC. 11403.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, strike lines 15 through 19 and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) Request for review.--When an agency publishes an \n     economically significant rule, a chairman or ranking member \n     of a committee of jurisdiction of either House of Congress \n     may request the Comptroller General of the United states to \n     review the rule.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has \npassed by unanimous consent the ``Truth in Regulating Act.'' This \nlegislation would support Congressional oversight to ensure that \nimportant regulatory decisions are efficient, effective, and fair.\n  The foundation of the ``Truth in Regulating Act'' is the right of \nCongress and the people we serve to know about important regulatory \ndecisions. Through the General Accounting Office, which serves as \nCongress' eyes and ears, this legislation will help us get access to \nthe cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, and other key information \nunderlying important regulatory proposals. So, in a real sense, this \nlegislation not only gives people the right to know; it gives them the \nright to see--to see how the government works, or doesn't. GAO will be \nresponsible for providing an evaluation of the analysis underlying a \nproposed regulation, which will enable us to communicate better with \nthe agency up front. It will help us to ensure that the proposed \nregulation ultimately is sensible and consistent with Congress' intent. \nIt will help improve the quality of important regulations. This will \ncontribute to the success of programs the public values and improve \npublic confidence in the Federal Government, which is a real concern \ntoday.\n  Under the 3-year pilot project established by this legislation, a \nchairman or ranking member of a committee with legislative or general \noversight jurisdiction, such as Governmental Affairs, may request the \nGAO to provide an independent evaluation of the agency regulatory \nanalysis for any proposed economically significant rule. The \nComptroller General shall submit a report no later than 180 calendar \ndays after a committee request is received. The Comptroller General's \nevaluation of the rule shall include the following: an evaluation of \nthe agency's analysis of the potential benefits of the rule; an \nevaluation of the agency's analysis of the potential costs of the rule; \nan evaluation of the agency's analysis of alternative approaches as \nwell as of any cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, federalism \nassessment, or other analysis prepared by the agency or required for \nthe rule; and a summary of the results of the evaluation and the \nimplications of those results.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the ``Truth in Regulating Act'' \nwill encourage Federal agencies to make better use of modern \ndecisionmaking tools, such as benefit-cost analysis and risk \nassessment. Currently, these important tools often are viewed simply as \noptions--options that aren't used as much or as well as they should be. \nOver the years, the Governmental Affairs Committee has reviewed and \ndeveloped a voluminous record showing that our regulatory process is \nnot working as well as intended and is missing important opportunities \nto achieve more cost-effective regulation. In April 1999, I chaired a \nhearing in which we heard testimony on the need for this proposal. The \nGeneral Accounting Office has done important studies for Governmental \nAffairs and other committees showing that agency practices--in cost-\nbenefit analysis, risk assessment, federalism assessments, and in \nmeeting transparency and disclosure requirements of laws and executive \norders--need significant improvement. Many other authorities support \nthese findings. All of us benefit when government performs well and \nmeets the needs of the people it serves.\n  A lot of effort and collaboration went into this legislation, which I \nthink is why the Senate can now approve it unanimously. S. 1198 was \noriginally the ``Congressional Accountability for Regulatory \nInformation Act of 1999,'' sponsored by Senator Richard Shelby with \nSenators Lott and Bond. I sponsored S. 1244, the ``Truth in Regulating \nAct of 1999,'' with Senators Lincoln, Voinovich, Kerrey, Breaux, \nLandrieu, Inhofe, Stevens, Bennett, Robb, Hagel, and Roth. We \nsynthesized these two similar bills, and I negotiated certain changes \nand clarifications with Joe Lieberman, the Ranking Member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. On November 3, 1999, the negotiated \nchanges were offered as a Thompson/Lieberman substitute amendment to S. \n1198, and the bill was reported by the Governmental Affairs Committee \nby voice vote. Afterwards, I worked on clarifications with Senator \nLevin. I thank my colleagues for pulling together to get the job done.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am supporting Senate passage of S. \n1198, a bill to provide a three year pilot program for GAO review of \ncertain agency rule makings. These are rule makings where the Chairman \nor Ranking Member of a committee of jurisdiction in the House or the \nSenate has requested such a review after the rule has been published as \nproposed.\n  As first introduced and considered in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\nwas opposed to this bill. I was concerned that it created a two track \nrule making process, putting GAO in the shoes of the rule making agency \nand having GAO carry out its own interpretation of the public comments, \nscientific studies and economic analyses involved in the development of \nthe rule. But through the work of Senator Thompson and Senator \nLieberman, the bill has been reworked and refined to a point where it \nmay provide the agencies, Congress and the public with helpful \ninformation in evaluating the work of a rule making in progress without \njeopardizing the separate and distinct roles played by the Executive \nand Legislative branches in the regulatory process.\n  As most of my colleagues know, I, along with Senator Thompson, have \nbeen fighting for years for a regulatory reform bill that would \nestablish clear cost-benefit analysis standards for federal rule making \nagencies. I believe it is very important that federal agencies do a \nreasonable and proficient job of assessing the potential costs and the \npotential benefits of a proposed regulatory option and that they inform \nthe public and Congress of those costs and benefits and tell us whether \nit's likely that the benefits of a proposed rule justify the costs. If \nan agency can't make that determination or if an agency concludes that \nthe benefits of a rule don't justify the costs, then it should have the \nobligation to tell us why it is going ahead with the regulation. That, \nto me, is common sense. And it's particularly important in light of \nrecent studies which show that numerous rules issued by federal \nagencies don't have benefits that justify the costs. We need to know \nwhy and in the future, with that information, we can decide whether we \nwant to regulate under those circumstances. But Senator Thompson and I, \ndespite a wide ranging group of supporters and the commitment of the \nAdministration to sign the bill, have been frustrated in our efforts to \nget such a bill passed.\n  I think passing The Regulatory Improvement Act, S. 746, should be our \nfirst priority--getting the basic systems in place--and then once \npassed, consider an evaluative role for GAO in reviewing what agencies \nare doing in response to the requirements of that new law. But in the \nface of entrenched opposition to the Regulatory Improvement Act, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has pushed ahead with the GAO bill, and \ngiven the significant amendments made to the bill during the \nCommittee's markup and the amendment we are adopting here, on the \nSenate floor, today, I am willing to help advance this legislation now. \nThe amendments to which I refer did several important things, \nincluding: specifying that GAO's role is to review the work of the \nagency and not the substance of the rule; beginning GAO's review after \nthe rule has been published as proposed; and ensuring the existing \ndiscretion and authority of both the rule making agencies and the GAO.\n  Mr. President, I would like to confirm with the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Governmental Affairs Committee, if they would, my \nunderstanding of certain provisions of this bill. First, I understand \nfrom this legislation that the rule making agencies retain their \nauthority and discretion with respect to the issuance of rules. Nothing \nin this bill is intended to alter an agency's authority or discretion \nwith respect to a rule making. Is that right?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Michigan is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is also my understanding that this legislation is not \nintended to authorize any delay in the issuance of a rule.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That's right.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And finally, it is my understanding that when GAO issues \nits report on a rule pursuant to this legislation, that report, like \nthe audit reports GAO issues now, will allow for the subject agency to \nrespond to the findings and comments of GAO and will embody the \nagency's response in the GAO report. Is that right?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In short, then, this legislation neither expands or \ncontracts the authority of GAO in reviewing an agency's rule making nor \ndoes it expand or contract a rule making agency's authority to develop \nor issue a rule. The legislation establishes a process by which a \nchairman or ranking member of a committee of jurisdiction can request \nGAO after a proposed rule is published, to review the rule and report \nto Congress within 180 days, and it gives GAO the staff resources to \ncarry those reviews out. Is that right?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from \nConnecticut for their clarifications.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to, \nthe committee substitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill be read \nthe third time and passed, the title amendment be agreed to, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3142) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1198), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 1198\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
