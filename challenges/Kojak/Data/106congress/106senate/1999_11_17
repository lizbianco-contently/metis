Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I commend Senator Wellstone \nfor his leadership on this issue. I rise to support the amendment that \nhe has offered. I have been involved with Senator Wellstone in \nconstructing this proposal. The proposal very simply is to try to have \na time out of sorts with respect to the mergers that are occurring in \nthe agricultural processing industries. The question at the root of all \nof this is, What is the value of a family farm in our country and do we \ncare about whether this country has family farmers in its future?\n  If we do, if we care about keeping family farmers in our country's \nfuture, then we must do something about the concentration that is \noccurring and plugging the arteries of the free market system in the \nagricultural economy. Family farmers are not able to compete in a free \nand open system. It is just not happening. Why? Because of these \nmergers and concentration in the large agricultural industries.\n  Let me show you with this chart what is happening to family farmers. \nThe family farm share of the retail cereal grains dollar has gone down, \ndown, and way down. Why? Why is the family farm share of the food \ndollar going down? Because as my friend from Minnesota likes to say, \nthe big food giants have muscled their way to the dinner table. He is \nabsolutely correct. They are grabbing more of the food dollar. The \nfamily farmer gets less. The food processors are making substantial \namounts, record dollars, and the family farmers are, unfortunately, not \nable to make it.\n  The farm share of the retail pork dollar is down, down, way down. The \nfamily farm share of the retail beef dollar? Exactly the same thing.\n  Why is all of this occurring? Because concentration in these \nindustries means there are fewer firms. For example, in market \nconcentration in meat processing, in beef, the top four firms\n\n[[Page S14655]]\n\ncontrol 80 percent of the profits; in sheep, 73 percent; pork, 57 \npercent. Exactly the same is true in grain. Wet corn milling, 74 \npercent, the top four companies.\n  The point is, this massive concentration is plugging the arteries of \nthe market system. There isn't competition, or at least the kind of \ncompetition that is fair competition for family farms.\n  Now, our proposal is very simple. It proposes a moratorium on certain \nkinds of mergers. We are talking only about the largest firms. And then \nduring that moratorium for 18 months we have a commission review the \nunderlying statutes that determine what is competitive and what is \nanticompetitive.\n  There are people here who don't care about family farmers. They say, \nif the market system would decide that family farms should continue, \nthen they will continue. And if the market system is ambivalent to it, \nthen we won't have family farmers. But that is because the view of such \npeople matches the view of economists, which is that you can value only \nthat which you can measure in quantitative terms. If you can attach \ndollars and cents to it, then it has value. If you can't, it doesn't. \nThe fact is, family farm enterprises have value far beyond their \nproduction of corn or wheat. Family farms in my State produce much more \nthan their crops. They also produce a community. They have a social \nproduct as well as a material product.\n  Now, this product is invisible to economists and to policy experts \nwho only see what they can count in money, but it is crucially \nimportant to our country. We tend to view our economy as a kind of \nStuff Olympics: Those who produce the most stuff win. We are a country \nthat produces more stuff than we need in many areas but much less of \nwhat we really need in other areas. And one such thing we lack is the \nculture and the opportunity we get when we continue a network of family \nfarms. Europeans call this contribution ``multifunctionality.'' That is \njust a fancy way of saying that an enterprise can serve us in more ways \nthan an economist can give credit for. A small town cafe is much more \nto that small town than its financial statement. It is the hub of the \ncommunity. It is the hub of interaction, the crossroads where people \nmeet rather than be blips on a computer screen. The same is true with \nfamily farms. It is much more important to this country than the \nfinancial receipts would show.\n  To those who do not care much about family farms, none of this \nmatters. To those of us who believe a network of family farms preserved \nfor our future enhances and strengthens this country, we believe very \nstrongly that we must take actions to give family farmers a chance to \nsurvive.\n  One of those actions--only one--is to say, let us stop this massive \nconcentration in the giant food industries that is choking the life out \nof family farms. Why is it that when you buy a loaf of bread, the \namount of money the farmers get from that loaf of bread is now not even \nthe heel, it is less than the heel?\n  Why is it that anyone in the food processing industry who touches \nthat which farmers produce--wheat, corn, soybeans, and more--makes \nrecord profits, but the farmers are going broke?\n  Why is it that a farmer who gases a tractor, plows the land, and \nnurtures the grain all summer, combines it and harvests it in the fall, \ngoes to the elevator only to be told the county elevator and the grain \ntrade have described that food as worthless. Then someone gets hold of \nthat same grain and crisps it, shreds it, flakes it, puffs it, puts it \nin a box and gets it on the grocer's shelf. The grain then sells for $4 \nor $5 a box, and all of a sudden it has great value as puffed or \nshredded wheat. The processor makes record profits and family farmers \nare making record losses.\n  Why is that? Because this system does not stack up. It does not stack \nup in a manner that allows fair, free, and open competition. When you \nhave this kind of concentration, there is not a free market. That is \ntrue in the grain processing industry, it is true in meat, and it is \ntrue as well in the other areas I have discussed.\n  Family farmers are seeing record declines in their share of the \ncereal dollar while everyone else who handles the grain the farmer \nproduced is making a record profit. That is the point.\n  I am for a free, fair, and open economy and fair competition. But our \neconomic system today is not providing that because some are choking \nthe life out of family farmers by clogging the marketplace with unfair \ncompetition. We have antitrust laws to deal with this. They are not \nvery effective, frankly. When Continental and Cargill can decide to \nmarry, and are then sufficiently large to create a further \nanticompetitive force in this market, then there is something wrong \nwith the underlying antitrust laws.\n  This bill is not a Cargill-Continental bill, incidentally. It is not \naimed at any specific company. It is aimed rather at having a timeout \non the massive orgy of mergers that is occurring at the upper level of \nthe corporate world, $100 million or more in value, and at evaluating \nwhat is happening to the market system.\n  If we believe in the free market, we have to nurture that free market \nand protect it. A free market exists when you have free, fair, and open \ncompetition.\n  The last antitrust buster of any great note was Teddy Roosevelt at \nthe start of the century saying the robber barons of oil could not \ncontinue to rob the American people.\n  My point is that if we want to keep family farms in our future, we \nmust take bold and aggressive action to make certain that competition \nis fair to family farms. Today, it is not. They are losing their shirts \nprimarily because of the unfair competition that comes from substantial \nconcentration.\n  My point, to conclude, is we lose something very significant, much \nmore than economists can measure, when we decide we will not care about \nthe destruction of the network of family farms in this country. Europe \nhas 7.5 million family farms dotting the landscape because they decided \nlong ago that these contribute much more to their culture and economy \nthan what the balance sheet shows in numbers. They do in this country \nas well. It is time we take bold action to do something about it.\n  The first step, a modest step in my judgment, proposed by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, myself, and others is to do something about antitrust, \nthe concentration that is clogging the free market, taking money away \nfrom family farmers and putting us in a position where the family farm \nin this country is devastated.\n  We can stop this. This is not rocket science. Good public policy \ndirected in the right area will give economic help and opportunity to \nfamilies who are attempting to farm in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise again to oppose the \nWellstone amendment. I stand here as perhaps one of the only Members of \nthe Senate who has made his living from agribusiness, specifically as a \nfood processor. I think I know of what I speak this morning.\n  I tell my colleagues, if they are listening via TV or however, this \nis a vote about whether or not you believe and trust in the free-market \nsystem.\n  I also rise as somebody who cares a great deal about farmers. I have \nvoted consistently for farm aid in its many forms as we try to provide \nit in the Senate. But I am saying the Wellstone amendment will not turn \naround the ag economy. It does nothing to open overseas markets. It \ndoes nothing about global oversupply of grain, and it does nothing to \nrelieve the onerous regulatory burdens placed on family farmers by the \nFederal Government, such as estate taxes, the unworkable H-2A program, \nthe way the Food Quality Protection Act is being implemented, or the \nloss of water rights. It goes on and on.\n  The family farmer is more under assault by regulation by this \nGovernment than it has ever been by the food processing industry. \nFrankly, what we are saying is the food processor who perhaps wants to \nbuy 100 million pounds of grain but is offered 200 million pounds \nbecause it is produced is somehow to be penalized by the Senate for \nparticipating in the free market. It is not right. It is not our \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S14656]]\n\n  The Wellstone amendment implies that the Antitrust Division at the \nJustice Department is incapable of handling these agribusiness mergers. \nYet the evidence is to the contrary. This is the same Antitrust \nDivision that has required numerous divestitures in recent agribusiness \nacquisitions, such as the Cargill-Continental, Monsanto-Dekalb Genetics \nCorporation. This is the same Antitrust Division that rigorously \npursued antitrust proceedings against Microsoft.\n  Antitrust policy has an important implication to American business \nand deserves the scrutiny of the Judiciary Committee, not posturing on \nthe floor of the Senate. Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, has already announced there will be in his committee \nhearings on agribusiness concentration, as there ought to be, but not \nhere, not this way, not this amendment.\n  The Wellstone amendment additionally is not evenhanded in its \napproach. It exempts agricultural cooperatives, some of which are large \nagribusinesses in their own right. I know from my own experience how to \ntake a small company and make it big by the inefficiencies of the large \ncompanies. The Wellstone amendment will prevent mergers that are often \nnecessary to keep plants competitive, employing people in rural and \nurban areas, and providing important outlets for farm products.\n  It does not distinguish between good mergers and bad mergers. Some of \nthese things have to happen because there is an oversupply of food \nprocessors, in fact. The same market forces that are affecting the \nfarmer also affect the food processor.\n  The Wellstone amendment will effectively guarantee that no medium-\nsize agribusiness will be capable of growing large enough to rival the \nscale of the existing large agribusinesses. Again, I say the American \ndream is for the little guy to become a big guy. This says the food \nprocessor has one of two options if he is in trouble: He can either \nstruggle and try to continue or else he can go bankrupt. I point out if \nyou are interested in farmers, remember that more than two-thirds of \nthe farmers of this country do not grow for the agricultural \ncooperatives; they grow for stock-held-owned companies.\n  The Wellstone amendment will not deconcentrate agribusiness, but it \nwill ensure small- and medium-size agribusinesses are prevented from \ntaking advantage of the same efficiencies enjoyed by their larger \ncompetitors. Frankly, the kind of distrust of the market represented by \nthis amendment is the kind of thing we should expect from the Duma in \nRussia and the National Assembly of France but never from the Senate.\n  In conclusion, I appeal to my colleagues' common sense. This \namendment is before us today in the name of saving family farmers.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider for a moment just who supplies the \nfamily farmer with critical crop inputs, such as seed and fertilizer. \nWho does the family farmer sell their production to for processing and \nmarketing? The answer, in most cases, of course, is agribusinesses, the \none sector of the economy that is being singled out today for a \nfederally mandated merger moratorium that is certainly a counter to the \nfree market that I believe we value in this country.\n  I remind my colleagues that agribusinesses and farmers are \nintertwined and interdependent. They are under the same market forces \non both sides. When the very visible hand of government intervention in \nthe market place is raised in an attempt to punish agribusinesses, \ninevitably it will punish family farmers, too.\n  I say again, most farmers do not grow for agricultural cooperatives. \nThey often grow for small family food processors. So what happens to \nthem? Ultimately, no matter the good intentions of those who are behind \nthis amendment because I stand with them when it comes to trying to \nhelp the family farmer, I just simply say this is not the way.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial \nfrom not my paper but I believe it is Senator Wellstone's paper, the \nStar Tribune in Minneapolis.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Star Tribune, Nov. 15, 1999]\n\n           Giant Killer: Wellstone's Misguided AG Merger Plan\n\n       In the great tradition of prairie populism, Sen. Paul \n     Wellstone has responded to the current farm recession by \n     calling for a federal moratorium on big agribusiness mergers. \n     As a cry of alarm for farmers, this is useful politics. But \n     as a device to restore commodity prices, it is practically \n     pointless, and as a tool of antitrust policy, it is \n     exceedingly blunt.\n       When it resumes debate on the topic this week, the Senate \n     should embrace Wellstone's plan for an agricultural antitrust \n     commission, but it should reject the notion of blocking all \n     mergers, good and bad.\n       Wellstone is right about one thing: Consolidation in \n     agribusiness is perfectly real and genuinely troublesome. A \n     series of agronomy mergers has greatly reduced the number of \n     companies that sell seed and fertilizer to farmers. \n     Meanwhile, the top four meatpacking companies have doubled \n     their share of the beef and pork markets since 1980, to 80 \n     percent and 54 percent respectively.\n       But that trend has nothing to do with this year's \n     commodities collapse, which stems almost entirely from a glut \n     of grain in world markets. Just three years ago, farmers were \n     receiving near-record prices, yet the grain and meat \n     industries already were highly concentrated. Milk processing \n     is just as concentrated as grain or meat, yet dairy farmers \n     earned huge profits last year.\n       Whether consolidation inflicts long-term damage is harder \n     to know. One federal study found that large meat packers \n     discriminate against small livestock farmers, and another \n     found that big beef processors were able to drive down cattle \n     prices by about 4 percent. But several other studies by the \n     U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have found that big, \n     efficient meatpackers improve quality control and save money \n     for consumers. One USDA study even found that livestock \n     farmers got higher prices as the beef industry consolidated, \n     apparently because highly efficient meatpackers passed along \n     some of their savings in the form of higher prices to \n     farmers.\n       To support an outright merger moratorium, you would have to \n     believe that all mergers are wrong or that the current group \n     of federal antitrust regulators is incapable of sorting good \n     from bad.\n       But neither proposition holds up. The 1986 merger of Hormel \n     Foods and Jennie-O Foods, for example, greatly expanded the \n     state's turkey industry while improving the competitiveness \n     of two venerable Minnesota companies. When Michael Foods of \n     St. Louis Park bought Papetti Hygrade of New Jersey in 1997, \n     it enabled two modest egg-processors to survive against much \n     bigger world rivals. Nor is it clear that federal regulators \n     are asleep at the switch. The Justice Department put Cargill \n     Inc. through an antitrust wringer this year before downsizing \n     its purchase of part of Continental Grain.\n       As usual, however, there is something smoldering when \n     Wellstone smells smoke. The Justice Department needs more \n     staff and more money to keep up with a tidal wave of merger \n     applications. His proposed antitrust commission should study \n     whether consolidation in agribusiness is reducing the \n     diversity and independence of American farming.\n       Wellstone isn't grandstanding when he says that thousands \n     of farmers are in genuine trouble this year. But that doesn't \n     mean the populists should get whatever they want, or that \n     what they want would be good for farmers if they got it.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. The first paragraph states:\n\n       In the great tradition of prairie populism, Sen. Paul \n     Wellstone has responded to the current farm [crisis] by \n     calling for a federal moratorium on big agribusiness mergers. \n     As a cry of alarm for farmers, this is useful politics. But \n     as a device to restore commodity prices, it is practically \n     pointless, and as a tool of antitrust policy, it is [an] \n     exceedingly blunt [instrument].\n\n  I join with this editorial in saying that Senator Wellstone's motives \nare good, but his means are just simply misdirected in this case.\n  Ultimately, no matter the good intentions of those who are behind \nthis amendment, it is the family farmers who will pay the greatest \nprice for hobbling the innovation and competitiveness of small- and \nmedium-sized agribusinesses in such a sweeping way.\n  The consequences of the Wellstone amendment run contrary to the \nstated objectives of its supporters. It will not spur new competition \nin the large agribusiness sector. It will not induce higher commodity \nprices for producers. It would be a vote of no confidence in the \nability of the antitrust division to enforce our existing antitrust \nstatutes.\n  So I plead with my colleagues, if they can hear my voice. I ask them \nto vote no on the Wellstone amendment. This is not the way to help the \nfamily farmer. We should trust the marketplace, unless we as a \ngovernment are prepared to subsidize even more and more aspects of our \nagriculture in this country. We already do a great deal. We may yet \nneed to do more. But we must\n\n[[Page S14657]]\n\nnot do more in this way, in this Senate, in this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Chair be kind enough to notify me when I have \nused up 10 minutes of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes; the Chair will do that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, before we get right into the debate, I wish to also \nmention another debate in agriculture and say to my colleagues from \nsome of our Midwest dairy States that I share their indignation at the \nway in which the extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact and the \nblocking of the milk marketing order reform by the Secretary of \nAgriculture--kind of two hits on us--has been put into a conference \nreport. We voted on this on the floor of the Senate. This was not \npassed by either House. Yet it was tucked into a conference report.\n  I think it is an outrageous process. I think people are sick and \ntired of these backroom deals. I intend to be a part of every single \neffort that is made by Senators Kohl, Feingold, Grams, myself, others, \nto raise holy heck about this.\n  After having said that, let me respond to some of the comments on the \nfloor. First of all, I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for offering \nthis amendment with me. As long as my colleague from Oregon represents \nthat tradition of populism, this is Senator Dorgan. It is who he is. \nFrankly, I think it is all about democracy and all about the market.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Johnson and Feingold be \nadded as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Oregon and others, that as \nmuch respect as I have for the Minnesota Star Tribune, I am not all \nthat troubled that sometimes we disagree and that there is an editorial \nthat is in opposition to this amendment because, frankly, this \namendment comes from the countryside. This comes from the heartland. \nThis comes from the heart of our farm and rural communities. That is \nwhere this amendment comes from. I say that to all Senators, Democrats \nand Republicans alike.\n  I also say to my colleague from Oregon, actually this is all about \nthe market. This has nothing to do with Russia or whatever country he \nmentioned. Quite to the contrary, this is all about putting some free \nenterprise back into our economy. This is about putting free enterprise \nback into the free enterprise system. This is about the Sherman Act and \nthe Clayton Act and Senator Estes Kefauver and a great tradition of \nantitrust action. That is what this is about.\n  This is about making sure we have competition. This is making sure \nthat our producers--the one, if you will, free enterprise sector in \nthis food industry--have a chance to survive. That is what this is \nabout. This is as old fashioned and pro-American and a part of the \nhistory of our country as you can get, from Thomas Jefferson to Andrew \nJackson, right up to now.\n  Let me be clear about that. This is a very modest amendment. What it \nsays is that until we develop some kind of comprehensive solution to \nthe problem of extreme concentration in our agricultural markets, and \nanticompetitive practices of the few large conglomerates that have \nmuscled their way to the dinner table, and are driving our producers \nout, we ought to take a ``timeout'' on these mergers and acquisitions--\nnot of small businesses but of large agribusinesses.\n  This timeout could last as long as 18 months but no longer. It could \nalso be terminated well short of 18 months by passage of some \nlegislation, which is what I hope we will be serious about, to deal \nwith this problem of concentration.\n  This is a historic debate and a historic vote because, you know what, \nwe are going to have to deal with the whole question of monopoly power \nand whether or not we need to have more competition and free enterprise \nin our free enterprise system in a lot of sectors of this economy. That \nis what Viacom buying up CBS is all about. That is what the proposed \nmerger of Exxon and Mobil is all about. That is what the rapid \nconsolidations and mergers in all these sectors of the economy, where \nyou have a few firms that dominate, I think to the detriment of our \nconsumers and our small businesses, is all about.\n  If we pass this timeout, we are still going to need to revisit this \nproblem of concentration within the next 18 months. We have to do so \nand pass legislation. What we cannot do is pass this legislation today. \nSo what we want to do is put a hold on these colossal agribusiness \nmergers that are occurring on an almost daily basis. What we are saying \nis, let's pass legislation that puts some competition back into the \nfood industry, that gives our family farmers, our producers a chance. \nBut until we do that, let's take a timeout so we can put a stop to some \nof these colossal agribusiness mergers that are taking place at a \nbreathtaking pace every single day.\n  This amendment also is intended to create an incentive for the \nCongress to develop a more comprehensive solution on an expedited \nbasis.\n  Last week, if my colleagues need any evidence, the Wall Street \nJournal reported that Novartis and Monsanto, two of the largest \nagribusiness giants, may be merging. The Journal accurately states:\n\n       . . . the industry landscape seems to be changing every \n     day.\n\n  In fact, the ground is constantly shifting beneath our feet, and soon \nit is going to be too late to do anything about it. That is exactly why \nwe need a timeout. These mergers build momentum for more mergers, and \nthese large companies are all saying that we have no other choice, \ngiven what is going on right now, but to merge and get bigger and \nbigger and bigger. Just imagine what the effect of a merger between \nMonsanto and Novartis would mean. It would obviously put more pressure \non more firms to join in on one of these emerging handful of food chain \nclusters that are poised to control our agricultural markets.\n  This timeout we are proposing today is intended to lessen those \npressures and to arrest this trend before it is too late. That is what \nthis is all about. This amendment is all about whether or not our \nproducers are going to have a chance. This is an amendment that is all \nabout whether or not rural communities are going to be able to make it. \nThis amendment is all about whether or not farmers are going to be able \nto get a decent price. When you are at an auction and you are trying to \nsell something and you only have three buyers, you are not going to get \nmuch of a price. That is exactly what is happening in agriculture \ntoday.\n  This is all about competition. This is all about America. This is all \nabout Jeffersonian tradition and whether or not Senators are on the \nside of family farmers or whether they are on the side of these large \nconglomerates. We have horizontal concentration taking place. Whether \nwe are looking at the beef packers or at pork or grain or whether we \nare looking at every single sector, we have four companies that control \n50, 60, 70 percent of the market. That is not competition. Economics \n101: It is oligopoly, at best, when you have four firms that control \nover 50 percent of the market.\n  The scarier thing is the vertical integration. When one firm expands \nits control over various stages of food production, from the \ndevelopment of the animal or plant gene to production of fertilizer and \nchemical inputs, to actual production, to processing, to marketing and \ndistribution to the supermarket shelf, is that the brave new world of \nagriculture we want to see? That is exactly the trend we are \nexperiencing today.\n  I quote an April 1999 report by the Minnesota Land Stewardship \nProject. I think it is right on the mark:\n\n       Packers' practice of acquiring captive supplies through \n     contracts and direct ownership is reducing the number of \n     opportunities for small- and medium-sized farmers to sell \n     their hogs;\n\n  As a matter of fact, our hog producers are facing extinction, and \nthese packers are in hog heaven. We want to know, who is making the \nmoney? How can it be that these corporate agribusinesses are making \nrecord profits while our producers are going under?\n  The Land Stewardship Project goes on to say:\n\n       With fewer buyers and more captive supply, there is less \n     competition for independent\n\n[[Page S14658]]\n\n     farmers' hogs and insufficient market information regarding \n     price; and lower prices result.\n\n  Leland Swensen, president of the National Farmers Union, recently \ntestified:\n\n       The increasing level of market concentration, with the \n     resulting lack of competition in the marketplace, is one of \n     the top concerns of farmers and ranchers. At most farm and \n     ranch meetings, market concentration ranks as either the \n     first or second priority of issues of concern. Farmers and \n     ranchers believe that lack of competition is a key factor in \n     the low commodity prices they are receiving. So our \n     corporate agribusinesses grow fat, and our farmers are \n     facing lean times.\n\n  I wasn't born yesterday. I understand what has been going on since we \nintroduced this amendment. I know the folks who have been making the \ncalls. We are up against some of the largest agribusinesses, some of \nthe largest multinational corporations, some of the largest \nconglomerates you could ever be up against.\n  Let us talk about this very practical and modest proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). As requested by the Senator, he \nhas used his first 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  First, the standard we use is the standard that now exists under the \nClayton Act, which is whether or not a merger may be substantially to \nlessen competition or tend to create a monopoly. Second, we are talking \nabout the largest mergers in which both parties have annual net \nrevenues over $100 million. This is not small business--both parties \nwith annual revenues over $100 million.\n  Third, some of my colleagues were concerned about the possibility of \nfacing financial insolvency. We address the problem. In this amendment \nis language which makes it clear that the Attorney General would have \nthe authority to waive this moratorium in extraordinary circumstances, \nsuch as financial insolvency or similar financial distress. We have \nanother waiver authority which goes to the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Some colleagues said, what about mergers and acquisitions that \nactually are procompetitive? What we are going to do is to say, under \nmodification, that USDA could waive the moratorium for deals that don't \nincrease concentration to levels that are determined to be detrimental \nto family farmers. This moratorium or timeout won't even take effect \nfor 18 months because presumably we are going to act earlier.\n  We have to do something about this merger mania. We have to do \nsomething about getting some competition back into the food industry. \nWe have to do something that is on the side of family farmers. This \ntimeout, with all of the provisions we have which make it so \nreasonable--and we are still in negotiation with our colleague from \nIowa, who I know cares fiercely about this--ought to lead to an \namendment that should generate widespread support.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment by the Senator from Minnesota that would impose an 18-month \nmoratorium on mergers in the food processing industry. While I oppose \nthis amendment, I understand Senator Wellstone's motivation in offering \nit. I share his concern over the rapid vertical and horizontal \nintegration in the food processing industry and the effect this trend \nmay have had on family farmers.\n  The livestock industry for beef cattle and hogs has experienced low \nprices for too long. In fact, the price for live hogs recently reached \nits lowest level since the Great Depression. Family farms are the \nbackbone of our rural communities, yet family farms are failing. \nFarmers now receive 36 percent less for their products than they did 15 \nyears ago. Mr. President, there are not many other honest, hardworking \nAmericans who can say that their salaries have gone down by 36 percent \nover the last decade. Some farmers have complained that the \nconcentration within the industry has restricted their choice of buyers \nfor their products.\n  Many factors have contributed to the troubles farmers have faced \nrecently--consolidation within the food processing industry may not be \nthe sole cause of these troubles, though I recognize it could well be a \ncause. The recent rate of consolidation, however, is a concern to me, \nand for this reason I recently pledged a full and comprehensive review \nof this matter by the full Senate Judiciary Committee. We need to look \nat the entire spectrum of the food industry to explore the extent to \nwhich consolidation within the industry is adversely affecting family \nfarmers. We also need to examine whether existing antitrust statutes \nare being adequately enforced and whether any changes to federal law \nare warranted.\n  While I sympathize with the amendment offered by Senator Wellstone, I \nam afraid that it does nothing to shed further light on the matter. Not \nonly does the amendment fail to address the heart of the matter, it may \neven do more harm than good for our farmers. We cannot possibly \nunderstand all of the implications of placing an 18-month moratorium on \nagribusiness mergers. It is very likely, Mr. President, that smaller \nfood processing plants will rely on mergers with larger processors if \nthey are to survive. Placing a moratorium on mergers could actually \ncause smaller firms to go out of business. In such a case, this \namendment would surely stop a merger, but putting a smaller firm out of \nbusiness is a less desirable outcome than allowing mergers to go \nforward. Many of these smaller processors are actually owned by \nfarmers.\n  We cannot afford to lose our family farms in this country, and I \nthink everyone recognizes that. Let us deal with this issue \npragmatically. Let us get to the bottom of this problem. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this amendment. We should first allow the \nJudiciary Committee to fully examine these issues and prudently \ndetermine what effect, if any, consolidation in the industry has on the \nplight of the family farmer. The type of market interference proposed \nby this amendment is simply wrong and I urge my colleagues to reject \nit.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make some additional remarks regarding \nconcentration in the food processing industry. I have been as concerned \nabout concentration in the food processing industry as any Member of \nthis body. My concern over the concentration in the food processing \nindustry led me to break the logjam on the Livestock Concentration \nReport Act in the 104th Congress and get it through the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the full Senate.\n  My concern over concentration in the processing industry led me to \nintroduce the Interstate Distribution of State-Inspected Meat Act of \n1997 in the 105th Congress. This bill would have helped to shore up and \nenhance competition in the meatpacking industry.\n  My concern over this issue led me to pass an amendment in the fiscal \nyear 1999 Agriculture appropriations bill that required the USDA to \nproduce a proposal with regard to the interstate distribution issue. I \nam also considering legislation, along with Senator Daschle, to codify \nthe USDA's proposal, which goes even further toward shoring up \ncompetition in the meatpacking industry.\n  Finally, I have recently unveiled my plan for the Judiciary Committee \nto provide a full and comprehensive review of the concentration issue. \nSo far, we have had some excellent studies on this issue. Here is just \na small sampling of the many studies already completed with regard to \nconsolidation in the food processing industry:\n  (1) A GAO Report entitled: ``Packers and Stockyards Administration: \nOversight of Livestock Market Competitiveness Needs to Be Enhanced'' \n(October 1991).\n  (2) ``Concentration in Agriculture: A Report of the USDA Advisory \nCommittee on Agricultural Concentration'' (June 1996).\n  (3) A USDA report entitled: ``Concentration in the Red Meat Packing \nIndustry'' (February 1996).\n  (4) A GAO report entitled: ``Packers and Stockyards Program: USDA's \nResponse to Studies on Concentration in the Livestock Industry'' (April \n1997).\n  (5) A report of the USDA Officer of Inspector General entitled: \n``Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration: Evaluation \nof Agency Efforts to Monitor and Investigate Anti-competitive Practices \nin the Meatpacking Industry'' (February 1997).\n  I believe the next step is not another study. The next step is to \nexamine whether existing antitrust statutes are being adequately \nenforced and whether\n\n[[Page S14659]]\n\nany changes to Federal law are warranted to help remedy the situation. \nI suggest that a moratorium on mergers has the potential for causing \nmore harm than good. A moratorium is not an issue that has been \nstudied, and frankly, the unintended consequences could be that some \nprocessors are forced to go out of business due to the ban on mergers. \nThis would have exactly the opposite effect that we are hoping for. I \nmight add, that farmers from my State who have been very concerned \nabout the concentration issue have also expressed their opposition to \nthe Wellstone amendment, for this reason.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by my friend Senator Wellstone. Let me explain both why I \nsupport this amendment and why my support is somewhat qualified.\n  On the one hand, I agree that agricultural concentration is a problem \nwhich increasingly undermines the viability of family farms and \nnegatively affects the well-being of our agricultural communities. On \nour Antitrust Subcommittee, we have watched with growing concern the \nwave of agricultural mergers and joint ventures in agriculture that \nhave reduced the marketing options available to producers, and which \nmay ultimately reduce--or may already have reduced--the prices they \nreceive from the marketplace. While these merging corporations often \ncontend that the mergers will result in better service for farmers and \ncost-savings for consumers, it's unclear whether that is true. And \nfarmers face continued pressures from giant conglomerates against whom \nthey have little bargaining power.\n  But, on the other hand, I am concerned that a blanket ban against all \nagricultural mergers would prevent those mergers that are pro-\ncompetitive as well as those that are undesirable. In addition, \nsingling out a particular industry for merger moratoria, I fear, will \nlead to other calls for similar ``carve-outs.''\n  Perhaps a better way to address the problem of consolidation in the \nagricultural industry is do what the administration has already \npromised. The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department has given me \na commitment that it will appoint a Special Counsel for agricultural \nantitrust issues--and it should do so expeditiously. This official will \nhelp ensure that agribusiness mergers no longer are a poor stepsister \nto mergers in the computer, telecom, finance, and media industries.\n  Mr. President, in moving a measure such as this one, we need to take \ncare that we do not harm the very people we are trying to help. But \nuntil we see real signs that the administration is prepared to \nseriously scrutinize concentration in the agricultural industry, this \napproach is preferable to no action at all.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will vote against the Wellstone-Dorgan \nagribusiness merger moratorium because I believe the solution to this \nproblem is not a temporary moratorium. Instead, the Department of \nJustice should enforce the anti-trust laws that now exist to prevent \nthe problems arising from industry concentration. That's why, last \nFebruary, I signed a letter to the President, along with 22 of my \ncolleagues, urging the administration to conduct a full-scale detailed \nexamination of the impacts of market concentration on our nation's \nfamily farmers and ranchers. We requested that the study be completed \nwithin six months and the findings reported to Congress. We have yet to \nreceive that study. I will continue to press the Department of Justice \nto exercise particular diligence in reviewing proposed mergers or \nacquisitions involving major agribusiness firms.\n  Our family farmers and ranchers need and deserve our full support. I \nhave worked hard to provide emergency funding in times of natural \ndisaster, and to address the economic disasters created by trade and \nworld economic conditions. I am working to reform the federal crop \ninsurance program to address the needs of specialty crop producers. And \nI will continue to advocate for full adherence to existing anti-trust \nlaws, and the procedures for investigating market concentration in \nagriculture.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senator \nWellstone's amendment. I know that my friend and colleague from \nMinnesota is proposing this amendment with the welfare of America's \nfamily farmer in mind. I, too, think of America's family farmer, but I \nhave concerns that placing a moratorium on agribusiness mergers and \nacquisitions now may do more harm in my State than good. This is an \nimportant issue and I commend Senator Hatch's willingness to hold \nhearings on this matter in the Antitrust Subcommittee. We need to have \nthe time to carefully consider how agribusiness mergers and \nacquisitions affect America's producers.\n  I am very proud of the farmers in my State. Arkansas ranks in the top \n10 rice, chicken, catfish, turkey, cotton, sorghum, eggs, and soybean \nproducing States in America. Despite their productivity, there are \nfewer this season than last season. An ailing national agriculture \neconomy has pushed many farmers to the breaking point. I visited 27 \ncounties in Arkansas over the August recess and saw the strain on their \nfaces and heard the frustration in their voices. Their deep concern for \nthe future of farming comes from knowing that agriculture is the \nlifeblood of my State's economy.\n  Arkansas is dominated by small farms and cooperatives, but Arkansas \nis also home to national processors like Tyson Foods. I do not believe \nthat we should trade the interests of one for another. Instead, we must \ndevelop a balanced policy that will help small farmers and not penalize \nthose companies which are helping drive my State's agriculture \nrecovery. In many communities, these cooperatives and agribusinesses \nare the foundation of the farm economy in that area. Right now, many of \nthose communities are still hurting. That is why I am more concerned \nabout the overall survivability of the cooperatives and agribusinesses \nin Arkansas than the possibility that some of them may someday decide \nto merge with a larger entity. In reality, if an agribusiness in \nArkansas is struggling to stay alive, and Senator Wellstone's \nmoratorium on agribusiness mergers and acquisitions is imposed, that \ngreatly limits an ailing business' ability to sell to survive. In other \nwords, if the owners of an agribusiness have only two choices to \nsurvive--either sell or declare bankruptcy--and the option to sell is \ndenied, then their going out of business doesn't help anyone.\n  While America's farmers are slowly recovering from low commodity \nprices, high production costs and poor trade, I believe now is not the \ntime to destabilize agribusinesses in Arkansas. On the other hand, I \nknow that producers in many farm states have serious concerns about the \nimpact larger agribusinesses, especially the meat processing industry, \nhave on their ability to recover from poor prices. Let me be clear, I \ndo not advocate inaction, but I am concerned that producers and \nprocessors in my state, both large and small, may be unintentionally \nharmed by the Wellstone amendment.\n  Many meat processing agribusinesses in Arkansas provide stability for \nproducers and have good working relationships with them. Because most \nof their producers work under contract, both the agribusinesses and \nproducers suffer when prices are low. Tyson Foods, known for their \npoultry processing, is involved in raising hogs. As the price for hogs \nbegan to fall, Tyson felt the financial strain of production without \nthe ability to process. In the mind of Tyson's contract pork producers, \nthe company's situation had reached a critical level when they received \nletters telling them that sustained low hog prices were forcing Tyson \nto only offer 30-day contracts. Producers were left wondering how they \nwould pay off debt and survive if Tyson could not renew their \ncontracts. Recently, Smithfield announced that it will be taking over \nTyson's Pork Group, effectively stabilizing the future of Tyson's \ncontract producers. Unlike Tyson who only raised hogs, Smithfield has \nthe capacity to both raise and process their livestock.\n  Clearly, if Senator Wellstone's moratorium on mergers and \nacquisitions was in pace at the time of the Smithfield acquistion of \nTyson's Pork Group, contract producers would still be living under a \ncloud of uncertainty in an ailing hog market. With that in mind, I \nencourage my colleagues to vote against the Wellstone amendment so that \nSenator Hatch may be afforded\n\n[[Page S14660]]\n\nthe time to thoroughly address the impact agribusiness mergers and \nacquisitions are having on the American family farmer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we only have 20 additional minutes to \ndebate this. There will be a vote this morning.\n  I have always had the greatest respect for my colleague from Oregon. \nI think he is a really excellent Senator and a good thinker. On this \nissue, the purpose of our being here is about competition. I don't \nthink anyone can dispute that family farmers have been squeezed by a \nsystem in which highly concentrated industries are taking more of the \nprofits, saying we want more of the profits and we want to give family \nfarmers less profits. That is not a sign of good competition; it \nhappens because these industries have the economic power to do it.\n  I taught economics briefly. Some would suggest you are not fit for \nother work when you have done that. But I have gone on nonetheless. \nEconomists will argue this both ways. I understand that. But there is a \ncommonsense aspect to this.\n  Harry Truman used to say that nobody should be President who first \ndoesn't know about hogs. The Senator from Minnesota talked about hogs \nand concentration in the hog industry. Hogs are just one. Beef, \ngrains--in every single area, industries are more and more \nconcentrated, choking the economic life out of the little guy, out of \nthe little producer. Why? Because they can. They want to increase their \nprofits, increase their size, and choke the life out of family farmers. \nOur point is, that is not free, fair, and open competition. That is not \na marketplace that is working.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will yield on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Of course.\n  For the record, no one should be President who doesn't know something \nabout green peas either.\n  In all seriousness, I understand what the Senator is saying. I think \nwhat the Wellstone amendment, hopefully, is doing--if it does not pass \ntoday, I hope it has the Justice Department going to work on this \nissue. In my view, what we don't need is more layers of second-guessing \nthe marketplace from the Department of Agriculture.\n  We already have a system of antitrust laws. They need to enforce \nthem, and there are serious problems of too heavy a concentration. I \njust simply tell you that I have seen, in my own experience, when these \ncompanies get too big, they create companies coming up behind them. It \nhappens time and time again--for the little guy to become a big guy. It \nhappens also on the farm, as a small family farm. Now you have huge \ncorporate farms.\n  It is a process of the marketplace working. Usually, when we \nintervene in these ways, we do it incorrectly, bluntly, ineffectively, \nand we end up hurting the people we are trying to help. I believe we \nhave laws that ought to be employed and, if they are employed, the \nconcerns of the Senators from the Great Plains will be addressed, and \nthey should be addressed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This little guy/big guy notion of economics reminds me of \nthe old parable that the lion and lamb may lie down together but the \nlamb isn't going to get much sleep. That is also true in economics. It \nis certainly true in this economy. The little interests are \ndisappearing. That is true of agriculture. Family farmers are having \nthe life choked out of them by the concentration in industries which \nthey have the muscle to say: We want more of our food dollar coming \nfrom that bread, and we want you to have less. That is what they are \nsaying to family farmers.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I have 5 minutes at the \nvery end to summarize this because we may make some changes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will watch the time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I have 5 minutes at the end? Otherwise, my time \nwill burn off.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the leadership has suggested to \nme they want an up-or-down vote on this. If there are amendments that \nthe Senator has, he would very much like those to be a part of the \nhearing that Senator Hatch already announced will be occurring in the \nnext session of this Congress.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would like that. I don't want to have all my time \nburned up. I would like to have 5 minutes at the end.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in my concluding 30 seconds, I will say \nthat the Jeffersonian notion of how this system ought to work is broad-\nbased economic ownership. That is what Thomas Jefferson envisioned--\nbroad-based economic ownership in this country which not only \nguarantees economic freedom but political freedom as well.\n  The point is, the concentration that is occurring is unhealthy, \nespecially in agriculture, because it is choking the life out of family \nfarmers. We are talking simply about a timeout here.\n  When I talked about Harry Truman's description of hogs, incidentally, \nthat would have lost its luster had he said that nobody should become \nPresident without first knowing about green peas. He was talking about \nhogs because he was talking about broad-based economic ownership on \nAmerica's family farms. He had it just right. That is what we are \ntrying to get back to with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 4 minutes 59 \nseconds remaining on his time.\n  Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, it will have to be subtracted from both sides \nof the debate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the unanimous consent I am asking for \nis whether or not, if the other side is not going to use the time, I \ncould reserve for the end when we run out of time the final 4 minutes \n59 seconds to summarize this because I am waiting for Senator Grassley. \nWe have been involved in negotiations. I would like to summarize where \nwe are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I want to say, in a larger sense, \nif we can single out agribusiness in this way for sort of super-\nantitrust treatment, if you will, we can single out any industry. I \nhave noticed, in my 3 years as a Senator, we have sort of a merry-go-\nround of unpopular businesses in this country and we pick them off one \nat a time. I am very concerned about this process of intervening in a \nmarketplace that works because there are winners and losers in the \nmarketplace. Agriculture is a very difficult industry. I don't know the \nprofits of these big food processors. I, frankly, don't know most of \nthese kinds of industries. Most of the food processors I think of may \nactually have revenues of $100 million. But that is sales; that doesn't \nmean profit. They may have losses of $110 million. I don't know. I \ndon't see their books.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, let me be clear again. I want to tell \nthe Senator that there are two very important, if you will, safety \nvalves. One has to do with the very point he just made. If, in fact, a \nbusiness says, look, we will be insolvent if we don't do this \nacquisition or merger, then they will get a waiver to do that. I want \nto make that clear, as to what this is and is not. That might get you \nsupport. I think there are provisions in here that are important.\n  Second, this is just a timeout; that is all this is. This comes from \nsome pretty solid empirical evidence about the wave of mergers. And, \nagain, three or four firms dominate well over 50 percent of the market \nand its effect on producers.\n  Finally, I do believe that, again, if USDA uses this criterion, it \ncan also be a second safety valve that says, look, in this particular \ncase, this acquisition or merger would be procompetitive given the \nsituation. That would be another way.\n  So we are trying to deal with the most extreme of circumstances. This \nis\n\n[[Page S14661]]\n\neminently reasonable. It is a cooling off; it is a message from the \nSenate that we care about what is going on out there. We want to have \nmore free enterprise built into the system. This is pro-free \nenterprise, pro-competition. We don't have the competition now.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to talk \nso the American people can hear this. The problem we are talking about \nis that, for agriculture, we are not going to create just an antitrust \ndivision that ought to be going to work every day evaluating these \nthings, but now we are going to create a whole new role for USDA to \nmake judgments about the marketplace. I don't trust Government to make \nthose judgments about the marketplace; I really don't. I think we mess \nit up more than we help it. So I really don't think that satisfies my \nconcern.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield again, let me be clear about \nthis on two issues. First of all, if it weren't for the wave of mergers \nand this breathtaking consolidation of power--and then we look at the \nSherman Act and the Clayton Act and wonder what is going on here--we \nwould not even be talking about a timeout. That is the only reason we \nare doing this. I don't think anybody can deny the reality of what \nhappened.\n  Second, the USDA would only be involved if a company said: Listen, we \nwould like to get a waiver from this timeout period. It is only if a \ncompany makes the request or a company says: Look, we would like to get \na waiver from this timeout period. We are big, but we need to be \ninvolved in this acquisition or merger and it will actually be \nprocompetitive. We are just trying to give a company a place to go.\n\n  So, with all due respect, it is not the kind of Government \ninvolvement my colleague fears. There does come a point in time in the \nrich history of our country where public power is there. Where is Teddy \nRoosevelt when we need him today? That is all this is, a cooling-off \nperiod to give us incentive, I say to my colleague from Oregon, to \nwrite some laws and do something that will put the competition back in \nplace, so our producers have a chance.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am \nall for the rules Teddy Roosevelt created. If they were enforced, we \nwould not need to develop more Government.\n  I guess I would understand the Senator's amendment more if he didn't \nexempt agricultural cooperatives. I don't understand that. It is a \ndifferent forum of how you do agribusiness. It is farmer-owned. But, \nfrankly, it is unfair to other farmers who do not process for nonfarmer \ncooperatives. I just think if it is good for the goose, it is good for \nthe gander. But it is not in this amendment. It is unfair, and it isn't \nright. Treat them all the same or, frankly, let's defeat this \namendment. I sincerely hope the Senate will not interfere in the \nmarketplace as proposed by this amendment. Allow the Judiciary \nCommittee to go forward and hold its hearings, and let's ask the \nantitrust department and Justice Department to go to work and enforce \nthe laws we already have.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed for 3 minutes, not to come out of the time that has been \nestablished for this bill, realizing that would make the vote 3 minutes \nlater--just to let people know where we are on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just so that colleagues on both sides will \nknow, last week, and again yesterday for that matter, we made more \nprogress on this bill.\n  We have been able to clear 27 amendments to improve the Bankruptcy \nReform Act. Those are amendments offered by both Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  Senator Torricelli, Senator Harry Reid, and I have been working in \ngood faith with Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch to clear amendments. \nWe have been able to do that, and we will try to clear even more.\n  I am pleased, on a personal point, that the majority accepted my \namendment regarding the mandate to file tax returns under the bill. \nThat will save $24 million over the next 5 years. But there are a lot \nof amendments similar to this that have improved it.\n  Senator Torricelli and I are working together with the deputy \nDemocratic leader, and we are preparing to enter a unanimous consent \nrequest to limit the remaining Democratic amendments to 27 amendments. \nFifteen of these have already been offered to the bill and are the \npending business. All 27 were filed by November 5. Most of these are \ngoing to have very short time agreements. Many will be accepted. From a \ntotal of 320 amendments that were filed by both Republicans and \nDemocrats on November 5, the managers of the bill on both sides have \nboiled down the remaining Democratic and Republican amendments to about \n35--from 320 to 35.\n  Many of them are going to be acceptable either with modifications or \nin the present form. The remaining ones are critical to the debate on \nthis bill.\n  Remember that for the first time in our Nation's history this bill \nwould restrict the rights of Americans to file for bankruptcy based on \nthe debtor's income. If we are going to adopt a means-tested bankruptcy \nlaw, we should have a full and fair debate on that. The American people \nwould ask for nothing more.\n  The credit card industry is going to get billions out of this and \nshould have to bear some responsibilities for its lax lending \npractices. We have heard a lot of stories about 5-year-olds getting \ncredit cards in the mail with a multi-thousand-dollar limit.\n  Then we have the Truth in Lending Act on here.\n  I would like to get as close to a fair and balanced bill as we passed \nlast year.\n  But we have come to the floor to offer amendments. We had only 4 \nhours of debate on Monday, and a disrupted day yesterday with caucuses \nand other things. But we have moved very quickly on this. We have \ndisposed of 35 amendments with only 8 rollcalls.\n  I urge Senators to move forward. The leaders are trying to move \nforward.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing me to break in to bring people up \nto date.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send a modification to my amendment \nto the desk and ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified. I \nwill explain the two provisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It takes unanimous consent.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Reserving the right to object, I certainly don't \nmind the Senator offering an explanation of the amendment. But I have \nbeen asked by the majority leader and Senator Hatch to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would appreciate it before we have \nthis vote. My colleagues were with Senator Lott when I was very \ninvolved in the unanimous consent agreement as to which amendments were \ngoing to come up and how we were going to deal with nonrelevant \namendments.\n  Senator Daschle asked Senator Lott. I was right out here on the \nfloor. In fact, I had made the request that if, in fact, we weren't \nchanging the meaning or the scope of our amendment, but we were going \nto make a correction, we would be able to do that. Senator Lott said if \nthis didn't change the meaning of the amendment, or the scope of it, \nthen, of course, that would be all right.\n  This is not a different amendment. This is in violation, or I would \nnever have agreed to this unanimous consent agreement. All we are doing \nis listening to colleagues who have said there should be $10 million to \n$100 million on both parties. We think that would make a big difference \nfrom the point of view of small businesses, and at least give \nbusinesses another place where they can go if they believe their merger \nor acquisition is not procompetitive.\n  Those are the two changes. I cannot believe that now I am being told \nI can't do this. This was a part of the unanimous consent agreement. I \nwas on the floor. I will get the Congressional Record out of the \nexchange.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If the Senator will yield, I was not a part of \nthat\n\n[[Page S14662]]\n\nagreement. I know what I have been told by the majority leader and by \nSenator Hatch. Whether the scope is narrowed or not, the principle is \nthe same. If there is an invasion of the free enterprise system, it \npotentially penalizes all the farmers who rely upon the stock-owned \ncompanies in advantage of a few others.\n  I think that is the wrong way to do it. We have some laws. I think \nthey need to be enforced. But this is too blunt of an instrument. If \nyou want to help farmers, this is not the way to do it. If you want to \nhelp farmers, you go after the regulations that are strangling them. \nYou open up the international markets. And, yes, you enforce antitrust \nlaws. But you don't create a regulation that interferes in a very blunt \nfashion with the free enterprise system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me try this again. My colleague can \nobject to the amendment. But that is a different issue. That is a \ndifferent issue. I now come to the floor with a modification. When we \ncame up with this original unanimous consent agreement, the majority \nleader made it crystal clear in an exchange with the minority leader--I \nwas out here on the floor--if we wanted to have a technical correction \nin our bill and it was not changing the scope or meaning, that it \nwould, of course, be all right. Now you are denying me my right to make \nthat modification. Why are you afraid of a modification? I am just a \nlittle bit outraged by this. I was here. I was on the floor. I know \nwhat was discussed. I know what the majority leader said.\n\n  I also believe if my colleagues want to have an up-or-down vote, \nfine. But you ought to give me the right to make a modification to my \namendment that I think would make this a stronger and a better \namendment.\n  I want to send the amendment to the desk again. Did I send it? Do you \nalready have it?\n  I appeal to the Senator to please not object to my unanimous consent \nrequest to modify my amendment with what I have sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A modification is not in order without \nunanimous consent.\n  Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to modify my \namendment, which is exactly what we agreed to in terms of how we deal \nwith these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleagues are afraid to have a vote \nand an honest debate on what we are talking about, and this is a \nviolation of the agreement that we made when we talked about how to \nproceed.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am in no way questioning what \nthe Senator was saying. I wasn't a party to the agreement he was \ntalking about. What I am objecting to is the principle, whether it is a \nlittle or a lot. What I am saying is we have the laws to fix these \nkinds of problems. The Justice Department ought to go to work, and we \nought not to be intervening in the agricultural marketplace in this \nway.\n  If you want to help farmers, help them with their water rights, help \nthem with their labor problems, help them with closed international \nmarkets, help them with subsidies, and help them with a whole range of \nthings we do in great abundance around here. But, frankly, get off \ntheir air hose when it comes to regulation. They are being strangled by \nregulation. This is not the way to help farmers; therefore, I object on \nmy own basis--not on the basis of Senator Lott or any other leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under regular order, the amendment cannot be \nmodified without unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator for 1 minute for \nthe purpose of making an inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand the point made by the Senator from Oregon.\n  First of all, I was not here during the discussion on the floor. So I \nam not someone who can describe what happened during that discussion. \nBut if the Senator from Minnesota is correct--and he may well be--that, \nin fact, the majority leader made representations, I think he would not \nwant to abridge them at this point. I think it is a matter of finding \nthe record; the majority leader has always acted in good faith to honor \nan agreement he made on the floor.\n\n  Before denying the opportunity to the Senator from Minnesota, we \nought to get that record and find out to what the majority leader \nagreed. I am certain what he agreed to then he would agree to today. If \nhe agreed to allow a modification, the Senator from Minnesota should be \nallowed to pursue that modification.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I don't want to deny the Senator from Minnesota \nhis chance to modify his amendment on the basis of an agreement he had \nwith the leader. I don't want to not pursue an issue this important \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend?\n  The Senator from North Dakota made a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The clerk will \ncontinue to call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue to \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative assistant continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I want to find \nout from the Chair whether or not I can amend, provide direction to my \namendment without requiring unanimous consent; whether I have a right \nto do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the Senate rules, the Senator cannot do \nthat.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have how much time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have said it all, along with Senator \nDorgan, about the why of this amendment and how important it is for our \nproducers, how important it is to take a timeout so we can have some \ncompetition, how important it is to farmers and rural communities. \nGiven the ruling of the Chair, I want to be crystal clear as to what \nhas now happened.\n  I wanted to come to the floor of the Senate--it was my understanding \nI would be able to do so, but I have been told I would not be able to \ndo so--and improve upon this amendment in the spirit of compromise.\n  Some colleagues are concerned about this timeout and they said: Why \ndon't we have companies with $100 million. And the other threshold for \nan acquisition merger would be $100 million as well. They would be more \ncomfortable with that. I wanted to provide this direction to my \namendment to improve upon it. I wanted to compromise.\n  I was also told by some colleagues they are a little worried that \nduring this cooling off period, maybe some of the acquisitions and \nmergers would be procompetitive. I worked very hard to have some very \nspecific language which would enable such a company to go to USDA and \nsay: Listen, this would be procompetitive. And USDA, based upon clear \ncriteria, would say: You are right.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate today as a Senator from the State \nof Minnesota to try to modify my amendment. It is very clear what the \nmodification would be. Based upon discussions with other Senators, in \nthe spirit of compromise, so we can at least move\n\n[[Page S14663]]\n\nthis forward and provide a message to our producers that we care, so \nthat some Senators who may now have to vote against this because of \ntheir concerns would be able to support it so we can actually adopt \nsomething that will make a difference, I am told I do not have the \nright to modify my amendment.\n  Also--this is my final point because I cannot help but be a little \nbit angry about this--the majority leader came to me last week when \nSenators wanted to leave. We were scheduled to have a debate, and we \nwere scheduled to have a vote. The idea was, to enable people to leave, \nwe would hold this over, and I said yes. It is not as if I have waited \nto the last minute. We could have had negotiations then. We have just \ncome back to this.\n  I must say to my colleague from Oregon and others, I am skeptical \nabout this. It is pretty rare that a Senator cannot come to the floor \nand modify his amendment. Whatever the procedural ruling is, it seems \nto me it is crystal clear what is going on. I wanted to modify it. I \nwanted to compromise. I wanted to make an amendment that would generate \nmore support, maybe even adopt it, and I have been denied the \nopportunity to do so. That is very unfortunate.\n  It is about time my colleagues gave some serious thought to being on \nthe side of some of the interests in our country that do not have all \nthe money and are not so well connected and such big investors and do \nnot have such power. When my colleagues start with that, think about \nthe producers and the people who live in our rural communities because \nright now we are seeing merger mania. We are seeing a lack of \ncompetition. We need to go back, I guess, to Teddy Roosevelt politics. \nIt is a shame I have been denied the right to provide direction to my \namendment or a modification to my amendment which would have been a \ngood compromise.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, other than I do not have strong \nfeelings about any of it, I will not take the last 25 seconds. I feel \ntoo strongly to say anything more in the last 25 seconds. It is rare \nthat a Senator cannot modify his amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2752. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) \nand the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich) are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 27, nays 71, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 366 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--27\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Moynihan\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--71\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     McCain\n     Voinovich\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2752) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2663\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 2663.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this amendment retains existing \nbankruptcy law for low-income persons. A feature of the law as it now \nexists and which is perfectly sensible is the presumption that people \nwho incur debt shortly before declaring bankruptcy have acted \nfraudulently. Clearly, this can be the case, is often the case, and is \nproven so.\n  However, the bill presently before the Senate extends the time (from \n60 days to 90 days for consumer debts, for instance) in which this \npresumption of fraudulent activity takes place, and it changes the \ndollar amounts. We propose to keep the law as it is for low-income \npersons--people below the median income level, who already live hand-\nto-mouth, who often find themselves in a bind, with no intent to \ndefraud, and keep borrowing until they are in bankruptcy situations. \nThey won't have lawyers and can't defend against presumptions.\n  We simply keep the existing law. Deal with true fraud and important \nbankruptcies as the bill proposes to do but leave the small and hapless \nfolk to their small and hapless fortunes.\n  The administration supports this measure, as does my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and his associate in these \nmatters, Ms. Landrieu of Louisiana.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in its current form, the bankruptcy reform \nbill attempts to resolve a major area of bankruptcy abuse, known as \n``load up.'' In plain terms, load up occurs when a debtor goes on a \nspending spree shortly before filing for bankruptcy.\n  Under S. 625, limits are placed on a debtor's ability to buy luxury \ngoods and take out large cash advances on the eve of bankruptcy. The \nbill accomplishes this by creating a rebuttable presumption that \ncertain debts are not dischargeable. Specifically, the bill provides \nthat debts of more than $250 per credit card for luxury goods, that are \nincurred within 3 months of bankruptcy, and cash advances of more than \n$750, incurred within 70 days of bankruptcy, are presumed to be \nfraudulent and are non-dischargeable.\n  These provisions, while an improvement over current law, are by no \nmeans a solution to the load up problem. Debtors still essentially are \nfree to take out a cash advance of $750 and buy luxury goods valued at \n$250 on each of their credit cards before even the presumption of \nnondischargeability kicks in. It also is important to note that under \nthe bill, luxury goods specifically exclude ``goods or services \nreasonably necessary for the support or maintenance of the debtor or a \ndependent of the debtor.''\n  Many have complained that these provisions do not go far enough to \nclose the load up loophole. The amendment by the Senator from New York, \nin contrast, undermines the bill's modest anti-load up provisions by \napplying them only to those with income above the national median. \nSimply stated, the amendment would create an unjustified double \nstandard, with those who fall under the national median income being \npermitted to load up on luxury goods and cash advances before filing \nfor bankruptcy, as permitted by current law.\n  If we seriously intend to reform our bankruptcy laws and eliminate \nfraud in the system, we cannot let this major loophole continue without \nany reasonable limits.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment because it sets \nup a double standard which lets below median-income bankrupts load up \non debt on the eve of bankruptcy and then get those debts wiped away \nwithout judicial scrutiny. I know the Senator from New York is well-\nintentioned, but this amendment is a very bad idea.\n  Last night, the Senator from New York, in proposing his amendment, \ncorrectly noted that there is no evidence whatever that below median-\nincome debtors could ever pay a significant amount of their debts. We \nhave taken care of the problem the Senator from New York has raised by \ntotally exempting below median-income debtors from the means test. I \nthink that is fair and reasonable. It is a fact of life. It means the \npoor won't be forced into repayment plans they could never complete.\n\n[[Page S14664]]\n\n  However, this amendment raises an entirely different question. This \namendment isn't about whether the poor should be given a pass in terms \nof being forced to repay their debts. This amendment says people below \nthe median income can purchase over $1,000 in luxury goods, such as \nGucci loafers, and get over $1,000 in cash advances just minutes before \ndeclaring bankruptcy and they won't have to justify their debts to a \nbankruptcy judge.\n  This is not good bankruptcy policy. Anybody who loads up on debt on \nthe eve of bankruptcy should have to justify their debts. When it comes \nto suspicious and perhaps fraudulent behavior, we should treat everyone \nthe same, below median income or above median income. Anybody who loads \nup on debt right before filing for bankruptcy should have to explain \nthemselves; otherwise, we open the door to an obvious abuse.\n  Last week, we defeated the Dodd amendment which contained very \nsimilar provisions. I ask my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Is it in order for me to offer a second-degree \namendment that would preclude any purchase of Gucci loafers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be in order.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I so move.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator send the amendment to the \ndesk?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I made my point.\n  I withdraw my request.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I wish to have a brief word about the \nissue of recess appointments.\n  For quite some number of years, Presidents--Democrats and \nRepublicans--have, in my opinion, violated the Constitution by making \nrecess appointments. The Constitution is very explicit when it says \nthat recess appointments can only be made in the event the vacancy \noccurs during the recess. There is a reason for this, historically.\n  Back in the days when we were on horses and we had legislative \nsessions that might have lasted 1, 2, or 3 months, we found ourselves \nin recess more than we were in session. Therefore, on occasion it would \nbe necessary for the Secretary of State, who may have died in office--\nor when vacancies had occurred while we were in recess--to have to \nreappoint somebody. So we did. It made sense. But since that time--over \nthe last several years--that privilege has been abused. As I say, this \nis not just an abuse that takes place by Republican or Democrat \nPresidents; it is both of them equally.\n  Consequently, the Constitution, which says that the Senate has the \nprerogative of advice and consent, has been violated. It was put there \nfor checks and balances. It was put there for a very good reason. That \nreason is just as legitimate today as it was when our Founding Fathers \nput it in there; that is, the Senate should advise and consent to these \nappointments. It means we should actually be in on the discussion as \nwell as consenting to the decision the President has made by virtue of \nhis nomination.\n  In 1985, President Reagan was making a number of recess appointments \nthat, in my opinion, and in the opinion of most of the Democrats and \nRepublicans, was not in keeping with the Constitution. And certainly \nthe majority leader at that time--who was Senator Bob Byrd from West \nVirginia, the very distinguished Senator--made a request of the \nPresident not to make recess appointments. He extracted from him a \ncommitment in writing that he would not make recess appointments and, \nif it should become necessary because of extraordinary circumstances to \nmake recess appointments, that he would have to give the list to the \nmajority leader--who was, of course, Bob Byrd--in sufficient time in \nadvance that they could prepare for it either by agreeing in advance to \nthe confirmation of that appointment or by not going into recess and \nstaying in pro forma so the recess appointments could not take place.\n  In order to add some leverage to this, the majority leader, Senator \nByrd, said he would hold up all Presidential appointments until such \ntime as President Reagan would give him a letter agreeing to those \nconditions. The President did give him a letter. President Reagan gave \nhim a letter.\n  I will quote for you from within this letter. This was on October 18, \n1985. He said:\n\n       . . . prior to any recess breaks, the White House would \n     inform the Majority Leader and [the Minority Leader] of any \n     recess appointment which might be contemplated during such \n     recess. They would do so in advance sufficiently to allow the \n     leadership on both sides to perhaps take action to fill \n     whatever vacancies that might be imperative during such a \n     break.\n  This is exactly what we talked about. This is the reason President \nReagan agreed to this. He gave a letter to Senator Byrd. Senator Byrd \nwas satisfied.\n  Along came a recess last May or June, and the President did in fact \nappoint someone he had nominated long before the recess occurred--in \nfact, not just months but even more than a year before that--and who \nhad not complied with the necessary information in order to come up for \nconfirmation. In that case, President Clinton did in fact violate the \nintent of the appointment process in the advice and consent provision \nfound in the Constitution.\n  I wrote a letter to President Bill Clinton. My letter said exactly \nthe same thing the letter said from Bob Byrd to President Reagan in \n1985. It was worded the same way President Reagan's letter was worded. \nIt said: Unless you will give us a letter, I am going to personally put \na hold on all recess appointments.\n  The President started appointing people. And I put a hold on all of \nthem--it didn't make any difference; I put a hold on all nonmilitary \nappointments--until finally, I remember one time somebody said: Well, \nwe have a really serious problem because we can't get confirmation on \nthe President's nominee for Secretary of the Treasury. This could have \na dramatic adverse effect on the economy. The value of the dollar could \ngo down. All these things came into the picture. What are you going to \ndo about that? I said: I am not going to do anything, but you had \nbetter tell the President about that because it is serious. Finally, he \nagreed to it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all of these documents be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. The letter finally came on June 15, 1999. I will read one \nsentence out of that letter.\n\n       I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 \n     between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your \n     letter remains a fair and constructive framework which my \n     Administration will follow.\n\n  Once again, what is he following? He is saying, prior to any recess, \nthe White House will inform the majority leader and the minority leader \nof any recess appointments which might be contemplated during such \nrecess? Would they do so in advance sufficiently to allow leadership on \nboth sides to perhaps take action to fill whatever vacancies might be \nimperative during such break? He agreed to it.\n  I have not seen such a document, but I think in anticipation of the \nrecess we are going in, it is my understanding that the President \nmerely sent a list of some 150 nominees he has. Again, I didn't see it. \nIt was never officially received by the majority leader. It was sent \nback to the White House.\n  If he thinks this is a loophole in the commitment he made, it \ncertainly is not a loophole.\n  Anticipating that this President--who quite often does things he \ndoesn't say he is going to do and who quite often says things that \naren't true--is going to in fact have recess appointments, we wrote a \nletter. It is not just on my letterhead signed by me, but also I \nbelieve there are 16 other Senators saying that if you make recess \nappointments during the upcoming recess, which violates the spirit of \nyour agreement, we will respond by placing holds on all judicial \nnominees.\n\n       The result would be a complete breakdown in cooperation \n     between our two branches of government on this issue which \n     could prevent the confirmation of any such nominees next \n     year.\n\n\n[[Page S14666]]\n\n\n  I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding and that we don't go \ninto a recess with the President not understanding that we are very \nserious about that. It is not just me putting a hold on all judicial \nnominees for the remaining year of his term of service, but 16 other \nSenators have agreed to do that.\n  It would be very easy for the President to just go ahead and comply \nwith that agreement he has in his letter of June 15, 1999, rather than \nfeeling compelled to make judicial appointments during this recess.\n  I want to serve notice to make it very clear.\n  I received a letter from the President. He did not honor me with a \npersonal letter. It came from John Podesta, Chief of Staff to the \nPresident. Without reading the whole letter, because it is rather \nlengthy, it says that they might not comply with this.\n  I want to make sure it is abundantly clear without any doubt in \nanyone's mind in the White House--I will refer back to this document I \nam talking about right now--that in the event the President makes \nrecess appointments, we will put holds on all judicial nominations for \nthe remainder of his term. It is very fair for me to stand here and \neliminate any doubt in the President's mind of what we will do.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 1999.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I appreciate our conversation this \n     morning, and our mutual desire to come to an understanding \n     about recess appointments. We have often worked together to \n     help promote the smooth operation of the government, and I \n     believe that we can once again come to an agreement.\n       As you know, the recent recess appointment of the U.S. \n     Ambassador to Luxembourg has caused great concern to many \n     members of the Senate. I believe that it would be \n     constructive for us to reach an understanding in principle on \n     how we will now proceed to ensure that we avoid similar \n     sparring between the Executive Branch and the Senate in the \n     future.\n       I agree that we will use the understanding reached between \n     President Reagan and Senator Byrd in 1985, cited by your \n     Chief of Staff today. That understanding, described in the \n     Congressional Record of October 18, 1985, states ``. . . \n     prior to any recess breaks, the White House would inform the \n     Majority Leader and [the Minority Leader] of any recess \n     appointment which might be contemplated during such recess. \n     They would do so in advance sufficiently to allow the \n     leadership on both sides to perhaps take action to fill \n     whatever vacancies that might be imperative during such a \n     break.''\n       I believe that this is both a reasonable and a constructive \n     framework. Following this precedent will help us to proceed \n     in a cooperative and expeditious manner on future nominees.\n       Mr. President, I appreciate your stated desire to work with \n     me on this issue, and I look forward to hearing from you \n     soon.\n           Sincerely,\n     Trent Lott.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, June 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I was pleased to learn from your letter of \n     June 10 that you agree with my Chief of staff on the matter \n     of recess appointments. As Mr. Podesta indicated in his \n     letter to you, my Administration has made it a practice to \n     notify Senate leaders in advance of our intentions in this \n     regard, and this precedent will continue to be observed.\n       I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 \n     between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your \n     letter remains a fair and constructive framework, which my \n     Administration will follow. I also appreciate your view that \n     our nominees merit expeditious consideration through \n     bipartisan cooperation among Senators; I sincerely hope that \n     this spirit will prevail in the days to come.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 10, 1999.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write to urge your compliance with \n     the spirit of our recent agreement regarding recess \n     appointments and to inform you that there will be serious \n     consequences if you act otherwise.\n       If you do make recess appointments during the upcoming \n     recess which violate the spirit of our agreement, then we \n     will respond by placing holds on all judicial nominees. The \n     result would be a complete breakdown in cooperation between \n     our two branches of government on this issue which could \n     prevent the confirmation of any such nominees next year.\n       We do not want this to happen. We urge you to cooperate in \n     good faith with the Majority Leader concerning all \n     contemplated recess appointments.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jesse Helms, Wayne Allard, Michael Crapo, Michael B. \n           Enzi, Bob Smith, George Voinovich, Pete B. Domenici, \n           James M. Inhofe, Phil Gramm, Mitch McConnell, Craig \n           Thomas, Rod Grams, Tim Hutchinson, Conrad Burns, Chuck \n           Grassley, Richard Shelby.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, November 12, 1999.\n     Senator James Inhofe,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: Thank you for your recent letter of \n     November 10, 1999 on the need for cooperation between the \n     Legislative and Executive branches and the President's right \n     to recess appoint as defined by the Constitution.\n       We appreciate and thank the Senate, especially the Majority \n     and Minority Leaders, for the 84 confirmations from Wednesday \n     November 10, which includes eight republican nominees \n     recommended by the Majority Leader. These confirmations \n     reduce the number of nominees awaiting confirmation to 153 \n     for this year. While nominees wait an average of six months \n     to be confirmed, we thank you for confirming 62% of nominees \n     this year.\n       We look forward to working with you on the 153 remaining \n     nominees and new nominations this session and next session. \n     They are important to the public, because they include \n     nominations critical to the safety of our citizens and the \n     integrity of our criminal justice system (US Marshals, US \n     Attorneys and judges).\n       Compared with previous administrations, the President has \n     used his authority to make recess appointments infrequently. \n     President Reagan made 239 recess appointments. During \n     President Bush's four-year term, 78 persons were recess \n     appointed. We have made only 59 in 7 years, fewer than \n     President Bush in four years. Several of our recess \n     appointees have been republican nominees, done with the \n     cooperation of the Senate leadership.\n       Because of the importance of filling these positions and \n     pursuant to an agreement with the Majority Leader, we \n     continue to notify the Majority and Minority Leaders of any \n     effort the President may make a appoint temporarily a person \n     into a vacancy, while awaiting confirmation by the Senate.\n       We will continue to meet with the Majority Leader's Office \n     to accomplish our goal of confirming and appointing these \n     nominees. We want to cultivate a cooperative relationship \n     with you, and ask for your continued help in expeditiously \n     confirming nominees so important to the US public.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Podesta,\n                                  Chief of Staff to the President.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Acting in the capacity of the Senator from \nMontana, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14666-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I should note just on the bankruptcy bill, \nwe are making more progress. This morning we were able to clear four \nmore amendments. I understand there is a total of 31 amendments that \nbeen accepted to improve the Bankruptcy Reform Act. These are \namendments that have been offered on both sides of the aisle.\n  I commend the distinguished deputy Democratic leader, the Senator \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Reid, for his help. He has\n\n[[Page S14667]]\n\nbeen, as I described him in the caucus, indefatigable in his efforts to \nmove this through. He and I and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nTorricelli, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and the Senator \nfrom Utah, Mr. Hatch, have all worked to clear amendments or to set \nrollcalls on those we cannot clear.\n  I have urged Members to have short time agreements, and they have \nagreed to that. I think we have gone from some 300 or more potential \namendments down to only a dozen or so, if that, that are remaining.\n  When you are dealing with a piece of legislation as complex as this, \nas important as this, when we are only 2 to 3 weeks before the end of \nthis session--when we are only 2 to 3 weeks before the end of this \nsession--I was hoping somebody would jump up and disagree on that ``2 \nto 3 weeks'' bit--or possibly a few days before the end of this \nsession, it shows how well we have done.\n  But as I said earlier, before he came on the floor, I commend the \nSenator from Nevada, who has worked so hard to bring down those numbers \non the amendments.\n\n  Frankly, I would like to see us wrap this up. I would like to go to \nVermont.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. REID. I just talked to someone coming out of the conference. They \nsaid: What about this bankruptcy bill? I said: It is up to the majority \nwhether or not we have a bankruptcy bill this year. We have worked very \nhard these past few days on these amendments. We need time on the floor \nto begin to offer some of these amendments.\n  As the Senator knows, we have maybe 8 or 9 amendments total out of \n320, and we could have a bill. And the contentious amendments--on one \nthat is causing us not to move forward, the Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer, has agreed to a half hour. That is all he wants. I just cannot \nimagine, if this bill is as important as I think it is and, as I have \nheard, the majority believes it is, why we cannot get a bill.\n  Does the Senator from Vermont understand why we are not moving \nforward?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am at a loss to understand why we cannot.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada, yesterday morning--and I normally \nspeak at about an octave higher than this; I am coming out of a bout of \nbronchitis--I came back to be here at 10 o'clock because we were going \nto be on the bill. Instead, we had morning business, I believe, until \nabout 4 o'clock in the afternoon. That is 6 hours. That is what it \nwould have taken to finish the bill, especially after the work of the \nSenator from Nevada, and others, in clearing out so many of the \nRepublican and Democratic amendments to get them accepted or voted on.\n  I understand we are waiting for the other body to get the \nappropriations bill over here. I would think between now and normal \nsuppertime today we could finish this bill, if people want to. We are \nwilling to move on our side. We are willing to have our amendments come \nup.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from California on the floor. She has \nwaited some time. She has been here several days waiting with an \namendment. She has indicated she is willing to go ahead with a \nrelatively short period of time. The Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer, has said the same. We are ready to go, and I wish we would.\n  As I stated earlier, I would have liked very much to get this done. I \nwould actually like very much to finish all the items we have. I wish \nwe could have finished a couple weeks ago. I want to go to Vermont. I \nwant to be with my family. It was snowing there yesterday, as I am sure \nit was in parts of the State of the distinguished Presiding Officer. I \nsee the distinguished Senator from Maine on the floor. I expect it did \nin her State.\n  Mr. REID. It was 81 degrees in Las Vegas yesterday.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Eighty-one degrees in Las Vegas. How about snow in the \nmountains?\n  Mr. REID. Oh, there was snow in the mountains.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Nevada has the good fortune as I do: We \nboth represent two magnificent and beautiful States. He has the \nability, however, in his State to go far greater ranges in climate, in \ntemperature, over a distance of 100 miles or so than just about \nanywhere else in the country. We sometimes do those ranges in \ntemperature and climate in one afternoon in Vermont, but we are not \nalways happy about it.\n\n  I would like to see us get moving and get out of here. I see the \ndistinguished Senator from California, who has asked me to yield to \nher. I am prepared to do that, but I also note that we will not start \non any matter until the distinguished floor leader on the other side is \non the floor. So I am at a bit of a quandary. I wanted to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from California with her amendment, but the \ndistinguished floor leader on the Republican side is not here.\n  So I ask that the Senator from California withhold a bit. I see the \nSenator from--I may be a traffic cop here. I see my good friend and \nneighbor from New England, the Senator from Maine.\n  I ask, could she indicate to me just about how much time she may \nneed?\n  Ms. COLLINS. It was my understanding that there was an agreement that \nat 2:15--and we are a little late in getting here--Senator Schumer and \nI were going to be able to introduce a bill as in morning business. We \nwould need approximately 15 minutes, I would guess.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then I ask, Mr. President, unanimous consent that after \nthe distinguished Senator from Maine and the distinguished Senator from \nNew York have been heard, it would then be in order to go to the \ndistinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, so she could go \nforward with her amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Reserving the right to object, I believe that--Mr. \nPresident, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nMaine and the Senator from New York be recognized, and then the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, and the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nEdwards, be recognized for 5 minutes each after the Senator from Maine \nand the Senator from New York, and then the floor go to the Senator \nfrom California--now that I see the Senator from Iowa on the floor--so \nshe could then go back to the bankruptcy bill.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, it would be 25 minutes: 15 \nminutes and 5 for each of the two Senators as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins and Mr. Schumer pertaining to the \nintroduction of the legislation are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14667-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14667-S14669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I have spoken before on the floor about \nthe devastation created by Hurricane Floyd in my State of North \nCarolina. Let me update and speak briefly on that subject, particularly \nsince we are in the process of a continuing resolution right now.\n  Everybody knows, because they have seen the pictures on television, \nwhat happened to my families in North Carolina as a result of Hurricane \nFloyd. We have two huge issues that have to be addressed before this \nCongress adjourns. One is housing. We have people in eastern North \nCarolina who don't have homes and have no prospect of having homes any \ntime in the foreseeable future. We have to address this housing \nsituation in North Carolina before we adjourn.\n  Second is our farmers. Our farmers were already in desperate straits \nlong before Hurricane Floyd came through, and they have been totally \ndevastated as a result of Hurricane Floyd. We have to address the needs \nof our farmers in eastern North Carolina before we leave Washington and \nbefore the Congress adjourns.\n  Let me say, first, that we have, in the last 24 hours, made progress \non both fronts. First, on the issue of housing, we have, at least in \nprinciple, reached agreement that FEMA will have an additional $215 \nmillion of authority--money already appropriated--for housing buyouts. \nBased on the information we presently have, that should get us well \ninto next year in the process of participating in the housing buyouts \nand helping all of our folks who desperately need help. That is good \nprogress, a move in the right direction. There is more work that needs \nto be done. But at least in terms of getting us through the winter, I \nthink we have probably done what we need to do in terms of housing.\n  On the issue of our farmers and agriculture, there is at least in \nprinciple an agreement for approximately $554 million of additional \nagricultural relief.\n  My concern has been and continues to be whether that money, No. 1, \nwill go to North Carolina and North Carolina's farmers; and, No. 2, \nwhether it addresses the very specific needs that our farmers have.\n  We are now in the process of working with everyone involved in these \nbudget negotiations to ensure that both of those problems are \naddressed:\n  No. 1, to make sure that a substantial chunk of that money goes to \nNorth Carolina, and that additional money, to the extent it is needed \nfor very specific purposes, can be appropriated and allocated to North \nCarolina's farmers to deal with the devastation created by Hurricane \nFloyd;\n  No. 2, to make sure at least a portion of the money that has already \nbeen appropriated goes to address the very specific needs our farmers \nhave.\n  It is absolutely critical that before the Senate adjourns and before \nthis Congress adjourns and leaves Washington these two problems be \naddressed.\n  I said it before; I will say it again. Our government serves no \npurpose if we are not available to meet the needs of our citizens who \nhave been devastated by disasters--in this case, Hurricane Floyd. These \nare people who have worked their entire lives--in the case of our \nfarmers, they have farmed the land for generations. They have paid \ntheir taxes. They have been good citizens. They have always lived up to \ntheir end of the bargain.\n  What they say to us now is: What is their government-- because this \nis their government--going to do to deal with their needs in this time \nof greatest need in the wake of Hurricane Floyd and disasters created \nby Hurricane Floyd?\n\n  We have a responsibility to these people. We need to make sure their \nneeds at least have been addressed through the winter. When we come \nback in the spring--we will be back in the spring, I assure my \ncolleagues--we will be talking to our colleagues again about what \nadditional needs we have because we will have additional long-term \nneeds. This problem is not going to be solved in a month. It is not \ngoing to be solved in 3 months. This will take a period of years. When \nCongress comes back in the spring, there will be many additional needs \nthat will have to be addressed.\n  But at a bare minimum, we need to ensure this Congress does not \nadjourn and people do not go home until we have made sure we have at \nleast addressed the housing needs which will get us through the \nwinter--I think we have made real progress in that direction--and, \nsecond, that we have gotten our farmers back up on their feet so they \ncan be back in business in the spring in order for them to continue \ntheir farming operation. Those two problems have to be addressed before \nwe leave.\n  Let me make clear what I have made clear before, which is my people \nare in trouble. They are hurting. They need help. Senator Helms and I \nhave worked together very diligently to try to get them the help they \nneed in this time of crisis.\n  I want to make it clear once again that I intend to use whatever tool \nis available to me to ensure that my people get the help they need and \nthe help they deserve.\n  This Congress and this Senate cannot go home and cannot leave \nWashington until we ensure that our people in North Carolina have a \nhome to go to.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to explain briefly why I have held \nall legislation--including appropriations bills. It revolves around the \nissue of dairy pricing policies and dairy compacts. One is a national \nmilk pricing system. I will explain that first and explain my concerns \nabout what is happening.\n  There is a national milk pricing policy which has been in effect for \nabout 60 years. It was set up in a way that said the further away you \nlive from Wisconsin, if you are a dairy farmer, the more you get for \nyour milk. The government set that policy up to encourage the formation \nof a national dairy industry because transportation--particularly \nrefrigeration--was not available at that time. They said the further \nyou live from Wisconsin, the more you get for your milk. That was 60 \nyears ago. That kind of policy no longer makes any sense.\n  In lieu of and in consideration of that, the Secretary of Agriculture \nand the USDA have come up with a new pricing system which does not \neliminate the differential. It simply reduces it. Ninety-seven percent \nof the farmers in our country voted for it. It was set to be \nimplemented on October 1st.\n  Now we find out that the Republicans are apparently intending to go \nback to the old pricing system. That is a disaster for our country. It \ncertainly is a disaster for Midwestern farmers, and it doesn't reflect \nthe reality of our present-day system.\n  Again, farmers in the Midwest and from Wisconsin are not asking for \nany advantage. They simply want to have the same opportunities for \nmarketing their product in a competitive way as dairy farmers all over \nthe country. It seems to me that is a reasonable request.\n\n  That is why we are so distressed at the impending outcome of what is \ngoing on in the House and will be here before the Senate very shortly.\n  The other one is the Northeast Dairy Compact. The Northeast Dairy \nCompact seeks to set arbitrarily, without consideration for market \nactivities, a price for their dairy farmers to sell their milk to \nprocessors. That price is generally higher than market prices. It makes \nit very difficult, if not impossible, for anybody else in other parts \nof the country to market their milk or their milk products in the \nNortheast Dairy Compact States--the New England States--because when \nthe prices are arbitrarily decided, the processors are then obviously \nlikely to buy their milk from the local farmer rather than to buy it \nfrom somebody in another State.\n  In effect, it excludes the opportunity to market your product--in \nthis case milk--in the New England States. That is not only a disaster \nfor us in the Midwest; it clearly is terrible national economic policy.\n  If it is allowed again to be renewed at this time--it expired in \nOctober--we would be endorsing a national policy which for the first \ntime in the history of our country excludes products from being sold \nwithout interference in all 50 States. We have never done that before. \nThe genius and the success of the\n\n[[Page S14669]]\n\nAmerican system is based on our ability--no matter where we live in \nthis country--to manufacture and sell products and services anywhere \nelse in this country without restrictions.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact says, no; we are not going to do that \nanymore.\n  If we allow the Northeast to do that, then for what reason would we \nnot allow other sections of the country to set up their own milk \ncartels, and for that matter, cartels on other products? If we allow it \nfor the Northeast Dairy Compact, then I say unequivocally there is no \njustification for not allowing it elsewhere, not only on milk but on \nother products.\n  I ask my fellow Senators: Is this the way to run a country \neconomically? Would any of us think we would endorse that kind of \npolicy where States and regions can decide for themselves not to allow \nother products into those States or regions?\n  It doesn't make any sense. It is not the way we built the country.\n  We should not renew, therefore, the Northeast Dairy Compact at this \ntime.\n  It was born 3 years ago in a back-room deal. There was no vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. It was presented as part of a very large farm \npackage. It was voted on in an affirmative way, but not by itself \nbecause it was part of a farm package 3 years ago. It is intended to be \nrenewed again this year as part of a back-room deal without debate on \nthe floor. It was debated twice all by itself. It lost on a straight \nup-and-down vote 3 or 4 years ago. The Northeast Dairy Compact lost on \na cloture vote just several months ago.\n  I am very concerned about both things: The milk marketing pricing \nsystem, and the Northeast Dairy Compact. I am concerned enough to have \na hold on all other legislation.\n  I hope very much that my fellow Senators can see the wisdom of my \ndecision and support me in this effort not only to do what is right for \nMiddle-Western dairy farmers but to do what is right for the people who \nlive and work all over this country.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for 10 minutes on the subject of the dairy issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my senior colleague, Senator \nKohl, for his efforts to fight for Wisconsin dairy farmers. We have \nworked long and hard together on this. We are determined to see this \nthrough.\n  For 60 years, dairy farmers across America have been steadily driven \nout of business and disadvantaged by the current Federal dairy policy. \nIt is hard to believe this, but in 1950 Wisconsin had over 143,000 \ndairy farms; after nearly 50 years of the current dairy policy, \nWisconsin is left with only 23,000 dairy farms. Let me repeat that: \nfrom 143,000 to 23,000 during this time period.\n  Why would anyone seek to revive a dairy policy that has destroyed \nover 110,000 dairy farms in a single State? That is more than five out \nof six farms in the last half century. This devastation has not been \nlimited to Wisconsin. Since 1950, America has lost over 3 million dairy \nfarms, and this trend is accelerating. Since 1958, America has lost \nover half of its dairy producers.\n  Day after day, season after season, we are losing dairy farms at an \nalarming rate. While the operations disappear, we are seeing the \nemergence of larger dairy farms. The trend toward large dairy \noperations is mirrored in States throughout the Nation. The economic \nlosses associated with the reduction of small farms goes well beyond \nthe impact of individual farm families who have been forced off the \nland. It is much broader than that.\n  The loss of these farms has devastated rural communities where small, \nfamily-owned dairy farms are the key to economic stability.\n  As Senator Kohl has alluded to during the consideration of the 1996 \nfarm bill, Congress did seek to make changes in the unjust Federal \npricing system by phasing out the milk price support program and to \nfinally reduce the inequities between the regions.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what happened at all. It didn't work. \nBecause of the back-door politicking during the eleventh hour of the \nconference committee, America's dairy farmers were stuck with the \ndevastatingly harmful Northeast Dairy Compact. Although it is painful \nand difficult for everyone, we in the Upper Midwest cannot stand for \nthat or any change that further disadvantages our dairy farms--the ones \nwho are left, not the tens of thousands who are gone but the less than \n25,000 who remain. We are determined to keep them in business.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact accentuates the current system's equities \nby authorizing six Northeastern States to establish a minimum price for \nfluid milk, higher even than those established under the Federal milk \nmarketing order, which are already pretty high and, frankly, much \nhigher than our folks get. The compact not only allows the six States \nto set artificially high prices for producers but permits them to block \nthe entry of lower-priced milk from competing States. Further \ndistorting the market are subsidies given to processors in these six \nStates to export their higher-priced milk to noncompact States.\n  Despite what some argue, the Northeastern Dairy Compact has not even \nhelped small Northeastern farmers. Since the Northeast first \nimplemented the compact in 1997, small dairy farms in the Northeast, \nwhich are supposed to have been helped, have gone out of business at a \nrate of 41 percent higher than they had in the previous 2 years. It is \nnot even working for the limited purposes it was supposed to serve.\n  Compacts often amount to a transfer of wealth to large farms by \naffording large farms a per farm subsidy that is actually 20 times \ngreater than the meager subsidy given to small farmers.\n  As my senior colleague has indicated, we need to support the moderate \nreforms of the USDA and reject the harmful dairy rider and let our \ndairy farmers get a fair price for their milk. I know as we go through \nthe coming days this may mean substantial delays. We all want to go \nhome to our States as early as possible. However, Senator Kohl and I \nare determined to do our best to fight for the remaining Wisconsin \ndairy farmers. Some of those steps may be necessary in order to achieve \nthat goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the joint resolution \nis considered read the third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 80) was considered read the third \ntime and passed.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask to call up amendment No. 2756.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, is there a unanimous \nconsent agreement before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). There is a unanimous consent \nagreement permitting the Senator from California to offer an amendment \nat this time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 2756.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. ENCOURAGING CREDITWORTHINESS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) certain lenders may sometimes offer credit to consumers \n     indiscriminately, without taking steps to ensure that \n     consumers\n\n[[Page S14670]]\n\n     are capable of repaying the resulting debt, and in a manner \n     which may encourage certain consumers to accumulate \n     additional debt; and\n       (2) resulting consumer debt may increasingly be a major \n     contributing factor to consumer insolvency.\n       (b) Study Required.--The Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System (hereafter in this section referred to as the \n     ``Board'') shall conduct a study of--\n       (1) consumer credit industry practices of soliciting and \n     extending credit--\n       (A) indiscriminately;\n       (B) without taking steps to ensure that consumers are \n     capable of repaying the resulting debt; and\n       (C) in a manner that encourages consumers to accumulate \n     additional debt; and\n       (2) the effects of such practices on consumer debt and \n     insolvency.\n       (c) Report and Regulations.--Not later than 12 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Board--\n       (1) shall make public a report on its findings with respect \n     to the indiscriminate solicitation and extension of credit by \n     the credit industry;\n       (2) may issue regulations that would require additional \n     disclosures to consumers; and\n       (3) may take any other actions, consistent with its \n     existing statutory authority, that the Board finds necessary \n     to ensure responsible industrywide practices and to prevent \n     resulting consumer debt and insolvency.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is submitted on behalf of Senator Jeffords of \nVermont and myself. This is the same amendment that passed the Senate \nlast year by voice vote. It is an important amendment, which is why I \nwish to do it today and ask for a rollcall vote.\n  Last year it was deleted in conference. I believe it will suffer the \nsame fate today if it were simply accepted. I note that the managers \nhave agreed to accept the amendment. I particularly want the Senator \nfrom Iowa to know that I am very grateful for that accommodation. \nHowever, I run the risk in allowing it to be accepted that it is again \nexpunged in conference.\n  This amendment requires the Federal Reserve Board to investigate the \npractice of issuing credit cards indiscriminately and inappropriately \nand to take necessary action to ensure that consumer credit is not \nextended recklessly or in a manner that encourages practices which \ncause consumer bankruptcies.\n  One part of the amendment, a brief paragraph, is a sense of the \nSenate that finds that certain lenders may offer credit to consumers \nindiscriminately and don't take steps to ensure that consumers have the \ncapacity to repay the resulting debt, possibly encouraging consumers to \neven accumulate additional debt. We all know that to be true. The \namendment then goes on to say that the resulting consumer debt may \nincreasingly be a major contributing factor to consumer bankruptcies.\n  This amendment would authorize the Federal Reserve Board to conduct a \nstudy of industry practices of soliciting and extending credit \nindiscriminately without taking those steps that are prudent to ensure \nconsumers are capable of repaying that debt. Within 1 year of \nenactment, the Federal Reserve Board would make a public report on its \nfindings regarding the credit industry's indiscriminate solicitation \nand extension of credit.\n  The amendment then would allow the Federal Reserve Board to issue \nregulations that would require additional disclosures to consumers and \nto take any other actions, consistent with its statutory authority, \nthat the Board finds necessary to ensure responsible industry-wide \npractices and to prevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency.\n  Why this amendment? Why is this amendment needed? This amendment \ndirectly addresses one of the major causes of personal bankruptcies: \nbad consumer credit card debt. The typical family filing for bankruptcy \nin 1998 owed more than 1\\1/2\\ times its annual income in short-term, \nhigh-interest debt. This means that the average family in bankruptcy, \nwith a median income of just over $17,500, had $28,955 in credit card \nand other short-term, high-interest debt--almost double the income of \ndebt.\n  Studies by the Congressional Budget Office, the FDIC, and independent \neconomists all link the rise in personal bankruptcies directly to the \nrise in consumer debt. As consumer debt has risen to an all-time high, \nso have consumer bankruptcies. Any meaningful bankruptcy reform I think \nmust address irresponsible actions of certain segments of the credit \ncard industry because, after all, this is the major problem that is \nexacerbating bankruptcy and increasing the number of filings.\n  Last year, the credit card industry sent out a record 3.45 billion \nunsolicited offers. That is 30 solicitations for credit cards to every \nhousehold in America. The number of solicitations jumped 15 percent \nfrom the last time I did this amendment to this time I am doing this \namendment. So instead of slowing down irresponsible offers of credit to \npeople who cannot possibly repay that credit, they have sped it up.\n  There are over 1 billion credit cards in circulation, a dozen credit \ncards for every household in this country. Three-quarters of all \nhouseholds have at least one credit card. Credit card debt has doubled \nbetween 1993 and 1997, to $422 billion from just over $200 billion.\n  During this 2-year debate on this bankruptcy bill, which I support, \nmy staff has contacted numerous credit card issuers. The overwhelming \nmajority of these companies do not check the income of the consumers \nbeing solicited. In other words, credit card issuers have no idea \nwhether persons to whom they issued credit cards have the means to pay \ntheir bill each month.\n  One of my constituents from Lakewood, CA, wrote, and this really \ndescribes this aptly:\n\n       What really bugs me about this is that credit card \n     companies send out these solicitations for their plastic \n     cards, and then when they get burned, they start crying foul. \n     They want all kinds of laws passed to protect them from \n     taking hits when it's their own practices that caused the \n     problem.\n\n  There is a real element of truth in this. This amendment will not \naffect any responsible lender. It will not affect the vast majority of \nthe credit card industry who responsibly check consumer credit history \nbefore issuing or preapproving credit cards.\n\n  Representatives of large credit card issuers have assured me and my \nstaff that they do not provide credit cards to consumers without a \nthorough credit check. However, I note that major credit cards, such as \nVisa or MasterCard, do not require banks who issue their cards to check \ncredit history. That is a bona fide area at which an investigation and \na study should take a look. Is this a good practice, not to check the \nbank who issues your card under your auspices and see that they also \ncheck the creditworthiness of the individual?\n  This amendment would affect lenders who fail to even inquire into the \nconsumer's ability to pay or those who specifically target consumers \nwho cannot repay the balances. It was news to me that there is a whole \ncategory of companies out there who actually go after people who are \novercome with credit card debt and offer them more credit cards to \nrepay that debt. A growing segment of the credit industry, known as \nsubprime lenders, increasingly searches for risk borrowers who they \nknow will make inappropriately low minimum monthly payments and carry \nlarge balances from month to month and have to pay extraordinarily high \ninterest rates.\n  This kind of lending has become the fastest growing, most profitable \nsubset of consumer lending. Although losses are substantial, interest \nrates of 18 percent to 40 percent on credit card debt make this lending \nprofitable. Many of these often relatively unsophisticated borrowers do \nnot realize that minimum monthly payments just put them deeper in a \nhole which, in many cases, leads to bankruptcy.\n  I have somebody close to me who is in that situation and has been in \nthat situation from 1991 to the present day with six or eight credit \ncards, does not have the income to repay them, and all this individual \nhas had is mounting interest payments and can never get to the \nprincipal of the debt. No matter how this individual responds within \nhis or her capabilities, he or she cannot possibly pay off the debt. I \neven stepped in and made an offer to the credit card companies to repay \nthe debt with a modicum of interest attached to it for this individual \nand was turned down. They said they made an offer to settle and they \nrejected the offer, they withdrew the offer of settlement.\n  Industry analysts estimate that using a typical minimum monthly \npayment rate on a credit card in order to pay off a $2,500 balance--\nthat is a balance of just $2,500--assuming the consumer never uses the \ncard to charge\n\n[[Page S14671]]\n\nanything else ever again, would take 34 years to pay off the balance. \nThat is the situation in which people find themselves.\n  It is my belief that this is irresponsible. What we are asking is the \nFederal Reserve do a study, an investigation to see if they agree this \nis irresponsible.\n  So this is the core concept.\n  Oh, let me make one other point. On the situation I just indicated to \nyou, that somebody who had that balance of $2,500 never used the card \nto charge anything else again, it would take 34 years to pay off that \nbalance. Total payments would exceed 300 percent of the principal.\n  So what I have found out is, there are people who are needy, who \nsuccumb to these credit cards, who engage in not just one credit card \nwith $10,000, but five or six or seven or eight, and maybe have an \nincome of $17,000 or $15,000 a year. They make these purchases, they \nget into trouble, and they can never pay off their debt. So, yes, \nbankruptcy looms as the only alternative.\n  To tighten up their obligations to pay back the debt--which I am in \nagreement of doing--and yet not evaluate whether these policies of \nlending are as responsible as they should be is absolutely wrong.\n  So for the second time in 2 years, I offer this amendment and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays in the hopes that the amendment will be agreed to \nand will remain in the bill in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator requesting the yeas and nays at \nthis time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 2655, as modified; 2764, as modified; and 2661, as \n                                modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent on \nsome amendments that have been agreed to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments, as modified \nwhere noted, be considered agreed to, en bloc, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc. The amendments are as \nfollows: No. 2655, as modified; No. 2764, as modified; and No. 2661, as \nmodified. I send the modifications to the desk.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  The Senator from Iowa knows I reserve that right but will not \nultimately object. But I do want to point out to my colleagues that the \namendments to be accepted by unanimous consent, which deal with the \n``teaser'' issue, which deal with disclosure on credit cards, in my \njudgment, do not go very far and need to go much further. I suggest to \nmy colleagues that the amendment Mr. Santorum of Pennsylvania and I \nhave offered would go much further on what would do the job.\n  Let me be very clear. I have been working on credit card disclosure \nfor over 10 years. A while ago, about 7 or 8 years ago, we passed \nsomething we thought required the credit card companies to disclose, in \nlarge numerical print, how much the annual interest rate was. That is \nreally the key issue when you decide what credit card to take. Many of \nthe credit card companies use ``teaser'' rates. They say 2 percent or 3 \npercent for a couple of months and then raise it to 10 or 11 or 15 \npercent.\n  So we drafted an amendment. But at the request of the industry, we \nwere not very specific. They said: You don't have to specify how large \nthe print should be or what should be in the box; just do it. It became \nlaw. The box was known as the Schumer box.\n  Let me show you what it is in current law. This credit card shown on \nthis chart is governed by that law. The only large print and the only \nnumber you see is ``3.9 percent.'' That is what is called the \n``teaser'' rate. It is only offered for a few months.\n  When it is time to pay your regular annual fee--in this case, 9.9 \npercent--in the box is just a lot of legal gobbledygook, and you can \nhardly see what the number is. To understand it is the 9.9 percent or \nthe 19.99 percent which governs, you probably have to have a degree \nfrom Harvard Law School.\n  What the Grassley-Torricelli amendment does is allow this kind of \ndeception to continue. It makes some improvements, but it does not make \nthe real improvement of disclosure. I have talked to leaders of the \ncredit card industry. They say: Don't cap us. Don't limit us. We are \nnot against disclosure. Then when we come up with a proposal, Mr. \nSantorum and I, that simply says they have to show the amount in 24-\npoint type--and here is what it says: ``Long-term annual percentage \nrate of purchases,'' and the amount--we get opposition.\n  Many of those who are close to the credit card industry have told me \nthe industry has told them they are against it. They say they are for \ndisclosure, but they really are not.\n\n  I do not have to oppose this amendment because we have a better \nalternative. The alternative is this. If you really believe in \ndisclosure, the Santorum-Schumer amendment is the way to go.\n  What is shown on this chart is deceptive. In all due respect to my \ngood friend from Iowa, who I know cares strongly about this issue, his \namendment will not change that one drop. They will have in big letters \nthe ``teaser'' rate and in hardly intelligible language what the real \ninterest rate is.\n  I would normally object to this unanimous consent request. But \nbecause there is an alternative to make real disclosure, and because we \nhave already debated, and because I know it is our right to get a vote \non that amendment, I will not object.\n  But I want my colleagues to understand one thing: We are not doing \nmuch, if anything, for the cause of real disclosure, for the cause of \nletting consumers see the interest rate they are paying before they buy \nthe credit card, unless we pass the Schumer-Santorum amendment.\n  So I withdraw my objection to this amendment. I know it is offered in \ngood faith. But please let my colleagues understand that if you want \nreal disclosure--no more, just disclosure, Adam Smith economics--the \nonly way to get it is not by an amendment that allows the industry to \ncontinue deceptive practices but, rather, by the Schumer-Santorum \namendment which says, in no uncertain terms, ``9.99 percent''--whatever \nthe interest rate is--24-point type, in large letters.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his courtesy. I withdraw any \nobjection to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before the Chair rules, I think the Senator from Nevada \nwishes to make a statement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we appreciate the cooperation of all \nMembers, especially the Senator from New York, who is always so \ninvolved in what goes on on the floor but also always so willing to \nwork toward a resolution.\n  It is my understanding that at this time the Senator is not intending \nto offer amendment No. 2765 which has been filed.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to my friend, before the unanimous consent \nagreement is entered, we have a number of amendments that perhaps at \nsome later time--I understand there are going to be some votes around 4 \no'clock. We can include, for example, the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia which is now pending. And there may be some others--for \nexample, the one from the Senator from New York, No. 2761, which he \nfiled and debated last week. So I would like the manager of the bill to \ntake a look at those and see if we can get some definite times set.\n  No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nunanimous consent request is agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2655, as modified; 2764, as modified; and 2661, \nas modified) were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 2655, AS MODIFIED\n\n (Purpose: To provide for enhanced consumer credit protection, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new title:\n\n                   TITLE--CONSUMER CREDIT DISCLOSURE\n\n     SEC. ____01.

Could we have 10 minutes on each side?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK, 10 minutes on this side and 10 minutes to be \ncontrolled by the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just to make sure, no second-degree amendments prior to \nthe vote on this amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New York is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, \nand I are offering an amendment to do some commonsense housecleaning \nwith respect to the means test safe harbor now in the bill and, more \nsignificantly, to restore something that was unfortunately taken out of \nthe bill by the managers' amendment: true protection for low- and \nmoderate-income bankruptcy filers from coercive predator litigation \ntactics involving section 707(b) of the bankruptcy code.\n  First the housecleaning: The managers' amendment included a provision \nstating that the bill's means test could not be used to remove low- and \nmoderate-income debtors from chapter 7. That was undoubtedly a big step \nforward for this bill, and I congratulate the managers for having taken \nthat step.\n  Now that the means test no longer applies to low- and moderate-income \nbankruptcy filers, it makes no sense for these individuals to have to \nfile means test calculations based on their income and expenses along \nwith the other papers they must file upon declaring bankruptcy. \nLikewise, it makes no sense for U.S. trustees to have to do means test \ncalculations with respect to low- and moderate-income bankruptcy filers \nwho, I repeat, cannot be means tested out of chapter 7. This imposes \nunnecessary burdens on debtors and wastes taxpayer dollars by leaving \nthese requirements in place.\n  Our amendment would fix the problem by deleting these requirements \nonly in cases involving low- and moderate-income bankruptcy filers. \nThese filers would still have to document their income and expenses. \nThey just wouldn't have to do means test calculations anymore, which \nare no longer required.\n  Now for the more important issue, the issue of protecting low- and \nmoderate-income bankruptcy filers from any coercive creditor litigation \ntactics under 707(b). Sad to say, this only became an issue 2 days or \nso ago. The bill formerly had a provision preventing creditors from \nbringing any motion under 707(b) against low- and moderate-income \nbankruptcy filers. That included motions under the means test, motions \nalleging that the debtor filed for chapter 7 in bad faith, and motions \nalleging that the totality of the circumstances of the debtor's \nfinancial situation demonstrated abuse. Bankruptcy trustees could bring \nthese motions against low- and moderate-income debtors, and \nappropriately so, just not creditors.\n  According to the report language for this bill, the ban on predator \nmotions existed to protect low-income filers; in other words, no \nmotion, no prospect for creditor coercion. Last year's Senate\n\n[[Page S14675]]\n\nbill had the same protection for low- and moderate-income filers. And \neven this year's House bill, which many consider more stringent than \nthe Senate bill, had this protection. Yet at this late stage in the \ngame, the managers' amendment deleted much of this bill's so-called \nsafe harbor against creditor 707(b) motions. It continues to protect \nlow- and moderate-income bankruptcy filers from motions under the means \ntest but now, for the first time, leaves these debtors vulnerable to \ncreditor motions alleging debtor bad faith or that the totality of the \ncircumstances demonstrated debtor abuse.\n  This chart illustrates the problem. Under the House's bill, safe \nharbor creditors can bring means test or totality of circumstances \nmotions only against above-median-income debtors. Under the Senate \nbill, as modified by the managers' amendment, motions against all \ndebtors, even those with income below median income for a household of \nsimilar size, can be brought by creditors.\n  What is the big deal about leaving low- and moderate-income debtors \nvulnerable to creditor motions based on these grounds? The big deal is \nwhat some aggressive creditors will do with these motions. These \ncreditors will use these motions and threats to bully poorer debtors \ninto giving up their bankruptcy rights altogether, whether that means \nstaying away from bankruptcy altogether, giving up their bankruptcy \nclaims, or agreeing that certain of their debts simply won't be reduced \nor eliminated by virtue of bankruptcy.\n  This should trouble all of us. Debtors who can't afford to litigate \nwith their creditors will just bow to creditors' demands.\n  Now, if I sound alarmist, I do so because the record is filled with \nexamples of aggressive creditors using the motions and leverage they \ncurrently have under the bankruptcy code to coerce low- and moderate-\nincome debtors into giving up their bankruptcy rights in some form.\n  In a review of a bankruptcy court case for the Western District of \nOklahoma, the judge described that creditor's practice as follows:\n\n       A review of the practices of [creditor's] attorneys . . . \n     indicated that in 1996 the firm filed 45 complaints seeking \n     exceptions to discharges on behalf of creditors having debts \n     arising from credit card agreements; that 100 such complaints \n     were filed in 1997. . . .\n       The firm's pattern of conduct appears as little more than \n     the use of this court and the bankruptcy code to coerce from \n     these debtors reaffirmation of their unsecured credit card \n     debt or some portion of it.\n\n  I could go on with other examples, but I will not to save the time of \nmy colleagues.\n  Here's a bankruptcy judge from the Western District of Missouri \ndescribing the litigation practices of AT Universal Card Services: \nThe [fraud] complaints, filed by AT, were filed solely to extract a \nsettlement from debtors. Once AT realized that the case would not \nsettle and that is would actually be required to offer evidence to \nsupport the allegations in the complaints, it moved to dismiss.\n  A woman from California described her experience.\n\n       . . . on the day we went to the bankruptcy hearing, we were \n     approached by a woman from [a retail creditor]. She explained \n     to me who she was. At the time, I was due to give birth in \n     two weeks. The woman told us we needed either to pay our bill \n     in full or return items such as a sofa, washing machine, and \n     vacuum. We weren't going to the hearing because we had money, \n     and we couldn't afford to replace these items, which we \n     needed. We explained these things and found an attorney. The \n     woman then said we could keep the items if we signed a paper \n     saying we would continue making payments. . . . We signed, of \n     course.\n\n  There is absolutely nothing illegal about making certain types of \nthreats today. There is not enough in this bill to stop most threats of \nthis nature from being made--and succeeding--tomorrow.\n  If you still think I am thrusting at windmills, let me direct your \nattention to a real-life letter from a creditor's attorney to a \ndebtor's attorney. The words speak for themselves.\n\n       We have reason to believe that your client may have \n     committed fraud in the use of the above-referenced credit \n     relationship. . . .\n       Be assured that our company is aware of the deadline for \n     filing an objection to dischargeability and has calendared \n     this date.\n\n  The problem is unequal bargaining power. It simply pays for the \ncreditor to put a debtor in the position of having to burn through \nseveral thousand dollars in attorney's fees fighting over a $100 TV \nset.\n  I want to be clear about something. I am not arguing that low- and \nmoderate-income debtors should be exempt from motions to remove them \nfrom chapter 7 for filing in bad faith or filing for chapter 7 \nabusively in light of the totality of their financial circumstances. \nAll I am saying is that when it comes to a debtor with $20,000 in \nyearly income, leave it to the bankruptcy trustees to bring these \nmotions. Leave it to the numerous other provisions of this bill that \ngraft new antifraud language onto the bankruptcy code to remedy the \nproblem. Just don't leave these debtors and their families vulnerable \nto the small, but not insignificant, number of wolves among the \ncreditor population.\n  I was leafing through Congress Daily one day last month, and I ran \ninto this advertisement run by the supporters of bankruptcy reform. The \nad features Mel from Mel's Auto Repairs, expressing concern: ``wealthy \ncustomers getting a free ride in bankruptcy,'' ``wealthy filers,'' \n``higher-income filers,'' ``wealthy Americans today . . . erasing their \ndebts while continuing to live an affluent lifestyle.'' The theme of \n``bankruptcy abuse by the wealthy'' pervades the whole ad.\n  Mel is right. Wealthy persons do abuse the bankruptcy system, and too \noften. And it needs to be stopped. But surely, subjecting low- and \nmoderate-income debtors to new and potent creditor motions has nothing \nto do with cracking down on wealthy deadbeats. The rhetoric of this ad \ndoesn't match the reality of this bill--particularly its provision \nsubjecting a single debtor with $20,000 in income, a married debtor \nwith a household income of $30,000, or a debtor with a spouse and two \nkids with a household income of $40,000, to the threat of coercive \ncreditor litigation tactics involving 707(b) of the bankruptcy code.\n  I urge colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment and to simply \nrestore this bill to what it used to be and to where the House bill is.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nNew York for his cooperation with us on a couple of amendments he has \nworked out with us and has withdrawn so we could get closer to \ncompletion of work on this particular amendment.\n  In the case of his amendment just now offered, and my opposition to \nit, I want to say we have taken into consideration some of the \ncomplaints he has made--not about our bill, but complaints he would \nhave made about some of the people writing legislation in this area, \nthat they would go too far. But I think his amendment goes too far \nbecause it would have the effect of letting bankrupts below the \nnational median income file for bankruptcy and do it in bad faith. That \nwould make the small businesses and honest Americans who stand to lose \nout--they will be told they can't do anything about it. What we want is \nopportunity in our legal system, in the bankruptcy system, in the \ncourts there, to be able to make a judgment, if there is bad faith \nused, to do something about it--most importantly, to discourage that \nsort of activity.\n  So I think this amendment gets us back to the point where we are now \nunder existing law--inviting abuse of the bankruptcy code.\n  Under our bill, which we have been debating for the last several days \non the floor of the Senate, and particularly as modified by the \nmanagers' amendment now, people below the national median income are \nnot subject to motions by anybody under the means test. But there is \nanother part of this bill that says the bankruptcy cases can be \ndismissed if the debtor filed for bankruptcy in bad faith. At this \npoint, the creditors are allowed to file motions asking a bankruptcy \njudge to dismiss a case if it is filed in bad faith. That is the way \nour litigation system works and should continue to work.\n  In an effort to go the extra mile, however, I accepted an amendment, \nby Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Senator Sessions, to put new \nsafeguards in place to prevent creditors using any power they have to \nfile bad faith motions as a tactic to force a debtor to\n\n[[Page S14676]]\n\ngive up his or her rights. That should not be allowed. The Reed \nSessions amendment corrects that. The projections in the Reed Sessions \namendment were also developed in close consultation with the White \nHouse.\n  Our bill further provides that if a motion to dismiss is filed and \nthe judge dismisses it, the judge can assess penalties against a \ncreditor who filed the motion if the motion wasn't substantially \njustified. So we want to make sure that creditors who would abuse some \nof their power in court would not--if it was not substantially \njustified, if their position was not substantially justified, then \naction should be taken against them, and that is entirely fair as well. \nSo we have a fair system with tough penalties for creditor abuses.\n  Now, the amendment of Senator from New York will return to the system \nwe have today. Under current law, creditors can't file motions when a \nchapter 7 case is abusive or improper. And every observer acknowledges \nthat the current system doesn't work at all in terms of catching abuse; \nhence, a major part of this bill is to correct this situation.\n  We went to great length in our committee report on this bankruptcy \nbill to discuss this point in very much detail. So this amendment \nshould be defeated because it prevents the provisions prohibiting bad \nfaith bankruptcy from being enforced. That is like saying to deadbeats \nit is not OK to file for bankruptcy in bad faith, but we are not going \nto do anything about it if you do. And, of course, that is exactly the \nwrong signal we want to send. We want to make sure that people who go \ninto bankruptcy are people who have a legitimate reason for being there \nand that they aren't taking advantage of bankruptcy to somehow help \nthemselves, and in bad faith is part of that process.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 5 minutes remaining, \nand the Senator from New York used all the time allowed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, may I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute \nto respond?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Then I will reserve my time, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa reserves his time.\n  Does the Senator object to the unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. I wish to answer.\n  The bill's provisions purporting to prevent and ameliorate coercive \ncreditor litigation tactics will not be able to undo the damage done by \ngiving creditors the right to bring 707(b) ``totality of the \ncircumstances'' and ``bad faith'' motions against low- and moderate-\nincome debtors.\n  Section 102 of the bill says a court may award a debtor costs and \nattorney's fees if a court rules against the creditor's 707(b) motion \nand that motion was not ``substantially justified.'' This provision \nwill not deter coercive creditor litigation tactics. It doesn't cover \ncoercive threats to bring 707(b) motions, which are often sufficient to \nforce a debtor to give up his or her bankruptcy rights.\n  Finally, this sanctions provision contains an exception which \nprecludes any award against a creditor that holds a claim of under \n$1,000, no matter how wealthy the creditor is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue that the Senator from New York \njust brought up of threats being used is exactly what the Reed-Sessions \namendment deals with. I suggest this was also very much a point that \nwas raised by people at the White House that we have been discussing--\nthe whole issue of bankruptcy over a long period of time.\n  This was also worked out because this was a major concern. They did \nnot want this abuse. They did not want the issue of threats. We agree \nwith them, as we had to work it out with Senators Sessions and Reed \nbecause the bill, as they saw it, was not adequate enough in this area.\n  As people vote on this amendment, I hope they will consider that we \nhave been trying to respond in a very legitimate and strong way against \nthe use of threats.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The answer is yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his careful deliberation and his \nyielding.\n  It is my understanding that section 203 of the bill deemed it a \nviolation of the automatic stay for a creditor to engage in any \ncommunication other than a recitation of the creditor's rights, and \nthis would deal with threat. This provision would be stricken from the \nbill by the Reed-Sessions amendment. So the Reed-Sessions amendment \ndidn't deal with the problem, but it actually took out the basic \nprotection that a low-income debtor would have against threat.\n  Is that not correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If you threaten somebody during reaffirmation, the \nSessions-Reed amendment is set aside.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Louisiana be granted 5 \nminutes to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14676-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14676-S14678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERIOR BILL NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I know the underlying amendment we have just debated is quite \nimportant, and the bankruptcy bill we are debating is one of the things \nwe have to reconcile in order to wrap up our business and do the work \nfor the American people. But I come to the floor just for a few moments \nthis afternoon to speak on another subject because I would like to do \nmy part to help us bring this session to a positive close.\n  I was one of the Senators who placed a hold on some of the business \nbefore the Senate. I felt compelled to do so because of some actions \nthe administration was taking in the negotiations process on the \nInterior bill. I believe I had to try to stop, or reverse, or change \nit. With other things that have taken place, I believe we have been \nsomewhat successful. I want to speak about that for a moment.\n  As you are aware, Mr. President, about 2 years ago a great coalition \nof people came together from different perspectives in this country--\ndifferent parties, different areas of this Nation--to begin to speak \nabout the great need in America and the great desire on the part of the \nAmerican people, from Louisiana, California, New York, and all places \nin between, to try to find a permanent way to fund very important \nenvironmental projects--the purchase of land, the expansion of parks, \nthe creation of green space, the preservation of green space, the \nrestoration of wetlands, the commitment to historic preservation, the \nexpansion of our urban parks, the ability of all families, not just \nfamilies who can afford to fly in jets or take long automobile \nvacations, but for families who live in the U.S., to be able to enjoy \nthe beauty of nature; for us as a Nation as we move into this next \ncentury to take this opportunity to try to find a permanent way to fund \nsome of these programs so they won't be subject to the whims and wishes \nof Washington, something that is fiscally conservative in terms of our \nbalanced budget.\n  We tried to look for funding that would be appropriate to dedicate in \nthis way. We found a source of funding. That is where the funding is--\noffshore oil and gas revenues that were the subject of an earlier \ndebate today. As the prices go up, it helps some parts of our Nation; \nit is a challenge for other parts. But it brings more tax revenues into \nthe Federal coffers.\n  For 50 years, we have been drilling off the shores of Louisiana, \nTexas, Mississippi, and the gulf coast. We have brought over $120 \nbillion to the Federal Treasury by depleting one important resource for \nour Nation. That money has gone to the general fund. It has been spent \non a variety of projects--not reinvested but just spent in operating \nbudgets.\n  Many of us think a more fiscally conservative approach, and a more \nsound and responsible approach, would be to\n\n[[Page S14677]]\n\ntake a portion of those revenues produced by basically the gulf coast \nStates and reinvest a portion, if you will, or share a portion of those \nrevenues, with States and counties and parishes, as in Louisiana and \ncommunities around the Nation, to help in all the ways I have just \nexpressed in all of our land acquisition, land improvements, expansion \nof our parks, and wildlife conservation programs.\n  Two years ago, a great coalition came together. On one  side, we had \nthe National Chamber of Commerce; on the other side, we had a variety \nof environmental groups; we had elected officials, both at the Federal \nlevel and State level. As I said, it was a bipartisan coalition that \ncame together to back a bill, which was introduced on the House side \nand in the Senate, known as CARA, the Conservation and Reinvestment \nAct, to do just that.\n\n  This bill has picked up tremendous support in the last 2 years. It is \npending before our Senate Energy Committee with Senator Murkowski and \nme as the lead sponsors, with many Members of this body. The great news \nis that just last week in the House, under the great leadership of Don \nYoung from Alaska and George Miller from California, the ranking \nmember, this bill passed out very similar to ours on a 37-12 vote to \ntry to help bring us to a bipartisan consensus.\n  I am hopeful, as we wrap up this session and as we begin to get ready \nfor the next session of Congress, that we are now in a very good \nposition to be able to take some final actions in moving that bill \nthrough committee, onto the floor, and into a conference where the \nfinal details can be worked out because if we are going to have any \npermanency of funding from this source, it is going to have to be \nsomething that is shared with the States that produce the money in the \nfirst place.\n  Louisiana produces about 70 percent of our offshore oil and gas \nrevenues. We have great needs as a coastal State, along with States \nsuch as New York that just got hit very hard by Hurricane Floyd, \ncausing tremendous damage. There are great coastal needs in our States \nto fully fund the land and water conservation and wildlife conservation \nprograms.\n  I am very hopeful as we position ourselves for next year, that we are \nin a position to grab this opportunity supported by this grand \ncoalition and do something very positive for America's environment.\n  I am pleased to say I will be prepared to release my hold on the \nforeign operations bill in an attempt to do my part to move to \nreconciliation because we have effectively stopped the administration's \nefforts to permanently allocate funding but in a way that will not \ncover all of the things as I outlined. We want to make sure this \ninvestment in the Nation is not just about Federal land acquisition, \nalthough that is a very important piece of this. We want to make sure \nit is balanced, with the opportunity for Governors and local officials \nto purchase land at the local level. We want to make sure it is truly a \npartnership. We want to make sure the coastal impact assistance is \nthere as well as funding for historical preservation, urban parks, and \nwildlife programs.\n  While we didn't reach every goal we set out, we have raised this \nissue. We have built a strong coalition. We have raised this issue and \nwe have stopped the permanent allocation of these funds until the whole \npackage can be dealt with. We have made a very positive step.\n  On behalf of the great coalition, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter to the President, signed by 14 Senators, \nalong with a letter to Members of Congress from 865 organizations, \nbusiness and government agencies, that are funding this effort.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 1999.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: With your leadership we have a historic \n     opportunity to pass legislation in this Congress that will \n     permanently reinvest a portion of offshore oil and gas \n     revenues in coastal conservation and impact assistance \n     programs, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, wildlife \n     conservation, historic treasures and outdoor recreation. \n     Recently, forty of the nation's governors sent a letter to \n     Congress encouraging us to seize this historic opportunity. \n     This effort has been endorsed by almost every environmental \n     organization in the country as well as a broad array of \n     business interests including the United States Chamber of \n     Commerce.\n       There is strong bi-partisan support now for a proposal \n     that: will provide a fair share of funding to all coastal \n     states, including producing states; is free of harmful \n     environmental impacts to coastal and ocean resources; does \n     not unduly hinder land acquisition but acknowledges Congress' \n     role in making these decisions and reflects a true \n     partnership among federal, state and local governments.\n       There is also strong support for using these OCS revenues \n     to reinvest in the renewable resource of wildlife \n     conservation through the currently authorized Pittman-\n     Robertson program. This new influx of funding will nearly \n     double the Federal funds available for wildlife conservation \n     and education programs. We would like to ensure that wildlife \n     programs are kept among the priorities when negotiating for \n     monies from OCS revenues.\n       A historic conservation initiative is within our grasp. \n     With budget negotiations currently underway, we urge you to \n     push forward for a compromise which reflects the points \n     outlined above. It will be an accomplishment we can all \n     celebrate and a real legacy for future generations.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mary L. Landrieu, Max Cleland, Blanche L. Lincoln, Evan \n           Bayh, John F. Kerry, Tim Johnson, Charles Robb, John \n           Breaux, Robert J. Kerrey, Barbara A. Mikulski, Ron \n           Wyden, Herb Kohl, Ernest F. Hollings, Judd Gregg.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 November 1, 1999.\n     U.S. Congress,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Member of Congress: As the twentieth century draws to \n     a close, Congress has a rare opportunity to pass landmark \n     legislation that would establish a permanent and significant \n     source of conservation funding. A number of promising \n     legislative proposals would take revenues from non-renewable \n     offshore oil and gas resources and reinvest them in the \n     protection of renewable resources such as our wildlife, \n     public lands, coasts, oceans, historic and cultural \n     treasures, and recreation. Securing this funding would allow \n     us to build upon the pioneering conservation tradition that \n     Teddy Roosevelt initiated at the beginning of the century.\n       The vast majority of Americans recognize the duty we have \n     to protect and conserve our rich cultural and natural \n     legacies for future generations. A diverse array of interest, \n     including sportsmen and women, conservationists, historic \n     preservationists, park and recreation enthusiasts, urban \n     advocates, the faith community, business interests, state and \n     local governments, and others, support conservation funding \n     legislation because they recognize it is essential to fulfill \n     this obligation.\n       We call upon you and your colleagues to seize this \n     unprecedented opportunity. Pass legislation that would make a \n     substantial and reliable investment in the conservation of \n     our nation's wildlife; public lands; coastal and marine \n     resources; historic and cultural treasures; state, local and \n     urban parks and recreation programs; and open space. Design a \n     bill that provides significant conservation benefits, is free \n     of harmful environmental impacts to our coastal and ocean \n     resources, and does not unduly hinder land acquisition \n     programs.\n       An historic conservation funding bill is within our grasp. \n     It will be an accomplishment that all can celebrate. We look \n     to Congress to make this legislation a reality.\n           Sincerely,\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will read one paragraph from this petition. Let us \ngrab the opportunity now, to:\n\n       Pass legislation that would make a substantial and reliable \n     investment in the conservation of our Nation's wildlife; \n     public lands; coastal and marine resources; historic and \n     cultural treasures; State, local and urban parks, and \n     recreation programs; and open spaces. [Let us] design a bill \n     that provides significant conservation benefits, is free of \n     harmful environmental impacts to our coastal and ocean \n     resources and does not unduly hinder land acquisition \n     programs.\n\n  I believe we can meet these goals as we negotiate the detail and \ncompromise in the next session.\n  The Presiding Officer, being from the State of Alabama, has been a \ngreat leader in this effort. I look forward to working with the Senator \nnext year. I am pleased to tell our leader I will be removing my hold \non foreign ops because we have made some progress on this, and I look \nforward to working harder to make this a reality for the people of \nAmerica the next time we meet.\n  I yield my remaining time.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Louisiana leaves the floor, I want \nto express to her the appreciation of the entire minority caucus. There \nis no Member of the Senate who is more astute, works harder, and has a \nbetter understanding of the issues that face the Senate, which was well \ndemonstrated by her work on this issue about which she feels fervently. \nWe are grateful at this late date the Senator\n\n[[Page S14678]]\n\nhas been willing to work with members to release the hold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14678-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14678-S14687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999--CONTINUED\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we are back on the \nbankruptcy legislation; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Schumer amendment has not \nbeen disposed of.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. With the understanding of the Senator from New York, I \nask unanimous consent we temporarily lay aside that amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \npreviously talked to the Senator from Massachusetts about time \nagreement on his amendment. I prefer to forego a time agreement and \nhave him proceed accordingly. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2652\n\n(Purpose: To amend the definition of current monthly income to exclude \n                       social security benefits)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I call up amendment numbered 2652.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2652.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 11, line 2, insert before the first semicolon ``, \n     but excludes benefits received under the Social Security \n     Act''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a rather simple amendment. The \namendment I have offered will protect a debtor's Social Security \nbenefits during bankruptcy. This amendment is very important to older \nAmericans. I hope my colleagues will support it as our House colleagues \nsupported it last year.\n  As currently written, the means test in the pending bill will require \ndebtors to use their Social Security benefits to repay creditors. My \namendment excludes Social Security benefits from the definition of \n``current monthly income'' and ensures that those benefits will never \nbe used to repay credit card debt and other debt.\n  This amendment is particularly important to seniors. Between 1991 and \n1999 the numbers of people over 65 who filed bankruptcy grew by 120 \npercent. If we look over the figures from 1991 to 1999 by age of \npetitioner, we see the growth of those that are going through \nbankruptcy primarily have increased in the older citizen age group. \nThis is primarily a result of the downsizing, dismissing older workers \nand because of health care costs--primarily they have been dropped from \nhealth insurance. As the various statistics show, increasing numbers of \nindividuals have been impacted because of the prescription drugs.\n  Debtors filing a medical reason for bankruptcy, as the chart shows, \nreflects the fact we have gotten a significant increase in the number \nof older people who have gone into bankruptcy. The debtors who file as \nmedical reasons for bankruptcy, we find, increases dramatically for \nolder workers primarily because of health care costs more than any \nother factor.\n  We believe very strongly those individuals, most of whom are \ndependent upon Social Security as virtually their only income ought to \nhave those funds protected so they will be able to live in peace with \nsome degree of security and some degree of dignity.\n  This is sufficiently important. One can ask, why are we doing this \nnow rather than before? The reason it was not necessary before is \nbecause the Social Security effectively was protected with a series of \nprotections that were included in the existing bankruptcy law which \nhave not been included in this legislation. Therefore, without this \nkind of an amendment, they would be eligible for creditors. We think \nprotecting our senior citizens, those on Social Security, as a matter \nof both public policy and the fact of the importance of their \ncontributions, obviously, in terms of society, should be protected \nduring their senior years.\n  Today, many Americans work long and hard into the senior years. A \ngrowing percentage of the population is over the age of 85 and \npredominantly female. We see over the period of the next 10 years our \nelderly population will double and the increase in the percentage of \nwomen is going to increase significantly, as well. Others may be able \nto find alternative employment but at substantially lower wages or \nwithout health and other benefits that become increasingly important \nwith age.\n  In spite of all of the efforts to slow down the discrimination \nagainst elderly, in too many circumstances in our country today, the \nelderly are discriminated against in terms of employment.\n  Older Americans sometimes resort to short-term, high-interest credit \nwhen faced with unemployment because they assume their unemployment \nwill be temporary. They hope their use of credit or credit card debt \nwill serve as a bridge to cover the necessities until they start \nreceiving paychecks again. Due to their age, however, many of these \nindividuals never earn a salary comparable to the pay they lost. They \nfind themselves unable to deal with the new debt they have incurred. \nWhen they have nowhere else to turn, they sometimes turn to the safety \nvalue of bankruptcy.\n\n  Older Americans are also more frequent victims of predatory lending \npractices. Sometimes, bankruptcy is the most viable avenue for an \nelderly person to address the financial consequences of being \nvictimized by unscrupulous lenders. It is unfortunate that Senator \nDurbin's amendment to address that problem was defeated last week.\n  Studies of the problems facing older Americans tell us the same sad \nstory. In one study, one in ten older Americans reported that they \nfiled for bankruptcy after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate with \ntheir creditors. In some cases, their creditors threatened them with \nseizure of property, or placed harassing collection calls. Some of \nthese senior citizens explained that they have been the victims of \ncredit scams, and they were seeking relief in the bankruptcy courts.\n  For example, a 70-year-old woman filed for bankruptcy after her son \ndiscovered that she has allowed herself to become involved in a number \nof dubious financial transactions, including buying more than six \ndifferent expensive and duplicative life insurance policies and \nspending several thousand dollars on sweepstakes contests. At the time \nof her bankruptcy, she had mortgaged her previously mortgage-free home \nfor more than $74,000 to try and pay off her debts. She was in danger \nof losing the home she shared with her husband who was in failing \nhealth.\n  The bottom line is that bankruptcy shouldn't be made more difficult \nfor those who are depending on Social Security for their livelihood.\n  Social Security was developed to ensure that seniors can live their \ngolden years in dignity. If we allow Social Security income to be \nconsidered while determining whether someone is eligible for \nbankruptcy, a portion of those benefits could be used in a manner \ninconsistent with Congress' intent.\n  Some of my colleagues oppose this amendment because they argue that \nwealthy seniors would be the beneficiaries. But, practically speaking, \nwealthy debtors rarely use Chapter 7--they've more likely to file under \nChapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.\n  For very high income individuals, like Ross Perot, social security \nrepresents a very small percentage of their total income. Indeed, the \nmaximum social security retirement benefit for a new 65-year-old \nretiree in 1997 was $16,000. For the Ross Perot in this country, \n$16,000 is a rounding error. His income is so high that including or \nexcluding $6,000 changes his income by only a tiny percentage. But for \nthe poor widow who gets 90 percent of her income from social security \nit makes a big difference.\n  Rich debtors who file in Chapter 7 would be caught by the means test, \nwhether or not the courts include Social Security income as part of the \ndebtor's ``current monthly income.''\n  It is important to realize that even though we do tax individuals on \nhigher Social Security, 75 percent of our seniors pay no tax on Social \nSecurity because they are below $25,000 in income.\n\n[[Page S14679]]\n\nthis is the group about which we are talking.\n  For two-thirds of American seniors, Social Security income represents \nmore than 50 percent of the their total income, and for 42 percent of \nseniors, it represents three-quarters of their total income. That is \nbasically what we are talking about. We will hear: We can't accept this \nbecause it will create some loophole for our seniors.\n  We have to realize that for 42 percent of all seniors, Social \nSecurity represents three-quarters of their total income. Furthermore, \n95 percent of all workers never reach the maximum Social Security \nbenefit. That means only 5 percent of workers earn more than $72,000, \nand the average person is well below that income level. The myth of the \nwealthy senior using this amendment to avoid their obligations is just \nthat--it is a myth.\n  The purpose of Social Security is to guarantee there is a financial \nfoundation provided for all senior citizens to ensure their basic \nneeds--food, shelter, clothing, and medicines--are met. For two-thirds \nof senior citizens, Social Security provides more than half of their \nincome, and Social Security benefits are hardly enough, in many cases, \nto meet these basic needs of seniors. Certainly, they cannot survive on \nless.\n  If we are serious about providing financial security and personal \ndignity for the elderly, we must protect their Social Security benefits \nfrom claims in bankruptcy. Otherwise, we run the risk of vulnerable \nsenior citizens being left with virtually nothing. In many cases, these \nare the people who are not healthy enough to return to work, who \ncertainly lack the physical stamina to work the extra hours or get a \nsecond job. Social Security benefits are all they have--all they ever \nwill have--and these few dollars are essential to their financial \nsurvival. There is a higher concern here than recovering every last \ndollar for creditors. It is guaranteeing the elderly some measure of \nfinancial security in their declining years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Massachusetts. Also, for the benefit of everyone in \nthe Chamber and within the sound of my voice, on this bill we have \nmoved along significantly from 300-plus amendments down to fewer than \n10 amendments.\n  I hope we can continue working on this bill. I do not see any reason \nwhy we cannot finish this legislation tonight. We have a few \namendments. I have heard it being rumored that we are going out early \ntonight. If the majority wants a bankruptcy bill, they can have a \nbankruptcy bill. The minority is not holding up the bankruptcy bill. We \nhave, as I indicated, fewer than 10 amendments. A number of those \nSenators have agreed to time limits.\n  It is a situation where, with all the work that has been done for \nyears by the manager of the bill--not a matter of weeks but for years--\nthe goal is in sight, and we should move forward and pass this much-\nneeded legislation. I repeat, the problem is not with the minority. We \nare willing to work as late tonight as possible. We were willing to \nwork yesterday. I hope we can move forward on these amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor for a moment to \ncommend both Senator Grassley, the manager on the Republican side, and \nour very distinguished assistant Democratic leader. We started the \nconsideration of this bill several days ago. As I understand it, 20 \namendments were filed. We are now down to fewer than 10 amendments.\n  As I understand it, there is a potential time agreement on virtually \nevery amendment. Virtually every Senator has expressed their interest \nin bringing this bill to a conclusion and are prepared to accept time \nlimits.\n  I further understand the majority is giving some consideration now to \ngoing out early tonight after we have had a couple votes. I hope that \nisn't the case because I would like to see if we could finish this bill \neither tonight or tomorrow. There is no reason why we cannot finish it \nand move on to other matters. There are a number of other matters \npending.\n  So I speak for a lot of our colleagues in expressing our gratitude to \nthe distinguished assistant Democratic leader for his effort yet again. \nHe has done this on so many bills, but on this bill in particular he \nhas really done an extraordinary job of not only working to accommodate \nSenators but also to manage the legislation on our side, along with \nSenators Leahy and Torricelli, and, of course, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Grassley, for his work in working with Senators \nwho wish to offer amendments.\n  I know some of these amendments have been accepted, and some of these \namendments will require rollcalls. The point is, let's get the work \ndone. Let's finish either tonight or tomorrow, but let's finish the \nbill.\n  There was a time when I feared we would not finish this legislation \nthis year. Maybe that is the only silver lining for those of us who \nwould like to bring this matter to closure: That we will have the \nopportunity to finish this legislation.\n  Many members still have amendments. Some of these amendments that are \nyet to be offered may tell the story with regard to Democratic support. \nThere are some good amendments that are still pending. Senator Kennedy \nhas a very good amendment that needs to be addressed. I hope we can do \nthat and move on the other Democratic amendments that I know Senator \nSchumer and others have indicated they are prepared to offer.\n  So we are getting down now to the final few amendments. I hope we \nwill just keep the heat on, and finish up this critical legislation \nmany of us have worked so long and so hard to enact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have two unanimous consent requests.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2659, as modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the first unanimous consent is on an \namendment, as modified. It is amendment No. 2659. I send the \nmodification to the desk and ask unanimous consent it be considered \nagreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2659), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 18, line 5 insert ``(including a briefing conducted \n     by telephone or on the Internet)'' after ``briefing''.\n       On page 19, line 15, strike ``petition'' and insert \n     ``petition, except that the count, for cause, may order an \n     additional 15 days.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:30 we \nproceed to two stacked votes on the pending Feinstein amendment and the \nSchumer amendment, and do it in that order, with 4 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form between the two votes, and that no amendments \nbe in order prior to the votes. Maybe I ought to correct this. I think \nwe should say there would be 2 minutes divided on the Feinstein \namendment and then 2 minutes before we vote on the Schumer amendment--\nor 4.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I want to be sure. Is it \namendment No. 2761? Is that the Schumer amendment referred to by the \nSenator from Iowa?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Amendment No. 2762.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Amendment No. 2762.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So let me once again state this: I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 4:30 we proceed to two stacked votes on the pending \nFeinstein amendment, with 4 minutes equally divided to discuss the \nFeinstein amendment, and then at the end of that vote have 4 minutes \nequally divided to discuss the Schumer amendment, and then immediately \nproceed to a vote on or in relation to the Schumer amendment, and that \nno amendments be in order prior to the votes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, could I ask the manager of \nthe bill about why we can't vote on amendment No. 2761, also a Schumer \namendment?\n\n[[Page S14680]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Which amendment is that?\n  Mr. REID. The Schumer-Santorum amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have an objection from the Banking Committee on that \none at this point. And also, for the benefit of Senator Kennedy, who \nhas been very patient, I have one Senator I have to consult before we \ngo to a final decision on that amendment. But I think we can take care \nof this when we are over here voting, if you would let us proceed to \nthese. And then I will work with you to get to the bottom of that at \nthe time of that vote. Is that OK?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, to sum up my amendment, what this \nbankruptcy bill is all about is encouraging debtor responsibility--in \nother words, to the extent that an individual possibly can, they should \nrepay their debt. That is one side of it.\n  I think to the extent the credit industry can be responsible, you \nneed to have a balance between the two. Right now, there is not a \nbalance between the two. I think we all know of people who have a \nnumber of credit cards who do not have the income even to pay back the \nminimum debt or the minimum monthly payment plus interest over a period \nof time.\n  Let me give an example. If you have a $1,500 debt and your minimum \nmonthly payment is $25 and you have no late fees, no new purchases, at \n19.8-percent interest, it takes 282 months to pay that debt off. I know \npeople in this situation who shouldn't have credit cards, who should \nhave been checked out, who have six, who are going into bankruptcy \nbecause they didn't understand this simple concept.\n  What the amendment before you would do is ask the Federal Reserve to \ndo a study of lending practices in this area and make public their \nfindings, and also have the ability to set new regulations if they \nbelieve those regulations are warranted.\n  This amendment was passed a year ago by a voice vote. It was removed \nin conference. The amendment would be accepted. My concern is that it \nwould again be deleted in conference. Therefore, I have asked for the \nyeas and nays. I am hopeful this Senate will go on record as supporting \nthis study by the Federal Reserve.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the time \nwe have on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2756. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 82, nays 16, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 368 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--82\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--16\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Coverdell\n     Enzi\n     Gramm\n     Hagel\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n       \n     Fitzgerald\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     McCain\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2756) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, 4 minutes are now \nevenly divided on the Schumer amendment No. 2716.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum because we can work \nsomething out and maybe avoid a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2652\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wish to make it clear, what I am going to ask \nunanimous consent on now is unrelated to what we are trying to work out \non the Schumer amendment.\n  Mr. President, the managers have agreed to accept Senator Kennedy's \namendment, so I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2652 be \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2652) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed, \nthen, to 2 minutes of debate on that side, 2 minutes on this side, and \nthen we go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the regular order. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas \nand nays be vitiated on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there will be no more rollcalls today. \nWe hope to continue debating some amendments, and they will be stacked \nto be taken at a time determined by the leader tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again, I reiterate what I said before: The \nSenator from Iowa and I, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, \nand Senator Hatch have all been working very hard. We have gone from \n300 some odd amendments down to only a half dozen or so remaining. I \nwill continue to work with my friend from Iowa to try to clear whatever \nwe can.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any votes \nordered today be stacked for a time to be determined by the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know my good friend from Alabama is here\n\n[[Page S14681]]\n\nas manager on his side. I know we have no further rollcalls on this. I \nsee my friend from Wisconsin on the floor. I am wondering if we can get \nsome of the debate out of the way, and I wonder if we might yield to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin and let him begin debate on his amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Vermont that in looking over these \namendments, which have gone from 320 to now probably 7 or 8, a handful \nof amendments, the Senator understands that the movement of this \nbankruptcy bill is not being slowed down on this side of the aisle. Our \nMembers have been very cooperative. Would he agree to that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. The Senator from Nevada has cleared out an awful lot \nof them. I think we have cleared 300-some-odd down to half a dozen or \nso. We could, for example, vote tonight without further debate on the \nSchumer-Santorum amendment, No. 2761. We could stagger them in the \nmorning. I came in at 10 yesterday morning to be prepared to manage the \nbill on this side, and, for whatever reason, we stayed in morning \nbusiness until 4 in the afternoon. What I am trying to do here--and I \nknow the Senator from Alabama is on the floor, too--if there are things \nwe can take care of on the bill tonight, let's do it.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, Senator Wellstone has two \namendments he will offer first thing in the morning. Senator Feingold \nhas one amendment that has already been offered. He wants to debate it \nsome more, and he said he would do that tonight. We also have Senator \nFeingold who has one other amendment he wishes to offer at a subsequent \ntime. We also have a Dodd amendment that, I think with the managers' \nbill, we have worked out, and it has been agreed to by the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee and the manager. Senator Sarbanes has an \namendment he wishes to offer. Senator Harkin has an amendment he said \nhe may offer tonight. We are basically finished.\n  The two things that are holding this up--and we should not play \naround with it anymore--are an amendment by the Senator from New York \ndealing with clinics, on which he has agreed to a half-hour time limit, \nand we have the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, who has agreed to 17 \nminutes on an amendment relating to gun manufacturers.\n  I say to my friend, in short, we have almost nothing left. So it \nwould seem to me we should move forward as rapidly as possible and \nfinish this bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on the order, I think it would be \nappropriate for Senator Feingold to proceed at this time. Further, I \nthink we will proceed without unanimous consent after that. Senator \nGrassley will be back, and we can decide what to do then.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Paul Barger \nhave the privilege of the floor for this day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2748\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with \nrespect to amendment No. 2748.\n  I wish to speak on the landlord-tenant amendment I offered last week \nand, in particular, take a few minutes to respond to some of the \narguments made against it by the Senator from Alabama. This amendment \nis designed to lessen the harsh consequences of section 311 of the bill \nwith respect to tenants while at the same time protecting the \nlegitimate financial interests of landlords.\n  Just to review, current law provides for an automatic stay of \neviction proceedings upon the filing of a bankruptcy case. Landlords \nmay apply for relief at that stage so the eviction can proceed. But it \nis a process that often takes a few months.\n  Section 311 of Senate bill 625, the bill we are considering, \neliminates the stay in all landlord-tenant cases so that an eviction \ncan proceed immediately. In essence, my amendment would allow tenants \nto remain in their apartments while trying to sort out the difficult \nconsequences of bankruptcy if, and only if, they are willing to pay the \nrent that comes due after they file for bankruptcy. If the tenant fails \nto pay the rent, the stay can be lifted 15 days after the landlord \nprovides notice to the court that the rent has not been paid. If the \nreason for eviction is drug use or property damage, the stay can also \nbe lifted after 15 days.\n  Finally, if the lease has actually expired by its terms--in other \nwords, if there is no more time on the lease and the landlord plans to \nmove into the property--then, again, after 15 days notice the eviction \ncan proceed. This 15-day notice period does not apply if the tenant has \nfiled for bankruptcy previously. In other words, in cases of repeat \nfilings, the stay never takes effect, just as under section 311 in this \nbill.\n  So we are all clear on why this whole issue came up in the first \nplace, the main abuse that has been alleged is in Los Angeles County, \nwhere unscrupulous bankruptcy petition preparers advertise filing \nbankruptcy as a way to live rent free. Under my amendment, first of \nall, you could never live rent free. The debtor must pay rent after \nfiling for bankruptcy. If the debtor misses a rent payment, the stay \nwill be lifted 15 days later. Second of all, the automatic stay does \nnot take effect if the tenant is a repeat filer. So we take care of \nthis problem of the repeat filer, which is exactly what the Senator \nfrom Alabama and others portrayed in committee as the reason this \nprovision is needed.\n  So my amendment gets at the abuse, and it protects the rights and \neconomic interests of the landlord. What it eliminates, though, is the \npunitive aspect of this amendment and the possibility that tenants who \nare willing and able to pay rent once they get a little breathing room \nfrom their other creditors will instead be put out on the street.\n  I am, frankly, disappointed that my colleague from Alabama insists on \nthe harsh aspects of section 311 when my amendment would get at the \nproblem he has identified just as well.\n  The Senator from Alabama argued yesterday that somehow my amendment \nchanges current law and moves us in the direction of litigation and \ndelay. On the contrary, my amendment leaves intact the current law that \nallows landlords to get relief from the automatic stay. Let me be very \nclear about that. My amendment does not eliminate the ability of \nlandlords to apply for relief from the stay under current law. The law \nnow gives debtors some breathing room in legal proceedings, including \neviction proceedings. But landlords can apply for relief from the stay. \nIt is not an abuse of the law to take advantage of the automatic stay \nto get your affairs in order. Some tenants use that time to work out a \npayment schedule for their back rent so they can avoid eviction. Most \nlandlords don't want to throw people out on the street. They just want \nto be paid. My amendment requires that they be paid once bankruptcy is \nfiled, or the eviction can proceed immediately. But even if the rent is \npaid while the bankruptcy case is pending, if a landlord can still seek \nrelief from stay under the normal procedures and press forward with the \neviction.\n  I frankly think that most landlords will be happy to let a tenant \nstay as long as the rent is being paid. Who knows, if the bankruptcy is \nsuccessful, especially if it is a Chapter 13, the tenant may be able to \npay the past due rent. That certainly is not going to happen if the \ntenant is evicted. But if the landlord really doesn't want the tenant \nto stay, the landlord can seek relief. So my amendment doesn't allow a \ntenant to stay in the apartment indefinitely by resuming payment of \nrent. By no means does this amendment permit a tenant to stay in an \napartment indefinitely without a lease.\n  And any suggestion to the contrary is just wrong. It doesn't do that \nat all. It just covers the few months after the bankruptcy petition is \nfiled when the debtor is most vulnerable and the debtor is most in need \nof a roof over his or her head.\n  Now let me address one of the frequent refrains of the Senator from \nAlabama when he talks about this provision. He seems to be very \noffended by the idea that people are staying in\n\n[[Page S14682]]\n\ntheir apartments after the term of their lease has expired. Those who \nare familiar with landlord-tenant law know that this is commonplace in \nthe rental market. Many, many leases are for a term of one year but \nconvert to a month to month lease when the year is up. The contract \nessentially remains in force, but the term has expired. There is \nnothing wrong with that. It is perfectly legitimate. Typically, the \nconversion to month-to-month tenancy is provided for in standard lease \nlanguage.\n  This is not an abuse. It is the way many leases proceed in this \ncountry on a day-to-day basis.\n  Furthermore, the language of section 311 doesn't lift the stay when \nthe term of a lease has expired but rather in cases where ``a rental \nagreement has terminated under the lease agreement or applicable state \nlaw.'' Well, most rental agreements ``terminate'' when a rent payment \nis missed. So section 311 applies in all landlord-tenant cases, not \njust those where the lease term has expired.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that both the bill we passed last \nyear, and the conference report had a form of the protection that my \namendment provides for debtors. Section 311 of the bill that we are \nworking on now is harsher on tenant debtor than the conference report \nfrom last year and than the House bill that passed earlier this year.\n  Now let me respond to what I think is the core of Senator Sessions' \nobjection to my amendment. He said last week that the automatic stay is \nalways lifted, that the tenant never wins. So why not just get rid of \nthe stay. It's just a waste of time and money for the landlord.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter here from a debtor's attorney named \nHenry Sommer. Mr. Sommer is an expert in consumer bankruptcy cases. He \nis the author of the widely used treatise Consumer Bankruptcy Law and \nPractice, which is published by the National Consumer Law Center. He \nindicates in his letter that has represented thousands of low-income \nconsumer debtors over the past 25 years. I ask unanimous consent that \nMr. Sommer's letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Mr. Sommers heard the remarks of the \nSenator from Alabama last week in opposition to my amendment. He \nwrites:\n\n       The statement was made that landlords always prevail in \n     automatic stay motions. This is not correct. In my personal \n     experience, I doubt that landlords have prevailed in even 20% \n     of the cases. in most of the other cases, the family paid the \n     rent and the motion was either withdrawn or denied.\n\n  Mr. Sommers goes on to state:\n\n       The more important point is that in most cases no motion is \n     brought by the landlord. The automatic say does what it is \n     intended to do. In these cases, the family that was facing \n     eviction cures the rent arrears and remains in its apartment. \n     The landlord is made whole, and the family is permitted the \n     time necessary to reorganize its finances.\n\n  Mr. Sommers also discusses my amendment.\n\n       To the extent there are abuses in the current system, your \n     amendment will provide prompt and efficient relief by giving \n     landlords a streamlined procedure that could be pursued \n     quickly and without an attorney.\n\n  That's a crucial point, Mr. President, because one of the concerns \nexpressed by the Senator from Alabama is the expense and inconvenience \nof the relief from stay process for landlords under current law. Mr. \nSommers concludes:\n\n       Your amendment would make it impossible to obtain \n     significant delay simply by filing a bankruptcy petition, as \n     can occur today. But it would not hurt the innocent family, \n     struggling to get its finances together, that is able to \n     begin making rent payments and cure its rent default.\n\n  That is really the crucial point Mr. President. We are talking about \nreal people here. People who are very vulnerable. The Senator from \nAlabama argued yesterday that a landlord may have another tenant lined \nup to move into an apartment. And he said that if my amendment were \nadopted, and I'm quoting here, ``that tenant's life may be disrupted if \nthe landlord can't deliver the premises.'' Well, Mr. President, what \nabout the life of the current tenant, very possibly a single mother \nwith children? For months she's been trying to make ends meet, but \nthe child support she is owned by her ex-husband has not been coming. \nShe misses a few rent payments as she tries to make sure her children \nare fed and their home is heated. The landlord starts eviction \nproceedings. And she is forced to file for bankruptcy.\n\n  Now once the bankruptcy is filed, and her other creditors are \ntemporarily at bay, she can pay her rent. On time and in full. What \nabout disruption to her life if we put her and her children out on the \nstreet? Do we not care about that? If the landlord is not economically \nharmed, why wouldn't we allow her to stay in her apartment for a few \nmonths more? Why can't we maintain the breathing room that the \nautomatic stay under current law provides? What is so terrible about \nthat?\n  Mr. President, this is the situation I am concerned about. I want to \nrespond in a reasonable way to the abuses that section 311 is \nsupposedly designed to address. But I don't want to cause undue \nhardship to people who are able to pay their rent while their \nbankruptcy case is pending.\n  In the spirit of compromise, I have proposed a few other changes to \nthe amendment to the Senator from Alabama, in response to some of the \nconcerns he and his staff have raised. We are trying to listen very \ncarefully to the points that the Senator from Alabama is making. First, \nI am willing to have the stay lifted not only in cases where the lease \nhas expired and the landlord wants to move into the property, but also \nin cases where the landlord wants to let a member of his or her \nimmediate family to occupy the premises. I will expand the language in \nmy amendment to cover that situation.\n  I will also expand the language to cover a situation where the lease \nhas expired and the landlord has entered into a signed and enforceable \nagreement with another tenant before the bankruptcy petition is filed. \nThat is the situation that the Senator from Alabama has suggested \ncreates an unbearable hardship for the new tenant. So if a new lease \nhas been made before the debtor files for bankruptcy, the landlord can \napply for expedited relief from the stay.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it has been suggested that some debtors will \ntry to game the system by filing for bankruptcy the day after a rent \npayment is due, thus giving themselves almost a free month in the \napartment before my amendment would apply. I am willing to try to stop \nthis kind of abuse by requiring debtors to pay any rent that comes due \nup to 10 days before the filing of the petition.\n  Mr. President, I am trying to be reasonable. I am going to make these \nchanges in a second degree amendment and I hope the Senator from \nAlabama will accept the amendment. I want my colleagues to understand \nthat this amendment is designed to address the abuses that the Senator \nfrom Alabama has identified, but do it in a much more reasonable way, \nso that we can protect some very vulnerable people from being thrown \nout on the streets at a very difficult time in their lives.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2779 to Amendment No. 2748\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2779 to amendment No. 2748.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1, line 5, strike all after ``(23)'' and insert the \n     following:\n       under subsection (a)(3), of the commencement or \n     continuation of any eviction, unlawful detainer action, or \n     similar proceeding by a lessor against a debtor involving \n     residential real property--\n       ``(A) on which the debtor resides as a tenant under a \n     rental agreement; and\n       ``(B) with respect to which--\n       ``(i) the debtor fails to make a rent payment that \n     initially becomes due under the rental agreement or \n     applicable State law after the date of filing of the petition \n     or within the 10 days prior to the filing of the petition, if \n     the lessor files with the court a certification that the \n     debtor has not made a payment for rent and serves a copy of \n     the certification to the debtor; or\n       ``(ii) the debtor's lease has expired according to its \n     terms and (a) the lessor or a member of the lessor's \n     immediate family intends to personally occupy that property, \n     or (b)\n\n[[Page S14683]]\n\n     the lessor has entered into an enforceable lease agreement \n     with another tenant prior to the filing of the petition, if \n     the lessor files with the court a certification of such facts \n     and serves a copy of the certification to the debtor;\n       ``(24) under subsection (a)(3), of the commencement or \n     continuation of any eviction, unlawful detainer action, or \n     similar proceeding by a lessor against a debtor involving \n     residential real property, if during the 1-year period \n     preceding the filing of the petition, the debtor--\n       ``(A) commenced another case under this title; and\n       ``(B) failed to make a rent payment that initially became \n     due under an applicable rental agreement or State law after \n     the date of filing of the petition for that other case; or\n       ``(25) under subsection (a)(3), of an eviction action based \n     on endangerment of property or the use of an illegal drug, if \n     the lessor files with the court a certification that the \n     debtor has endangered property or used an illegal drug and \n     serves a copy of the certification to the debtor.''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end of the flush material at the end \n     of the subsection the following: ``With respect to the \n     applicability of paragraph (23) or (25) to a debtor with \n     respect to the commencement or continuation of a proceeding \n     described in that paragraph, the exception to the automatic \n     stay shall become effective on the 15th day after the lessor \n     meets the filing and notification requirements under that \n     paragraph, unless the debtor takes such action as may be \n     necessary to address the subject of the certification or the \n     court orders that the exception to the automatic stay shall \n     not become effective or provides for a later date of \n     applicability.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this second-degree amendment \nincorporates the modifications I just described. I hope it will be \nacceptable to the managers of the bill. I have actually shared these \nideas and changes with the managers and with the Senator from Alabama.\n  If not, I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n                                                      Law Offices,\n\n\n                                       Miller, Frank & Miller,\n\n                              Philadelphia, PA, November 10, 1999.\n     Senator Russ Feingold,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I listened to some of the debate \n     concerning your amendment that would moderate some of the \n     landlord-tenant provisions of S. 625. I am writing to let you \n     know that some of the statements made in opposition to your \n     amendment are not in my experience accurate. (I have \n     represented thousands of low-income consumer debtors over the \n     last 25 years and also spend time educating and consulting \n     with other bankruptcy lawyers around the country.)\n       The statement was made that landlords always prevail in \n     automatic stay motions. This is not correct. In my personal \n     experience, I doubt that landlords have prevailed in even 20% \n     of the cases. In most of the other cases, the family paid the \n     rent due and the motion was either withdrawn or denied.\n       Overall, more than 20% of landlord stay motions probably \n     are granted, because no one denies that in a few cities there \n     have been widespread abuses (spurred by nonattorney petition \n     preparers, not by attorneys) and when landlords have gone to \n     court they have prevailed in almost all such cases. However, \n     even in these places the problem was being solved even \n     without legislation. I noticed that the figures given for Los \n     Angeles county (where the abuses were worst) were from 1996. \n     It is my understanding that changes in state law and in \n     bankruptcy court procedures have significantly reduced the \n     abuses since then.\n       The more important point is that in most cases, no motion \n     is brought by the landlord. The automatic stay does what it \n     was intended to do. In these cases, the family that was \n     facing eviction cures the rent arrears and remains in its \n     apartment. The landlord is made whole, and the family is \n     permitted the time necessary to reorganize its finances. \n     Thus, even if it is true that in most cases where landlords \n     seek relief from the stay, such relief is granted (no data is \n     actually kept on the results of such motions), in the large \n     majority of bankruptcy cases tenants catch up on their rent \n     arrears, the landlord is satisfied, no motion for relief from \n     the stay is brought, and the family remains in its home.\n       To the extent there are abuses in the current system, your \n     amendment will provide prompt and efficient relief by giving \n     landlords a streamlined procedure that could be pursued \n     quickly and without an attorney. Your amendment would make it \n     impossible to obtain any significant delay simply by filing a \n     bankruptcy petition, as can occur today. But it would not \n     hurt the innocent family, struggling to get its finances \n     together, that is able to begin making rent payments and cure \n     its rent default.\n       Please contact me if you need further information about \n     tenants in bankruptcy.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Henry J. Sommer.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin. I know he cares deeply about this issue. He has made \nsome changes in the previous amendment that make the bill more \npalatable. However, it still runs afoul of common sense and efficient \noperation of the bankruptcy system. Furthermore, it will allow abuse of \nthe system in a way that is unjustified and unprecedented in terms of \nany other creditor of a person who goes into bankruptcy.\n  We are asking a landlord for certain periods of time to extend free \nrent, when the grocer is not required to give free groceries and the \ngas station is not required to give free gas.\n  Let me make a few points about this matter. It is a subject of great \nabuse in the United States. That is why we are here. The bankruptcy law \nwas last amended in any significant fashion in 1978. Since that time, \nwe have found that a large bankruptcy bar has developed. This has been \nvery good in many ways, but also this skilled, experienced and \nspecialized bar has learned how to utilize the Federal bankruptcy laws \nto maximize benefits for their clients, as they believe it is their \nduty to do. In the process, they have created abuses of innocent \ncreditors and landlords, among others.\n  That is not what we are about. Our responsibility, as a Congress, is \nnot to blame the lawyers, is not to blame the tenants who take \nadvantage of these things. The responsibility of Congress is to pass \nlaws that are not easily abused and that end in just results.\n  One of the most abused sections of the bankruptcy law has been the \nlandlord-tenant situation. First, eviction procedures are set forth in \nthe laws of all 50 States. One cannot simply throw somebody out of \ntheir apartment. One has to file an eviction notice, go to the State \ncourt, prove the case, and eventually get the tenant out. Many believe \nthat process is far too prolonged and far too costly. That is what the \nlaw is. In many instances, it is good because it provides tenants \nopportunities to get their affairs together.\n  With the current bankruptcy law, tenants have responded to ads in \nnewspapers and fliers passed out in neighborhoods and throughout the \ncommunities. Those ads say: Up to 7 months free rent. Call us; we will \ntake care of you. We guarantee you 2 to 7 months of delays in payment \nof your rent and guarantee you will not be evicted under those \ncircumstances.\n  How can that happen? Say a person is behind in his rent and also \nbehind in other payments, and people have filed lawsuits against him, \nand he or she has gone to the lawyer to ask what to do, and the lawyer \nfiles for bankruptcy. Maybe the lease the person had with the landlord \nhas already expired. Maybe it requires him to pay his rent monthly, and \nit has been 4 or 5 months since the rent has been paid, and the \nlandlord has already commenced eviction actions against the tenant. \nWhen that happens, the matter normally goes forward in State court.\n  Under normal State laws for removal of someone who does not pay their \nrent, when a bankruptcy court is involved, the eviction case is stayed; \nan automatic stay is issued. The landlord cannot proceed with that \neviction until the stay is lifted in the bankruptcy court. Once that \nhappens, the landlord can go back to State court and continue with his \nlawful eviction actions.\n  This has caused quite a bit of gaming of the system. For example, I \nwill share with Members some statistics from California. The Los \nAngeles County Sheriffs Department estimates that 3,886 residents filed \nfor bankruptcy in 1996 simply to prevent the execution of valid court-\nordered evictions. The sheriff has the responsibility of actually \nevicting the tenant. The Sheriffs Department of Los Angeles said these \n3,886 bankruptcy petitions represent over 7 percent of all the eviction \ncases handled by the department and that losses have been estimated at \nnearly $6 million per year in that county. Some people routinely flaunt \nthat automatic stay provision--lawyers do--that advertises that persons \nmay live rent free by filing bankruptcy.\n\n  One bankruptcy flier sent out said for a fee the lawyers will use \nmore moves than Magic Johnson to prolong the eviction process.\n  This is not good. A judge in California has dealt with this matter \nover and over again, and in an opinion, this\n\n[[Page S14684]]\n\nis what Judge Zurzolo in the Central District of California had to say \nabout the evictions and how he believes how meritless they are. This is \nfrom his written opinion:\n\n       . . . the bankruptcy courts . . . are flooded with chapter \n     7 and chapter 13 cases filed solely for the purpose of \n     delaying unlawful detainer evictions. Inevitably and swiftly \n     following this in bankruptcy court, the filing of these \n     cases, is the filing of a motion for relief of stay by the \n     landlord.\n\n  After the bankruptcy is filed and the eviction notice is stopped, the \nlandlord has to go into bankruptcy court with his lawyer and file for \nrelief from stay and say: Look, I have not been paid rent for many \nmonths; the tenant is in violation of the lease; there is no asset of \nwhich the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction. Bankruptcy judge, allow me \nto proceed with my eviction.\n  Or the landlord will say: The lease has expired. The tenant has been \nhere a year. In month 14, the lease expired. He did not extend the \nlease. I want to remove him.\n  This is what the judge continues to say in his opinion:\n\n       These relief from stay motions are rarely contested and are \n     never lost. Bankruptcy courts in our district hear dozens of \n     these stay motions weekly, none of which involves any \n     justiciable controversies of fact or law.\n\n  I don't know about the individual who says he represented a lot of \ncases and said he won some of the motions, but I don't believe they \nought to be winning them under the law if the lease has expired, and \nthat is what our amendment says. If the lease has expired, there cannot \nbe an asset of the bankruptcy estate, and if there is no asset for the \nbankruptcy court to take jurisdiction over, it has no ability to issue \nany stay orders to protect or stop any litigation that is ongoing.\n  That couldn't be the case. If the lease is behind and the payments \nhave been so far delayed that the lease has been violated and, \nlikewise, the tenant has no property interests, there is no asset \nbefore the bankruptcy court over which the bankruptcy court has \njurisdiction. The bankruptcy court essentially has jurisdiction only \nover the assets, to make sure when a person cannot pay his debts, all \nthe assets are brought into the pot and the people who should receive \nthe money from the estate get it in proper order.\n  We are talking about monumental abuse. This is a loophole that has \nbeen expanded over and over again. We are seeing record numbers of \nfilings. Many people are filing bankruptcy solely for this protection.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment, which he has worked hard to improve, is \nbetter than before, but is still unacceptable and still creates an \nunjust situation. For example, if a debtor owes rent and files for \nbankruptcy, he can wait until after his rent is due and then file it \nand have 15 days before his first rent payment is due. Then he could \nmake that payment and not make any more payments and remain on this \nproperty--maybe even when the lease has expired he can stay there--and \nnot pay the next month's rent.\n  This is the problem I have been talking about. He has 2, 3, 4 months \nnow. His lawyer is advising him how to do this. His lawyer is going to \nadvise him, first of all: Pay me. Pay your lawyer and do not pay your \nother debts until you have to. The debtor will do that. Then the \nlandlord has to get a lawyer to file a certificate of failure to pay \nrent, and once that has been approved by the court, after a further \ndelay of 15 days, then he has to go back to State court, now months \nbehind schedule, and pick up again his legitimate eviction notice.\n  Bankruptcy court ought not be for that purpose. If the people of the \nUnited States want to provide individuals without assets a place to \nlive, then we ought to do so. In fact, we do that. We have low-rent \nhousing for people with low income or rent-free housing for people who \ncannot afford it. We have benefits for people who do not have housing. \nBut why should an American citizen, a landlord, be required to provide \nto a tenant, who has violated his lease, an asset rent free that we in \nthe U.S. Congress are not willing to fund? If it is so easy and it \ncosts so little, why don't we pay for it? Why don't we tax American \npeople to pay for other people's rent? We are doing that to a degree \nright now.\n  I do not believe that is a legitimate approach to the matter. It is \nnot common sense. It is not what American law is about. When you are in \na Federal court, in a bankruptcy court, or a State court, if you have a \nlease, that is a contract, and if you violate that lease, then you lose \nthe benefit of the contract.\n  This is so basic and fundamental that I do not know how we in this \nCongress can think we can pass a law that makes American citizens \nresponsible for someone to have a place to live when they are not \npaying for it.\n  We have a number of different provisions in State law that allow \ntenants rights to hold on and refinance and maybe keep the place in \nwhich they live. That is all right. I want to continue that. If people \nwant to change that, go to your State court, change your eviction laws \nin your State, and take it to your State legislature.\n  Let's not make the bankruptcy law become a policy of social \nengineering to decide who should get special benefits and who should \npay for those benefits. In effect, it is a tax. The landlord who loses \nthis money is a person who is taxed. Indeed, we may have landlords \ngoing bankrupt if tenants do not pay rent.\n  Two-thirds of rental residences in America today are four units or \nless. That means we have an awful large number of our grandparents and \nbrothers-in-law who may have a duplex or garage apartment and are \nrenting them to people, and all of a sudden, somebody does not pay. \nThey cannot get the tenants out. The landlords are not receiving any \nmoney. Two, 3 months go by, and finally the landlord files for \neviction. Boom, the tenant files for bankruptcy. Then, the landlord has \nto hire a lawyer to go to bankruptcy court, and that is another 2, 3 \nextra months delay. The landlord is without rent for 2, 3 months, and \nthey still do not have their property back.\n  This is an abuse of bankruptcy law, and this legislation is designed \nto fix it. This bill does not change substantive landlord tenant law. \nRather, it is a change in that if certain circumstances exist, the \nlandlord does not have to hire a lawyer to go to Federal bankruptcy \ncourt to get relief.\n\n  It says there is an exemption from the automatic stay if the eviction \nproceeding was started prior to the filing of the bankruptcy. If the \nlandlord had already filed for eviction before the individual files for \nbankruptcy, the eviction process can continue as it would have \nnormally.\n  In addition, the bill says the automatic stay does not apply if an \neviction proceeding was based on the fact that the lease had already \nbeen terminated. It was a year's lease, and you are in month 13, 14, \n15, 16 and no payments have been received and the landlord wants to \nlease to another tenant. It is the landlord's property. The tenant has \nno property rights. His lease has expired, for heaven's sake.\n  I say to Senator Feingold, I respect his concern for these matters. \nStates do provide protections for persons who have difficulty paying \ntheir rent.\n  Also, many landlords all over America try to work with their tenants. \nThey do not want to change tenants if they are happy with a tenant. If \nthey can help work out the tenant's payments, for previous months, that \nis a courtesy extended by small landlords, two-thirds of whom have four \nunits or less. Those courtesies can turn sour in a hurry if, after \nmonths of working with a tenant, the tenant becomes further and further \nbehind in rent. Boom, a bankruptcy petition is filed; boom, they are \nstayed from eviction; months go by and the landlord has to hire a \nlawyer and great cost is incurred. This is an abuse of the system, and \nI must oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am disappointed in the response of the \nSenator from Alabama. His comments to the effect that the only thing we \nshould be considering is State laws having to do with leases and \ncontracts almost suggests to me he does not believe there is any role \nfor Federal bankruptcy law.\n  Bankruptcy law is contemplated in the U.S. Constitution. It certainly \nwas not understood there would be no role at all for Federal bankruptcy \nlaw to have an impact on people's lives in our States, whether it be \nAlabama or Wisconsin. The automatic stay is an integral part of the \nfederal bankruptcy\n\n[[Page S14685]]\n\nlaws and its purpose is not just to protect the property of the estate \nbut also to provide some breathing room for the debtor.\n  I will be the first to concede to the Senator from Alabama that one \nof the concerns in bankruptcy has to be making sure creditors get paid \nas much as possible and as efficiently as possible. That is legitimate. \nAnd a second important concern is to make sure people do not abuse the \nbankruptcy system.\n  But the concern the Senator from Alabama refuses to address, refuses \nto discuss, is that the bankruptcy law is supposed to help people get \nback on their feet. I will tell you that one lousy way to help people \nget back on their feet is to kick them out of their apartments, when it \nserves no financial interest of the landlord for that to happen.\n\n  The Senator from Alabama simply refuses to address the example I gave \nof a single woman with children, who is not getting her child support, \nwho wants to and is prepared to pay her rent and is simply running into \ntrouble and is ready to pay it again after she files for bankruptcy and \nhas a stay against her other creditors. In the world that the Senator \nfrom Alabama portrays, this person loses out. This is deeply troubling \nto me.\n  What more can you do than listen to a colleague give hypothetical \nafter hypothetical after hypothetical about what might be wrong with \nthe amendment and try to specifically address those concerns? That is \nexactly what I have done in making the changes contained in my second \ndegree amendment.\n  So, yes, efficiency in preventing abuses is an important principle. \nLet me review: The Senator from Alabama, both in committee and on the \nfloor, has attempted to suggest that all kinds of abuses will still \ncontinue under the amendment that we have. The trouble is, the abuses \nhe cites and the statistics he cites are all irrelevant to my \namendment. My amendment will prevent the abuses.\n  He talks about the abuse of lawyers who do repeat filings, especially \nin Los Angeles County. We addressed that. Under our amendment, if you \ndo multiple filings, you are out of luck; the stay is lifted \nautomatically. Essentially, the provisions of the bill that the Senator \nfrom Alabama prefers apply in that situation.\n  In committee he argued against my amendment by saying: What happens \nif a landlord wants to move back into his own place? All right. We took \ncare of that. We address that concern in the amendment. But then he \nsays: What happens if his brother wants to move into the place? Well, \nwe took care of that concern in this second degree amendment that I \njust offered.\n  Here is another example, because instead of admitting that we have \nactually dealt with some of these hypotheticals, he says: What happens \nif the landlord has a signed agreement for a new lease prior to the \nfiling of the bankruptcy? We addressed that concern too, but that still \nisn't good enough.\n  But I tell you what frustrates me the most. The Senator from Alabama \nkeeps saying that people will live rent free. It is as if I have said \nnothing here on the floor at all. It is as if I have not said, time \nafter time after time, that under my amendment a tenant cannot live \nrent free for 5 or 6 months, as the Senator has suggested. After filing \nfor bankruptcy, if you do not pay your rent as it comes due, you are \nout of there under my amendment.\n  So what is all this talk about abuses, when in each and every \nhypothetical the Senator has proposed in committee or on the floor we \nhave addressed his concern? We have addressed abuse. We have addressed \nthe fact that the system has to be efficient.\n  But what has not been addressed and what this amendment is trying to \ndeal with is what the Senator from Alabama simply ignores. He gives no \nhope; he gives no alternative to the person that I describe: the woman \nwith children, who is not getting her child support, who is willing and \nable to pay her rent once she files for bankruptcy, but the Senator \nfrom Alabama would have her booted out of her apartment with her kids \nat the very moment when she is trying to get back on her feet.\n  So I urge the Senator from Alabama to actually review all of my \nattempts to try to address his concerns so that I can feel at least \nthat this has been a process where he has raised concerns that he was \nworried about and we tried to deal with them. That is what we have been \ndoing in debating and modifying this amendment.\n  I know on other issues we have been able to do that with the Senator, \nand I appreciate that. But I urge him, surely there has to be a better \nanswer than just ``tough luck'' for these individuals who I have \ndescribed, who are not in a position where they are going to abuse the \nsystem, who cannot get month after month of free rent living, because \nthat is exactly what we dealt to prevent in the amendment. We have \nspecifically dealt with the problem of a person who tries to get more \nthan 1 month of rent free.\n\n  The whole problem with this overall bill is sort of symbolized by \nthis debate. There needs to be some balance. I have recognized, in that \nspirit, the call of the Senator from Alabama for more efficiency, the \ncall of the Senator from Alabama for preventing abuses. But where is \nthe balance? Where is the recognition that there are human beings with \nlimited resources who may need the opportunity to stay in that \napartment and pay the rent after the bankruptcy is filed?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do thank the Senator from Wisconsin for accepting \nsome changes because of my objections to his last amendment. As I \nindicated earlier, I think he did respond to a number of those. But I \nalso think he fairly clearly made the arguments I made a few minutes \nago. I made those the last time his amendment came up also; and those \nwere not addressed. They still remain a fundamental flaw.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. What objection do you have?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My concern is that there is fundamentally no legal \nbasis for a stay in bankruptcy court of a lease that has expired or a \nlease that has been breached by lack of payment--since there is none, \nthen the landlord ought not to have to hire a lawyer and go to \nbankruptcy court. So I continue to have that concern. But the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin has repeatedly said the tenant would be able to remain \non the property, but only if they paid rent.\n  Let me give you a hypothetical.\n  On October 1, the tenant's rent is due. The tenant does not pay. On \nOctober 11, he files bankruptcy. On November 1, the rent is due; and it \nis not paid. On November 1, the landlord immediately files his notice \nin the bankruptcy court. And then 15 days are allowed to go by, \npresumably so the tenant could file some other complaint in bankruptcy \ncourt, some other delay or motion. And 15 days go by; and on November \n16, the stay of the eviction proceedings is lifted. Then the landlord \nhas to go back to the State court again to pursue his eviction notice, \nwhich has been stopped, which has probably fallen behind the 10,000 \nother cases in that State court system. And now the landlord has a hard \ntime bringing it up.\n  So I would suggest to you, it is quite possible that the tenant could \nhave 6 weeks rent free. I made the comment about ``rent free'' because \nI will show this advertisement right here in San Bernadino: ``7 months \nfree rent.'' That is what is being advertised in the paper:\n\n       No matter how far you are behind in your rent. We guarantee \n     you can stay in your apt. or house for 2-7 months more \n     without paying a penny!!! Find out how. We can stop the \n     Sheriff or Marshall and get you more time.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is the Senator aware that our amendment would prohibit \nwhat you are reading right there?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It does not exactly, but it gives them at least a month \nand a half--if not 2 months, a month and a half.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Isn't it a fact----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In addition, it still allows the abuse of forcing the \nlandlord to go to two different courts to pursue a legitimate----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If I could follow up, under the scenario you described, \nisn't it true that you are talking about a maximum of 6 weeks, and not \n6 months? Wouldn't you concede that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Under this scenario, it is clearly 6 weeks, if \neverything goes\n\n[[Page S14686]]\n\nperfectly for the landlord. It is guaranteed 6 weeks under these \ncircumstances.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would suggest to the Senator, you described the most \negregious and extreme possibility under our amendment. And you were \ntalking about 4 months, 5 months, 6 months. Not only is that not \naccurate, that is clearly not my intent.\n  My intent, as I have indicated time and again, is to try to make sure \na person who is in this position has to pay that rent once they file \nfor bankruptcy, and keep paying it or else they are out of luck. And \nthe goal, just so it is clear to the Senator from Alabama, is obviously \nnot to create that kind of scenario you described. If fact, you just \nmade our case, that the maximum exposure there would probably be about \n6 weeks, not 6 months, as you suggested.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Under most State eviction proceedings, a tenant who \ndesires to stay on the property can maintain possession of that rental \nproperty 45 to 60 days. There are many rights and remedies for tenants. \nBut at some point, the ability to stay without paying rent has to be \nended. When you take that 45 to 60 days, and then file a bankruptcy \npetition, and then get another 6 weeks on top of that--and that is \nassuming everything goes smoothly, that the landlord can find a lawyer \nwho will go to bankruptcy the first day he calls one, and who can get \ndown there and file the proper petition or get his certificate filed. \nMaybe the landlord's lawyer does not understand how to file one of \nthese certificates, and ends up billing him $250 or $300 for filing the \ndarn thing, when, in fact, as the Senator, who is an excellent lawyer, \nknows, bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over property. It is the \nestate of the person who is filing. If there is no property, there is \nno estate, which is the case where the lease has expired, or the case \nwhere the lease has been breached by lack of payment. Then the \nbankruptcy court can't legitimately issue an order affecting that \nproperty. The bankruptcy judge can never issue an order under those \ncircumstances. So why make somebody go to bankruptcy court to file \nthese petitions if it will not do anything other than cost the landlord \nmore money to delay the eviction and cost that person money?\n\n  If we in the Congress want to fund people who can't pay their rents \nand give them emergency funding, something like that, that is a matter \nto debate. I don't think we ought to tax private citizens to support \nindividuals in this fashion when their contractual rights have been \nended. We have to make sure our bankruptcy system is a good, tight, \nlegal system and not a social service agency.\n  We give certain rights and benefits to debtors under bankruptcy law. \nWe allow a person who has tremendous debts to walk in and wipe out \nevery one of those debts. Unless their income is above the median \nincome and they can pay back at least 25 percent of their debts, they \ncan go in bankruptcy court and never pay anybody they owe. They do not \nhave to pay their garage mechanic who fixed their automobile for them, \nnot their brother-in-law who loaned their family money when they needed \nit, not their mother, not their credit card company, not their bank, \nnot their doctor, not their hospital, just wipe them all out because we \nbelieve people ought not be crushed under a weight of debt.\n  I do not believe we would expect the gas station to give free \ngasoline to somebody who has filed bankruptcy. I don't believe we would \nexpect the grocery store to give free groceries to somebody who filed \nbankruptcy. Neither should somebody who has violated his lease, is \nsubject to eviction under the appropriate State law, be given free \nrent, even for a month and a half, perhaps more. That is what our \nconcern is.\n  I understand the Senator's great passion for this circumstance, but I \nbelieve this would be a step backward. It would allow an abuse to \ncontinue which we need to eliminate. I hope the Members of this body \nwill reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Alabama. Frankly, this isn't really about a great passion on this \nissue. All I am trying to achieve is some balance. I do think landlords \nshould be paid their rent. I do think it is terrible when people abuse \nthe system.\n  But in case after case where the Senator from Alabama has presented \nan abuse, we have tried to address it. What it all came down to, when I \nasked him what he still objected to, was that he fundamentally doesn't \nbelieve in the principle behind the bankruptcy system, which is giving \npeople an opportunity to get back on their feet and providing a little \nbreathing room in the case of the type of person I described.\n  I described a single woman with children who is not getting her child \nsupport, who is in danger of being booted out of that apartment. When \nthe Senator responds, he talks about the people who game the system, \npeople who have different debts all over the place and who can hire \nsophisticated attorneys. That is not who we are talking about.\n  In fact, I refer back to Mr. Sommer's summary of what my amendment \nwould do. The amendment is actually perfectly tailored to the situation \nof the person who can't hire a lawyer or afford a lawyer. That is who \nwe are talking about. We are talking about people who certainly are not \nsophisticated enough or able to game the bankruptcy system. They are \nnot in that category at all. They are people who simply want to stay in \ntheir apartment. They have financial problems, but once they file for \nbankruptcy, they want to be able to start paying that rent again.\n  Let me read what Mr. Sommer said. He is not a person who works on \nbankruptcy. He is a distinguished author on bankruptcy law. He wrote to \nme:\n\n       To the extent there are abuses in the current system, your \n     amendment will provide prompt and efficient relief by giving \n     landlords a streamlined procedure that could be pursued \n     quickly and without an attorney.\n\n  Let me reiterate that. So much of the argument of the Senator from \nAlabama is premised on the idea that this is somehow a sweet deal for \nlawyers. What this expert says is that these provisions allow this kind \nof opportunity for a person who needs it without an attorney. He \nwrites:\n\n       Your amendment would make it impossible to obtain any \n     significant delay simply by filing a bankruptcy petition, as \n     can occur today.\n\n  This expert makes it very clear that this is a significant \nimprovement over current bankruptcy law, of which the Senator from \nAlabama is critical. Even with my amendment, he says it is almost \nimpossible to obtain any significant delay simply by filing a \nbankruptcy petition. He concedes that some of that could happen today, \nas the Senator from Alabama has pointed out.\n  Here is the last line, the critical piece that the Senator from \nAlabama simply won't address, when it comes to one of the purposes of \nFederal bankruptcy law. Mr. Sommer says:\n\n       But it would not hurt the innocent family, struggling to \n     get its finances together, that is able to begin making rent \n     payments and cure its rent default.\n\n  That is all I am trying to do, to get some balance here so that an \ninnocent family that is trying to get its act together and finances \ntogether doesn't get booted out of its apartment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the statements of the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin. I will offer for the record three \nadvertisements that are not particularly unusual. One I read from \nearlier, how they can stop the sheriff and get you more time. Call us \nif you lost in court. Don't give up. Call us. We will give you more \ntime.\n  In other words, if you have had your eviction proceedings that every \nother citizen gets, come down and file bankruptcy and we can get you \nmore time, even though we can wipe out all your debts. A person can \nthen begin to find another place to live, he has no other debt, no old \ndebts to pay. He can afford to make the rent payments, and maybe a \nlandlord will let him stay.\n  Here is another advertisement, from Los Angeles: Stop this eviction, \nfrom 1 to 6 months. I know under the Senator's amendment it might not \ntake quite as long. He would cut that time down. But he said from 1 to \n6. But\n\n[[Page S14687]]\n\nunder his amendment I just went through, wouldn't the Senator agree, it \nis at least a month to 6 weeks?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, didn't we come to the \nconclusion that we are talking 6 weeks and not 6 months? Would the \nSenator concede that is a big difference, 6 weeks versus 6 months?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Not if you depend on the rent every month, as many \npeople do who rent out their garage.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Isn't there a substantial difference between 6 weeks \nand 6 months of rent? I would say that is significant.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is significant if you don't get rent for 2 months or \n1 month or 6 months, if you need it.\n  The Senator suggests these people are not trying to game the system. \nThey are not sophisticated in all of this. They go to lawyers. They \ntake advertisements like this. Those advertisements will still be \nthere. They tell tenants how to do this. They are shocked when the \nlawyer says, don't pay any more on your credit card. Don't pay any more \nat the bank. Don't pay any more of your debts. Take your next paycheck, \ngive it to me, and I will wipe out everything you owe.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these three \ndocuments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           7 MONTHS FREE RENT\n\n                       100% Guaranteed in Writing\n\n       No matter how far you are behind in your rent.

One of the things Senator Grassley has done in the \nbill, and the Senator has mentioned, is to provide that you do not have \nto have an attorney in bankruptcy court for most of the actions that \nwill take place. This is indeed a good step forward. You would not have \nto have an attorney in this landlord tenant situation. I would suggest \nthat for the average small apartment owner who gets a notice that he is \nto stay his eviction procedures, and he has a lawyer who is doing the \neviction procedures, he is going to ask his lawyer: What is this? What \ncan you do to get this stay lifted? The landlord is going to hire a \nlawyer and end up spending several hundred dollars to get this matter \ntaken care of, when ultimately, the procedure is such that there will \nbe no legal basis for the filing of the complaint in the overwhelming \nnumber of cases.\n  I understand the Senator's concern. I believe this bill, as written, \nwill provide all the protections the States have given to tenants. I \nbelieve we have a responsibility to see they have protections, that \nthey can defend their interests in court before being thrown out of \ntheir apartments.\n  And, indeed, that is the law in every State in America today. But I \ndo not believe we ought to allow those who file bankruptcy to have \nsubstantial benefits over those who don't file bankruptcy, who are \nmanaging somehow, in some way, on the same income, to pay their debts. \nI don't believe they should have a superior advantage. I don't believe \nlandlords who are going to lose in this bankruptcy proceeding, no \ntelling how many months rent, should be required to fund additional \nrents. If this body wants to pay them to allow people to stay, it is \nOK; otherwise, it is not.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14687-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14687-S14688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SATELLITE TELEVISION SERVICE\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the 570,000 \nsatellite viewers in the State of Arkansas who would like to watch \nlocal news broadcasts over their satellite dishes. Since I began \nserving in the Senate in January, I have received more phone calls, \nletters, and postcards regarding satellite television service than \nabout Federal spending, crime, health care, or many of the other \nimportant issues we have debated this year.\n  Many constituents complained to me earlier this year after they lost \nsome of their network signals due to a court order. Others have been \nworried they will lose part of their service by December 31. I have \nkept all of these constituents informed about developments with the \nbill that would let them keep their full satellite service.\n  When we passed the bill--which most people refer to as the Satellite \nHome Viewer Act--by unanimous consent in May, I told my constituents \ntheir problems would soon be resolved. Then, as the summer days got \nshorter and the leaves began to fall, I told them to just be patient. I \nsaid, ``It will be just a few more weeks,'' because members of the \nconference committee had begun to meet.\n  Now, as we rush to conclude the legislative session, my constituents, \nand millions of others across the country, are still waiting. I now \nshare their anger with what they perceive as Washington interfering \nwith their access to information and entertainment. I have been told \nthere is only one Senator who is holding up the process of passing a \nbill that would permit satellite viewers to receive local network \nsignals over their satellite dishes. This is especially frustrating \nconsidering the House of Representatives has overwhelmingly approved a \nbill by a vote of 411-8.\n  In my opinion, it is so unreal that those who stand in the way of \nthis legislation would think that as we rush to finish the important \ntask of funding the Federal Government, they can kill this bill in the \n11th hour and no one will notice. I am here to bear witness that people \nwill notice. As many as 50 million people will notice because that is \nhow many people risk losing part of their satellite service if we do \nnot complete action on the satellite bill before the end of this \nsession.\n  The satellite TV conference report is the product of hard-fought and \nvery extensive negotiation among conferees. The provision that one \nSenator has expressed concerns about is especially important for \nresidents of rural States. The local broadcast signal provision in the \nsatellite bill would create a loan\n\n[[Page S14688]]\n\nguarantee to bring local channels via satellite into small television \nmarkets. Without this loan guarantee, there is little chance that any \ncorporation will make a business decision to launch a satellite that \nwould enable it to beam local television signals into rural \ncommunities. Local broadcasters provide people with local news and \nvital details about storm warnings and school closings. People in rural \ncommunities need access to this information. They deserve no less.\n  It is important to note that this loan guarantee will not cost the \ntaxpayers 1 cent because a credit risk premium would cover any losses \nfrom default on the federally backed private loan.\n  This rural provision should stay in the satellite bill, and we should \nvote on this bill in the light of day rather than sneaking a whittled-\ndown version into an omnibus package.\n  I hold in my hand a letter signed by a bipartisan group of 24 \nSenators urging the majority leader to file cloture on and proceed to \nthe satellite bill. After we delivered the letter, five additional \nSenators called my office seeking to sign it. I understand that another \nletter supporting the rural provision may be circulating as I speak.\n  Mr. President, I urge the majority leader to listen to the will of \nthe people and to the majority of the Members of this body. Let us vote \non this today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I could take a moment to comment, I \ncompliment Senator Lincoln for her comments. I totally agree with her. \nThere was a long and difficult conference. It was the Intellectual \nProperty Communication Omnibus Reform Act--a long and difficult \nconference. We had a lot of give and take. We had conferees from two \nSenate committees. It became a Rubik's Cube, where everybody had to \ngive something. We got it through, and it passed. I believe my friend \nsaid the vote in the House was 411-8. In my little State, we have \n70,000 homes with satellite dishes that will be left dark if we don't \nget this. There are 12 million nationwide.\n  I hope we can do this before we go out. The heavy lifting has already \nbeen done. It was done in the committee of conference. The \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas made very clear throughout that \nwhole time the needs of her constituents, as have other Senators. I \nhope that whether they are sitting in a farmhouse in Vermont, a home in \nArkansas, or anywhere else, if on New Year's Eve they want to watch the \nfestivities by satellite, they can do that. I compliment the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14688-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14688-S14689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to talk, as \nI have on several occasions recently, about the issue of prescription \ndrugs and the Nation's elderly. You certainly can't open up a major \npublication these days without reading about this issue.\n  The New York Times, on Sunday last, had an excellent article. Time \nmagazine, which came out in the last couple of days, had a lengthy \ndiscussion of prescription drugs and seniors. These are all very \ncaptivating discussions, but almost all of them end with the author's \njudgment that nothing is going to get done in Congress about this \ncritical issue. They go on and on for pages and, finally, the author \nwinds around to the conclusion that this issue has been tied up in \npartisanship and the kind of bickering that you see so often in \nWashington, DC. There you have it. Case closed. Lots of arguing but no \nrelief for the Nation's older people. Lots of politics but no results.\n  So what I have been trying to do, in an effort to break the gridlock \non that issue, is to come to the floor of the Senate and talk \nspecifically about a bipartisan piece of legislation, the Snowe-Wyden \nbill, which has received what amounts to a majority of Senators' \nsupport at this point because they have already voted for the funding \nplan that we envisage, and to talk about how the Senate could come \nforward with real relief for the Nation's older people and do it in a \nbipartisan way.\n  As part of the effort to break the gridlock, as this poster next to \nme indicates, I hope seniors will send to each of us copies of their \nprescription drug bills. As a result of seniors and their families \nbeing involved in this way, this will help to bring about a bipartisan \neffort in the Senate and actually win passage of the legislation and \nbring about relief for older people.\n  The Snowe-Wyden legislation is called the SPICE bill, the Senior \nPrescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It ought to be a subject \nMembers of Congress know something about because the Snowe-Wyden bill \nis based on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. It is not some \nalien, one-size-fits-all Federal price control regime but something \nthat offers a lot of choice and alternatives and uses the forces of the \nmarketplace to deliver good health care to Members of Congress and \ntheir families.\n  Senator Snowe and I have essentially used that model for the approach \nthat we want to take in delivering prescription drug benefits for the \nNation's older people. Fifty-four Members of the Senate, as part of the \nbudget resolution, said they would vote for a specific way to fund the \nlegislation. What I have tried to do is come to the floor on a number \nof occasions recently and as a result of folks reading this poster and \nsending copies of their prescription drug bills to us individually in \nthe Senate in Washington, DC, I hope to be able to show the need in our \ncountry is enormous and to help catalyze bipartisan action.\n  Tonight, in addition to reading briefly from some of the bills I have \nreceived in recent days, I am going to talk a little bit about how it \nis not going to be possible to solve this problem unless the approach \nthe Senate devises, in addition to being bipartisan, addresses the \nquestion of affordable insurance. For example, this Time magazine \narticle that came out today--a very interesting and very thoughtful \npiece and I commend the author for most of what is written--talks about \nthe role of the Internet. It says there are going to be a variety of \nproposals debated on the floor of the Senate. But with the Internet, \npeople are going to just try to go out and buy prescription drugs and \nit goes into various details about how seniors can buy prescriptions on \nline.\n\n  I was director of the Gray Panthers at home in Oregon for about 7 \nyears before I was elected to the Congress. Suffice it to say, I can \nassure you that some of the most frail and vulnerable older people in \nour country are not going to be able to buy their prescriptions on line \nthe way Time magazine envisages. But perhaps even more important, if an \nolder person is spending more than half of his or her Social Security \ncheck on prescription medicine--and I have given example after example \nin recent days of older people in our country, at home in our States. I \nam very pleased my friend and colleague, Senator Smith, is in the chair \nbecause he has talked often about the need for bipartisan action on \nthis issue to help seniors.\n  I think both of us would agree that if you have an older person who \nis spending more than half of their monthly income on prescription \ndrugs--more than half of their Social Security checks, for example, and \na lot of them get nothing but Social Security--those folks are going to \nneed decent insurance coverage. They need to be in a position to get \ninsurance coverage that will pick up a significant hunk of their \nprescription drug costs.\n  The Time magazine article tells you all about buying drugs over the \nInternet. But a lot of those senior citizens with an income of $11,000 \nor $12,000 a year--a modest income--when they are spending more than \nhalf of their income on prescription drugs are not going to find an \nanswer on the Internet. They are going to need decent insurance \ncoverage.\n  The Snowe-Wyden legislation envisages--is a detailed plan, it is a \nspecific plan, a bipartisan plan, S. 1480--and lays out a system that \ninvolves marketplace choices and competitive forces in the private \nsector. Seniors will be in a position to have real clout when it comes \nto purchasing private insurance.\n  I think what is so sad about the situation with respect to our older \npeople and prescription drugs is they get hit by a double whammy. \nMedicare doesn't cover prescription medicine. That is the way the \nprogram began back in the middle 1960s.\n  Second, a lot of the big buyers, health maintenance organizations, or \na plan, can go out and negotiate a discount. And the senior who walks \ninto a\n\n[[Page S14689]]\n\npharmacy in our home State in Coos Bay or Beaverton or Pendleton or \nsome part of our home State, ends up, in effect, paying a premium \nbecause the big buyers are able to negotiate discounts.\n  It is critical that seniors be in a position to get more affordable \nprivate insurance for their prescription medicine.\n  Under the Snowe-Wyden legislation for seniors on a modest income, \nother than a copayment or deductible, the legislation would pick up the \nentire part of that senior's insurance premium that covers prescription \ndrugs.\n  That is something that will help that frail older person. It is not \ngoing to be the Internet that is going to be a panacea for that older \nperson but legislation that helps that elderly widow or retired \ngentleman afford private insurance coverage is something that will be \nof help to them. That is what the Snowe-Wyden legislation is all about.\n  Tonight, I want to read from a few letters I have received in the \nlast couple of days. And I will continue in the days ahead as the \nSenate wraps up--we hope it won't be too many more days ahead--to bring \nthese kinds of cases to the floor of the Senate in an effort to try to \nsee the Senate come together in a bipartisan way and provide some \nrelief for older people.\n  One elderly couple, for example, wrote me about their medical \nsituation, reporting that both had recently had heart surgery and one \nof them, in addition, had a stroke. They are taking blood-thinner \ndrugs. They are taking important cholesterol-lowering drugs--Lipitor--\nand drugs for lowering blood pressure. They are breaking that \nparticular medicine in half because they cannot afford their \nprescriptions, and then they are taking a drug which serves as an \nantidepressant.\n  This couple has a combined income of around $1,500 a month. For the \nmonth of October alone, they spent $888 on just the drugs I mentioned. \nOver half of their monthly income is going for prescription medicine.\n  I don't believe there is going to be relief for that elderly couple \nover the Internet. They are not going to be able to deal with that \nfinancial predicament where they spend over half of their monthly \nincome on prescription medicine through some ``www'' opportunity on the \nInternet. They are going to need decent insurance coverage.\n  That is what the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation tries to provide.\n  The second case I would like to touch on tonight comes from our home \nState. An elderly woman wrote me to report that in recent days she \nspent more than $800 on her prescription medicine. She writes: ``I'm on \na fixed income. It's just getting harder and harder. Medicare help with \nprescriptions is a real need.''\n  Finally, a third letter that I think sums up the kind of predicament \nthat a lot of seniors in our State are facing comes from Beaverton \nwhere an elderly couple is trying to make ends meet essentially with \njust Social Security and a little bit of help from family.\n  When they are finished paying for their prescription drugs--this is \nan elderly couple in Beaverton, OR, in our home State--they have \n$107.40 left over to live for the month.\n  Just think about that. It is not an isolated kind of case. Think \nabout what it has to be like for an older couple to have $107 left over \nfor living after they have paid for their prescription medicine.\n  In the last sentence, this particular elderly woman just asked a \nquestion: ``Can you help?''\n  I think that really sums it up.\n  I think the American people want to see if the Senate, instead of the \nusual tired routine of bickering and arguing and inaction, will produce \na bipartisan plan to provide real relief.\n  What I find so striking, and why I am so proud to have teamed up with \nthe Republican Senator from Maine on this bipartisan issue, is that \nwhen I am asked at home--I had a town meeting a couple of days ago on \nthe Oregon coast. And the President often has the same kind of \ncommunity session. I was asked about whether the Nation can afford to \ncover prescription medicine.\n  My answer is, if you are reading these bills, that America cannot \nafford not to cover prescription medicine because these drugs, as in \nthe case I described initially, are drugs that keep people well. They \nhelp people deal with blood pressure. They help people deal with \ncholesterol. These are drugs to help keep people healthy. If you keep \nthem healthy, they don't land in the hospital where they rack up those \nhuge charges for Part A of Medicare. I cited repeatedly these \nanticoagulant medicines.\n  Evidence shows that for perhaps $1,000 a year, seniors could get a \ncomprehensive program of anticoagulant medicines that can help prevent \nstrokes. We have seen again and again that if you can't get this kind \nof preventive medical help and you incur a stroke, it costs more than \n$100,000 to pick up the cost.\n  That is really the choice, it seems to me, for the Senate. I think \nthe Presiding Officer of the Senate and I have shown in our home States \nthat it is possible on a whole host of issues, frankly, issues that a \nlot of people think are more divisive than even prescription medicine, \nto come together in a bipartisan way. I am hopeful the Senate can show \nthat as well. We have seen one poll after another demonstrating that \nthe American people want Congress to provide real relief.\n  In the last couple of weeks, I have seen several polls which indicate \nthat helping frail and vulnerable seniors with prescription drug \ncoverage through Medicare is one of the top two or three concerns for \nthis country.\n  Instead of these articles that we are seeing coming out of Time \nmagazine and New York Times and others saying we probably won't be \nfinished, and there won't be an effective answer, I would like to see \nthe Senate show we can really follow through and produce for the older \npeople of this country.\n  In the days left of this session--we all hope there won't be many \nmore--until we get comprehensive bipartisan legislation that provides \nthe elderly real relief, I intend to keep coming to the floor of the \nSenate to talk about this issue.\n  I hope folks who are listening tonight will send in copies of their \nprescription drug bills.\n  This poster says it all: ``Send in your prescription drug bills.'' \nSend them to each of us in the Senate in Washington D.C.\n  I can tell you the bills that are coming into my office--they are \nreally coming in now as a result of our taking the opportunity to \ndiscuss this issue on the floor of the Senate--say that this is an \nurgent need.\n  There are people who write who are conservative. There are people who \nwrite who are liberals, Democrats, Republicans, and independents, and \nall across the political spectrum who say: Get the job done. We are not \ninterested in the traditional bickering and fighting about who gets \ncredit, whose turf is being invaded, and which particular parochial \nkind of issue is being placed ahead of the national wellbeing.\n\n  This Nation's seniors and this Nation's families want us to come \ntogether and deal with this issue.\n  I intend to come back on the floor of the Senate again and again \nuntil the Senate does.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nacknowledge the 40th year of broadcasting for radio station KJAM-FM, \nserving Madison, South Dakota and area communities. KJAM Radio first \naired on December 3rd, 1959, and this December 3rd, the staff and \nfriends of the radio station will be celebrating this remarkable feat \nin radio broadcasting with a well-deserved anniversary party.\n  Small town, locally owned radio stations like KJAM are one of rural \nAmerica's unique cultural contributions to our nation. They mirror the \nstrong values of the small towns they serve. KJAM has served Madison \nwell, and I would like to commend the employees\n\n[[Page S14690]]\n\nand supporters of KJAM for their dedication over these 40 years in \nbringing to the area local and regional news, weather, and broadcasts \nof events for Dakota State University and area high schools.\n  Beginning in January, KJAM will be managed by Three Eagles \nCommunications, which I am sure will continue to enrich the lives of \narea residents with quality radio broadcasting.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in honoring John and JoLynn Goeman, \nthe owners of KJAM, who have given so much to the Madison community. \nJohn Goeman is the only employee who has been with the station since \nits inception, and I know his listeners will be sad to hear his last \ngreeting to radio listeners with the ``First Edition'' of the day's \nnews.

Mr. President, on Friday, November 12, a United Nations \nWorld Food Programme airplane carrying 24 people crashed in northern \nKosovo, killing all on board. The plane departed Rome bound for \nPristina, Kosovo--the wreckage was found only 20 miles from its \ndestination. The passengers, mainly humanitarian aid workers, were on a \nroutine flight run by the World Food Programme.\n  The World Food Programme is the world's largest international food \naid organization that provides food aid to 75 million people worldwide \nthrough development projects and emergency operations.\n  The WFP fights both the acute hunger that grips a family fleeing \ncivil conflicts and the chronic hunger that slowly gnaws away a life. \nHunger afflicts one out of every seven people on earth. 800 million \npeople are malnourished. Starvation threatens at least another 50 \nmillion victims of man-made and natural disasters. In 1998, the WFP \ndelivered 2.8 million tons of food to 80 countries. These projects are \nenormous undertakings, and are sometimes not without human costs.\n  The WFP has lost more employees than any other UN agency in work-\nrelated accidents, illnesses or attacks. Fifty-one people since 1988 \nhave lost their lives while in service to those who would otherwise go \nhungry. Among the 24 people who died in the most recent tragedy were \ndoctors, a civil engineer, aid workers, a volunteer chemist, police \nofficers and non-governmental organization workers.\n  As we begin to plan our Thanksgiving meals, let us pause a moment to \nreflect on those who dedicate themselves to the eradication of \nstarvation. Let us remember our dear friend and colleague, Congressman \nMickey Leland, who died in a plane crash 10 years ago while leading a \nmission to an isolated refugee camp in Ethiopia.\n  And as we talk about the United Nations, let us not forget who the \nU.N. is made up of--humanitarian aid workers who devote their lives, \noften at great risk, to easing the suffering of others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14691-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE UNITED STATES BORDER PATROL\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise as a cosponsor \nof S. Con. Res. 74, a resolution which recognizes the United States \nBorder Patrol's 75 years of service to this country.\n  These brave men and women serve, day in and day out, as both \ndefenders and ambassadors of our nation. With professionalism, civility \nand a watchful eye, members of the United States Border Patrol watch \nout for illegal immigrants and the entry of illegal drugs.\n  It is a difficult task, Mr. President. But one that our Border Patrol \nAgents perform well. And these duties are not just difficult, Mr. \nPresident. Oftentimes they are dangerous as well. Particularly in this \nera of well-armed thugs and smugglers, Border Patrol Agents may find \nthemselves out-gunned as they protect our nation's borders. 86 Border \nPatrol Agents and Pilots have lost their lives in the line of duty--6 \nin 1998 alone.\n  We all owe our Border Patrol our thanks for their bravery and their \nwillingness to put in long, hard hours in service to their country.\n  I would like to make special note, Mr. President, of the members of \nthe Detroit Sector of the U.S. Border Patrol. These fine individuals \nperform with grace in the face of very difficult assignments. In the \nDetroit sector, fewer than 20 Border Patrol field agents are expected \nto be responsible for four large Midwestern states--Michigan, Ohio, \nIndiana, and Illinois, an area covering hundreds of miles of border. \nThis small number of Border Patrol agents also must assist INS \ninvestigators in responding to local law enforcement requests in these \nfour states.\n  I salute the good work of the United States Border Patrol, and \nespecially thank the members of the Detroit Sector for their work above \nand beyond the call of duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14691-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14691-S14692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PEDRO MARTINEZ WINS 1999 AMERICAN LEAGUE CY YOUNG AWARD\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us in Massachusetts know that \nPedro Martinez, the great pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, is the class \nof the American League. Yesterday, the Baseball Writers' Association of \nAmerica confirmed that judgment by unanimously selecting Pedro Martinez \nas the winner of the Cy Young Award for the American League for 1999.\n  Pedro's record this year was brilliant. His 23 victories, his earned \nrun average of 2.07, and his 313 strikeouts led the league in all three \nof those categories, and his dramatic victory over the New York Yankees \nin the third game of the American League Championship Series last month \nwas the crowning achievement in his extraordinary season.\n  All of us in Boston are proud of the Red Sox and proud of Pedro \nMartinez. I congratulate him on this well-deserved recognition, and I \nask unanimous consent that a ``Red Sox News Flash'' about the award be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Red Sox News Flash, Nov. 16, 1999\n\n       This afternoon Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez was selected \n     the 1999 American League Cy Young award winner by the \n     Baseball Writers' Association of America. The voting was \n     unanimous, with Pedro finishing with 140 points, including \n     all 28 first place votes.\n       Martinez led the American League in seven major pitching \n     categories, including wins (23), ERA (2.07) and strikeouts \n     (313), becoming the first Red Sox pitcher to lead the AL in \n     those three categories since Cy Young in 1901. Martinez' 2.07 \n     ERA was more than a run less than New York's David Cone, who \n     ranked 2nd in ERA at 3.44. The right-hander also became the \n     third pitcher to win the award in both leagues, joining Randy \n     Johnson (1995 in AL & 1999 in NL) and Gaylord Perry (1972 in \n     AL & 1978 in NL). He also becomes the fifth pitcher to win \n     the award with two different clubs.\n       Pedro's 313 strikeouts in 1999 set a new Red Sox single \n     season record. Martinez became the first American League \n     pitcher with 300 or more strikeouts in a season since Randy \n     Johnson in 1993 with Seattle (308) and he is one of 14 \n     different pitchers to have struck out 300 or more batters in \n     a season. He is the second pitcher in Major League History to \n     achieve 300 or more strikeouts in both leagues (Randy Johnson \n     is the other). Pedro is only the 9th player in Major League \n     History to strike out 300 or more batters in a season more \n     than once: joining Nolan Ryan (6x), Sandy Koufax (3x), Randy \n     Johnson (3x, including '99), Sam McDowell (2x), Curt \n     Schilling (2x), Walter Johnson (2x) and J.R. Richard (2x).\n       The Dominican Republic native tossed his 2nd career 1 \n     hitter on September 10th at New York and set a career high \n     with 17 strikeouts (tying the Major League season-high in \n     1999). Martinez became the first Red Sox pitcher to win 20 \n     games since Roger Clemens in 1990 (21-6) and the first Sox \n     pitcher other than Clemens since Dennis Eckersley in 1978. He \n     also set a team record by striking out 10 or more batters 19 \n     times in a season. He became the first right-handed pitcher \n     to record 15 or more strikeouts 6 times in a season since \n     Nolan Ryan in 1974.

Mr. President, in July, when the Senate debated the \nCommerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary fiscal year 2000 spending bill, \nan important amendment was adopted to the bill. That amendment, offered \nby my colleague Senator Boxer, would have made it illegal to sell or \ntransfer firearms or ammunition to anyone under the influence of \nalcohol. Unfortunately, the House-Senate conference committee, in \nworking out the differences between the two versions of this spending \nmeasure, removed the Senate-passed amendment from the final bill.\n  I do not understand how something so simple, so straightforward, \ncould be deleted from the final bill. This amendment does nothing more \nthan save lives and prevent injuries by prohibiting drunks from buying \nguns or ammunition. Under current law, it is illegal to sell firearms \nor ammunition to a purchaser under the influence of illicit drugs. This \nwould simply close the loophole by making it illegal for someone under \nthe influence of alcohol to purchase the same products.\n  It is unconscionable that House and Senate conferees deleted this \ncommon-sense provision from the bill. Unfortunately, this is just \nanother example of how reasonable legislation is repeatedly stymied by \nthe power of the NRA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14692-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE MICROSOFT RULING\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, two core principles guide our economy, \ncompetition and the rule of law. In the absence of competition there is \nno innovation or consumer choice. For over 100 years the anti-trust \nlaws have served as an indispensable bullwark to ensure that unfettered \ncompetition does not result in monopoly power that stifles innovation \nand denies consumers a choice.\n  So it is curious that a veritable who's who of ``conservative'' \npoliticians and think tanks unleashed a barrage of faxes attacking \nFederal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision in United States v. \nMicrosoft.\n  Based on a voluminous record, Judge Jackson found that Microsoft had \nsucceeded in ``stifling innovations that would benefit consumers, for \nthe sole reason that they do not coincide with Microsoft's self-\ninterest.''\n  The factual findings of the District Court held that ``Microsoft will \nuse its prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm \nthat insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition \nagainst one of its core products.''\n  According to the District Court, Microsoft ``foreclosed an \nopportunity for PC makers to make Windows PC systems less confusing and \nmore user-friendly as consumers desired.''\n  The record included the testimony of numerous high tech entrepreneurs \nwho felt the lash of Microsoft's monopolistic wrath. From IBM's \ninability to gain support for its OS2/Warp operating system to Apple's \ninability to effectively compete with Windows to threats to cut off \nNetscape's ``oxygen supply,'' Microsoft engaged in a pernicious pattern \nof anticompetitive behavior, openly flaunting the rule of law. Perhaps \nthe most damning of all was the evasive testimony of Microsoft founder \nWilliam Gates.\n  It is, frankly, a record that is quite embarrassing. But rather than \nshow remorse, Microsoft has embarked on a vendetta to punish the \noutstanding group of Justice Department lawyers who bested its minions \nof high-payed lawyers and spin doctors.\n  So, Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to praise the Justice \nDepartment's Antitrust Division and its leader Joel Klein. It is well \nknown that I had my doubts about Mr. Klein, but I am pleased to say, \nand not too proud to admit, that I misjudged him. He is doing an \noutstanding job.\n  In the long run, failure to promote competition and innovation will \nundermine our preeminence in the high tech arena.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14692-4", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14692-S14693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE CONSERVATION AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Senator from \nLouisiana in calling upon our colleagues in the Senate, as well as the \nAdministration, to capitalize on the momentum provided by the House \nResources Committee last week in passing the Conservation and \nReinvestment Act of 1999. We must not let this opportunity slip away to \nenact what may well be the most significant conservation effort of the \ncentury.\n  As part of any discussion into utilizing revenues from Outer \nContinental Shelf oil drilling to fund conservation programs, I want to \nensure that wildlife programs are kept among the priorities of the \ndebate. Specifically, I want to comment upon the importance of funding \nfor wildlife conservation, education, and restoration efforts as \nprovided in both the House and Senate versions of the Conservation and \nReinvestment Act of 1999. This funding would be administered as a \npermanent funding source through the successful Pittman-Robertson Act.\n  This program enjoys a great deal of support including a coalition of \nnearly 3,000 groups across the country known as the Teeming with \nWildlife Coalition. Also, this funding would be provided without \nimposing new taxes. Funds will be allocated to all 50 states for \nwildlife conservation of non-game species, with the principal goal of \npreventing species from becoming endangered or listed under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  In my home state of Arkansas, we have recognized the importance of \nfunding conservation and management initiatives. The people of Arkansas \nwere successful in passing a one-eighth cent sales tax to fund these \ntypes of programs. As I'm sure is true all across this country, people \ndon't mind paying taxes for programs that promote good wildlife \nmanagement and help keep species off of the Endangered Species List.\n  By taking steps now to prevent species from becoming endangered, we \nare not only able to conserve the significant cultural heritage of \nwildlife enjoyment for the people of this country, but also to avoid \nthe substantial costs associated with recovery for endangered species. \nIn fact, all 50 states would benefit as a result of the important link \nbetween these wildlife education-based initiatives and the benefits of \nwildlife-related tourism.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to make\n\n[[Page S14693]]\n\nthis historic legislation a reality upon our return early next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14693-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FIRST YEAR IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as the first session of the 106th \nCongress comes to an end, I cannot help but think of what an \ninteresting and exciting first year it has been for me in the United \nStates Senate. The experience has been a wonderful one, to say the \nleast. As my colleagues all well know from their first days in the \nSenate, setting up a Senate office is a daunting task, and setting one \nup right does not happen by accident. Many have helped make my \ntransition from the House to the Senate a smooth one, and I would like \nto take a moment to stop and thank, in particular, the dedicated and \nloyal employees of the Architect of the Capitol, the Secretary of the \nSenate, and the Senate Sergeant at Arms who played an integral role in \nmaking sure that my staff and I could serve the citizens of New York as \neffectively as possible.\n  From the Architect of the Capitol's office, a special thanks goes to \nthe following: Sherry Britton, Michael Cain, Edolphus Carpenter, Tim \nChambers, Jerry Coates, David Cox, Darvin Davis, Andre DeVore, Reggie \nDonahue, Ed Fogle, Bob Garnett, Steve Howell, Donna Hupp, Lamont \nJamison, JoAnn Martin, Dwight McBride, Alpha McGee, Richard Muriel, \nRandy Naylor, James Outlaw, Albert Price, Lindwood Simmons, Sally \nTassler, Doug Whittington, Jr., Clarence Williams, Caroll Woods, and \nGreg Young.\n  Kim Brinkman, Timothy O'Keefe, John Trimble, and Timothy Wineman from \nthe Office of Secretary of the Senate deserve special recognition.\n  And, from the Senate Sergeant at Arms office, I would like to point \nout: Roosevelt Allen, Sterret Carter, Robert Croson, Val Fisher, Denise \nGresham, Kenneth Lloyd, Michael Lussier, Stacy Norris, Theresa Peel, \nDan Templeton, Jeanne Tessieri, and James Wentz.\n  The professionalism that each of these individuals displayed should \nbe a source of great pride to their bosses, and if I wore a hat, I \nwould tip it to them. But, for now, I hope they will accept my thanks \nand praise for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14693-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14693-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2541.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to tobacco \n     subsidies and food-producing agricultural activities; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 68\n\n       Whereas, For many years, even as our country has wrestled \n     with the costly and harmful effects of tobacco use, Americans \n     have provided financial support for tobacco farming through \n     federal tobacco subsidies. These subsidies include money \n     spent for tobacco crop insurance and price support, in \n     addition to inspection and grading services. While changes in \n     federal agricultural programs and law have significantly \n     reduced money going to tobacco farming and related \n     activities, federal dollars continue to be spent on an \n     endeavor that is harmful to our citizens; and\n       Whereas, One of the greatest challenges facing humanity in \n     any age is the production of food of sufficient quantity and \n     quality to meet ever-rising needs. Investments in the process \n     of raising crops are among the most important commitments we \n     can make to future generations. Subsidies for food \n     production, research, and marketing hold the potential to \n     touch every citizen in a positive fashion; and\n       Whereas, With the recent settlement among the states and \n     the tobacco industry, the enormity of the cost tobacco exacts \n     on our society is clear. Any money going to support any \n     aspect of this activity would be far better spent elsewhere; \n     now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to end tobacco subsidies and to redirect \n     this support to food-producing agricultural activities; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14695-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REPORT OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following report of committee was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. THOMPSON, from the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs:\n       Report to accompany the bill (S. 1877) to amend the Federal \n     Report Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Rept.

A bill to provide for the return of fair and reasonable fees \nto the Federal Government for the use and occupancy of National Forest \nSystem land under the recreation residence program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                  cabin user fee fairness act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that \nwill set a new course for the Forest Service in determining fees for \nforest lots on which families and individuals have been authorized to \nbuild cabins for seasonal recreation since the early part of this \ncentury. I am pleased to have Senators Mike Crapo, Craig Thomas, and \nConrad Burns joining me in sponsoring this legislation, which is a \ncompanion bill to H.R. 3327, introduced in the House of Representatives \nby Congressman George Nethercutt.\n  In 1915, under the Term Permit Act, Congress set up a program to give \nfamilies the opportunity to recreate on our public lands through the \nso-called recreation residence program. Today, 15,000 of these forest \ncabins remain, providing generation after generation of families and \ntheir friends a respite from urban living and an opportunity to use our \npublic lands.\n  These cabins stand in sharp contrast to many aspects of modern \noutdoor recreation, yet are an important aspect of the mix recreation \nopportunities for the American public. While many of us enjoy fast, \noff-road machines and watercraft or hiking to the backcountry with \nhigh-tech gear, others enjoy a relaxing weekend at their cabin in the \nwoods with their family and friends.\n  The recreation residence programs allows families all across the \ncountry an opportunity to use our national forests. This quiet, \nsomewhat uneventful\n\n[[Page S14697]]\n\nprogram continues to produce close bonds and remarkable memories for \nhundreds of thousands of Americans, but in order to secure the future \nof the cabin program, this Congress needs to reexamine the basis on \nwhich fees are now being determined.\n  Roughly 20 years ago, the Forest Service saw the need to modernize \nthe regulations under which the cabin program is administered. \nAcknowledging that the competition for access and use of forest \nresources has increased dramatically since 1915, both the cabin owners \nand the agency wanted a formal understanding about the rights and \nobligations of using and maintaining these structures.\n  New rules that resulted nearly a decade later reaffirmed the cabins \nas a valid recreational use of forest land. At the same time, the new \npolicy reflected numerous limitations on use that are felt to be \nappropriate in order to keep areas of the forest where cabins are \nlocated open for recreational use by other forest visitors. Commercial \nuse of the cabins is prohibited, as is year-round occupancy by the \nowner. Owners are restricted in the size, shape, paint color and \npresence of other structures or installations on the cabin lot. The \nonly portion of a lot that is controlled by the cabin owner is that \nportion of the lot that directly underlies the footprint of the cabin \nitself.\n  At some locations, the agency has determined a need to remove cabins \nfor a variety of reasons related to ``higher public purposes'' and \ncabin owners wanted to be certain in the writing of new regulations \nthat a fair process would guide any future decisions about cabin \nremoval. At other locations, some cabins have been destroyed by fire, \navalanche or falling trees, and a more reliable process of determining \nwhether such cabins might be rebuilt or relocated was needed. It was \ndetermined, therefore, that this recreational program would be tied \nmore closely to the forest planning process.\n\n  The question of an appropriate fee to be paid for the opportunity of \nconstructing and maintaining a cabin in the woods was also addressed at \nthat time. Although the agency's policies for administration of the \ncabin program have, overall, held up well over time, the portion \ndealing with periodic redetermination of fees proved in the last few \nyears to be a failure.\n  A base fee was determined 20 years ago by an appraisal of sales of \ncomparable undeveloped lots in the real estate market adjacent to the \nnational forest where a cabin was located. The new policy called for \nreappraisal of the value of the lot 20 years later--a trigger that led \nto initiation of the reappraisal process in 1995.\n  In the meantime, according to the policy, annual adjustments to the \nbase fee would be tracked by the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD), which \nproved to be a faulty mechanism for this purpose. Annual adjustments to \nthe fee based on movements of the IPD failed entirely to keep track of \nthe booming land values associated with recreation development.\n  As the results of actual reappraisals on the ground began reaching my \noffice in 1997, it became clear that far more than the inoperative IPD \nwas out of alignment in determining fees for the cabin owners.\n  At the Pettit Lake tract in Idaho's Sawtooth National Recreation \nArea, the new base fees skyrocketed into alarming five-digit amounts--\nso high that a single annual fee was nearly enough money to buy raw \nland outside the forest and construct a cabin. Meanwhile, the agency's \nappraisal methodology was resulting in new base fees in South Dakota, \nin Florida, and in some locations in Colorado that were actually lower \nthan the previous fee.\n  Very generally speaking, the value of the use of the forest lot is \napproximately the same for any cabin owner, whether they are tucked \ninto what has become in recent years the Sawtooth National Recreation \nArea of Idaho, or high in the Sierra Mountain range of California, or \nin the lowland forests of the southeastern States. Yet Idaho cabin \nowners are now expected to pay a new average fee of $9,221 each year, \nwhile cabin owners in Kentucky will be paying a new average fee of \n$140.\n  At the request of the chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture \nin 1998, the cabin owners named a coalition of leaders of their various \nnational and State cabin owner associations to examine the methodology \nbeing used by the Forest Service to determine fees. It became obvious \nto these laymen that analysis of appraisal methodology and the \ndetermination of fees was beyond their grasp, and a prestigious \nconsulting appraiser was retained to guide the cabin owners through \ntheir task. The report and recommendations of the coalition's \nconsulting appraiser is available from my office for those who might \nwish to examine the details.\n  At the bottom line, it was learned that the Forest Service--contrary \nto its own policy--was appraising and affixing value to the lots being \nprovided to cabin owners as if this land were fully developed, legally \nsubdivided, fee simple residential land.\n  In other words, the agency has been capturing the values associated \nwith a variety of structures and services that the homeowners \nthemselves (not the agency) provide. The Forest Service, in setting \nfees on this basis, has been capturing incremental values assigned by a \ndeveloper at various stages of development for risk, expectations of \nprofit and other factors.\n  My goal is to see that the cabin program remains affordable for \nAmerican families. Consistent with the recommendations of the \ncoalition's consulting appraiser, the methodology for determining fees \nis directed toward the value of the use to the cabin owner--not what \nthe market would bear, should the Forest Service decide to sell off its \nassets.\n  This is highly technical legislation. Its purpose is to send a clear \nset of instructions to appraisers in the field and a clear set of \ninstructions to forest managers to respect the results of appraisals \nundertaken to place value on the raw land being offered cabin owners.\n  I intend to hold hearings on this legislation early in the next \nsession. I urge each of my colleagues to be in contact with cabin \nowners in their State during the congressional recess. There are more \nthan 15,000 families out there who fear that the long tradition of \ncabin-based forest recreation is nearing an end because the agencies \nfee mechanism has made the program unaffordable for all but the \nwealthy. These cabin owners and I would wholeheartedly welcome the \nsupport and cosponsorship of all Senators for this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1938\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Cabin User Fee Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the recreation residence program is--\n       (A) a valid use of forest land and 1 of the multiple uses \n     of the National Forest System; and\n       (B) an important component of the recreation program of the \n     Forest Service;\n       (2) cabins located on forest land have provided a unique \n     recreation experience to a large number of cabin owners, \n     their families, and guests each year since Congress \n     authorized the recreation residence program in 1915;\n       (3) tract associations, cabin owners, their extended \n     families, guests, and others that regularly use and enjoy \n     forest cabin tracts have contributed significantly toward \n     efficient management of the program and the stewardship of \n     forest land;\n       (4) cabin user fees have traditionally generated income to \n     the Federal Government in amounts significantly greater than \n     the Federal cost of administering the program;\n       (5) the rights and privileges granted to owners of cabins \n     authorized under the program have steadily diminished while \n     regulatory restrictions and fees charged under the program \n     have steadily increased; and\n       (6) the current fee determination procedure has been shown \n     to incorrectly reflect market value and value of use.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the \n     National Forest System recreation residence program is \n     managed to preserve the opportunity for individual and \n     family-oriented recreation at a reasonable cost; and\n       (2) to develop and implement a more efficient, cost-\n     effective procedure for determining cabin user fees that \n     better reflects the probable value of that use by the cabin \n     owner, taking into consideration the limitations of the \n     authorization and other relevant market factors.\n\n[[Page S14698]]\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nreaffirm the United States' historic commitment to protecting refugees \nwho are fleeing persecution or torture; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                       the refugee protection act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today Senators Brownback, Feingold, \nKennedy, Kerry, Jeffords, and I are introducing the Refugee Protection \nAct of 1999, a bill to limit and reform the expedited removal system \ncurrently operating in our ports of entry.\n  In 1996, I introduced an amendment that would have only authorized \nthe use of expedited removal at times of immigration emergencies. The \nbill I introduce today--with the cosponsorship of two Republican and \nthree Democratic Senators--is modeled on that proposal. That amendment \npassed the Senate with bipartisan support, but was omitted from the \nbill that was reported out of a partisan, closed conference. As a \nresult, expedited removal took effect on April 1, 1997. America's \nhistoric reputation as a beacon for refugees has suffered as a \nconsequence.\n  Expedited removal allows INS inspections officers summarily to remove \naliens who arrive in the United States without travel documents, or \neven with facially valid travel documents that the officers merely \nsuspect are fraudulent, unless the aliens utter the magic words \n``political asylum'' upon their first meeting with American immigration \nauthorities. This policy is fundamentally unwise and unfair, both in \ntheory and in practice.\n  First, this policy ignores the fact that many deserving asylum \napplicants are forced to travel without papers. For example, victims of \nrepressive governments often find themselves forced to flee their \nhomelands at a moment's notice, without time or means to acquire proper \ndocumentation. Or a government may systematically strip refugees of \ntheir documentation, as we saw Serb soldiers do in Kosovo earlier this \nyear.\n  Second, expedited removal places an undue burden on refugees, and \nplaces too much authority in the hands of low-level INS officers. \nRefugees typically arrive at our borders ragged and tired from their \nordeals, and often with little or no knowledge of English. Our policy \nforces them to undergo a secondary inspection interview with a low-\nlevel INS officer who can deport them on the spot, subject only to a \nsupervisor's approval. By law, anyone who indicates a fear of \npersecution or requests asylum during this interview is to be referred \nfor an interview with an asylum officer. But no safeguards exist to \nguarantee that this happens, and the secondary inspection interviews \ntake place behind closed doors with no witnesses. Indeed, this \ninterview often becomes unduly confrontation and intimidating. As the \nLawyers Committee for Human Rights has documented, refugees are \ndetained for as long as 36 hours, are deprived of food and water, and \nare often shackled. If they are lucky, they will be provided with an \ninterpreter who speaks their language. If they are unlucky, they will \nreceive no interpreter at all, or an interpreter who works for the \nairline owned by the government that they claim is persecuting them. \nSuch a system is a betrayal of our ideals, and is already producing a \nhuman cost.\n  Indeed, only a few years into this new regime, there are \nextraordinary troubling stories of bona fide refugees who were turned \naway unjustly at our borders. I will talk about two such refugees \ntoday.\n  ``Dem'' (a pseudonym) was a 21-year-old ethnic Albanian student in \nKosovo. In October 1998, Serbian police seized him and tortured him for \n10 days, accusing him of terrorism and threatening to kill his family. \nImmediately after this experience, Dem fled Kosovo, without travel \ndocuments. He traveled through Albania to Italy, where he purchased a \nSlovenian passport. In January of this year, he flew via Mexico City to \nCalifornia, hoping to find refuge in the United States.\n  Dem's hopes were not realized. The INS referred him for a secondary \ninspection interview and provided for a Serbian translator to \nparticipate by telephone. Since Dem could speak only Albanian, the \ninterpreter was useless. Instead of finding an interpreter who could \nspeak Albanian, the INS officers simply closed Dem's case, handcuffed \nhis hands behind his back and put him on a plane back to Mexico City. \nIn other words, Dem--a victim of an ethnic conflict that was already \nfront page news in America's newspapers--was removed from the United \nStates without ever being asked in a language he could understand \nwhether he was afraid to return to Kosovo. Luckily, Dem succeeded in a \nsecond attempt to enter the United States, has since been found to have \na credible fear of persecution, and is now awaiting an asylum hearing. \nOne can only wonder how many refugees in Dem's position never receive \nsuch a second chance.\n  While Dem was arriving in Los Angeles this January, a Tamil from Sri \nLanka named Arumugam Thevakumar arrived at JFK Airport in New York \nseeking asylum. Mr. Thevakumar had escaped from Sri Lanka and its \nbloody civil war, but only after being persecuted by the army because \nhe is a Tamil. When he had his secondary inspection interview, he told \nthe interpreter that he was a refugee and sought asylum. The translator \nlaughed and said that he was unable to translate Mr. Thevakumar's \nrequest into English. In addition to battling a language barrier and an \nuncooperative translator, Mr. Thevakumar's ability to convince the INS \nof his sincerity was further handicapped by the fact that he was \nhandcuffed and shackled for significant portions of the interview.\n  Following his interview, Mr. Thevakumar was briefly detained and was \nallowed to telephone a cousin, who arranged for a lawyer. The lawyer \ncontacted the INS to clarify that Mr. Thevakumar wanted to apply for \nasylum. But the INS sent Mr. Thevakumar back to Istanbul, where his \nflight to New York had originated, without affording him even the \nopportunity to show that he was deserving of asylum. Indeed, the INS \nfaulted him for not making his intention to apply for asylum clear \nduring his secondary inspection interview.\n  Mr. Thevakumar's ordeal did not end there. When he landed in Turkey, \nhe was jailed for four days by immigration officials, who beat and \ninterrogated him before handing him over to regular police. When he was \nfinally released by the police, he was referred to a United Nations \noffice in Ankara, halfway across the country from Istanbul. After 15 \ndays of travel wearing clothes that were completely unsuitable for the \nTurkish winter, he finally arrived at the U.N. office and requested \nrefugee status and asked not to be sent back to Sri Lanka. He is \ncurrently living in a Red Cross facility in Turkey.\n  These stories--just two of the many stories demonstrating the human \ncost of expedited removal--go a long way toward showing the inhumanity \nof the new immigration regime that Congress imposed in 1996. But \nrefugees are not the only people affected by expedited removal. Human \nrights groups have also documented numerous cases where people \ntraveling to the United States on business, with proper travel \ndocuments, have been removed based on the so-called ``sixth sense'' of \na low-level INS officer who suspected that their facially valid \ndocuments were fraudulent. In other words, the damage done by expedited \nremoval also threatens the increasingly international American \neconomy--if businesspeople from\n\n[[Page S14702]]\n\naround the world are treated disrespectfully at our ports of entry, \nthey are likely to take their business elsewhere.\n  But perhaps the most distressing part of expedited removal is that \nthere is no way for us to know how many deserving refugees have been \nexcluded. Because secondary inspection interviews are conducted in \nsecret, we typically only learn about mistakes when refugees manage to \nmake it back to the U.S. a second time, like Dem, or when they are \ndeported to a third country they passed through on their way to the \nU.S., like Mr. Thevakumar. This uncertainty should lead us to be \nespecially wary of continuing this failed experiment.\n  As I said, my bill would limit the use of expedited removal to times \nof immigration emergencies, defined as the arrival or imminent arrival \nof aliens that would substantially exceed the INS' ability to control \nour borders. The bill gives the Attorney General the discretion to \ndeclare an emergency migration situation, and the declaration is good \nfor 90 days. During those 90 days, the INS would be authorized to use \nexpedited removal. The Attorney General is given the power to extend \nthe declaration for further periods of 90 days, in consultation with \nthe House and Senate Judiciary Committees. s\n  This framework allows the government to take extraordinary steps when \na true immigration emergency threatens our ability to patrol our \nborders. At the same time, it recognizes that expedited removal is an \nextraordinary step, and is not an appropriate measure under ordinary \ncircumstances.\n  This bill also provides safeguards that will ensure that refugees are \nassured of some due process rights, even during immigration \nemergencies. First, aliens would be given the right to have an \nimmigration judge review a removal order, and would have the right both \nto speak before the immigration judge on their own behalf and to be \nrepresented at the hearing at their own expense. To make these rights \nmeaningful, immigration officers would be required to inform aliens of \ntheir rights before they are removed or withdraw their application to \nenter the country. This provision takes away from low-level INS \nofficers the unilateral power to remove an alien from the United \nStates.\n  Second, expedited removal will not apply to aliens who have fled from \na country that engages in serious human rights violations. The Attorney \nGeneral, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary of State for \nDemocracy, Human Rights, and Labor, will develop and maintain a list of \nsuch countries. This will help ensure that even during an immigration \nemergency, we will provide added protection for many of our most \nvulnerable refugees.\n  Third, this bill reforms the procedures used to determine whether an \napplicant who seeks asylum has a credible fear of persecution. If an \nasylum officer determines that an applicant does not have a credible \nfear of persecution, the applicant will now have a right to a prompt \nreview by an immigration judge. The applicant will have the right to \nappear at that review hearing and to be represented, at the applicant's \nexpense. In addition to providing procedural guarantees, the bill also \nredefines ``credible fear of persecution'' as a claim for asylum that \nis not clearly fraudulent and is related to the criteria for granting \nasylum. In combination, these changes will make it easier for aliens \nrequesting asylum in the United States to receive an appropriate asylum \nhearing before an immigrant judge.\n  Fourth, the bill clarifies that the Attorney General is not obligated \nto detain asylum applicants while their claims are pending. Asylum \nseekers are not criminals and they do not deserve to be imprisoned or \ndetained against their will. There may be cases where detention is \nappropriate, and this bill allows for such cases, but I believe that \nthat power should only be used in very rare cases. After all, these \napplicants have by definition demonstrated a credible fear of \npersecution. Moreover, detaining asylum applicants imposes a \nsignificant burden on the taxpayers, who of course must foot the bill \nfor the detention. This bill also gives the Attorney General the \nability to release an asylum applicant from detention pending a final \ndetermination of credible fear of persecution.\n  Finally, this Refugee Protection Act also addresses a few other \nproblems that have arisen under the restrictive immigration laws \nCongress passed in 1996. First, it gives aliens the opportunity to \ndemonstrate good cause for filing for asylum after the one-year time \nlimit for claims has expired. By definition, worthy asylum applicants \nhave arrived in the United States following traumatic experiences \nabroad. They often must spend their first months here learning the \nlanguage and adjusting to a culture that in many cases is \nextraordinarily different from the one they know. Therefore, although I \ncan understand the desire to have asylum seekers submit timely \napplications, we must apply the one-year rule with some discretion and \ncommon sense. Indeed, when the Senate passed the 1996 immigration law, \nit contained a broad ``good cause'' exception that did not survive to \nbecome part of the final legislation. The Senate should take up this \nissue again; we were right in 1996, and the need is still there today.\n  In a similar vein, the bill allows asylum applicants whose claims \nhave been rejected to submit a second application where they can show \ngood cause. No one wants to allow aliens to submit repeated \napplications and drain the resources of our INS officers and \nimmigration courts. But there are exceptional cases where a second \napplication is justified, beyond the ``changed circumstances'' \nexception that exists under current law. For example, extraordinarily \nworthy asylum applicants, unfamiliar with the United States and its \nlegal system, might submit an application without the benefit of \ncounsel and without an understanding of the legal requirements of a \nsuccessful asylum claim. Such people deserve a second chance to \ndemonstrate that they deserve to receive asylum.\n  In conclusion, I point out that even in 1996, a year in which \nimmigration was as unpopular in this Capitol as I can remember, this \nbody agreed that expedited removal was inappropriate for a country of \nour ideals and our historic commitment to human rights. And that \nagreement cut across party lines, as many of my Republican colleagues \nvoted to implement expedited removal only in times of immigration \nemergencies. I urge them, as well as my fellow Democrats, to support \nthis legislation and to work for its passage before the end of the \n106th Congress.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleagues from \nVermont, Senator Leahy and Senator Jeffords, among others, to introduce \nthis bill entitled The Refugee Protection Act of 1999, which restores \nfairness to our treatment of refugees who arrive at our shores seeking \nfreedom from persecution and oppression. This bill should dramatically \nreduce incidences where refugees are wrongly returned to their \ncountries to face imprisonment, torture, and even death.\n  It was about 400 years when the refugee Pilgrims arrived in this new \nland seeking religious liberty. Defined by such events since the \nearliest days of the Republic, America has provided asylum to those \nfleeing tyranny and seeking liberty. George Washington urged his fellow \ncitizens ``to render this country more and more a safe and propitious \nasylum for the unfortunates of other countries.'' In his 1801 First \nAnnual Message, President Thomas Jefferson asked, ``Shall oppressed \nhumanity find no asylum on this globe?''\n  In 1996, Congress changed the procedures by which arriving asylum \nseekers ask for protection in the United States, which our legislation \ncorrects. Previously, arriving asylum seekers presented their claims \ndirectly to an immigration judge at an evidentiary hearing. The \napplicant could present witnesses and documentation to support their \nclaim. Decisions by the immigration judge were subject to \nadministrative and judicial review.\n  The new 1996 law did away with these fundamental due process \nprotections, and instead, granted lower level INS officers the power to \nmake life and death decisions that previously were entrusted to \nprofessional immigration judges. This new, unfortunate system of \n``expedited removal'' presently allows for the immediate deportation of \nindividuals who arrive without valid travel documents, such as a \npassport and visa. It can even be used against an individual who has a \nfacially valid visa that INS inspectors suspect was obtained under \nfalse pretenses. In short,\n\n[[Page S14703]]\n\nthe process is so expedited and summary that it has resulted in the \nimproper deportation of refugees fleeing persecution and torture. \nSimply put, our legislation restores the pre-1996 due process \nprocedures, including a judicial review.\n  Last year, Congress addressed the problems of religious persecution \nwhich continues to be a serious problem worldwide. Enactment of the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act was the first time in the history \nof democracy that any country had adopted comprehensive, national \nlegislation on religious liberty. That legislation ensures that \nreligious liberty will be an important factor in our nation's foreign \npolicy considerations. In the May 17, 1999 final report to the \nSecretary of State and to President of the United States, the Advisory \nCommittee on Religious Freedom Abroad said:\n\n       Putting an end to such (religious) persecution cannot be \n     accomplished without providing meaningful protection to the \n     victims of religious persecution. We must upgrade domestic \n     procedures that identify and protect refugees and asylum \n     seekers fleeing religious persecution. We must strengthen our \n     overseas refugee processing mechanisms to reach those in need \n     of rescue. . . And, here at home we must eliminate processes \n     such as ``expedited removal'' that can make victims of those \n     fleeing religious persecution rather than providing access to \n     protection.\n\n  Consistent with this commitment to protect international religious \nliberty, we must also ensure that persons fleeing religious persecution \nare not wrongly turned away at our shores because of unfair procedures. \nThis will be accomplished through this Act.\n  The Refugee Protection Act returns fairness to the system by limiting \nexpedited removal procedures only to emergency situations. An \n``emergency'' must be declared as such by the Attorney General, and \ntypically involves large numbers of immigrants arriving en masse, so as \nto overwhelm the INS review system. In the event that ``expedited \nremoval'' is employed, the Act requires an immigration judge to review \nthe summary deportation order. Also, it permits claims for asylum to be \nfiled beyond the one-year deadline created by the 1996 legislation, if \nthere is good cause for the delay or when consideration of the claims \nis clearly in the interest of justice.\n  Our refugee asylum system reflects both the best and the worst \npolicies, throughout our history as a nation. In 1939, more than 900 \nJews aboard the SS St. Louis, who were within sight of Miami, were \nrejected and forced to return to Europe where they were murdered in \nconcentration camps. Yet when World War II ended, the United States led \nthe effort to establish universally recognized fundamental rights. As a \nresult of this advocacy, the General Assembly of the United Nations \nadopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948 \nwhich recognized a right of asylum.\n  Over the next 30 years the United States provided refuge to numerous \npeople fleeing communism, including to those involved in `underground' \ndemocracy movements in Hungary, Cuba, and Southeast Asia. Yet it was \nnot until 1980 that Congress enacted a comprehensive asylum system \nusing the criteria of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of \nRefugees. The Convention defines a refugee as someone with a ``well-\nfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, \nnationality, membership of a particular social group or political \nopinion.'' Under the procedures of this Refugee Act of 1980, requests \nfor asylum were decided by an immigration judge, thus providing a \nfundamental due process protection. Notably, this judicial review was \nstripped in the 1996 legislation, and is a flaw which our legislation \nseeks to correct.\n  Fair procedures are critically important in making life or death \ndecisions, as asylum cases can be. At a June 24, 1999 hearing of the \nSenate Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, Ms. \nLavinia Limon, Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, noted:\n\n       Once released, torture victims often attempt to flee to \n     countries such as the United States to become invisible and \n     safe, and to survive. But they retain the impact of \n     torture: they are not able to speak of their experiences \n     for fear officials will not believe them or understand \n     them or will regard them as criminals. They often cannot \n     express themselves effectively in asylum interviews \n     because they cannot speak articulately of their \n     experiences and they feel vulnerable to all officials. \n     They have learned to fear government and the police and \n     they do not trust any government officials and authorities \n     to help them. They have been weakened and disabled \n     psychologically from the torture. Many times the victims \n     must flee alone, enduring long periods of separation from \n     their families who might otherwise provide emotional \n     support.\n\n  Today the need for proper asylum reviews is greater than ever. \nWorldwide, religious intolerance and ethnic strife turn religious \nleaders and ordinary citizens into desperate asylum seekers. According \nto Amnesty International, government-sanctioned torture is practiced in \n125 countries.\n  This legislation helps those fleeing intolerable injustices in the \nname of religious freedom and democracy. Placing the decision squarely \nin the hands of an immigration judge does not impose an unreasonable or \nimpossible burden on the government. Congress should enact the Refugee \nProtection Act because it restores the fundamental due process \nprotections needed to ensure that legitimate asylum seekers are not \nwrongly turned away.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Leahy, Brownback, and Jeffords, to introduce a \nbill that will reduce the likelihood that people fleeing genuine \npersecution in their homelands and seeking refuge in America will be \nunfairly returned to their countries.\n  Mr. President, as you know, our nation has been built by people who \narrived on our shores from all over the world. Immigrants have enriched \nour nation economically, culturally, and in so many other invaluable \nways. I don't think anyone can dispute that, of all the countries in \nthe world, our nation has the deepest, richest commitment to welcoming \nall people who want to make a new home and a new life.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, our nation also has a deep tradition \nof welcoming those who are fleeing oppression in their native land. \nFrom the pilgrims who set foot in present day Massachusetts and \nVirginia, to the Kosovars who fled brutality in their homeland earlier \nthis year, America has been a safe refuge for those fleeing \npersecution. Our nation's first president, George Washington, said: \n``America is open to receive not only the opulent and respectable \nstranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all nations and \nreligions.'' George Washington said those words in 1783. One hundred \nand one years later, France would present our country with a gift, a \nstatue called ``Liberty Enlightening the World.'' In 1884, that title \nwas a profound statement of our nation's past, our present and hope for \nthe future. ``Liberty Enlightening the World'' later became known as \nthe Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty has these words inscribed \non her:\n\n     . . . Give me your tired, your poor,\n     Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n     The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\n     I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, our current asylum and immigration laws \nhave nearly slammed the door shut on victims of persecution, even those \nwho are sure to suffer if returned to their home countries. Current law \noriginates with the passage in 1996 of the Illegal Immigration Reform \nand Immigrant Responsibility Act. That law was an attempt to combat \nillegal immigration. But in the process, Congress denied victims of \npersecution the protection that our nation historically has offered. \nThe current system provides for the immediate deportation of \nindividuals who arrive without travel documents precisely in order. \nNow, Mr. President, it's appropriate that we require these documents, \nbut people who have fled torture and great brutality may not have \nproper documentation because of the circumstances under which they fled \ntheir homelands. As a result, genuine victims of persecution face the \nrisk of being turned away at our borders and put on the next plane back \nto face imprisonment, torture or death. The 1996 law effectively \nempowers low level INS officers to summarily make the life and death \ndecision as to whether to deport an asylum seeker. Prior to 1996, those \ndecisions were made by an immigration judge. We must return a judicial \nrole to the review of asylum claims.\n\n  As my colleagues who were here in 1995 and 1996 may recall, the 1996 \nlaw\n\n[[Page S14704]]\n\nwas enacted in reaction to a flurry of concern that our border controls \nwere too lax. The debate on the 1996 law was fueled by legitimate \nconcern over criminals who managed to enter the country and commit acts \nof terrorism or other crimes. In response, the INS began a sensible \ntightening of the asylum process. In 1994 and 1995, the INS ceased \nissuing work authorizations at the border. Instead, asylum seekers had \nto wait until an adjudication of their case before receiving work \nauthorization. As a result, claims for asylum dropped dramatically--\nthose who were seeking work but did not have a legitimate fear of \npersecution were no longer claiming asylum. The INS reforms were \neffective. But the 1996 law went too far. In our rush to keep \nundesirable asylum applicants out, Congress created a system where \nthose with bona fide asylum claims face the great risk of being \nimmediately deported to face the wrath of oppressive home governments \nwithout a real chance to make their case.\n  Because an INS officer has the authority to deport refugees \nimmediately, with no record keeping requirement, it has been difficult \nto determine exactly how many genuine refugees with a valid fear of \npersecution in their home countries have been turned away at our \nairports and borders as a result of the 1996 law. Organizations like \nthe Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, however, have been able to \ncollect some data on the extent of the problem.\n  One of the most troubling stories is the case of a 21-year-old \nKosovar Albanian known as ``Dem.'' In October 1998, Serb police seized \nDem at his home, beat him, and threatened to kill his family. This \nabuse occurred over a period of ten days. When the Serb police finally \nreleased Dem, he fled Kosovo. He eventually made his way to the United \nStates in January of this year, landing in California via Mexico City. \nWhen he arrived, the INS arranged for a Serbian translator to assist by \ntelephone with its questioning of Dem. But Dem, a Kosovar Albanian, \ncould not speak Serbian. After the translator spoke with Dem, the \ntranslator said something to the INS officer. The INS officer promptly \nhandcuffed and fingerprinted Dem and then put him on a plane back to \nMexico City.\n  Fortunately, Dem was not returned to Kosovo. Dem tried re-entering \nthe United States and on this second attempt, he was allowed to apply \nfor asylum. But the facts supporting Dem's asylum claim had not \nchanged. We must fix a system that produces such arbitrary results \nwhere people's lives, and American ideals, are at stake.\n  We don't know exactly how many victims of real persecution have been \nimmediately deported, and we obviously don't know exactly what has \nhappened to each victim since enactment of the 1996 law. What we do \nknow is that an asylum seeker who is fleeing torture, abuse or death \nfaces the risk of being kicked out of our country, without even \nobtaining a perfunctory hearing before an immigration judge.\n  The Refugee Protection Act of 1999 will return fairness and due \nprocess to the treatment of asylum seekers. For non-emergency migration \nsituations, the bill would restore the pre-1996 law, when immigration \njudges were involved in the decision to deport someone who claimed \nasylum. The current process will continue to apply in emergency \nmigration situations and would designate the Attorney General as the \nofficial with authority to determine when an emergency migration \nsituation exists. The bill also would provide that an emergency cannot \nexist for more than 90 days, unless the Attorney General, after \nconsultation with the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, determines \nthat the emergency situation continues to exist.\n  Mr. President, this is a sensible bill that allows us to scrutinize \nthose who come to our borders, but honors our best traditions and \nreturns fairness and humanity to our treatment of those who are fleeing \npersecution. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Leahy, \nBrownback and Jeffords in fighting for basic human dignity, decency and \njustice. Let us lift the torch of ``Liberty Enlightening the World'' \nonce again. Let us not reflexively turn away those whose very lives may \ndepend on a fair hearing as they seek refuge in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1941. A bill to amend the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act \nof 1974 to authorize the Director of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency to provide assistance to fire departments and fire prevention \norganizations for the purpose of protecting the public and firefighting \npersonnel against fire and fire-related hazards; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n          Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague and \nfriend, Senator DeWine of Ohio, to introduce legislation that would \nrepresent our nation's first comprehensive commitment to fire safety. \nThe Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act (the FIRE \nbill), will, for the first time, provide volunteer and professional \nfirefighters with the resources they need to protect the people and \nproperty of their towns and cities.\n  In communities throughout America, firefighters are almost always the \nfirst to respond to a call for help. They respond to a fire alarm. They \nare on the scene of traffic accidents and construction accidents. \nEmergency medical technicians, who often belong to fire departments, \neach day answer tens of thousands of calls for medical assistance. And, \nwhen a natural or manmade calamity strikes--from hurricanes to school \nshootings to bombings--firefighters are there without fail, restoring \norder and saving lives.\n  Given all that they do, it should surprise no one that, across the \nNation, fire departments struggle to find resources to help keep our \ncommunities safe. As the demands placed on fire departments have grown \nin volume and magnitude, the ability of local residents to support them \nhas been put to a severe test. As a result, towns and cities throughout \nthe country are struggling mightily to provide the fire departments \nwith the resources they require.\n  The FIRE Act will help localities meet that critical objective. It \nwill provide grants to help localities hire more firefighters, train \nnew and existing personnel to handle the volume and intensity of \ntoday's tragedies, and purchase badly needed equipment.\n  This legislation will also provide critical resources to communities \nto fund fire prevention and education programs so that they can \nanticipate disasters and respond appropriately. Such programs are \ncritical means of preventing tragedies from occurring in the first \nplace. Eight out of ten fire deaths occur in a place where people feel \nthe safest--their homes. Tragically, our children and the elderly \naccount for a disproportionate number of these deaths. Indeed, \npreschool children face a risk of death from fire that is more than \ntwice the risk for all age groups combined. While we can and should \nensure that the fire equipment and personnel are available to respond \nto these tragedies, our best defense remains education and prevention. \nYet, it is a painful irony that when resources are scarce, education \nand prevention efforts are often the first to be put on the budgetary \nchopping block. The legislation Senator DeWine and I are introducing \nwill help ensure that no locality is put in the painful position of \nchoosing between prevention and responding to emergencies.\n  This legislation will enable our fire departments to worry more about \nsaving lives and less about finding dollars. It will enable communities \nto better prevent disasters, and better train firefighters.\n  I look forward to working with Senator DeWine to successfully advance \nthis legislation in the Senate. It is our shared hope that our \ncolleagues will come to realize that this bill is one whose time has \ncome. Our Nation's firefighters deserve the support that this bill will \nprovide, and I hope that we will give it to them before the end of this \nCongress.\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, each day, we entrust our lives and \nthe safety of our families, friends, and neighbors to the capable hands \nof the brave men and women in our local police and fire departments. \nThese individuals have decided that they are willing to risk their \nlives and safety out of a dedication to their citizens and their \ncommitment to public service.\n  In Congress, we have recognized the dangers inherent in police work \nby\n\n[[Page S14705]]\n\ndedicating federal resources to help local police departments. In fact, \nthis year, Fiscal Year (FY) 1999, the federal government spent $11 \nbillion on law enforcement initiatives, such as the COPS program, to \nhelp local law enforcement face the daily challenges of their \ncommunities. In contrast, though, the federal government spent only $32 \nmillion on fire prevention and training.\n  We ask local firefighters to risk no less than their lives every time \nthey respond to a fire alarm. We ask them to risk their lives \nresponding to the approximately two million reports of fire that they \nreceive on an annual basis. We expect them to be willing to give their \nlives in exchange for the lives of our families, neighbors, and friends \nonce every 71 seconds while responding to the 400,000 residential \nfires--fires which represent only about 22% of all fires reported. We \ncount on them to protect our lives and the lives of our loved ones.\n  I believe the Federal Government needs to show a greater commitment \nto the fire services. So, today, along with my colleague and friend \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, I rise to introduce the Firefighter \nInvestment and Response Enhancement Act--or, FIRE bill. This bill is \nvery simple. It authorizes, over five years, $5 billion in grants to \nlocal fire departments. These grants can be used for just about any \npurpose--training, equipment, hiring more firefighters, or education \nand prevention programs. A new office, established by this bill under \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), would be responsible \nfor distributing grants to local departments based on a competitive \nprocess, involving needs assessment. To ensure that the funding is not \nspent solely on brand new state-of-the-art fire trucks, it mandates \nthat no more than 25% of the grant funding can be used to purchase new \nfire vehicles. Finally, it requires that at least 10% of the funds are \nused for fire prevention programs.\n  Our bill is supported by the National Safe Kids Campaign, the \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters, International Association \nof Fire Chiefs, national Volunteer Fire Council, International \nAssociation of Arson Investigators, International Society of Fire \nService Instructors, and the National Fire Protection Association. It \nis also a companion measure to legislation introduced in the House by \nCongressmen Pascrell and Weldon, where almost 200 members of the House \nof Representatives have cosponsored it. I am proud to introduce this \nbill with my friend from Connecticut and look forward to working to \nensure that the federal government increases its commitment to the men \nand women who make up our local fire departments. We owe it to \nthem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1942. A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to establish \ngrant programs to provide State pharmacy assistance programs and \nmedication management programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               PHARMACEUTICAL AID FOR OLDER AMERICANS ACT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, there has been considerable attention \nrightfully paid by our colleagues this year to the issue of providing \nprescription drug coverage for our older American citizens. Estimates \nof the number of older Americans without some form of added coverage \nfor prescription drugs vary between a low of 16.7 percent to 50 \npercent. About 7.7 million Medicare beneficiaries with annual incomes \nbelow 200 percent of poverty have no prescription drug coverage, \ndespite some evidence indicating they are in poorer health than those \nbeneficiaries with coverage. Those without added coverage for \nprescription benefits spend approximately 50 percent of their total \nincome on out-of-pocket health care costs, and there are anecdotal \nreports that some elders forgo taking their prescribed medicines in \norder to have food to eat. Finally, there are econometric studies that \nconclude that a $1 increase in pharmaceutical expenditure is associated \nwith a $3.65 reduction in hospital care expenditure.\n  The problems posed by the lack of prescription drug coverage for the \nneediest elders is compounded by the well-documented effects of \ninappropriate drug use among the elderly. In 1995, the General \nAccounting Office (GAO) found that inappropriate drug use among elders \nis acute and that elders were particularly susceptible to unintended, \nadverse drug events (ADEs), due in part to the natural aging process \nand also to the likelihood that they are taking multiple medications. \nOne study of drug use by the elderly, done by the Vermont Program for \nQuality in Health Care, found that it was not uncommon for elders to be \ntaking more than a dozen drugs at one time. In fact, the Vermont study \nactually documented one case in which ``a single individual received \nprescriptions for 71 different drugs in a single year, several of which \nprobably should not have been taken in combination.''\n  The GAO report also cited studies showing that hospitalizations for \nelderly patients due to ADEs were six times greater than for the \ngeneral population, with an estimated annual cost of $20 billion. \nHowever, a recent Journal of the American Medical Association article \nindicated that the level of ADEs could be reduced 66 percent, if a \npharmacist participated in grand rounds. Clearly, more must be done to \nrecognize the importance of medication management programs that ensure \nthe quality of drug therapy, including patient evaluations, compliance \nassessments, and drug therapy reviews.\n  We are all aware that prescription drug costs continue to grow at an \nalarming rate. Seniors are being forced to spend greater and greater \nportions of their fixed incomes on prescription drugs which they need \nto live. Research and development of prescription drugs have come a \nlong way since Medicare was originally enacted in 1965. Today, drugs \nare just as important as hospital visits, and in many cases more \nimportant, and it just doesn't make sense for Medicare to reimburse \nhospitals for surgery but not to provide coverage for the drugs that \nmight prevent surgery. We need to modernize the Medicare program so \nthat it does not go bankrupt in the next 10 to 15 years, and at the \nsame time we must ensure that any Medicare reform proposal we consider \nincludes a prescription drug benefit that helps all seniors.\n  Mr. President, I have already introduced two measures that will help \nour older citizens obtain the medicines they need and at prices they \ncan afford. My first bill, S. 1462, the ``Personal Use Prescription \nDrug Importation Act of 1999,'' allows Americans of all ages to avail \nthemselves of the lower prices for prescription medicines that are \navailable in Canada. A second measure, S. 1725, the ``DrugGap Insurance \nfor Seniors Act of 1999,'' would provide for a more comprehensive \naccess to prescription drugs by Medicare beneficiaries through reform \nand modernization of the Medicare Supplemental, Medigap, program. Under \nthis approach, all existing Medigap plans, and three new drug-only \nMedigap plans, would provide various levels of prescription drug \nbenefits from which seniors could choose. And our neediest elders' \nneeds would be supported through Federal contributions for the cost of \ntheir premiums.\n  During the 1st Session of the 106th Congress, no fewer than eight \nbills have been introduced in the Senate to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit for Medicare beneficiaries--with most proposals estimated to \ncost between $5 billion and $40 billion per year. While I'm hopeful \nthat we will all work hard to include a prescription drug benefit for \nMedicare beneficiaries, I am also concerned that at the end of the \nCongress we may not be successful. That is why I am introducing a \nmeasure today, the ``Pharmaceutical Aid to Older Americans Act,'' which \nwill serve as a backstop for our neediest elders. This program builds \non State pharmacy assistance programs that are already in place, and it \nencourages States to begin them where they don't already exist.\n  Fifteen States are cutting new and innovative paths for providing \nprescription drug coverage for their neediest citizens. Most of these \nprograms are for elder citizens (more than half also cover people with \ndisabilities), and cover a wide variety of drugs--though some are \nlimited to certain drugs or conditions, some require cost sharing for \nprescription medicines, and some have annual enrollment fees or monthly \npremiums. As of 1997, these programs aided over 700,000 people. The\n\n[[Page S14706]]\n\nPharmaceutical Aid to Older Americans Act is designed to assist States \nin their efforts to provide medicines and appropriate pharmacy \ncounseling benefits for their neediest elders.\n  This Act will strengthen the Older Americans Act by authorizing two \ndiscretionary grant programs, subject to appropriations, to fund State-\nbased pharmaceutical assistance and medication management programs. \nUnder this measure, States would develop models that work best for them \nand would have the latitude to design and implement innovative \napproaches for providing benefits to their neediest elders. States \nawarded grant money would agree to: match Federal funds with 30 percent \nnew or existing State funds or in-kind contributions and not supplant \ncurrent State expenditures with Federal funds. In-kind contributions \ncounting toward the match requirement could include assistance from \npharmaceutical companies and organization- and community-based \npharmacies, thereby making this approach a truly public-private \npartnership.\n  Each application for pharmaceutical assistance funds must include a \nmedication management program that ensures the quality of drug \ntherapies through patient evaluations, compliance assessments, and drug \ntherapy reviews. Federal funds could be used to provide drug coverage \nbenefits only to eligible beneficiaries, defined as Medicare \nbeneficiaries with incomes up to 200 percent of poverty but without any \nother coverage for prescription drug benefits (States could expand \neligibility with State resources). All senior citizens could utilize \nthe medication management portion of the program.\n\n  This is not government control of drug prices or price-fixing. The \nStates can purchase pharmaceuticals from any willing seller, including \npharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmaceutical distributors, wholesalers, \npharmacy benefit management firms (PBMs), and chain or local \npharmacies, without any Federal requirement for wholesale prices or \nMedicaid-based rebates. In some instances, it's likely that States may \nbe able to negotiate better purchasing prices than any of those set by \nsome artificial, imposed ceiling. Finally, for those States that choose \nnot to provide pharmaceutical benefits, the Act authorizes grants to \nStates to create or support stand-alone Medication Management Programs \nthat will involve the States in collaborative efforts with community, \nchain-based, and institutional pharmacists to implement medication \nmanagement programs.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, I am fully committed to \nproviding a prescription benefit for all our elders as we move forward \non comprehensive reform of the Medicare program. I am equally committed \nto seeing that the Older Americans Act is reauthorized this Congress, \nand I will work diligently to get these jobs accomplished. However, if \nthe latter effort succeeds and the former doesn't, then the \nPharmaceutical Assistance for Older Americans Act will be in place to \nprovide much-needed medicines for our neediest elders. I'm very pleased \nMr. President, that this measure has received endorsement of two of the \nkey advocacy organizations associated with the Older Americans Act, the \nNational Association of Area Agencies on Aging and the National \nAssociation of State Units on Aging. Note that these guardians of the \naged support this measure, like me, if and only if we are unsuccessful \nin passing a prescription drug benefit for the Medicare program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and the text of \nthese letters and this measure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1942\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

We believe \n     implementation of this Act could be an ideal interim measure \n     until a Medicare prescription drug benefit is enacted.\n       As you know, a fast-growing aging population coupled with \n     escalating pharmaceutical costs makes the lack of \n     prescription drug coverage one of the most pressing problems \n     facing our nation's older Americans. The proposed State \n     Pharmacy Assistance Program would allow states with existing \n     benefit programs to expand services and provide a strong \n     incentive for other states to implement a prescription drug \n     program.\n       Your legislative measure also goes far in addressing drug \n     misuse, which is another escalating and dangerous problem. \n     The proposed Medication Management Program would provide \n     states with a financial base to implement a statewide \n     information, education and counseling program that would \n     significantly benefit the health and welfare of older adults.\n       While N4A supports your proposal in concept, we have some \n     specific questions about the implementation of these programs \n     and concerns about the roles and responsibilities of Area \n     Agencies on Aging (AAAs) and Title IV Native American \n     grantees. We welcome the opportunity to meet with you in the \n     near future to address these concerns.\n       Again, we applaud your efforts and look forward to working \n     with you next session as you further define the proposal and \n     shepherd it through the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Janice Jackson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                         State Units on Aging,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 10, 1999.\n     Sean Donohue,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sean: Dan Quirk and I reviewed the draft you sent last \n     week outlining Senator Jeffords' proposed Pharmaceutical Aid \n     to Older Americans Act. Overall, the proposal to provide \n     grants to states to support the development or expansion of \n     pharmaceutical assistance programs and medication management \n     programs is a good one, and using the existing infrastructure \n     of the Older Americans Act makes good sense. The aging \n     network is well suited to develop and administer these types \n     of programs. Your proposal was well developed and thoughtful.\n       Both programs would provide valuable assistance to older \n     people who do not have any other prescription drug coverage \n     available. The requirement for a 30-percent state match seems \n     high, but allowing contributions to be ``in-kind'' will help \n     states in that regard. The income eligibility level of 200-\n     percent of the federal poverty level may conflict with the \n     eligibility levels set by states in existing programs, though \n     I haven't done an analysis of this yet. As with other \n     programs under the Older Americans Act, if state-funded \n     programs already exist that provide the same services, and \n     eligibility or cost sharing requirements are at odds with the \n     federal program, it requires states essentially to manage two \n     different funding streams for the same program or set of \n     services. As always, giving states the flexibility to blend \n     federal funds with state funds to develop one program would \n     decrease administrative expenses for the states and allow the \n     money saved to be used for direct services.\n       NASUA continues to support overall reform of the Medicare \n     program that would provide a comprehensive prescription drug \n     benefit to beneficiaries. In the meantime, state-funded \n     programs that are being developed and which would be \n     supported under this proposal continue to fill in the gaps \n     for people with no coverage for prescription drugs. This \n     proposal would strengthen the existing infrastructure, and \n     perhaps could serve to support a prescription program under \n     Medicare whenever it may be implemented in the future.\n       We hope this proposal will generate some further interest \n     in reauthorizing the Older Americans Act as soon as possible, \n     hopefully before the end of the 106th Congress. We were very \n     disappointed that reauthorization was stalled over long-\n     standing disagreements over the Title V program.\n       If there is anything NASUA can do to support Senator \n     Jeffords proposal and reauthorization, please let me know.\n       Thanks for the opportunity to review the Pharmaceutical Aid \n     to Older Americans Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kathleen C. Konka,\n                                                 Policy Associate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 1943. A bill to provide for an inexpensive book distribution \nprogram; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  first book distribution program act\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I introduce \nlegislation on another topic I will be discussing with Chairman \nJeffords as we move forward with reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee.\n\n  I am introducing legislation today to fund an innovative book \ndistribution\n\n[[Page S14708]]\n\nprogram targeted at giving low-income students their own ``first \nbook.''\n  The ``First Book'' program is a non-profit private organization that \nhas been tremendously successful gathering and distibuting new \nchildren's books to needy children throughout the nation. Key to the \nsuccess of ``First Book'' are local boards called ``First Book Local \nAdvisory Boards.'' Under my legislation, which would provide $5 million \na year federal investment to such boards, will help them leverage \nmillions more in funds from other sources. ``First Book'' has been \nsuccessful because it is locally-driven, and reflects private industry \ninitiative. ``First Book'' provides new books, which the program \npurchases from publishers at discount rates, to disadvantaged children \nand families primarily through tutoring, mentoring, and family literacy \nprograms.\n  This bill builds on successful efforts underway in communities across \nthe country. It takes what has been a successful but very targeted \nprogram, and will increase its reach and effect into many more American \ncommunities. ``First Book'' makes a very real difference for \ndisadvantaged children and their families, and with this investment, it \nwill make a difference for thousands more.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 1944. A bill to provide national challenge grants for innovation \nin the education of homeless children and youth; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n          stuart mc kinney homeless education improvement act\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation on \nanother topic I will be discussing with Chairman Jeffords as we move \nforward with reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n\n  The bill deals with an improvement I hope we can make in the Stuart \nMcKinney Homeless Education program. While the McKinney program is \nrelatively small, my hope is that we can greatly improve its \neffectiveness by recognizing and funding innovative approaches for \nserving homeless students.\n  Chairman Jeffords and others have recognized that keeping a homeless \nchild in their school district of origin is vital to their success. \nChildren, especially homeless children, need continuity in their lives. \nYet as a nation, we have not yet focused on funding the innovative \npractices that will show how this can be done and done effectively.\n  In addition, there are chronic problems facing homeless children, \nsuch as the problems of trying to reach out to unaccompanied homeless \nyouth, those young people who do not have parents or guardians with \nthem in their homeless situation. Homeless preschoolers present another \nwhole range of issues that many schools struggle to overcome.\n  My legislation will provide $2 million each year in national \ncompetitive challenge grants for innovation in the education of \nhomeless children and youth. We follow this same approach in education \ntechnology and other areas, and challenge grants are remarkably \nsuccessful in sparking innovation and dissemination of new methods of \ninstruction.\n  Homeless students face many challenges, and schools face challenges \nin serving them. Creating a small challenge grant for homeless \neducation is one necessary step we can take to help schools help these \nstudents succeed and achieve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 1948. A bill to amend the provisions of title 17, United States \nCode, and the Communications Act of 1934, relating to copyright \nlicensing and carriage of broadcast signals by satellite; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  intellectual property and communications omnibus reform act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nsection-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  S. 1948--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. Short Title. This Act may be cited as the \n     ``Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act \n     of 1999.''\n\n         TITLE I--SATELLITE HOME VIEWER IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n       When Congress passed the Satellite Home Viewer Act in 1988, \n     few Americans were familiar with satellite television. They \n     typically resided in rural areas of the country where the \n     only means of receiving television programming was through \n     use of a large, backyard C-band satellite dish. Congress \n     recognized the importance of providing these people with \n     access to broadcast programming, and created a compulsory \n     copyright license in the Satellite Home Viewer Act that \n     enabled satellite carriers to easily license the copyrights \n     to the broadcast programming that they retransmitted to their \n     subscribers.\n       The 1988 Act fostered a boom in the satellite television \n     industry. Coupled with the development of high-powered \n     satellite service, or DSS, which delivers programming to a \n     satellite dish as small as 18 inches in diameter, the \n     satellite industry now serves homes nationwide with a wide \n     range of high quality programming. Satellite is no longer \n     primarily a rural service, for it offers an attractive \n     alternative to other providers of multichannel video \n     programming; in particular, cable television. Because \n     satellite can provide direct competition with the cable \n     industry, it is in the public interest to ensure that \n     satellite operates under a copyright framework that permits \n     it to be an effective competitor.\n       The compulsory copyright license created by the 1988 Act \n     was limited to a five year period to enable Congress to \n     consider its effectiveness and renew it where necessary. The \n     license was renewed in 1994 for an additional five years, and \n     amendments made that were intended to increase the \n     enforcement of the network territorial restrictions of the \n     compulsory license. Two-year transitional provisions were \n     created to enable local network broadcasters to challenge \n     satellite subscribers' receipt of satellite network service \n     where the local network broadcaster had reason to believe \n     that these subscribers received an adequate off-the-air \n     signal from the broadcaster. The transitional provisions were \n     minimally effective and caused much consumer confusion and \n     anger regarding receipt of television network stations.\n       The satellite license is slated to expire at the end of \n     this year, requiring Congress to again consider the copyright \n     licensing regime for satellite retransmissions of over-the-\n     air television broadcast stations. In passing this \n     legislation, the Conference Committee was guided by several \n     principles. First, the Conference Committee believes that \n     promotion of competition in the marketplace for delivery of \n     multichannel video programming is an effective policy to \n     reduce costs to consumers. To that end, it is important that \n     the satellite industry be afforded a statutory scheme for \n     licensing television broadcast programming similar to that of \n     the cable industry. At the same time, the practical \n     differences between the two industries must be recognized and \n     accounted for.\n       Second, the Conference Committee reasserts the importance \n     of protecting and fostering the system of television networks \n     as they relate to the concept of localism. It is well \n     recognized that television broadcast stations provide \n     valuable programming tailored to local needs, such as news, \n     weather, special announcements and information related to \n     local activities. To that end, the Committee has structured \n     the copyright licensing regime for satellite to encourage and \n     promote retransmissions by satellite of local television \n     broadcast stations to subscribers who reside in the local \n     markets of those stations.\n       Third, perhaps most importantly, the Conference Committee \n     is aware that in creating compulsory licenses, it is acting \n     in derogation of the exclusive property rights granted by the \n     Copyright Act to copyright holders, and that it therefore \n     needs to act as narrowly as possible to minimize the effects \n     of the government's intrusion on the broader market in which \n     the affected property rights and industries operate. In this \n     context, the broadcast television market has developed in \n     such a way that copyright licensing practices in this area \n     take into account the national network structure, which \n     grants exclusive territorial rights to programming in a local \n     market to local stations either directly or through \n     affiliation agreements. The licenses granted in this \n     legislation attempt to hew as closely to those arrangements \n     as possible. For example, these arrangements are mirrored in \n     the section 122 ``local-to-local'' license, which grants \n     satellite carriers the right to retransmit local stations \n     within the station's local market, and does not require a \n     separate copyright payment because the works have already \n     been licensed and paid for with respect to viewers in those \n     local markets. By contrast, allowing the importation of \n     distant or out-of-market network stations in derogation of \n     the local stations' exclusive right--bought and paid for in \n     market-negotiated arrangements--to show the works in question \n     undermines those market arrangements. Therefore, the specific \n     goal of the 119 license, which is to allow for a life-line \n     network television service to those homes beyond the reach of \n     their local television stations, must be met by only allowing \n     distant network service to those homes which cannot receive \n     the local network television stations. Hence, the ``unserved \n     household'' limitation that has been in the license since its \n     inception. The Committee is mindful and respectful of the\n\n[[Page S14709]]\n\n     interrelationship between the communications policy of \n     ``localism'' outlined above and property rights \n     considerations in copyright law, and seeks a proper balance \n     between the two.\n       Finally, although the legislation promotes satellite \n     retransmissions of local stations, the Conference Committee \n     recognizes the continued need to monitor the effects of \n     distant signal importation by satellite. To that end, the \n     compulsory license for retransmission of distant signals is \n     extended for a period of five years, to afford Congress the \n     opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness and continuing need \n     for that license at the end of the five-year period.\n     Section 1001. Short Title\n       This title may be cited as the ``Satellite Home Viewer \n     Improvement Act.''\n     Section 1002. Limitations on Exclusive Rights; Secondary \n         Transmissions by Satellite Carriers Within Local Markets\n       The House and the Senate provisions were in most respects \n     highly similar. The conference substitute generally follows \n     the House approach, with the differences described here.\n       Section 1002 of this Act creates a new statutory license, \n     with no sunset provision, as a new section 122 of the \n     Copyright Act of 1976. The new license authorizes the \n     retransmission of television broadcast stations by satellite \n     carriers to subscribers located within the local markets of \n     those stations.\n       Creation of a new statutory license for retransmission of \n     local signals is necessary because the current section 119 \n     license is limited to the retransmission of distance signals \n     by satellite. The section 122 license allows satellite \n     carriers for the first time to provide their subscribers with \n     the television signals they want most: their local stations. \n     A carrier may retransmit the signal of a network station (or \n     superstation) to all subscribers who reside within the local \n     market of that station, without regard to whether the \n     subscriber resides in an ``unserved household.'' The term \n     ``local market'' is defined in Section 119(j)(2), and \n     generally refers to a station's Designated Market Area as \n     defined by Nielsen.\n       Because the section 122 license is permanent, subscribers \n     may obtain their local television stations without fear that \n     their local broadcast service may be turned off at a future \n     date. In addition, satellite carriers may deliver local \n     stations to commercial establishments as well as homes, as \n     the cable industry does under its license. These amendments \n     create parity and enhanced competition between the satellite \n     and cable industries in the provision of local television \n     broadcast stations.\n       For a satellite carrier to be eligible for this license, \n     this Act, following the House approach, provides both in new \n     section 122(a) and in new section 122(d) that a carrier may \n     use the new local-to-local license only if it is in full \n     compliance with all applicable rules and regulations of the \n     Federal Communications Commission, including any requirements \n     that the Commission may adopt by regulation concerning \n     carriage of stations or programming exclusivity. These \n     provisions are modeled on similar provisions in section 111, \n     the terrestrial compulsory license. Failure to fully comply \n     with Commission rules with respect to retransmission of one \n     or more stations in the local market precludes the carrier \n     from making use of the section 122 license. Put another way, \n     the statutory license overrides the normal copyright scheme \n     only to the extent that carriers strictly comply with the \n     limits Congress has put on that license.\n       Because terrestrial systems, such as cable, as a general \n     rule do not pay any copyright royalty for local \n     retransmissions of broadcast stations, the section 122 \n     license does not require payment of any copyright royalty by \n     satellite carriers for transmissions made in compliance with \n     the requirements of section 122. By contrast, the section 119 \n     statutory license for distant signals does require payment of \n     royalties. In addition, the section 122 statutory license \n     contains no ``unserved household'' limitation, while the \n     section 119 license does contain that limitation.\n       Satellite carriers are liable for copyright infringement, \n     and subject to the full remedies of the Copyright Act, if \n     they violate one or more of the following requirements of the \n     section 122 license. First, satellite carriers may not in any \n     way willfully alter the programming contained on a local \n     broadcast station.\n       Second, satellite carriers may not use the section 122 \n     license to retransmit a television broadcast station to a \n     subscriber located outside the local market of the station. \n     Retransmission of a station to a subscriber located outside \n     the station's local market is covered by section 119, and is \n     permitted only when all conditions of that license are \n     satisfied. Accordingly, satellite carriers are required to \n     provide local broadcasters with accurate lists of the street \n     addresses of their local-to-local subscribers so that \n     broadcasters may verify that satellite carriers are making \n     proper use of the license. The subscriber information \n     supplied to broadcasters is for verification purposes only, \n     and may not be used by broadcasters for any other reason. Any \n     knowing provision of false information by a satellite carrier \n     would, under section 122(d), bar use of the Section 122 \n     license by the carrier engaging in such practices. The \n     section 122 license contains remedial provisions parallel to \n     those of Section 119, including a ``pattern or practice'' \n     provision that requires termination of the Section 122 \n     statutory license as to a particular satellite carrier if it \n     engages in certain abuses of the license.\n       Under this provision, just as in the statutory licenses \n     codified in sections 111 and 119, a violation may be proven \n     by showing willful activity, or simple delivery of the \n     secondary transmission over a certain period of time. In \n     addition to termination of service on a nationwide or local \n     or regional basis, statutory damages are available up to \n     $250,000 for each 6-month period during which the pattern or \n     practice of violations was carried out. Satellite carriers \n     have the burden of proving that they are not improperly \n     making use of the section 122 license to serve subscribers \n     outside the local markets of the television broadcast \n     stations they are providing. The penalties created under this \n     section parallel those under Section 119, and are to deter \n     satellite carriers from providing signals to subscribers in \n     violation of the licenses.\n       The section 122 license is limited in geographic scope to \n     service to locations in the United States, including any \n     commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States. \n     In addition, section 122(j) makes clear that local \n     retransmission of television broadcast stations to \n     subscribers is governed solely by the section 122 license, \n     and that no provision of the section 111 cable compulsory \n     license should be interpreted to allow satellite carriers to \n     make local retransmissions of television broadcast stations \n     under that license. Likewise, no provision of the section 119 \n     license (or any other law) should be interpreted as \n     authorizing local-to-local retransmissions. As with all \n     statutory licenses, these explicit limitations are consistent \n     with the general rule that, because statutory licenses are in \n     derogation of the exclusive rights granted under the \n     Copyright Act, they should be interpreted narrowly.\n       Section 1002(a) of this Act contains new standing \n     provisions. Adopting the approach of the House bill, section \n     122(f)(1) of the Copyright Act is parallel to section 119(e), \n     and ensures that local stations, in addition to any other \n     parties that qualify under other standing provisions of the \n     Act, will have the ability to sue for violations of section \n     122. New section 122(f)(2) of the Copyright Act enables a \n     local television station that is not being carried by a \n     satellite carrier in violation of the license to file a \n     copyright infringement lawsuit in federal court to enforce \n     its rights.\n     Section 1003. Extension of Effect of Amendments to Section \n         119 of Title 17, United States Code\n       As in both the House bill and the Senate amendment, this \n     Act extends the section 119 satellite statutory license for a \n     period of five years by changing the expiration date of the \n     legislation from December 31, 1999, to December 31, 2004. The \n     procedural and remedial provisions of section 119, which have \n     already been interpreted by the courts, are being extended \n     without change. Should the section 119 license be allowed to \n     expire in 2004, it shall do so at midnight on December 31, \n     2004, so that the license will cover the entire second \n     accounting period of 2004.\n       The advent of digital terrestrial broadcasting will \n     necessitate additional review and reform of the distant \n     signal statutory license. And responsibility to oversee the \n     development of the nascent local station satellite service \n     may also require for review of the distant signal statutory \n     license in the future. For each of these reasons, this Act \n     establishes a period for review in 5 years.\n       Although the section 119 regime is largely being extended \n     in its current form, certain sections of the Act may have a \n     near-term effect on pending copyright infringement lawsuits \n     brought by broadcasters against satellite carriers. These \n     changes are prospective only; Congress does not intend to \n     change the legality of any conduct that occurred prior to the \n     date of enactment. Congress does intend, however, to benefit \n     consumers where possible and consistent with existing \n     copyright law and principles.\n       This Act attempts to strike a balance among a variety of \n     public policy goals. While increasing the number of potential \n     subscribers to distant network signals, this Act clarifies \n     that satellite carriers may carry up to, but no more than, \n     two stations affiliated with the same network. The original \n     purpose of the Satellite Home Viewer Act was to ensure that \n     all Americans could receive network programming and other \n     television services provided they could not receive those \n     services over-the-air or in any other way. This bill reflects \n     the desire of the Conference to meet this requirement and \n     consumers' expectations to receive the traditional level of \n     satellite service that has built up over the years, while \n     avoiding an erosion of the programming market affected by the \n     statutory licenses.\n     Section 1004. Computation of Royalty Fees for Satellite \n         Carriers\n       Like both the House bill and the Senate amendment, this Act \n     reduces the royalty fees currently paid by satellite carriers \n     for the retransmission of network and superstations by 45 \n     percent and 30 percent, respectively. These are reductions of \n     the 27-cent royalty fees made effective by the Librarian of \n     Congress on January 1, 1998. The reductions take effect on \n     July 1, 1999, which is the beginning of the second accounting \n     period for 1999, and apply to all accounting periods for the \n     five-year extension of the section 119 license. The Committee \n     has drafted this provision such that, if the section 119 \n     license is renewed after 2004, the 45 percent and 30 percent \n     reductions of the 27-cent fee will remain in effect, unless \n     altered by legislative amendment.\n\n[[Page S14710]]\n\n       In addition, section 119(c) of title 17, United States \n     Code, is amended to clarify that in royalty distribution \n     proceedings conducted under section 802 of the Copyright Act, \n     the Public Broadcasting Service may act as agent for all \n     public television copyright claimants and all Public \n     Broadcasting Service member stations.\n     Section 1005. Distant Signal Eligibility for Consumers\n       The Senate bill contained provisions retaining the existing \n     Grade B intensity standard in the definition of ``unserved \n     household.'' The House agreed to the Senate provisions with \n     amendments, which extend the ``unserved household'' \n     definition of section 119 of title 17 intact in certain \n     respects and amend it in other respects. Consistent with the \n     approach of the Senate amendment, the central feature of the \n     existing definition of ``unserved household''--inability to \n     receive, through use of a conventional outdoor rooftop \n     receiving antenna, a signal of Grade B intensity from a \n     primary network station--remains intact. The legislation \n     directs the FCC, however, to examine the definition of \n     ``Grade B intensity,'' reflecting the dBu levels long set by \n     the Federal Communications Commission in 47 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 73.683(a), and issue a rulemaking within 6 months after \n     enactment to evaluate the standard and, if appropriate, make \n     recommendations to Congress about how to modify the analog \n     standard, and make a further recommendation about what an \n     appropriate standard would be for digital signals. In this \n     fashion, the Congress will have the best input and \n     recommendations from the Commission, allowing the Commission \n     wide latitude in its inquiry and recommendations, but reserve \n     for itself the final decision-making authority over the scope \n     of the copyright licenses in question, in light of all \n     relevant factors.\n       The amended definition of ``unserved household'' makes \n     other consumer-friendly changes. It will eliminate the \n     requirement that a cable subscriber wait 90 days to be \n     eligible for satellite delivery of distant network signals. \n     After enactment, cable subscribers will be eligible to \n     receive distant network signals by satellite, upon choosing \n     to do so, if they satisfy the other requirements of section \n     119.\n       In addition, this Act adds three new categories to the \n     definition of ``unserved household'' in section 119(d)(10): \n     (a) certain subscribers to network programming who are not \n     predicted to receive a signal of Grade A intensity from any \n     station of the relevant network, (b) operators of \n     recreational vehicles and commercial trucks who have complied \n     with certain documentation requirements, and (c) certain C-\n     band subscribers to network programming. This Act also \n     confirms in new section 119(d)(10)(B) what has long been \n     understood by the parties and accepted by the courts, namely \n     that a subscriber may receive distant network service if all \n     network stations affiliated with the relevant network that \n     are predicted to serve that subscriber give their written \n     consent.\n       Section 1005(a)(2) of the bill creates a new section \n     119(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Copyright Act to prohibit a satellite \n     carrier from delivering more than two distant TV stations \n     affiliated with a single network in a single day to a \n     particular customer. This clarifies that a satellite carrier \n     provides a signal of a television station throughout the \n     broadcast day, rather than switching between stations \n     throughout a day to pick the best programming among different \n     signals.\n       Section 1005(a)(2) of this Act creates a new section \n     119(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of the Copyright Act to confirm that \n     courts should rely on the FCC's ILLR model to presumptively \n     determine whether a household is capable of receiving a \n     signal of Grade B intensity. The conferees understand that \n     the parties to copyright infringement litigation under the \n     Satellite Home Viewer Act have agreed on detailed procedures \n     for implementing the current version of ILLR, and nothing in \n     this Act requires any change in those procedures. In the \n     future, when the FCC amends the ILLR model to make it more \n     accurate pursuant to section 339(c)(3) of the Communications \n     Act of 1934, the amended model should be used in place of the \n     current version of ILLR. The new language also confirms in \n     new section 119(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) that the ultimate \n     determination of eligibility to receive network signals shall \n     be a signal intensity test pursuant to 47 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 73.686(d), as reflected in new section 339(c)(5) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934. Again, the conferees understand \n     that existing Satellite Home Viewer Act court orders already \n     incorporate this FCC-approved measurement method, and nothing \n     in this Act requires any change in such orders. Such a signal \n     intensity test may be conducted by any party to resolve a \n     customer's eligibility in litigation under section 119.\n       Section 1005(a)(2) of this Act creates a new section \n     119(a)(2)(B)(iii) of the Copyright Act to permit continued \n     delivery by means of C-band transmissions of network stations \n     to C-band dish owners who received signals of the pertinent \n     network on October 31, 1999, or were recently required to \n     have such service terminated pursuant to court orders or \n     settlements under section 119. This provision does not \n     authorize satellite delivery of network stations to such \n     persons by any technology other than C-band.\n       Section 1005(b) also adds a new provision (E) to section \n     119(a)(5). The purpose of this provision is to allow certain \n     longstanding superstations to continue to be delivered to \n     satellite customers without regard to the ``unserved \n     household'' limitation, even if the station now technically \n     qualifies as a ``network station'' under the 15-hour-per-week \n     definition of the Act. This exception will cease to apply if \n     such a station in the future becomes affiliated with one of \n     the four networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC) that qualified as \n     networks as of January 1, 1995.\n       Section 1005(c) of this Act adds a new section 119(e) of \n     the Copyright Act. This provision contains a moratorium on \n     terminations of network stations to certain otherwise \n     ineligible recent subscribers to network programming whose \n     service has been (or soon would have been) terminated and \n     allows them to continue to be eligible for distant signal \n     services. The subscribers affected are those predicted by the \n     current version of the ILLR model to receive a signal of less \n     than Grade A intensity from any network station of the \n     relevant network defined in section 73.683(a) of Commission \n     regulations (47 C.F.R. 73.683(a)) as in effect January 1, \n     1999. As the statutory language reflects, recent court orders \n     and settlements between the satellite and broadcasting \n     industries have required (or will in the near future require) \n     significant numbers of terminations of network stations to \n     ineligible subscribers in this category. Although the \n     conferees strongly condemn lawbreaking by satellite carriers, \n     and intend for satellite carriers to be subject to all other \n     available legal remedies for any infringements in which the \n     carriers have engaged, the conferees have concluded that the \n     public interest will be served by the grandfathering of this \n     limited category of subscribers whose service would otherwise \n     be terminated.\n       The decision by the conferees to direct this limited \n     grandfathering should not be understood as condoning unlawful \n     conduct by satellite carriers, but rather reflects the \n     concern of the conference for those subscribers who would \n     otherwise be punished for the actions of the satellite \n     carriers. Note that in the previous 18 months, court \n     decisions have required the termination of some distant \n     network signals to some subscribers. However, the Conferees \n     are aware that in some cases satellite carriers terminated \n     distant network service that was not subject to the original \n     lawsuit. The Conferees intend that affected subscribers \n     remain eligible for such service.\n       The words ``shall remain eligible'' in section 119(e) refer \n     to eligibility to receive stations affiliated with the same \n     network from the same satellite carrier through use of the \n     same transmission technology at the same location; in other \n     words, grandfathered status is not transferable to a \n     different carrier or a different type of dish or at a new \n     address. The provisions of new section 119(e) are \n     incorporated by reference in the definition of ``unserved \n     household'' as new section 119(d)(10)(C).\n       Section 1005(d) of this Act creates a new section \n     119(a)(11), which contains provisions governing delivery of \n     network stations to recreational vehicles and commercial \n     trucks. This provision is, in turn, incorporated in the \n     definition of ``unserved household'' in new section \n     119(d)(10)(D). The purpose of these amendments is to allow \n     the operators of recreational vehicles and commercial trucks \n     to use satellite dishes permanently attached to those \n     vehicles to receive, on television sets located inside those \n     vehicles, distant network signals pursuant to section 119. To \n     prevent abuse of this provision, the exception for \n     recreational vehicles and commercial trucks is limited to \n     persons who have strictly complied with the documentation \n     requirements set forth in section 119(a)(11). Among other \n     things, the exception will only become available as to a \n     particular recreational vehicle or commercial truck after the \n     satellite carrier has provided all affected networks with all \n     documentation set forth in section 119(a). The exception will \n     apply only for reception in that particular recreational \n     vehicle or truck, and does not authorize any delivery of \n     network stations to any fixed dwelling.\n     Section 1006. Public Broadcasting Service Satellite Feed\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with an \n     amendment that applies the network copyright royalty rate to \n     the Public Broadcasting Service the satellite feed. The \n     conference agreement grants satellite carriers a section 119 \n     compulsory license to retransmit a national satellite feed \n     distributed and designated by PBS. The license would apply to \n     educational and informational programming to which PBS \n     currently holds broadcast rights. The license, which would \n     extend to all households in the United States, would sunset \n     on January 1, 2002, the date when local-to-local must-carry \n     obligations become effective. Under the conference agreement, \n     PBS will designate the national satellite feed for purposes \n     of this section.\n     Section 1007. Application of Federal Communications \n         Commission Regulations\n       The section 119 license is amended to clarify that \n     satellite carriers must comply with all rules, regulations, \n     and authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission \n     in order to obtain the benefits of the section 119 license. \n     As provided in the House bill, this would include any \n     programming exclusivity provisions or carriage requirements \n     that the Commission may adopt. Violations of such rules, \n     regulations or authorizations would render a carrier \n     ineligible for the copyright statutory license with respect \n     to that retransmission.\n\n[[Page S14711]]\n\n     Section 1008. Rules for Satellite Carriers Retransmitting \n         Television Broadcast Signals\n       The Senate agrees to the House bill provisions regarding \n     carriage of television broadcast signals, with certain \n     amendments, as discussed below. Section 108 creates new \n     sections 338 and 339 of the Communications Act of 1934. \n     Section 338 addresses carriage of local television signals, \n     while section 339 addresses distant television signals.\n       New section 338 requires satellite carriers, by January 1, \n     2002, to carry upon request all local broadcast stations' \n     signals in local markets in which the satellite carriers \n     carry at least one signal pursuant to section 122 of title \n     17, United States Code. The conference report added the \n     cross-reference to section 122 to the House provision to \n     indicate the relationship between the benefits of the \n     statutory license and the carriage requirements imposed by \n     this Act. Thus, the conference report provides that, as of \n     January 1, 2002, royalty-free copyright licenses for \n     satellite carriers to retransmit broadcast signals to viewers \n     in the broadcasters' service areas will be available only on \n     a market-by-market basis.\n       The procedural provisions applicable to section 338 \n     (concerning costs, avoidance of duplication, channel \n     positioning, compensation for carriage, and complaints by \n     broadcast stations) are generally parallel to those \n     applicable to cable systems. Within one year after enactment, \n     the Federal Communications Commission is to issue \n     implementing regulations which are to impose obligations \n     comparable to those imposed on cable systems under paragraphs \n     (3) and (4) of section 614(b) and paragraphs (1) and (2) of \n     section 615(g), such as the requirement to carry a station's \n     entire signal without additions or deletions. The obligation \n     to carry local stations on contiguous channels is \n     illustrative of the general requirement to ensure that \n     satellite carriers position local stations in a way that is \n     convenient and practically accessible for consumers. By \n     directing the FCC to promulgate these must-carry rules, the \n     conferees do not take any position regarding the application \n     of must-carry rules to carriage of digital television signals \n     by either cable or satellite systems.\n       To make use of the local license, satellite carriers must \n     provide the local broadcast station signal as part of their \n     satellite service, in a manner consistent with paragraphs \n     (b), (c), (d), and (e), FCC regulations, and retransmission \n     consent requirements. Until January 1, 2002, satellite \n     carriers are granted a royalty-free copyright license to \n     retransmit broadcast signals on a station-by-station basis, \n     consistent with retransmission consent requirements. The \n     transition period is intended to provide the satellite \n     industry with a transitional period to begin providing local-\n     into-local satellite service to communities throughout the \n     country.\n       The conferees believe that the must-carry provisions of \n     this Act neither implicate nor violate the First Amendment. \n     Rather than requiring carriage of stations in the manner of \n     cable's mandated duty, this Act allows a satellite carrier to \n     choose whether to incur the must-carry obligation in a \n     particular market in exchange for the benefits of the local \n     statutory license. It does not deprive any programmers of \n     potential access to carriage by satellite carriers. Satellite \n     carriers remain free to carry any programming for which they \n     are able to acquire the property rights. The provisions of \n     this Act allow carriers an easier and more inexpensive way to \n     obtain the right to use the property of copyright holders \n     when they retransmit signals from all of a market's broadcast \n     stations to subscribers in that market. The choice whether to \n     retransmit those signals is made by carriers, not by the \n     Congress. The proposed licenses are a matter of legislative \n     grace, in the nature of subsidies to satellite carriers, and \n     reviewable under the rational basis standard.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     See footnotes at end of Analysis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In addition, the conferees are confident that the proposed \n     license provisions would pass constitutional muster even if \n     subjected to the O'Brien standard applied to the cable must-\n     carry requirement.\\2\\ The proposed provisions are intended to \n     preserve free television for those not served by satellite or \n     cable systems and to promote widespread dissemination of \n     information from a multiplicity of sources. The Supreme Court \n     has found both to be substantial interests, unrelated to the \n     suppression of free expression.\\3\\ Providing the proposed \n     license on a market-by-market basis furthers both goals by \n     preventing satellite carriers from choosing to carry only \n     certain stations and effectively preventing many other local \n     broadcasters from reaching potential viewers in their service \n     areas. The Conference Committee is concerned that, absent \n     must-carry obligations, satellite carriers would carry the \n     major network affiliates and few other signals. Non-carried \n     stations would face the same loss of viewership Congress \n     previously found with respect to cable noncarriage.\\4\\\n       The proposed licenses place satellite carrier in a \n     comparable position to cable systems, competing for the same \n     customers. Applying a must-carry rule in markets which \n     satellite carriers choose to serve benefits consumers and \n     enhances competition with cable by allowing consumers the \n     same range of choice in local programming they receive \n     through cable service. The conferees expect that, by January \n     1, 2002, satellite carriers' market share will have increased \n     and that the Congress' interest in maintaining free over-the-\n     air television will be undermined if local broadcasters are \n     prevented from reaching viewers by either cable or satellite \n     distribution systems. The Congress' preference for must-carry \n     obligations has already been proven effective, as attested by \n     the appearance of several emerging networks, which often \n     serve underserved market segments. There are no narrower \n     alternatives that would achieve the Congress' goals. Although \n     the conferees expect that subscribers who receive no \n     broadcast signals at all from their satellite service may \n     install antennas or subscribe to cable service in addition to \n     satellite service, the Conference Committee is less sanguine \n     that subscribers who receive network signals and hundreds of \n     other programming choices from their satellite carrier will \n     undertake such trouble and expense to obtain over-the-air \n     signals from independent broadcast stations. National feeds \n     would also be counterproductive because they siphon potential \n     viewers from local over-the-air affiliates. In sum, the \n     Conference Committee finds that trading the benefits of the \n     copyright license for the must carry requirement is a fair \n     and reasonable way of helping viewers have access to all \n     local programming while benefitting satellite carriers and \n     their customers.\n       Section 338(c) contains a limited exception to the general \n     must-carry requirements, stating that a satellite carrier \n     need not carry two local affiliates of the same network that \n     substantially duplicate each others' programming, unless the \n     duplicating stations are licensed to communities in different \n     states. The latter provisions address unique and limited \n     cases, including WMUR (Manchester, New Hampshire) / WCVB \n     (Boston, Massachusetts) and WPTZ (Plattsburg, New York)/ WNNE \n     (White River Junction, Vermont), in which mandatory carriage \n     of both duplicating local stations upon request assures that \n     satellite subscribers will not be precluded from receiving \n     the network affiliate that is licensed to the state in which \n     they reside.\n       Because of unique technical challenges on satellite \n     technology and constraints on the use of satellite spectrum, \n     satellite carriers may initially be limited in their ability \n     to deliver must carry signals into multiple markets. New \n     compression technologies, such as video streaming, may help \n     overcome these barriers however, and, if deployed, could \n     enable satellite carriers to deliver must-carry signals into \n     many more markets than they could otherwise. Accordingly, the \n     conferees urge the FCC, pursuant to its obligations under \n     section 338, or in any other related proceedings, to not \n     prohibit satellite carriers from using reasonable \n     compression, reformatting, or similar technologies to meet \n     their carriage obligations, consistent with existing \n     authority.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       New section 339 of the Communications Act contains \n     provisions concerning carriage of distant television stations \n     by satellite carriers. Section 339(a)(1) limits satellite \n     carriers to providing a subscriber with no more than two \n     stations affiliated with a given television network from \n     outside the local market. In addition, a satellite carrier \n     that provides two distant signals to eligible households may \n     also provide the local television signals pursuant to section \n     122 of title 17 if the subscriber offers local-to-local \n     service in the subscriber's market. This provision furthers \n     the congressional policy of localism and diversity of \n     broadcast programming, which provides locally-relevant news, \n     weather, and information, but also allows consumers in \n     unserved households to enjoy network programming obtained via \n     distant signals. Under new section 339(a)(2), which is based \n     on the Senate amendment, the knowing and willful provision of \n     distant television signals in violation of these restrictions \n     is subject to a forfeiture penalty under section 503 of the \n     Communications Act of $50,000 per violation or for each day \n     of a continuing violation.\n       New section 339(b)(1)(A) requires the Commission to \n     commence within 45 days of enactment, and complete within one \n     year after the date of enactment, a rulemaking to develop \n     regulations to apply network nonduplication, syndicated \n     exclusivity and sports blackout rules to the transmission of \n     nationally distributed superstations by satellite carriers. \n     New section 339(b)(1)(B) requires the Commission to \n     promulgate regulations on the same schedule with regard to \n     the application of sports blackout rules to network stations. \n     These regulations under subparagraph (B) are to be imposed \n     ``to the extent technically feasible and not economically \n     prohibitive'' with respect to the affected parties. The \n     burden of showing that conforming to rules similar to cable \n     would be ``economically prohibitive'' is a heavy one. It \n     would entail a very serious economic threat to the health of \n     the carrier. Without that showing, the rules should be as \n     similar as possible to that applicable to cable services.\n       Section 339(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 addresses \n     the three distinct areas discussed by the Commission in its \n     Report & Order in Docket No. 98-201: (i) the definition of \n     ``Grade B intensity,'' which is the substantive standard for \n     determining eligibility to receive distant network stations \n     by satellite, (ii) prediction of whether a signal of Grade B \n     intensity from a particular station is present at a \n     particular household, and (iii) measurement of whether a \n     signal of Grade B intensity from a particular station is \n     present\n\n[[Page S14712]]\n\n     at a particular household. Section 339(c) addresses each of \n     these topics.\n       New section 339(c) addresses evaluation and possible \n     recommendations for modification by the Commission of the \n     definition of Grade B intensity, which is incorporated into \n     the definition of ``unserved household'' in section 119 of \n     the Copyright Act. Under section 339(c), the Commission is to \n     complete a rulemaking within 1 year after enactment to \n     evaluate, and if appropriate to recommend modifications to \n     the Grade B intensity standard for analog signals set forth \n     in 47 C.F.R. Sec. 73.683(a), for purposes of determining \n     eligibility for distant signal satellite service. In \n     addition, the Commission is to recommend a signal standard \n     for digital signals to prepare Congress to update the \n     statutory license for digital television broadcasting. The \n     Committee intends that this report would reflect the FCC's \n     best recommendations in light of all relevant considerations, \n     and be based on whatever factors and information the \n     Commission deems relevant to determining whether the signal \n     intensity standard should be modified and in what way. As \n     discussed above, the two-part process allows the Commission \n     to recommend modifications leaving to Congress the decision-\n     making power on modifications of the copyright licenses at \n     issue.\n       Section 339(c)(3) addresses requests to local television \n     stations by consumers for waivers of the eligibility \n     requirements under section 119 of title 17, United States \n     Code. If a satellite carrier is barred from delivering \n     distant network signals to a particular customer because the \n     ILLR model predicts the customer to be served by one or more \n     television stations affiliated with the relevant network, the \n     consumer may submit to those stations, through his or her \n     satellite carrier, a written request for a waiver. The \n     statutory phrase ``station asserting that the retransmission \n     is prohibited'' refers to a station that is predicted by the \n     ILLR model to serve the household. Each such station must \n     accept or reject the waiver request within 30 days after \n     receiving the request from the satellite carrier. If a \n     relevant network station grants the requested waiver, or \n     fails to act on the waiver within 30 days, the viewer shall \n     be deemed unserved with respect to the local network station \n     in question.\n       Section 339(c)(4) addresses the ILLR predictive model \n     developed by the Commission in Docket No. 98-201. The \n     provision requires the Commission to attempt to increase its \n     accuracy further by taking into account not only terrain, as \n     the ILLR model does now, but also land cover variations such \n     as buildings and vegetation. If the Commission discovers \n     other practical ways to improve the accuracy of the ILLR \n     model still further, it shall implement those methods as \n     well. The linchpin of whether particular proposed refinements \n     to the ILLR model result in greater accuracy is whether the \n     revised model's predictions are closer to the results of \n     actual field testing in terms of predicting whether \n     households are served by a local affiliate of the relevant \n     network.\n       The ILLR model of predicting subscribers' eligibility will \n     be of particular use in rural areas. To make the ILLR more \n     accurate and more useful to this group of Americans, the \n     Conference Committee believes the Commission should be \n     particularly careful to ensure that the ILLR is accurate in \n     areas that use star routes, postal routes, or other \n     addressing systems that may not indicate clearly the location \n     of the actual dwelling of a potential subscriber. The \n     Commission should to ensure the model accurately predicts the \n     signal strength at the viewers' actual location.\n       New section 339(c)(5) addresses the third area discussed in \n     the Commission's Report & Order in Docket No. 98-201, namely \n     signal intensity testing. This provision permits satellite \n     carriers and broadcasters to carry out signal intensity \n     measurements, using the procedures set forth by the \n     Commission in 47 C.F.R. Sec. 73.686(d), to determine whether \n     particular households are unserved. Unless the parties \n     otherwise agree, any such tests shall be conducted on a \n     ``loser pays'' basis, with the network station bearing the \n     costs of tests showing the household to be unserved, and the \n     satellite carrier bearing the costs of tests showing the \n     household to be served. If the satellite carrier and station \n     is unable to agree on a qualified individual to perform the \n     test, the Commission is to designate an independent and \n     neutral entity by rule. The Commission is to promulgate rules \n     that avoid any undue burdens being imposed on any party.\n     Section 1009. Retransmission Consent\n       Section 1009 amends the provisions of section 325 of the \n     Communications Act governing retransmission consent. As \n     revised, section 325(b)(1) bars multichannel video \n     programming distributors from retransmitting the signals of \n     television broadcast stations, or any part thereof, without \n     the express authority of the originating station. Section \n     325(b)(2) contains several exceptions to this general \n     prohibition, including noncommercial stations, certain \n     superstations, and, until the end of 2004, retransmission of \n     not more than two distant signals by satellite carriers to \n     unserved households outside of the local market of the \n     retransmitted stations, and (E) for six months to the \n     retransmission of local stations pursuant to the statutory \n     license in section 122 of the title 17.\n       Section 1009 also amends section 325(b) of the \n     Communications Act to require the Commission to issue \n     regulations concerning the exercise by television broadcast \n     stations of the right to grant retransmission consent. The \n     regulations would, until January 1, 2006, prohibit a \n     television broadcast station from entering into an exclusive \n     retransmission consent agreement with a multichannel video \n     programming distributor or refusing to negotiate in good \n     faith regarding retransmission consent agreements. A \n     television station may generally offer different \n     retransmission consent terms or conditions, including price \n     terms, to different distributors. The FCC may determine that \n     such different terms represent a failure to negotiate in good \n     faith only if they are not based on competitive marketplace \n     considerations.\n       Section 1009 of the bill adds a new subsection (e) to \n     section 325 of the Communications Act. New subsection 325(e) \n     creates a set of expedited enforcement procedures for the \n     alleged retransmission of a television broadcast station in \n     its own local market without the station's consent. The \n     purpose of these expedited procedure is to ensure that delays \n     in obtaining relief from violations do not make the right to \n     retransmission consent an empty one. The new provision \n     requires 45-day processing of local-to-local retransmission \n     consent complaints at the Commission, followed by expedited \n     enforcement of any Commission orders in the United States \n     District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In \n     addition, a television broadcast station that has been \n     retransmitted in its local market without its consent will be \n     entitled to statutory damages of $25,000 per violation in an \n     action in federal district court. Such damages will be \n     awarded only if the television broadcast station agrees to \n     contribute any statutory damage award above $1,000 to the \n     United States Treasury for public purposes. The expedited \n     enforcement provision contains a sunset which prevents the \n     filing of any complaint with the Commission or any action in \n     federal district court to enforce any Commission order under \n     this section after December 31, 2001. The conferees believe \n     that these procedural provisions, which provide ample due \n     process protections while ensuring speedy enforcement, will \n     ensure that retransmission consent will be respected by all \n     parties and promote a smoothly functioning marketplace.\n     Section 1010. Severability\n       Section 1010 of the Act provides that if any provision of \n     section 325(b) of the Communications Act as amended by this \n     Act is declared unconstitutional, the remaining provisions of \n     that section will stand.\n     Section 1011. Technical Amendments\n       Section 1011 of this Act makes technical and conforming \n     amendments to sections 101, 111, 119, 501, and 510 of the \n     Copyright Act. Apart from these technical amendments, this \n     legislation makes no changes to section 111 of the Copyright \n     Act. In particular, nothing in this legislation makes any \n     changes concerning entitlement or eligibility for the \n     statutory licenses under sections 111 and 119, nor \n     specifically to the definitions of ``cable system'' under \n     section 111(f), and ``satellite carrier'' under section \n     119(d)(6). Certain technical amendments to these definitions \n     that were included in the Conference Report to the \n     Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act \n     (IPCORA) of 1999 are not included in this legislation. \n     Congress intends that neither the courts nor the Copyright \n     Office give any legal significance either to the inclusion of \n     the amendments in the IPCORA conference report or their \n     omission in this legislation. These statutory definitions are \n     to be interpreted in the same way after enactment of this \n     legislation as they were interpreted prior to enactment of \n     this legislation.\n       Section 1011(b) makes a technical and clarifying change to \n     the definition of a ``work made for hire'' in section 101 of \n     the Copyright Act. Sound recordings have been registered in \n     the Copyright Office as works made for hire since being \n     protected in their own right. This clarifying amendment shall \n     not be deemed to imply that any sound recording or any other \n     work would not otherwise qualify as a work made for hire in \n     the absence of the amendment made by this subsection.\n     Section 1012. Effective dates.\n       Under section 1012 of this Act, sections 1001, 1003, 1005, \n     and 1007 through 1011 shall be effective on the date of \n     enactment. The amendments made by sections 1002, 1004, and \n     1006 shall be effective as of July 1, 1999.\n\n                TITLE II--RURAL LOCAL TELEVISION SIGNALS\n\n     Section 2001. Short Title\n       This title may be referred to as the ``Rural Local \n     Broadcast Signal Act.''\n     Section 2002. Local Television Service in Unserved and \n         Underserved Markets\n       To encourage the FCC to approve needed licenses (or other \n     authorizations to use spectrum) to provide local TV service \n     in rural areas, the Commission is required to make \n     determinations regarding needed licenses within one year of \n     enactment.\n       However, the FCC shall ensure that no license or \n     authorization provided under this section will cause \n     ``harmful interference'' to the primary users of the spectrum \n     or to public safety use. Subparagraph (2), states that the \n     Commission shall not license under subsection (a) any \n     facility that causes harmful interference to existing primary \n     users of spectrum or to public safety use. The Commission \n     typically categorizes a licensed service as primary or \n     secondary. Under Commission rules, a secondary service cannot \n     be authorized to operate in the same band as a\n\n[[Page S14713]]\n\n     primary user of that band unless the proposed secondary user \n     conclusively demonstrates that the proposed secondary use \n     will not cause harmful interference to the primary service. \n     The Commission is to define ``harmful interference'' pursuant \n     to the definition at 47 C.F.R. section 2.1 and in accordance \n     with Commission rules and policies.\n       For purposes of section 2005(b)(3) the FCC may consider a \n     compression, reformatting or other technology to be \n     unreasonable if the technology is incompatible with other \n     applicable FCC regulation or policy under the Communications \n     Act of 1934, as amended.\n       The Commission also may not restrict any entity granted a \n     license or other authorization under this section, except as \n     otherwise specified, from using any reasonable compression, \n     reformatting, or other technology.\n\n              TITLE III--TRADEMARK CYBERPIRACY PREVENTION\n\n     Section 3001. Short Title; References\n       This section provides that the Act may be cited as the \n     ``Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act'' and that any \n     references within the bill to the Trademark Act of 1946 shall \n     be a reference to the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for \n     the registration and protection of trademarks used in \n     commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain \n     international conventions, and for other purposes,'' approved \n     July 5, 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.), also commonly referred \n     to as the Lanham Act.\n     Sec. 3002. Cyberpiracy Prevention\n       Subsection (a). In General. This subsection amends the \n     Trademark Act to provide an explicit trademark remedy for \n     cybersquatting under a new section 43(d). Under paragraph \n     (1)(A) of the new section 43(d), actionable conduct would \n     include the registration, trafficking in, or use of a domain \n     name that is identical or confusingly similar to, or dilutive \n     of, the mark of another, including a personal name that is \n     protected as a mark under section 43 of the Lanham Act, \n     provided that the mark was distinctive (i.e., enjoyed \n     trademark status) at the time the domain name was registered, \n     or in the case of trademark dilution, was famous at the time \n     the domain name was registered. The bill is carefully and \n     narrowly tailored, however, to extend only to cases where the \n     plaintiff can demonstrate that the defendant registered, \n     trafficked in, or used the offending domain name with bad-\n     faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a mark belonging \n     to someone else. Thus, the bill does not extend to innocent \n     domain name registrations by those who are unaware of \n     another's use of the name, or even to someone who is aware of \n     the trademark status of the name but registers a domain name \n     containing the mark for any reason other than with bad faith \n     intent to profit from the goodwill associated with that mark.\n       The phrase ``including a personal name which is protected \n     as a mark under this section'' addresses situations in which \n     a person's name is protected under section 43 of the Lanham \n     Act and is used as a domain name. The Lanham Act prohibits \n     the use of false designations of origin and false or \n     misleading representations. Protection under 43 of the Lanham \n     Act has been applied by the courts to personal names which \n     function as marks, such as service marks, when such marks are \n     infringed. Infringement may occur when the endorsement of \n     products or services in interstate commerce is falsely \n     implied through the use of a personal name, or otherwise, \n     without regard to the goods or services of the parties. This \n     protection also applies to domain names on the Internet, \n     where falsely implied endorsements and other types of \n     infringement can cause greater harm to the owner and \n     confusion to a consumer in a shorter amount of time than is \n     the case with traditional media. The protection offered by \n     section 43 to a personal name which functions as a mark, as \n     applied to domain names, is subject to the same fair use and \n     first amendment protections as have been applied \n     traditionally under trademark law, and is not intended to \n     expand or limit any rights to publicity recognized by States \n     under State law.\n       Paragraph (1)(B)(i) of the new section 43(d) sets forth a \n     number of nonexclusive, nonexhaustive factors to assist a \n     court in determining whether the required bad-faith element \n     exists in any given case. These factors are designed to \n     balance the property interests of trademark owners with the \n     legitimate interests of Internet users and others who seek to \n     make lawful uses of others' marks, including for purposes \n     such as comparative advertising, comment, criticism, parody, \n     news reporting, fair use, etc. The bill suggests a total of \n     nine factors a court may wish to consider. The first four \n     suggest circumstances that may tend to indicate an absence of \n     bad-faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a mark, and \n     the next four suggest circumstances that may tend to indicate \n     that such bad-faith intent exits. The last factor may suggest \n     either bad-faith or an absence thereof depending on the \n     circumstances.\n       First, under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(I), a court may consider \n     whether the domain name registrant has trademark or any other \n     intellectual property rights in the name. This factor \n     recognizes, as does trademark law in general, that there may \n     be concurring uses of the same name that are noninfringing, \n     such as the use of the ``Delta'' mark for both air travel and \n     sink faucets. Similarly, the registration of the domain name \n     ``deltaforce.com'' by a movie studio would not tend to \n     indicate a bad faith intent on the part of the registrant to \n     trade on Delta Airlines or Delta Faucets' trademarks.\n       Second, under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(II), a court may consider \n     the extent to which the domain name is the same as the \n     registrant's own legal name or a nickname by which that \n     person is commonly identified. This factor recognizes, again \n     as does the concept of fair use in trademark law, that a \n     person should be able to be identified by their own name, \n     whether in their business or on a web site. Similarly, a \n     person may bear a legitimate nickname that is identical or \n     similar to a well-known trademark, such as in the well-\n     publicized case of the parents who registered the domain name \n     ``pokey.org'' for their young son who goes by that name, and \n     these individuals should not be deterred by this bill from \n     using their name online. This factor is not intended to \n     suggest that domain name registrants may evade the \n     application of this act by merely adopting Exxon, Ford, or \n     other well-known marks as their nicknames. It merely provides \n     a court with the appropriate discretion to determine whether \n     or not the fact that a person bears a nickname similar to a \n     mark at issue is an indication of an absence of bad-faith on \n     the part of the registrant.\n       Third, under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(III), a court may consider \n     the domain name registrant's prior use, if any, of the domain \n     name in connection with the bona fide offering of goods or \n     services. Again, this factor recognizes that the legitimate \n     use of the domain name in online commerce may be a good \n     indicator of the intent of the person registering that name. \n     Where the person has used the domain name in commerce without \n     creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source or origin \n     of the goods or services and has not otherwise attempted to \n     use the name in order to profit from the goodwill of the \n     trademark owner's name, a court may look to this as an \n     indication of the absence of bad faith on the part of the \n     registrant.\n       Fourth, under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(IV), a court may consider \n     the person's bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark \n     in a web site that is accessible under the domain name at \n     issue. This factor is intended to balance the interests of \n     trademark owners with the interests of those who would make \n     lawful noncommercial or fair uses of others' marks online, \n     such as in comparative advertising, comment, criticism, \n     parody, news reporting, etc. Under the bill, the mere fact \n     that the domain name is used for purposes of comparative \n     advertising, comment, criticism, parody, news reporting, \n     etc., would not alone establish a lack of bad-faith intent. \n     The fact that a person uses a mark in a site in such a lawful \n     manner may be an appropriate indication that the person's \n     registration or use of the domain name lacked the required \n     element of bad-faith. This factor is not intended to create a \n     loophole that otherwise might swallow the bill, however, by \n     allowing a domain name registrant to evade application of the \n     Act by merely putting up a noninfringing site under an \n     infringing domain name. For example, in the well know case of \n     Panavision Int'l v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir. 1998), a \n     well known cybersquatter had registered a host of domain \n     names mirroring famous trademarks, including names for \n     Panavision, Delta Airlines, Neiman Marcus, Eddie Bauer, \n     Lufthansa, and more than 100 other marks, and had attempted \n     to sell them to the mark owners for amounts in the range of \n     $10,000 to $15,000 each. His use of the ``panavision.com'' \n     and ``panaflex.com'' domain names was seemingly more \n     innocuous, however, as they served as addresses for sites \n     that merely displayed pictures of Pana Illinois and the word \n     ``Hello'' respectively. This bill would not allow a person to \n     evade the holding of that case--which found that Mr. Toeppen \n     had made a commercial use of the Panavision marks and that \n     such uses were, in fact, diluting under the Federal Trademark \n     Dilution Act--merely by posting noninfringing uses of the \n     trademark on a site accessible under the offending domain \n     name, as Mr. Toeppen did. Similarly, the bill does not affect \n     existing trademark law to the extent it has addressed the \n     interplay between First Amendment protections and the rights \n     of trademark owners. Rather, the bill gives courts the \n     flexibility to weigh appropriate factors in determining \n     whether the name was registered or used in bad faith, and it \n     recognizes that one such factor may be the use the domain \n     name registrant makes of the mark.\n       Fifth, under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(V), a court may consider \n     whether, in registering or using the domain name, the \n     registrant intended to divert consumers away from the \n     trademark owner's website to a website that could harm the \n     goodwill of the mark, either for purposes of commercial gain \n     or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark, by \n     creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source, \n     sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the site. This \n     factor recognizes that one of the main reasons cybersquatters \n     use other people's trademarks is to divert Internet users to \n     their own sites by creating confusion as to the source, \n     sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the site. This is \n     done for a number of reasons, including to pass off inferior \n     goods under the name of a well-known mark holder, to defraud \n     consumers into providing personally identifiable information, \n     such as credit card numbers, to attract ``eyeballs'' to sites \n     that price online advertising according to the number of \n     ``hits'' the site receives, or even just to harm the value of \n     the mark. Under this provision,\n\n[[Page S14714]]\n\n     a court may give appropriate weight to evidence that a domain \n     name registrant intended to confuse or deceive the public in \n     this manner when making a determination of bad-faith intent.\n       Sixth, under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(VI), a court may consider \n     a domain name registrant's offer to transfer, sell, or \n     otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or any \n     third party for financial gain, where the registrant has not \n     used, and did not have any intent to use, the domain name in \n     the bona fide offering of any goods or services. A court may \n     also consider a person's prior conduct indicating a pattern \n     of such conduct. This factor is consistent with the court \n     cases, like the Panavision case mentioned above, where courts \n     have found a defendant's offer to sell the domain name to the \n     legitimate mark owner as being indicative of the defendant's \n     intent to trade on the value of a trademark owner's marks by \n     engaging in the business of registering those marks and \n     selling them to the rightful trademark owners. It does not \n     suggest that a court should consider the mere offer to sell a \n     domain name to a mark owner or the failure to use a name in \n     the bona fide offering of goods or services as sufficient to \n     indicate bad faith. Indeed, there are cases in which a person \n     registers a name in anticipation of a business venture that \n     simply never pans out. And someone who has a legitimate \n     registration of a domain name that mirrors someone else's \n     domain name, such as a trademark owner that is a lawful \n     concurrent user of that name with another trademark owner, \n     may, in fact, wish to sell that name to the other trademark \n     owner. This bill does not imply that these facts are an \n     indication of bad-faith. It merely provides a court with the \n     necessary discretion to recognize the evidence of bad-faith \n     when it is present. In practice, the offer to sell domain \n     names for exorbitant amounts to the rightful mark owner has \n     been one of the most common threads in abusive domain name \n     registrations. Finally, by using the financial gain standard, \n     this paragraph allows a court to examine the motives of the \n     seller.\n       Seventh, under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(VII), a court may \n     consider the registrant's intentional provision of material \n     and misleading false contact information in an application \n     for the domain name registration, the person's intentional \n     failure to maintain accurate contact information, and the \n     person's prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct. \n     Falsification of contact information with the intent to evade \n     identification and service of process by trademark owners is \n     also a common thread in cases of cybersquatting. This factor \n     recognizes that fact, while still recognizing that there may \n     be circumstances in which the provision of false information \n     may be due to other factors, such as mistake or, as some have \n     suggested in the case of political dissidents, for purposes \n     of anonymity. This bill balances those factors by limiting \n     consideration to the person's contact information, and even \n     then requiring that the provision of false information be \n     material and misleading. As with the other factors, this \n     factor is nonexclusive and a court is called upon to make a \n     determination based on the facts presented whether or not the \n     provision of false information does, in fact, indicate bad-\n     faith.\n       Eight, under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(VIII), a court may \n     consider the domain name registrant's acquisition of multiple \n     domain names which the person knows are identical or \n     confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, others' marks. This \n     factor recognizes the increasingly common cybersquatting \n     practice known as ``warehousing'', in which a cybersquatter \n     registers multiple domain names--sometimes hundreds, even \n     thousands--that mirror the trademarks of others. By sitting \n     on these marks and not making the first move to offer to sell \n     them to the mark owner, these cybersquatters have been \n     largely successful in evading the case law developed under \n     the Federal Trademark Dilution Act. This bill does not \n     suggest that the mere registration of multiple domain names \n     is an indication of bad faith, but it allows a court to weigh \n     the fact that a person has registered multiple domain names \n     that infringe or dilute the trademarks of others as part of \n     its consideration of whether the requisite bad-faith intent \n     exists.\n       Lastly, under paragraph (1)(B)(i)(IX), a court may consider \n     the extent to which the mark incorporated in the person's \n     domain name registration is or is not distinctive and famous \n     within the meaning of subsection (c)(1) of section 43 of the \n     Trademark Act of 1946. The more distinctive or famous a mark \n     has become, the more likely the owner of that mark is \n     deserving of the relief available under this act. At the same \n     time, the fact that a mark is not well-known may also suggest \n     a lack of bad-faith.\n       Paragraph (1)(B)(ii) underscores the bad-faith requirement \n     by making clear that bad-faith shall not be found in any case \n     in which the court determines that the person believed and \n     had reasonable grounds to believe that the use of the domain \n     name was a fair use or otherwise lawful.\n       Paragraph (1)(C) makes clear that in any civil action \n     brought under the new section 43(d), a court may order the \n     forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of a domain name to the \n     owner of the mark.\n       Paragraph (1)(D) clarifies that a prohibited ``use'' of a \n     domain name under the bill applies only to a use by the \n     domain name registrant or that registrant's authorized \n     licensee.\n       Paragraph (1)(E) defines what means to ``traffic in'' a \n     domain name. Under this Act, ``traffics in'' refers to \n     transactions that include, but are not limited to, sales, \n     purchases, loans, pledges, licenses, exchanges of currency, \n     and any other transfer for consideration or receipt in \n     exchange for consideration.\n       Paragraph (2)(A) provides for in rem jurisdiction, which \n     allows a mark owner to seek the forfeiture, cancellation, or \n     transfer of an infringing domain name by filing an in rem \n     action against the name itself, where the mark owner has \n     satisfied the court that it has exercised due diligence in \n     trying to locate the owner of the domain name but is unable \n     to do so, or where the mark owner is otherwise unable to \n     obtain in personam jurisdiction over such person. As \n     indicated above, a significant problem faced by trademark \n     owners in the fight against cybersquatting is the fact that \n     many cybersquatters register domain names under aliases or \n     otherwise provide false information in their registration \n     applications in order to avoid identification and service of \n     process by the mark owner. This bill will alleviate this \n     difficulty, while protecting the notions of fair play and \n     substantial justice, by enabling a mark owner to seek an \n     injunction against the infringing property in those cases \n     where, after due diligence, a mark owner is unable to proceed \n     against the domain name registrant because the registrant has \n     provided false contact information and is otherwise not to be \n     found, or where a court is unable to assert personal \n     jurisdiction over such person, provided the mark owner can \n     show that the domain name itself violates substantive federal \n     trademark law (i.e., that the domain name violates the rights \n     of the registrant of a mark registered in the Patent and \n     Trademark Office, or section 43(a) or (c) of the Trademark \n     Act). Under the bill, a mark owner will be deemed to have \n     exercised due diligence in trying to find a defendant if the \n     mark owner sends notice of the alleged violation and intent \n     to proceed to the domain name registrant at the postal and e-\n     mail address provided by the registrant to the registrar and \n     publishes notice of the action as the court may direct \n     promptly after filing the action. Such acts are deemed to \n     constitute service of process by paragraph (2)(B).\n       The concept of in rem jurisdiction has been with us since \n     well before the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Pennoyer \n     v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1877). Although more recent decisions \n     have called into question the viability of quasi in rem \n     ``attachment'' jurisdiction, see Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. \n     186 (1977), the Court has expressly acknowledged the \n     propriety of true in rem proceedings (or even type I quasi in \n     rem proceedings \\5\\) where ``claims to the property itself \n     are the source of the underlying controversy between the \n     plaintiff and the defendant.'' Id. at 207-08. The Act \n     clarifies the availability of in rem jurisdiction in \n     appropriate cases involving claims by trademark holders \n     against cyberpirates. In so doing, the Act reinforces the \n     view that in rem jurisdiction has continuing constitutional \n     vitality, see R.M.S. Titanic, Inc. v. Haver, 171 F.3d 943, \n     957-58 (4th Cir. 1999) (``In rem actions only require that a \n     party seeking an interest in a res bring the res into the \n     custody of the court and provide reasonable, public notice of \n     its intention to enable others to appear in the action to \n     claim an interest in the res.''); Chapman v. Vande Bunte, 604 \n     F. Supp. 714, 716-17 (E.D. N.C. 1985) (``In a true in rem \n     proceeding, in order to subject property to a judgment in \n     rem, due process requires only that the property itself have \n     certain minimum contacts with the territory of the forum.'').\n       By authorizing in rem jurisdiction, the Act also attempts \n     to respond to the problems faced by trademark holders in \n     attempting to effect personal service of process on \n     cyberpirates. In an effort to avoid being held accountable \n     for their infringement or dilution of famous trademarks, \n     cyberpirates often have registered domain names under \n     fictitious names and addresses or have used offshore \n     addresses or companies to register domain names. Even when \n     they actually do receive notice of a trademark holder's \n     claim, cyberpirates often either refuse to acknowledge \n     demands from a trademark holder altogether, or simply respond \n     to an initial demand and then ignore all further efforts by \n     the trademark holder to secure the cyberpirate's compliance. \n     The in rem provisions of the Act accordingly contemplate that \n     a trademark holder may initiate in rem proceedings in cases \n     where domain name registrants are not subject to personal \n     jurisdiction or cannot reasonably be found by the trademark \n     holder.\n       Paragraph (2)(C) provides that in an in rem proceeding, a \n     domain name shall be deemed to have its situs in the judicial \n     district in which (1) the domain name registrar, registry, or \n     other domain name authority that registered or assigned the \n     domain name is located, or (2) documents sufficient to \n     establish control and authority regarding the disposition of \n     the registration and use of the domain name are deposited \n     with the court.\n       Paragraph (2)(D) limits the relief available in such an in \n     rem action to an injunction ordering the forfeiture, \n     cancellation, or transfer of the domain name. Upon receipt of \n     a written notification of the complaint, the domain name \n     registrar, registry, or other authority is required to \n     deposit with the court documents sufficient to establish the \n     court's control and authority regarding the disposition of \n     the registration and use of the domain name to the court, and \n     may not transfer, suspend, or otherwise modify the domain \n     name during the pendency of the action, except upon order of \n     the court. Such domain\n\n[[Page S14715]]\n\n     name registrar, registry, or other authority is immune from \n     injunctive or monetary relief in such an action, except in \n     the case of bad faith or reckless disregard, which would \n     include a willful failure to comply with any such court \n     order.\n       Paragraph (3) makes clear that the new civil action created \n     by this Act and the in rem action established therein, and \n     any remedies available under such actions, shall be in \n     addition to any other civil action or remedy otherwise \n     applicable. This paragraph thus makes clear that the creation \n     of a new section 43(d) in the Trademark Act does not in any \n     way limit the application of current provisions of trademark, \n     unfair competition and false advertising, or dilution law, or \n     other remedies under counterfeiting or other statutes, to \n     cybersquatting cases.\n       Paragraph (4) makes clear that the in rem jurisdiction \n     established by the bill is in addition to any other \n     jurisdiction that otherwise exists, whether in rem or in \n     personam.\n     Subsection (b). Cyberpiracy Protection for Individuals\n       Subsection (b) prohibits the registration of a domain name \n     that is the name of another living person, or a name that is \n     substantially and confusingly similar thereto, without such \n     person's permission, if the registrant's specific intent is \n     to profit from the domain name by selling it for financial \n     gain to such person or a third party. While the provision is \n     broad enough to apply to the registration of full names \n     (e.g., johndoe.com), appellations (e.g., doe.com), and \n     variations thereon (e.g. john-doe.com or jondoe.com), the \n     provision is still very narrow in that it requires a showing \n     that the registrant of the domain name registered that name \n     with a specific intent to profit from the name by selling it \n     to that person or to a third party for financial gain. This \n     section authorizes the court to grant injunctive relief, \n     including ordering the forfeiture or cancellation of the \n     domain name or the transfer of the domain name to the \n     plaintiff. Although the subsection does not authorize a court \n     to grant monetary damages, the court may award costs and \n     attorneys' fees to the prevailing party in appropriate cases.\n       This subsection does not prohibit the registration of a \n     domain name in good faith by an owner or licensee of a \n     copyrighted work, such as an audiovisual work, a sound \n     recording, a book, or other work of authorship, where the \n     personal name is used in, affiliated with, or related to that \n     work, where the person's intent in registering the domain is \n     not to sell the domain name other than in conjunction with \n     the lawful exploitation of the work, and where such \n     registration is not prohibited by a contract between the \n     domain name registered and the named person. This limited \n     exemption recognizes the First Amendment issues that may \n     arise in such cases and defers to existing bodies of law that \n     have developed under State and Federal law to address such \n     uses of personal names in conjunction with works of \n     expression. Such an exemption is not intended to provide a \n     loophole for those whose specific intent is to profit from \n     another's name by selling the domain name to that person or a \n     third party other than in conjunction with the bona fide \n     exploitation of a legitimate work of authorship. For example, \n     the registration of a domain name containing a personal name \n     by the author of a screenplay that bears the same name, with \n     the intent to sell the domain name in conjunction with the \n     sale or license of the screenplay to a production studio \n     would not be barred by this subsection, although other \n     provisions of State or Federal law may apply. On the other \n     hand, the exemption for good faith registrations of domain \n     names tied to legitimate works of authorship would not exempt \n     a person who registers a personal name as a domain name with \n     the intent to sell the domain name by itself, or in \n     conjunction with a work of authorship (e.g., a copyrighted \n     web page) where the real object of the sale is the domain \n     name, rather than the copyrighted work.\n       In sum, this subsection is a narrow provision intended to \n     curtail one form of ``cybersquatting''--the act of \n     registering someone else's name as a domain name for the \n     purpose of demanding remuneration from the person in exchange \n     for the domain name. Neither this section nor any other \n     section in this bill is intended to create a right of \n     publicity of any kind with respect to domain names. Nor is it \n     intended to create any new property rights, intellectual or \n     otherwise, in a domain name that is the name of a person. \n     This subsection applies prospectively only, affecting only \n     those domain names registered on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n     Sec. 3003. Damages and Remedies\n       This section applies traditional trademark remedies, \n     including injunctive relief, recovery of defendant's profits, \n     actual damages, and costs, to cybersquatting cases under the \n     new section 43(d) of the Trademark Act. The bill also amends \n     section 35 of the Trademark Act to provide for statutory \n     damages in cybersquatting cases, in an amount of not less \n     than $1,000 and not more than $100,000 per domain name, as \n     the court considers just.\n     Sec. 3004. Limitation on Liability\n       This section amends section 32(2) of the Trademark Act to \n     extend the Trademark Act's existing limitations on liability \n     to the cybersquatting context. This section also creates a \n     new subparagraph (D) in section 32(2) to encourage domain \n     name registrars and registries to work with trademark owners \n     to prevent cybersquatting through a limited exemption from \n     liability for domain name registrars and registries that \n     suspend, cancel, or transfer domain names pursuant to a court \n     order or in the implementation of a reasonable policy \n     prohibiting cybersquatting. Under this exemption, a \n     registrar, registry, or other domain name registration \n     authority that suspends, cancels, or transfers a domain name \n     pursuant to a court order or a reasonable policy prohibiting \n     cybersquatting will not be held liable for monetary damages, \n     and will be not be subject to injunctive relief provided that \n     the registrar, registry, or other registration authority has \n     deposited control of the domain name with a court in which an \n     action has been filed regarding the disposition of the domain \n     name, it has not transferred, suspended, or otherwise \n     modified the domain name during the pendency of the action, \n     other than in response to a court order, and it has not \n     willfully failed to comply with any such court order. Thus, \n     the exemption will allow a domain name registrar, registry, \n     or other registration authority to avoid being joined in a \n     civil action regarding the disposition of a domain name that \n     has been taken down pursuant to a dispute resolution policy, \n     provided the court has obtained control over the name from \n     the registrar, registry, or other registration authority, but \n     such registrar, registry, or other registration authority \n     would not be immune from suit for injunctive relief where no \n     such action has been filed or where the registrar, registry, \n     or other registration authority has transferred, suspended, \n     or otherwise modified the domain name during the pendency of \n     the action or wilfully failed to comply with a court order.\n       This section also protects the rights of domain name \n     registrants against overreaching trademark owners. Under a \n     new subparagraph (D)(iv) in section 32(2), a trademark owner \n     who knowingly and materially misrepresents to the domain name \n     registrar or registry that a domain name is infringing shall \n     be liable to the domain name registrant for damages resulting \n     from the suspension, cancellation, or transfer of the domain \n     name. In addition, the court may grant injunctive relief to \n     the domain name registrant by ordering the reactivation of \n     the domain name or the transfer of the domain name back to \n     the domain name registrant. In creating a new subparagraph \n     (D)(iii) of section 32(2), this section codifies current case \n     law limiting the secondary liability of domain name \n     registrars and registries for the act of registration of a \n     domain name, absent bad-faith on the part of the registrar \n     and registry.\n       Finally, subparagraph (D)(v) provides additional \n     protections for domain name holders by allowing a domain name \n     registrant whose name has been suspended, disabled, or \n     transferred to file a civil action to establish that the \n     registration or use of the domain name by such registrant is \n     not a violation of the Lanham Act. In such cases, a court may \n     grant injunctive relief to the domain name registrant, \n     including the reactivation of the domain name or transfer of \n     the domain name to the domain name registrant.\n     Sec. 3005. Definitions\n       This section amends the Trademark Act's definitions section \n     (section 45) to add definitions for key terms used in this \n     Act. First, the term ``Internet'' is defined consistent with \n     the meaning given that term in the Communications Act (47 \n     U.S.C. 230(f)(1)). Second, this section creates a narrow \n     definition of ``domain name'' to target the specific bad \n     faith conduct sought to be addressed while excluding such \n     things as screen names, file names, and other identifiers not \n     assigned by a domain name registrar or registry.\n     Sec. 3006. Study on Abusive Domain Name Registrations \n         Involving Personal Names\n       This section directs the Secretary of Commerce, in \n     consultation with the Patent and Trademark Office and the \n     Federal Election Commission, to conduct a study and report to \n     Congress with recommendations on guidelines and procedures \n     for resolving disputes involving the registration or use of \n     domain names that include personal names of others or names \n     that are confusingly similar thereto. This section further \n     directs the Secretary of Commerce to collaborate with the \n     Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) \n     to develop guidelines and procedures for resolving disputes \n     involving the registration or use of domain names that \n     include personal names of others or names that are \n     confusingly similar thereto.\n     Sec. 3007. Historic Preservation\n       This section provides a limited immunity from suit under \n     trademark law for historic buildings that are on or eligible \n     for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, or \n     that are designated as an individual landmark or as a \n     contributing building in a historic district.\n     Sec. 3008. Savings Clause\n       This section provides an explicit savings clause making \n     clear that the bill does not affect traditional trademark \n     defenses, such as fair use, or a person's first amendment \n     rights.\n     Sec. 3009. Effective Date\n       This section provides that damages provided for under this \n     bill shall not apply to the registration, trafficking, or use \n     of a domain name that took place prior to the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n                     TITLE VI--INVENTOR PROTECTION\n\n     Sec. 4001. Short Title\n       This title may be cited as the ``American Inventors \n     Protection Act of 1999.''\n\n[[Page S14716]]\n\n     Sec. 4002. Table of Contents\n       Section 4002 enumerates the table of contents of this \n     title.\n\n                     Subtitle A--Inventors' Rights\n\n       Subtitle A creates a new section 297 in chapter 29 of title \n     35 of the United States Code, designed to curb the deceptive \n     practices of certain invention promotion companies. Many of \n     these companies advertise on television and in magazines that \n     inventors may call a toll-free number for assistance in \n     marketing their inventions. They are sent an invention \n     evaluation form, which they are asked to complete to allow \n     the promoter to provide expert analysis of the market \n     potential of their inventions. The inventors return the form \n     with descriptions of the inventions, which become the basis \n     for contacts by salespeople at the promotion companies. The \n     next step is usually a ``professional''-appearing product \n     research report which contains nothing more than boilerplate \n     information stating that the invention has outstanding market \n     potential and fills an important need in the field. The \n     promotion companies attempt to convince the inventor to buy \n     their marketing services, normally on a sliding scale in \n     which the promoter will ask for a front-end payment of up to \n     $10,000 and a percentage of resulting profits, or a reduced \n     front-end payment of $6,000 or $8,000 with commensurately \n     larger royalties on profits. Once paid under such a scenario, \n     a promoter will typically and only forward information to a \n     list of companies that never respond.\n       This subtitle addresses these problems by (1) requiring an \n     invention promoter to disclose certain materially relevant \n     information to a customer in writing prior to entering into a \n     contract for invention promotion services; (2) establishing a \n     federal cause of action for inventors who are injured by \n     material false of fraudulent statements or representations, \n     or any omission of material fact, by an invention promoter, \n     or by the invention promoter's failure to make the required \n     written disclosures; and (3) requiring the Director of the \n     United States Patent and Trademark Office to make publicly \n     available complaints received involving invention promoters, \n     along with the response to such complaints, if any, from the \n     invention promoters.\n     Sec. 4101. Short title\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Inventors'' Rights Act \n     of 1999.''\n     Sec. 4102. Integrity in invention promotion services\n       This section adds a new section 297 to in chapter 29 of \n     title 35, United States Code, intended to promote integrity \n     in invention promotion services. Legitimate invention \n     assistance and development organizations can be of great \n     assistance to novice inventors by providing information on \n     how to protect an invention, how to develop it, how to obtain \n     financing to manufacture it, or how to license or sell the \n     invention. While many invention developers are legitimate, \n     the unscrupulous ones take advantage of untutored inventors, \n     asking for large sums of money up front for which they \n     provide no real service in return. This new section provides \n     a much needed safeguard to assist independent inventors in \n     avoiding becoming victims of the predatory practices of \n     unscrupulous invention promoters.\n       New section 297(a) of title 35 requires an invention \n     promoter to disclose certain materially relevant information \n     to a customer in writing prior to entering into a contract \n     for invention promotion services. Such information includes: \n     (1) The number of inventions evaluated by the invention \n     promoter and stating the number of those evaluated positively \n     and the number negatively; (2) The number of customers who \n     have contracted for services with the invention promoter in \n     the prior five years; (3) The number of customers known by \n     the invention promoter to have received a net financial \n     profit as a direct result of the invention promoter's \n     services; (4) The number of customers known by the invention \n     promoter to have received license agreements for their \n     inventions as a direct result of the invention promoter's \n     services; and (5) the names and addresses of all previous \n     invention promotion companies with which the invention \n     promoter or its officers have collectively or individually \n     been affiliated in the previous 10 years to enable the \n     customer to evaluate the reputations of these companies.\n       New section 297(b) of title 35 establishes a civil cause of \n     action against any invention promoter who injures a customer \n     through any material false or fraudulent statement, \n     representation, or omission of material fact by the invention \n     promoter, or any person acting on behalf of the invention \n     promoter, or through failure of the invention promoter to \n     make all the disclosures required under subsection (a). In \n     such a civil action, the customer may recover, in addition to \n     reasonable costs and attorneys' fees, the amount of actual \n     damages incurred by the customer or, at the customer's \n     election, statutory damages up to $5,000, as the court \n     considers just. Subsection (b)(2) authorizes the court to \n     increase damages to an amount not to exceed three times the \n     amount awarded as statutory or actual damages in a case where \n     the customer demonstrates, and the court finds, that the \n     invention promoter intentionally misrepresented or omitted a \n     material fact to such customer, or failed to make the \n     required disclosures under subsection (a), for the purpose of \n     deceiving the customer. In determining the amount of \n     increased damages, courts may take into account whether \n     regulatory sanctions or other corrective action has been \n     taken as a result of previous complaints against the \n     invention promoter.\n       New section 297(c) defines the terms used in the section. \n     These definitions are carefully crafted to cover true \n     invention promoters without casting the net too broadly. \n     Paragraph (3) excepts from the definition of ``invention \n     promoter'' departments and agencies of the Federal, state, \n     and local governments; any nonprofit, charitable, scientific, \n     or educational organizations qualified under applicable State \n     laws or described under Sec. 170(b)(1)(A) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986; persons or entities involved in \n     evaluating the commercial potential of, or offering to \n     license or sell, a utility patent or a previously filed \n     nonprovisional utility patent application; any party \n     participating in a transaction involving the sale of the \n     stock or assets of a business; or any party who directly \n     engages in the business of retail sales or distribution of \n     products. Paragraph (4) defines the term ``invention \n     promotion services'' to mean the procurement or attempted \n     procurement for a customer of a firm, corporation, or other \n     entity to develop and market products or services that \n     include the customer's invention.\n       New section 297(d) requires the Director of the USPTO to \n     make publicly available all complaints submitted to the USPTO \n     regarding invention promoters, together with any responses by \n     invention promoters to those complaints. The Director is \n     required to notify the invention promoter of a complaint and \n     provide a reasonable opportunity to reply prior to making \n     such complaint public. Section 297(d)(2) authorizes the \n     Director to request from Federal and State agencies copies of \n     any complaints relating to invention promotion services they \n     have received and to include those complaints in the records \n     maintained by the USPTO regarding invention promotion \n     services. It is anticipated that the Director will use \n     appropriate discretion in making such complaints available to \n     the public for a reasonably sufficient, yet limited, length \n     of time, such as a period of three years from the date of \n     receipt, and that the Director will consult with the Federal \n     Trade Commission to determine whether the disclosure \n     requirements of the FTC and section 297(a) can be \n     coordinated.\n     Sec. 4103. Effective date\n       This section provides that the effective date of section \n     297 will be 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n             Subtitle B--Patent and Trademark Fee Fairness\n\n       Subtitle B provides patent and trademark fee reform, by \n     lowering patent fees, by directing the Director of the USPTO \n     to study alternative fee structures to encourage full \n     participation in our patent system by all inventors, large \n     and small, and by strengthening the prohibition against the \n     use of trademark fees for non-trademark uses.\n     Sec. 4201. Short title\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Patent and Trademark \n     Fee Fairness Act of 1999.''\n     Sec. 4202. Adjustment of patent fees.\n       This section reduces patent filing an reissue fees by $50, \n     and reduces patent maintenance fees by $110. This would mark \n     only the second time in history that patent fees have been \n     reduced. Because trademark fees have not been increased since \n     1993 and because of the application of accounting based cost \n     principles and systems, patent fee income has been partially \n     offsetting the cost of trademark operations. This section \n     will restore fairness to patent and trademark fees by \n     reducing patent fees to better reflect the cost of services.\n     Sec. 4203. Adjustment of trademark fees.\n       This section will allow the Director of the USPTO to adjust \n     trademark fees in fiscal year 2000 without regard to \n     fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index in order to better \n     align those fees with the costs of services.\n     Sec. 4204. Study on alternative fee structures\n       This section directs the Director of the USPTO to conduct a \n     study and report to the Judiciary Committees of the House and \n     Senate within one year on alternative fee structures that \n     could be adopted by the USPTO to encourage maximum \n     participation in the patent system by the American inventor \n     community.\n     Sec. 4205. Patent and Trademark Office funding\n       Pursuant to section 42(c) of the Patent Act, fees available \n     to the Commissioner under section 31 of the Trademark Act of \n     1946 \\6\\ may be used only for the processing of trademark \n     registrations and for other trademark-related activities, and \n     to cover a proportionate share of the administrative costs of \n     the USPTO. In an effort to more tightly ``fence'' trademark \n     funds for trademark purposes, section 4205 amends this \n     language such that all (trademark) fees available to the \n     Commissioner shall be used for trademark registration and \n     other trademark-related purposes. In other words, the \n     Commissioner may exercise no discretion when spending funds; \n     they must be earmarked for trademark purposes.\n\n                   Subtitle C--First Inventor Defense\n\n       Subtitle C strikes an equitable balance between the \n     interests of U.S. inventors who have invented and \n     commercialized business methods and processes, many of which \n     until recently were thought not to be patentable, and U.S. or \n     foreign inventors who later patent the methods and processes. \n     The subtitle creates a defense for inventors who have reduced \n     an invention to practice in the U.S. at\n\n[[Page S14717]]\n\n     least one year before the patent filing date of another, \n     typically later, inventor and commercially used the invention \n     in the U.S. before the filing date. A party entitled to the \n     defense must not have derived the invention from the patent \n     owner. The bill protects the patent owner by providing that \n     the establishment of the defense by such an inventor or \n     entrepreneur does not invalidate the patent.\n       The subtitle clarifies the interface between two key \n     branches of intellectual property law--patents and trade \n     secrets. Patent law serves the public interest by encouraging \n     innovation and investment in new technology, and may be \n     thought of as providing a right to exclude other parties from \n     an invention in return for the inventor making a public \n     disclosure of the invention. Trade secret law, however, also \n     serves the public interest by protecting investments in new \n     technology. Trade secrets have taken on a new importance with \n     an increase in the ability to patent all business methods and \n     processes. It would be administratively and economically \n     impossible to expect any inventor to apply for a patent on \n     all methods and processes now deemed patentable. In order to \n     protect inventors and to encourage proper disclosure, this \n     subtitle focuses on methods for doing and conducting \n     business, including methods used in connection with internal \n     commercial operations as well as those used in connection \n     with the sale or transfer of useful end results--whether in \n     the form of physical products, or in the form of services, or \n     in the form of some other useful results; for example, \n     results produced through the manipulation of data or other \n     inputs to produce a useful result.\n       The earlier-inventor defense is important to many small and \n     large businesses, including financial services, software \n     companies, and manufacturing firms--any business that relies \n     on innovative business processes and methods. The 1998 \n     opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \n     in State Street Bank and Trust Co. v. Signature Financial \n     Group,\\7\\ which held that methods of doing business are \n     patentable, has added to the urgency of the issue. As the \n     Court noted, the reference to the business method exception \n     had been improperly applied to a wide variety of processes, \n     blurring the essential question of whether the invention \n     produced a ``useful, concrete, and tangible result.'' In the \n     wake of State Street, thousands of methods and processes used \n     internally are now being patented. In the past, many \n     businesses that developed and used such methods and processes \n     thought secrecy was the only protection available. Under \n     established law, any of these inventions which have been in \n     commercial use--public or secret--for more than one year \n     cannot now be the subject of a valid U.S. patent.\n     Sec. 4301. Short title\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``First Inventor Defense \n     Act of 1999.''\n     Sec. 4302. Defense to patent infringement based on earlier \n         inventor\n       In establishing the defense, subsection (a) of section 4302 \n     creates a new section 273 of the Patent Act, which in \n     subsection (a) sets forth the following definitions:\n       (1) ``Commercially used and commercial use'' mean use of \n     any method in the United States so long as the use is in \n     connection with an internal commercial use or an actual sale \n     or transfer of a useful end result;\n       (2) ``Commercial use as applied to a nonprofit research \n     laboratory and nonprofit entities such as a university, \n     research center, or hospital intended to benefit the public'' \n     means that such entities may assert the defense only based on \n     continued use by and in the entities themselves, but that the \n     defense is inapplicable to subsequent commercialization or \n     use outside the entities;\n       (3) ``Method'' means any method for doing or conducting an \n     entity's business; and (4) ``Effective filing date'' means \n     the earlier of the actual filing date of the application for \n     the patent or the filing date of any earlier US, foreign, or \n     international application to which the subject matter at \n     issue is entitled under the Patent Act.\n       To be ``commercially used'' or in ``commercial use'' for \n     purposes of subsection (a), the use must be in connection \n     with either an internal commercial use or an actual arm's-\n     length sale or other arm's-length commercial transfer of a \n     useful end result. The method that is the subject matter of \n     the defense may be an internal method for doing business, \n     such as an internal human resources management process, or a \n     method for conducting business such as a preliminary or \n     intermediate manufacturing procedure, which contributes to \n     the effectiveness of the business by producing a useful end \n     result for the internal operation of the business or for \n     external sale. Commercial use does not require the subject \n     matter at issue to be accessible to or otherwise known to the \n     public.\n       Subject matter that must undergo a premarketing regulatory \n     review period during which safety or efficacy is established \n     before commercial marketing or use is considered to be \n     commercially used and in commercial use during the regulatory \n     review period.\n       The issue of whether an invention is a method is to be \n     determined based on its underlying nature and not on the \n     technicality of the form of the claims in the patent. For \n     example, a method for doing or conducting business that has \n     been claimed in a patent as a programmed machine, as in the \n     State Street case, is a method for purposes of section 273 if \n     the invention could have as easily been claimed as a method. \n     Form should not rule substance.\n       Subsection (b)(1) of section 273 establishes a general \n     defense against infringement under section 271 of the Patent \n     Act. Specifically, a person will not be held liable with \n     respect to any subject matter that would otherwise infringe \n     one or more claims to a method in another party's patent if \n     the person:\n       (1) Acting in good faith, actually reduced the subject \n     matter to practice at least one year before the effective \n     filing date of the patent; and\n       (2) Commercially used the subject matter before the \n     effective filing date of the patent.\n       The first inventor defense is not limited to methods in any \n     particular industry such as the financial services industry, \n     but applies to any industry which relies on trade secrecy for \n     protecting methods for doing or conducting the operations of \n     their business.\n       Subsection (b)(2) states that the sale or other lawful \n     disposition of a useful end result produced by a patented \n     method, by a person entitled to assert a section 273 defense, \n     exhausts the patent owner's rights with respect to that end \n     result to the same extent such rights would have been \n     exhausted had the sale or other disposition been made by the \n     patent owner. For example, if a purchaser would have had the \n     right to resell a product or other end result if bought from \n     the patent owner, the purchaser will have the same right if \n     the product is purchased from a person entitled to a section \n     273 defense.\n       Subsection (b)(3) creates limitations and qualifications on \n     the use of the defense. First, a person may not assert the \n     defense unless the invention for which the defense is \n     asserted is for a commercial use of a method as defined in \n     section 273(a)(1) and (3). Second, a person may not assert \n     the defense if the subject matter was derived from the patent \n     owner or persons in privity with the patent owner. Third, \n     subsection (b)(3) makes clear that the application of the \n     defense does not create a general license under all claims of \n     the patent in question--it extends only to the specific \n     subject matter claimed in the patent with respect to which \n     the person can assert the defense. At the same time, however, \n     the defense does extend to variations in the quantity or \n     volume of use of the claimed subject matter, and to \n     improvements that do not infringe additional, specifically-\n     claimed subject matter.\n       Subsection (b)(4) requires that the person asserting the \n     defense has the burden of proof in establishing it by clear \n     and convincing evidence. Subsection (b)(5) establishes that \n     the person who abandons the commercial use of subject matter \n     may not rely on activities performed before the date of such \n     abandonment in establishing the defense with respect to \n     actions taken after the date of abandonment. Such a person \n     can rely only on the date when commercial use of the subject \n     matter was resumed.\n       Subsection (b)(6) notes that the defense may only be \n     asserted by the person who performed the acts necessary to \n     establish the defense, and, except for transfer to the patent \n     owner, the right to assert the defense cannot be licensed, \n     assigned, or transferred to a third party except as an \n     ancillary and subordinate part of a good-faith assignment or \n     transfer for other reasons of the entire enterprise or line \n     of business to which the defense relates.\n       When the defense has been transferred along with the \n     enterprise or line of business to which it relates as \n     permitted by subsection (b)(6), subsection (b)(7) limits the \n     sites for which the defense may be asserted. Specifically, \n     when the enterprise or line of business to which the defense \n     relates has been transferred, the defense may be asserted \n     only for uses at those sites where the subject matter was \n     used before the later of the patent filing date or the date \n     of transfer of the enterprise or line of business.\n       Subsection (b)(8) states that a person who fails to \n     demonstrate a reasonable basis for asserting the defense may \n     be held liable for attorneys' fees under section 285 of the \n     Patent Act.\n       Subsection (b)(9) specifies that the successful assertion \n     of the defense does not mean that the affected patent is \n     invalid. Paragraph (9) eliminates a point of uncertainty \n     under current law, and strikes a balance between the rights \n     of an inventor who obtains a patent after another inventor \n     has taken the steps to qualify for a prior use defense. The \n     bill provides that the commercial use of a method in \n     operating a business before the patentee's filing date, by an \n     individual or entity that can establish a section 273 \n     defense, does not invalidate the patent. For example, under \n     current law, although the matter has seldom been litigated, a \n     party who commercially used an invention in secrecy before \n     the patent filing date and who also invented the subject \n     matter before the patent owner's invention may argue that the \n     patent is invalid under section 102 (g) of the Patent Act. \n     Arguably, commercial use of an invention in secrecy is not \n     suppression or concealment of the invention within the \n     meaning of section 102(g), and therefore the party's earlier \n     invention could invalidate the patent.\\8\\\n     Sec. 4303. Effective date and applicability\n       The effective date for subtitle C is the date of enactment, \n     except that the title does not apply to any infringement \n     action pending on the date of enactment or to any subject \n     matter for which an adjudication of infringement, including a \n     consent judgment, has been made before the date of enactment.\n\n[[Page S14718]]\n\n                   Subtitle D--Patent Term Guarantee\n\n       Subtitle D amends the provisions in the Patent Act that \n     compensate patent applicants for certain reductions in patent \n     term that are not the fault of the applicant. The provisions \n     that were initially included in the term adjustment \n     provisions of patent bills in the 105th Congress only \n     provided adjustments for up to 10 years for secrecy orders, \n     interferences, and successful appeals. Not only are these \n     adjustments too short in some cases, but no adjustments were \n     provided for administrative delays caused by the USPTO that \n     were beyond the control of the applicant. Accordingly, \n     subtitle D removes the 10-year caps from the existing \n     provisions, adds a new provision to compensate applicants \n     fully for USPTO-caused administrative delays, and, for good \n     measure, includes a new provision guaranteeing diligent \n     applicants at least a 17-year term by extending the term of \n     any patent not granted within three years of filing. Thus, no \n     patent applicant diligently seeking to obtain a patent will \n     receive a term of less than the 17 years as provided under \n     the pre-GATT \\9\\ standard; in fact, most will receive \n     considerably more. Only those who purposely manipulate the \n     system to delay the issuance of their patents will be \n     penalized under subtitle D, a result that the Conferees \n     believe entirely appropriate.\n     Sec. 4401. Short title\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Patent Term Guarantee \n     Act of 1999.''\n     Sec.4402. Patent term guarantee authority\n       Section 4402 amends section 154(b) of the Patent Act \n     covering term. First, new subsection (b)(1)(A)(i)-(iv) \n     guarantees day-for-day restoration of term lost as a result \n     of delay created by the USPTO when the agency fails to:\n       (1) Make a notification of the rejection of any claim for a \n     patent or any objection or argument under Sec. 132, or give \n     or mail a written notice of allowance under Sec. 151, within \n     14 months after the date on which a non-provisional \n     application was actually filed in the USPTO;\n       (2) Respond to a reply under Sec. 132, or to an appeal \n     taken under Sec. 134, within four months after the date on \n     which the reply was filed or the appeal was taken;\n       (3) Act on an application within four months after the date \n     of a decision by the Board of Patent Appeals and \n     Interferences under Sec. 134 or Sec. 135 or a decision by a \n     Federal court under Sec. Sec. 141, 145, or 146 in a case in \n     which allowable claims remain in the application; or (4) \n     Issue a patent within four months after the date on which the \n     issue fee was paid under Sec. 151 and all outstanding \n     requirements were satisfied.\n       Further, subject to certain limitations, infra, section \n     154(b)(1)(B) guarantees a total application pendency of no \n     more than three years. Specifically, day-for-day restoration \n     of term is granted if the USPTO has not issued a patent \n     within three years after ``the actual date of the application \n     in the United States.'' This language was intentionally \n     selected to exclude the filing date of an application under \n     the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).\\10\\ Otherwise, an \n     applicant could obtain up to a 30-month extension of a U.S. \n     patent merely by filing under PCT, rather than directly in \n     the USPTO, gaining an unfair advantage in contrast to \n     strictly domestic applicants. Any periods of time\n       (1) consumed in the continued examination of the \n     application under Sec. 132(b) of the Patent Act as added by \n     section 4403 of this Act;\n       (2) lost due to an interference under section135(a), a \n     secrecy order under section 181, or appellate review by the \n     Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences or by a Federal \n     court (irrespective of the outcome); and\n       (3) incurred at the request of an applicant in excess of \n     the three months to respond to a notice from the Office \n     permitted by section 154(b)(2)(C)(ii) unless excused by a \n     showing by the applicant under section 154(b)(3)(C) that in \n     spite of all due care the applicant could not respond within \n     three months\n\n     shall not be considered a delay by the USPTO and shall not be \n     counted for purposes of determining whether the patent issued \n     within three years from the actual filing date.\n       Day-for-day restoration is also granted under new section \n     154(b)(1)(C) for delays resulting from interferences,\\11\\ \n     secrecy orders,\\12\\ and appeals by the Board of Patent \n     Appeals and Interferences or a Federal court in which a \n     patent was issued as a result of a decision reversing an \n     adverse determination of patentability.\n       Section 4402 imposes limitations on restoration of term. In \n     general, pursuant to new Sec. 154(b)(2)(A)-(C) of the bill, \n     total adjustments granted for restorations under (b)(1) are \n     reduced as follows:\n       (1) To the extent that there are multiple grounds for \n     extending the term of a patent that may exist simultaneously \n     (e.g., delay due to a secrecy order under section 181 and \n     administrative delay under section 154(b)(1)(A)), the term \n     should not be extended for each ground of delay but only for \n     the actual number of days that the issuance of a patent was \n     delayed;\n       (2) The term of any patent which has been disclaimed beyond \n     a date certain may not receive an adjustment beyond the \n     expiration date specified in the disclaimer; and\n       (3) Adjustments shall be reduced by a period equal to the \n     time in which the applicant failed to engage in reasonable \n     efforts to conclude prosecution of the application, based on \n     regulations developed by the Director, and an applicant shall \n     be deemed to have failed to engage in such reasonable efforts \n     for any periods of time in excess of three months that are \n     taken to respond to a notice from the Office making any \n     rejection or other request;\n       New section 154(b)(3) sets forth the procedures for the \n     adjustment of patent terms. Paragraph (3)(A) empowers the \n     Director to establish regulations by which term extensions \n     are determined and contested. Paragraph (3)(B) requires the \n     Director to send a notice of any determination with the \n     notice of allowance and to give the applicant one opportunity \n     to request reconsideration of the determination. Paragraph \n     (3)(C) requires the Director to reinstate any time the \n     applicant takes to respond to a notice from the Office in \n     excess of three months that was deducted from any patent term \n     extension that would otherwise have been granted if the \n     applicant can show that he or she was, in spite of all due \n     care, unable to respond within three months. In no case shall \n     more than an additional three months be reinstated for each \n     response. Paragraph (3)(D) requires the Director to grant the \n     patent after completion of determining any patent term \n     extension irrespective of whether the applicant appeals.\n       New section 154(b)(4) regulates appeals of term adjustment \n     determinations made by the Director. Paragraph (4)(A) \n     requires a dissatisfied applicant to seek remedy in the \n     District Court for the District of Columbia under the \n     Administrative Procedures Act \\13\\ within 180 days after the \n     grant of the patent. The Director shall alter the term of the \n     patent to reflect any final judgment. Paragraph (4)(B) \n     precludes a third party from challenging the determination of \n     a patent term prior to patent grant.\n       Section 4402(b) makes certain conforming amendments to \n     section 282 of the Patent Act and the appellate jurisdiction \n     of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\\14\\\n     Sec. 4403. Continued examination of patent applications\n       Section 4403 amends section 132 of the Patent Act to permit \n     an applicant to request that an examiner continue the \n     examination of an application following a notice of ``final'' \n     rejection by the examiner. New section 132(b) authorizes the \n     Director to prescribe regulations for the continued \n     examination of an application notwithstanding a final \n     rejection, at the request of the applicant. The Director may \n     also establish appropriate fees for continued examination \n     proceedings, and shall provide a 50% fee reduction for small \n     entities which qualify for such treatment under section \n     41(h)(1) of the Patent Act.\n     Section 4404. Technical clarification\n       Section 4404 of the bill coordinates technical term \n     adjustment provisions set forth in section 154(b) with those \n     in section 156(a) of the Patent Act.\n     Section 4405. Effective date\n       The effective date for the amendments in section 4402 and \n     4404 is six months after the date of enactment and, with the \n     exception of design applications (the terms of which are not \n     measured from filing), applies to any application filed on or \n     after such date. The amendments made by section 4403 take \n     effect six months after date of enactment to allow the USPTO \n     to prepare implementing regulations an apply to all national \n     and international (PCT) applications filed on or after June \n     8, 1995.\n\n   Subtitle E--Domestic Publication of Patent Applications Published \n                                 Abroad\n\n       Subtitle E provides for the publication of pending patent \n     applications which have a corresponding foreign counterpart. \n     Any pending U.S. application filed only in the United States \n     (e.g., one that does not have a foreign counterpart) will not \n     be published if the applicant so requests. Thus, an applicant \n     wishing to maintain her application in confidence may do so \n     merely by filing only in the United States and requesting \n     that the USPTO not publish the application. For those \n     applicants who do file abroad or who voluntarily publish \n     their applications, provisional rights will be available for \n     assertion against any third party who uses the claimed \n     invention between publication and grant provided that \n     substantially similar claims are contained in both the \n     published application and granted patent. This change will \n     ensure that American inventors will be able to see the \n     technology that our foreign competition is seeking to patent \n     much earlier than is possible today.\n     Sec. 4501. Short title\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Domestic Publication of \n     Foreign Filed Patent Applications Act of 1999.''\n     Sec. 4502. Publication\n       As provided in subsection (a) of section 4502, amended \n     section 122(a) of the Patent Act continues the general rule \n     that patent applications will be maintained in confidence. \n     Paragraph (1)(A) of new subsection (b) of section 122 creates \n     a new exception to this general rule by requiring publication \n     of certain applications promptly after the expiration of an \n     18-month period following the earliest claimed U.S. or \n     foreign filing date. The Director is authorized by \n     subparagraph (B) to determine what information concerning \n     published applications shall be made available to the public, \n     and, under subparagraph (C) any decision made in this regard \n     is final and not subject to review.\n       Subsection (b)(2) enumerates exceptions to the general rule \n     requiring publication. Subparagraph (A) precludes publication \n     of any\n\n[[Page S14719]]\n\n     application that is: (1) no longer pending at the 18th month \n     from filing; (2) the subject of a secrecy order until the \n     secrecy order is rescinded; (3) a provisional \n     application;\\15\\ or (4) a design patent application.\\16\\\n       Pursuant to subparagraph (B)(i), any applicant who is not \n     filing overseas and does not wish her application to be \n     published can simply make a request and state that her \n     invention has not and will not be the subject of an \n     application filed in a foreign country that requires \n     publication after 18 months. Subparagraph (B)(ii) clarifies \n     that an applicant may rescind this request at any time. \n     Moreover, if an applicant has requested that her application \n     not be published in a foreign country with a publication \n     requirement, subparagraph (B)(iii) imposes a duty on the \n     applicant to notify the Director of this fact. An unexcused \n     failure to notify the Director will result in the abandonment \n     of the application. If an applicant either rescinds a request \n     that her application not be published or notifies the \n     Director that an application has been filed in an early \n     publication country or through the PCT, the U.S. application \n     will be published at 18 months pursuant to subsection (b)(1).\n       Finally, under subparagraph (B)(v), where an applicant has \n     filed an application in a foreign country, either directly or \n     through the PCT, so that the application will be published 18 \n     months from its earliest effective filing date, the applicant \n     may limit the scope of the publication by the USPTO to the \n     total of the cumulative scope of the applications filed in \n     all foreign countries. Where the foreign application is \n     identical to the application filed in the United States or \n     where an application filed under the PCT is identical to the \n     application filed in the United States, the applicant may not \n     limit the extent to which the application filed in the United \n     States is published. However, where an applicant has limited \n     the description of an application filed in a foreign country, \n     either directly or through the PCT in comparison with the \n     application filed in the USPTO, the applicant may restrict \n     the publication by the USPTO to no more than the cumulative \n     details of what will be published in all of the foreign \n     applications and through the PCT. The applicant may restrict \n     the extent of publication of her U.S. application by \n     submitting a redacted copy of the application to the USPTO \n     eliminating only those details that will not be published in \n     any of the foreign applications. Any description contained in \n     at least one of the foreign national or PCT filings may not \n     be excluded from publication in the corresponding U.S. patent \n     application. To ensure that any redacted copy of the U.S. \n     application is published in place of the original U.S. \n     application, the redacted copy must be received within 16 \n     months from the earliest effective filing date. Finally, if \n     the published U.S. application as redacted by the applicant \n     does not enable a person skilled in the art to make and use \n     the claimed invention, provisional rights under section \n     154(d) shall not be available.\n       Subsection (c) requires the Director to establish \n     procedures to ensure that no protest or other form of pre-\n     issuance opposition to the grant of a patent on an \n     application may be initiated after publication without the \n     express written consent of the applicant.\n       Subsection (d) protects our national security by providing \n     that no application may be published under subsection (b)(1) \n     where the publication or disclosure of such invention would \n     be detrimental to the national security. In addition, the \n     Director of the USPTO is required to establish appropriate \n     procedures to ensure that such applications are promptly \n     identified and the secrecy of such inventions is maintained \n     in accordance with chapter 17 of the Patent Act, which \n     governs secrecy of inventions in the interest of national \n     security.\n       Subsection (b) of section 4502 of subtitle E requires the \n     Government Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct a study of \n     applicants who file only in the United States during a three-\n     year period beginning on the effective date of subtitle E. \n     The study will focus on the percentage of U.S. applicants who \n     file only in the United States versus those who file outside \n     the United States; how many domestic-only filers request not \n     to be published; how many who request not to be published \n     later rescind that request; and whether there is any \n     correlation between the type of applicant (e.g., small vs. \n     large entity) and publication. The Comptroller General must \n     submit the findings of the study, once completed, to the \n     Committees on the Judiciary of the House and Senate.\n     Sec. 4503. Time for claiming benefit of earlier filing date\n       Section 119 of the Patent Act prescribes procedures to \n     implement the right to claim priority under Article 4 of the \n     Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial \n     Property.\\17\\ Under that Article, an applicant seeking \n     protection in the United States may claim the filing date of \n     an application for the same invention filed in another \n     Convention country--provided the subsequent application is \n     filed in the United States within 12 months of the earlier \n     filing in the foreign country.\n       Section 4503 of subtitle V amends section 119(b) of the \n     Patent Act to authorize the Director to establish a cut-off \n     date by which the applicant must claim priority. This is to \n     ensure that the claim will be made early enough--generally \n     not later than the 16th month from the earliest effective \n     filing date--so as to permit an orderly publication schedule \n     for pending applications. As the USPTO moves to electronic \n     filing, it is envisioned that this date could be moved closer \n     to the 18th month.\n       The amendment to Sec. 119(b) also gives the Director the \n     discretion to consider the failure of the applicant to file a \n     timely claim for priority to be a waiver of any such priority \n     claim. The Director is also authorized to establish \n     procedures (including the payment of a surcharge) to accept \n     an unintentionally delayed priority claim.\n       Section 4503(b) of subtitle E amends section 120 of the \n     Patent Act in a similar way. This provision empowers the \n     Director to: (1) establish a time by which the priority of an \n     earlier filed United States application must be claimed; (2) \n     consider the failure to meet that time limit to be a waiver \n     of the right to claim such priority; and (3) accept an \n     unintentionally late claim of priority subject to the payment \n     of a surcharge.\n     Sec. 4504. Provisional rights\n       Section 4504 amends section 154 of the Patent Act by adding \n     a new subsection (d) to accord provisional rights to obtain a \n     reasonable royalty for applicants whose applications are \n     published under amended section 122(b) of the Patent Act, \n     supra, or applications designating the United States filed \n     under the PCT. Generally, this provision establishes the \n     right of an applicant to obtain a reasonable royalty from any \n     person who, during the period beginning on the date that his \n     or her application is published and ending on the date a \n     patent is issued--\n       (1) makes, uses, offers for sale, or sells the invention in \n     the United States, or imports such an invention into the \n     United States; or\n       (2) if the invention claimed is a process, makes, uses, \n     offers for sale, sells, or imports a product made by that \n     process in the United States; and\n       (3) had actual notice of the published application and, in \n     the case of an application filed under the PCT designating \n     the United States that is published in a language other than \n     English, a translation of the application into English.\n       The requirement of actual notice is critical. The mere fact \n     that the published application is included in a commercial \n     database where it might be found is insufficient. The \n     published applicant must give actual notice of the published \n     application to the accused infringer and explain what acts \n     are regarded as giving rise to provisional rights.\n       Another important limitation on the availability of \n     provisional royalties is that the claims in the published \n     application that are alleged to give rise to provisional \n     rights must also appear in the patent in substantially \n     identical form. To allow anything less than substantial \n     identity would impose an unacceptable burden on the public. \n     If provisional rights were available in the situation where \n     the only valid claim infringed first appeared in \n     substantially that form in the granted patent, the public \n     would have no guidance as to the specific behavior to avoid \n     between publication and grant. Every person or company that \n     might be operating within the scope of the disclosure of the \n     published application would have to conduct her own private \n     examination to determine whether a published application \n     contained patentable subject matter that she should avoid. \n     The burden should be on the applicant to initially draft a \n     schedule of claims that gives adequate notice to the public \n     of what she is seeking to patent.\n       Amended section 154(d)(3) imposes a six-year statute of \n     limitations from grant in which an action for reasonable \n     royalties must be brought.\n       Amended section 154(d)(4) sets forth some additional rules \n     qualifying when an international application under the PCT \n     will give rise to provisional rights. The date that will give \n     rise to provisional rights for international applications \n     will be the date on which the USPTO receives a copy of the \n     application published under the PCT in the English language; \n     if the application is published under the PCT in a language \n     other than English, then the date on which provisional rights \n     will arise will be the date on which the USPTO receives a \n     translation of the international application in the English \n     language. The Director is empowered to require an applicant \n     to provide a copy of the international application and a \n     translation of it.\n     Sec. 4505. Prior art effect of published applications\n       Section 4505 amends section 102(e) of the Patent Act to \n     treat an application published by the USPTO in the same \n     fashion as a patent published by the USPTO. Accordingly, a \n     published application is given prior art effect as of its \n     earliest effective U.S. filing date against any subsequently \n     filed U.S. applications. As with patents, any foreign filing \n     date to which the published application is entitled will not \n     be the effective filing date of the U.S. published \n     application for prior art purposes. An exception to this \n     general rule is made for international applications \n     designating the United States that are published under \n     Article 21(2)(a) of the PCT in the English language. Such \n     applications are given a prior art effect as of their \n     international filing date. The prior art effect accorded to \n     patents under section 4505 remains unchanged from present \n     section 102(e) of the Patent Act.\n     Sec. 4506. Cost recovery for publications\n       Section 4506 authorizes the Director to recover the costs \n     of early publication required by the amendment made by \n     section 4502 of this Act by charging a separate publication \n     fee after a notice of allowance is given pursuant to section \n     151 of the Patent Act.\n\n[[Page S14720]]\n\n     Sec. 4507. Conforming amendments\n       Section 4507 consists of various technical and conforming \n     amendments to the Patent Act. These include amending section \n     181 of the Patent Act to clarify that publication of pending \n     applications does not apply to applications under secrecy \n     orders, and amending section 284 of the Patent Act to ensure \n     that increased damages authorized under section 284 shall not \n     apply to the reasonable royalties possible under amended \n     section 154(d). In addition, section 374 of the Patent Act is \n     amended to provide that the effect of the publication of an \n     international application designating the United States shall \n     be the same as the publication of an application published \n     under amended section 122(b), except as its effect as prior \n     art is modified by amended section 102(e) and its giving rise \n     to provisional rights is qualified by new section 154(d).\n     Sec. 4508. Effective date\n       Subtitle E shall take effect on the date that is one year \n     after the date of enactment and shall apply to all \n     applications filed under section 111 of the Patent Act on or \n     after that date; and to all applications complying with \n     section 371 of the Patent Act that resulted from \n     international applications filed on or after that date. The \n     provisional rights provided in amended section 154(d) and the \n     prior art effect provided in amended section 102(e) shall \n     apply to all applications pending on the date that is one \n     year after the date of enactment that are voluntarily \n     published by their applicants. Finally, section 404 \n     (provisional rights) shall apply to international \n     applications designating the United States that are filed on \n     or after the date that is one year after the date of \n     enactment.\n\n       Subtitle F--Optional Inter Partes Reexamination procedure\n\n       Subtitle F is intended to reduce expensive patent \n     litigation in U.S. district courts by giving third-party \n     requesters, in addition to the existing ex parte \n     reexamination in Chapter 30 of title 35, the option of inter \n     partes reexamination proceedings in the USPTO. Congress \n     enacted legislation to authorize ex parte reexamination of \n     patents in the USPTO in 1980, but such reexamination has been \n     used infrequently since a third party who requests \n     reexamination cannot participate at all after initiating the \n     proceedings. Numerous witnesses have suggested that the \n     volume of lawsuits in district courts will be reduced if \n     third parties can be encouraged to use reexamination by \n     giving them an opportunity to argue their case for patent \n     invalidity in the USPTO. Subtitle F provides that opportunity \n     as an option to the existing ex parte reexamination \n     proceedings.\n       Subtitle F leaves existing ex parte reexamination \n     procedures in Chapter 30 of title 35 intact, but establishes \n     an inter partes reexamination procedure which third-party \n     requesters can use at their option. Subtitle VI allows third \n     parties who request inter partes reexamination to submit one \n     written comment each time the patent owner files a response \n     to the USPTO. In addition, such third-party requesters can \n     appeal to the USPTO Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences \n     from an examiner's determination that the reexamined patent \n     is valid, but may not appeal to the Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit. To prevent harassment, anyone who requests \n     inter partes reexamination must identify the real party in \n     interest and third-party requesters who participate in an \n     inter partes reexamination proceeding are estopped from \n     raising in a subsequent court action or inter partes \n     reexamination any issue of patent validity that they raised \n     or could have raised during such inter partes reexamination.\n       Subtitle F contains the important threshold safeguard (also \n     applied in ex parte reexamination) that an inter partes \n     reexamination cannot be commenced unless the USPTO makes a \n     determination that a ``substantial new question'' of \n     patentability is raised. Also, as under Chapter 30, this \n     determination cannot be appealed, and grounds for inter \n     partes reexamination are limited to earlier patents and \n     printed publications--grounds that USPTO examiners are well-\n     suited to consider.\n     Sec. 4601. Short title\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Optional Inter Partes \n     Reexamination Procedure Act.''\n     Sec. 4602. Clarification of Chapter 30\n       This section distinguishes Chapter 31 from existing Chapter \n     30 by changing the title of Chapter 30 to ``Ex Parte \n     Reexamination of Patents.''\n     Sec. 4603. Definitions\n       This section amends section 100 of the Patent Act by \n     defining ``third-party requester'' as a person who is not the \n     patent owner requesting ex parte reexamination under section \n     302 or inter partes reexamination under section 311.\n     Sec. 4604. Optional Inter Partes Reexamination Procedure\n       Section 4604 amends Part III of title 35 by inserting a new \n     Chapter 31 setting forth optional inter partes reexamination \n     procedures.\n       New section 311, as amended by this section, differs from \n     section 302 of existing law in Chapter 30 of the Patent Act \n     by requiring any person filing a written request for inter \n     partes reexamination to identify the real party in interest.\n       Similar to section 303 of existing law, new section 312 of \n     the Patent Act confers upon the Director the authority and \n     responsibility to determine, within three months after the \n     filing of a request for inter partes reexamination, whether a \n     substantial new question affecting patentability of any claim \n     of the patent is raised by the request. Also, the decision in \n     this regard is final and not subject to judicial review.\n       Proposed sections 313-14 under this subtitle are similarly \n     modeled after sections 304-305 of Chapter 30. Under proposed \n     section 313, if the Director determines that a substantial \n     new question of patentability affecting a claim is raised, \n     the determination shall include an order for inter partes \n     reexamination for resolution of the question. The order may \n     be accompanied by the initial USPTO action on the merits of \n     the inter partes reexamination conducted in accordance with \n     section 314. Generally, under proposed section 314, inter \n     partes reexamination shall be conducted according to the \n     procedures set forth in sections 132-133 of the Patent Act. \n     The patent owner will be permitted to propose any amendment \n     to the patent and a new claim or claims, with the same \n     exception contained in section 305: no proposed amended or \n     new claim enlarging the scope of the claims will be allowed.\n       Proposed section 314 elaborates on procedure with regard to \n     third-party requesters who, for the first time, are given the \n     option to participate in inter partes reexamination \n     proceedings. With the exception of the inter partes \n     reexamination request, any document filed by either the \n     patent owner or the third-party requester shall be served on \n     the other party. In addition, the third party-requester in an \n     inter partes reexamination shall receive a copy of any \n     communication sent by the USPTO to the patent owner. After \n     each response by the patent owner to an action on the merits \n     by the USPTO, the third-party requester shall have one \n     opportunity to file written comments addressing issues raised \n     by the USPTO or raised in the patent owner's response. Unless \n     ordered by the Director for good cause, the agency must act \n     in an inter partes reexamination matter with special \n     dispatch.\n       Proposed section 315 prescribes the procedures for appeal \n     of an adverse USPTO decision by the patent owner and the \n     third-party requester in an inter partes reexamination. Both \n     the patent owner and the third-party requester are entitled \n     to appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences \n     (section 134 of the Patent Act), but only the patentee can \n     appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \n     (Sec. Sec. 141-144); either may also be a party to any appeal \n     by the other to the Board of Patent Appeals and \n     Interferences. The patentee is not entitled to the \n     alternative of an appeal of an inter partes reexamination to \n     the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Such \n     appeals are rarely taken from ex parte reexamination \n     proceedings under existing law and its removal should speed \n     up the process.\n       To deter unnecessary litigation, proposed section 315 \n     imposes constraints on the third-party requester. In general, \n     a third-party requester who is granted an inter partes \n     reexamination by the USPTO may not assert at a later time in \n     any civil action in U.S. district court \\18\\ the invalidity \n     of any claim finally determined to be patentable on any \n     ground that the third-party requester raised or could have \n     raised during the inter partes reexamination. However, the \n     third-party requester may assert invalidity based on newly \n     discovered prior art unavailable at the time of the \n     reexamination. Prior art was unavailable at the time of the \n     inter partes reexamination if it was not known to the \n     individuals who were involved in the reexamination proceeding \n     on behalf of the third-party requester and the USPTO.\n       Section 316 provides for the Director to issue and publish \n     certificates canceling unpatentable claims, confirming \n     patentable claims, and incorporating any amended or new claim \n     determined to be patentable in an inter partes procedure.\n       Subtitle F creates a new section 317 which sets forth \n     certain conditions by which inter partes reexamination is \n     prohibited to guard against harassment of a patent holder. In \n     general, once an order for inter partes reexamination has \n     been issued, neither a third-party requester nor the patent \n     owner may file a subsequent request for inter partes \n     reexamination until an inter partes reexamination certificate \n     is issued and published, unless authorized by the Director. \n     Further, if a third-party requester asserts patent invalidity \n     in a civil action and a final decision is entered that the \n     party failed to prove the assertion of invalidity, or if a \n     final decision in an inter partes reexamination instituted by \n     the requester is favorable to patentability, after any \n     appeals, that third-party requester cannot thereafter request \n     inter partes reexamination on the basis of issues which were \n     or which could have been raised. However, the third-party \n     requester may assert invalidity based on newly discovered \n     prior art unavailable at the time of the civil action or \n     inter partes reexamination. Prior art was unavailable at the \n     time if it was not known to the individuals who were involved \n     in the civil action or inter partes reexamination proceeding \n     on behalf of the third-party requester and the USPTO.\n       Proposed section 318 gives a patent owner the right, once \n     an inter partes reexamination has been ordered, to obtain a \n     stay of any pending litigation involving an issue of \n     patentability of any claims of the patent that are the \n     subject of the inter partes reexamination, unless the court \n     determines that the stay would not serve the interests of \n     justice.\n\n[[Page S14721]]\n\n     Sec. 4605. Conforming amendments\n       Section 4605 makes the following conforming amendments to \n     the Patent Act:\n       A patent owner must pay a fee of $1,210 for each petition \n     in connection with an unintentionally abandoned application, \n     delayed payment, or delayed response by the patent owner \n     during any reexamination.\n       A patent applicant, any of whose claims has been twice \n     rejected; a patent owner in a reexamination proceeding; and a \n     third-party requester in an inter partes reexamination \n     proceeding may all appeal final adverse decisions from a \n     primary examiner to the Board of Patent Appeals and \n     Interferences.\n       Proposed section 141 states that a patent owner in a \n     reexamination proceeding may appeal an adverse decision by \n     the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences only to the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as earlier \n     noted. A third-party requester in an inter partes \n     reexamination proceeding may not appeal beyond the Board of \n     Patent Appeals and Interferences.\n       The Director is required pursuant to section 143 \n     (proceedings on appeal to the Federal Circuit) to submit to \n     the court the grounds for the USPTO decision in any \n     reexamination addressing all the issues involved in the \n     appeal.\n     Sec. 4606. Report to Congress\n       Not later than five years after the effective date of \n     subtitle F, the Director must submit to Congress a report \n     evaluating whether the inter partes reexamination proceedings \n     set forth in the title are inequitable to any of the parties \n     in interest and, if so, the report shall contain \n     recommendations for change to eliminate the inequity.\n     Sec. 4607. Estoppel Effect of Reexamination\n       Section 4607 estops any party who requests inter partes \n     reexamination from challenging at a later time, in any civil \n     action, any fact determined during the process of the inter \n     partes reexamination, except with respect to a fact \n     determination later proved to be erroneous based on \n     information unavailable at the time of the inter partes \n     reexamination. The estoppel arises after a final decision in \n     the inter partes reexamination or a final decision in any \n     appeal of such reexamination. If section 4607 is held to be \n     unenforceable, the enforceability of the rest of subtitle F \n     or the Act is not affected.\n     Sec. 4608. Effective date\n       Subtitle F shall take effect on the date of the enactment \n     and shall apply to any patent that issues from an original \n     application filed in the United States on or after that date, \n     except that the amendments made by section 4605(a) shall take \n     effect one year from the date of enactment.\n\n         Subtitle G--United States Patent and Trademark Office\n\n       Subtitle G establishes the United States Patent and \n     Trademark Office (USPTO) as an agency of the United States \n     within the Department of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce \n     gives policy direction to the agency, but the agency is \n     autonomous and responsible for the management and \n     administration of its operations and has independent control \n     of budget allocations and expenditures, personnel decisions \n     and processes, and procurement. The Committee intends that \n     the Office will conduct its patent and trademark operations \n     without micro-management by Department of Commerce officials, \n     with the exception of policy guidance of the Secretary. The \n     agency is headed by an Under Secretary of Commerce for \n     Intellectual Property and Director of the United States \n     Patent and Trademark Office, a Deputy, and a Commissioner of \n     Patents and a Commissioner of Trademarks. The agency is \n     exempt from government-wide personnel ceilings. A patent \n     public advisory committee and a trademark public advisory \n     committee are established to advise the Director on agency \n     policies, goals, performance, budget and user fees.\n     Sec. 4701. Short title\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Patent and Trademark \n     Office Efficiency Act.''\n\n        Subchapter A--United States Patent and Trademark Office\n\n     Sec. 4711. Establishment of Patent and Trademark Office\n       Section 4711 establishes the USPTO as an agency of the \n     United States within the Department of Commerce and under the \n     policy direction of the Secretary of Commerce. The USPTO, as \n     an autonomous agency, is explicitly responsible for decisions \n     regarding the management and administration of its operations \n     and has independent control of budget allocations and \n     expenditures, personnel decisions and processes, \n     procurements, and other administrative and management \n     functions. Patent operations and trademark operations are to \n     be treated as separate operating units within the Office, \n     each under the direction of its respective Commissioner, as \n     supervised by the Director.\n       The USPTO shall maintain its principal office in the \n     metropolitan Washington, D.C., area, for the service of \n     process and papers and for the purpose of discharging its \n     functions. For purposes of venue in civil actions, the agency \n     is deemed to be a resident of the district in which its \n     principal office is located, except where otherwise provided \n     by law. The USPTO is also permitted to establish satellite \n     offices in such other places in the United States as it \n     considers necessary and appropriate to conduct business. This \n     is intended to allow the USPTO, if appropriate, to serve \n     American applicants better.\n     Sec. 4712. Powers and duties\n       Subject to the policy direction of the Secretary of the \n     Commerce, in general the USPTO will be responsible for the \n     granting and issuing of patents, the registration of \n     trademarks, and the dissemination of patent and trademark \n     information to the public.\n       The USPTO will also possess specific powers, which include:\n       (1) a requirement to adopt and use an Office seal for \n     judicial notice purposes and for authenticating patents, \n     trademark certificates and papers issued by the Office;\n       (2) the authority to establish regulations, not \n     inconsistent with law, that\n       (A) govern the conduct of USPTO proceedings within the \n     Office,\n       (B) are in accordance with Sec. 553 of title 5,\n       (C) facilitate and expedite the processing of patent \n     applications, particularly those which can be processed \n     electronically,\n       (D) govern the recognition, conduct, and qualifications of \n     agents, attorneys, or other persons representing applicants \n     or others before the USPTO,\n       (E) recognize the public interest in ensuring that the \n     patent system retain a reduced fee structure for small \n     entities, and\n       (F) provide for the development of a performance-based \n     process for managing that includes quantitative and \n     qualitative measures, standards for evaluating cost-\n     effectiveness, and consistency with principles of \n     impartiality and competitiveness;\n       (3) the authority to acquire, construct, purchase, lease, \n     hold, manage, operate, improve, alter and renovate any real, \n     personal, or mixed property as it considers necessary to \n     discharge its functions;\n       (4) the authority to make purchases of property, contracts \n     for construction, maintenance, or management and operation of \n     facilities, as well as to contract for and purchase printing \n     services without regard to those federal laws which govern \n     such proceedings;\n       (5) the authority to use services, equipment, personnel, \n     facilities and equipment of other federal entities, with \n     their consent and on a reimbursable basis;\n       (6) the authority to use, with the consent of the United \n     States and the agency, government, or international \n     organization concerned, the services, records, facilities or \n     personnel of any State or local government agency or foreign \n     patent or trademark office or international organization to \n     perform functions on its behalf;\n       (7) the authority to retain and use all of its revenues and \n     receipts;\n       (8) a requirement to advise the President, through the \n     Secretary of Commerce, on national and certain international \n     intellectual property policy issues;\n       (9) a requirement to advise Federal departments and \n     agencies of intellectual property policy in the United States \n     and intellectual property protection abroad;\n       (10) a requirement to provide guidance regarding proposals \n     offered by agencies to assist foreign governments and \n     international intergovernmental organizations on matters of \n     intellectual property protection;\n       (11) the authority to conduct programs, studies or \n     exchanges regarding domestic or international intellectual \n     property law and the effectiveness of intellectual property \n     protection domestically and abroad;\n       (12) a requirement to advise the Secretary of Commerce on \n     any programs and studies relating to intellectual property \n     policy that the USPTO may conduct or is authorized to \n     conduct, cooperatively with foreign intellectual property \n     offices and international intergovernmental organizations; \n     and\n       (13) the authority to (A) coordinate with the Department of \n     State in conducting programs and studies cooperatively with \n     foreign intellectual property offices and international \n     intergovernmental organizations, and (B) transfer, with the \n     concurrence of the Secretary of State, up to $100,000 in any \n     year to the Department of State to pay an international \n     intergovernmental organization for studies and programs \n     advancing international cooperation concerning patents, \n     trademarks, and other matters.\n       The specific powers set forth in new subsection (b) are \n     clarified in new subsection (c). The special payments of \n     paragraph (14)(B) are additional to other payments or \n     contributions and are not subject to any limitation imposed \n     by law. Nothing in subsection (b) derogates from the duties \n     of the Secretary of State or the United States Trade \n     Representative as set forth in section 141 of the Trade Act \n     of 1974 \\19\\, nor derogates from the duties and functions of \n     the Register of Copyrights. The Director is required to \n     consult with the Administrator of General Services when \n     exercising authority under paragraphs (3) and (4)(A). Nothing \n     in section 4712 may be construed to nullify, void, cancel, or \n     interrupt any pending request-for-proposal let or contract \n     issued by the General Services Administration for the \n     specific purpose of relocating or leasing space to the USPTO. \n     Finally, in exercising the powers and duties under this \n     section, the Director shall consult with the Register of \n     Copyright on all Copyright and related matters.\n     Sec. 4713. Organization and management\n       Section 4713 details the organization and management of the \n     agency. The powers and duties of the USPTO shall be vested in \n     the Under Secretary and Director, who shall be appointed by \n     the President, by and with the consent of the Senate. The \n     Under Secretary and Director performs two main functions. As \n     Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property, she \n     serves as the policy advisor to the Secretary of Commerce and \n     the\n\n[[Page S14722]]\n\n     President on intellectual property issues. As Director, she \n     is responsible for supervising the management and direction \n     of the USPTO. She shall consult with the Public Advisory \n     Committees, infra, on a regular basis regarding operations of \n     the agency and before submitting budgetary proposals and fee \n     or regulation changes. The Director shall take an oath of \n     office. The President may remove the Director from office, \n     but must provide notification to both houses of Congress.\n       The Secretary of Commerce, upon nomination of the Director, \n     shall appoint a Deputy Director to act in the capacity of the \n     Director if the Director is absent or incapacitated. The \n     Secretary of Commerce shall also appoint two Commissioners, \n     one for Patents, the other for Trademarks, without regard to \n     chapters 33, 51, or 53 of title 5 of the U.S. Code. The \n     Commissioners will have five-year terms and may be \n     reappointed to new terms by the Secretary. Each Commissioner \n     shall possess a demonstrated experience in patent and \n     trademark law, respectively; and they shall be responsible \n     for the management and direction of the patent and trademark \n     operations, respectively. In addition to receiving a basic \n     rate of compensation under the Senior Executive Service \\20\\ \n     and a locality payment,\\21\\ the Commissioners may receive \n     bonuses of up to 50 percent of their annual basic rate of \n     compensation, not to exceed the salary of the Vice President, \n     based on a performance evaluation by the Secretary, acting \n     through the Director. The Secretary may remove Commissioners \n     for misconduct or unsatisfactory performance. It is intended \n     that the Commissioners will be non-political expert \n     appointees, independently responsible for operations, subject \n     to supervision by the Director.\n       The Director may appoint all other officers, agents, and \n     employees as she sees fit, and define their responsibilities \n     with equal discretion. The USPTO is specifically not subject \n     to any administratively or statutorily imposed limits (full-\n     time equivalents, or ``FTEs'') on positions or personnel.\n       The USPTO is charged with developing and submitting to \n     Congress a proposal for an incentive program to retain senior \n     (of the primary examiner grade or higher) patent and \n     trademark examiners eligible for retirement for the sole \n     purpose of training patent and trademark examiners.\n       The Director of the USPTO, in consultation with the \n     Director of the Office of Personnel Management, is required \n     to maintain a program for identifying national security \n     positions at the USPTO and for providing for appropriate \n     security clearances for USPTO employees in order to maintain \n     the secrecy of inventions as described in section 181 of the \n     Patent Act and to prevent disclosure of sensitive and \n     strategic information in the interest of national security.\n       The USPTO will be subject to all provisions of title 5 of \n     the U.S. Code governing federal employees. All relevant labor \n     agreements which are in effect the day before enactment of \n     subtitle G shall be adopted by the agency. All USPTO \n     employees as of the day before the effective date of subtitle \n     G shall remain officers and employees of the agency without a \n     break in service. Other personnel of the Department of \n     Commerce shall be transferred to the USPTO only if necessary \n     to carry out purposes of subtitle G of the bill and if a \n     major function of their work is reimbursed by the USPTO, they \n     spend at least half of their work time in support of the \n     USPTO, or a transfer to the USPTO would be in the interest of \n     the agency, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce in \n     consultation with the Director.\n       On or after the effective date of the Act, the President \n     shall appoint an individual to serve as Director until a \n     Director qualifies under subsection (a). The persons serving \n     as the Assistant Commissioner for Patents and the Assistant \n     Commissioner for Trademarks on the day before the effective \n     date of the Act may serve as the Commissioner for Patents and \n     the Commissioner for Trademarks, respectively, until a \n     respective Commissioner is appointed under subsection (b)(2).\n     Sec. 4714. Public Advisory Committees\n       Section 4714 provides a new section 5 of the Patent Act \n     which establishes a Patent Public Advisory Committee and a \n     Trademark Public Advisory Committee. Each Committee has nine \n     voting members with three-year terms appointed by and serving \n     at the pleasure of the Secretary of Commerce. Initial \n     appointments will be made within three months of the \n     effective date of the Act; and three of the initial \n     appointees will receive one-year terms, three will receive \n     two-year terms, and three will receive full terms. Vacancies \n     will be filled within three months. The Secretary will also \n     designate chairpersons for three-year terms.\n       The members of the Committees will be U.S. citizens and \n     will be chosen to represent the interests of USPTO users. The \n     Patent Public Advisory Committee shall have members who \n     represent small and large entity applicants in the United \n     States in proportion to the number of applications filed by \n     the small and large entity applicants. In no case shall the \n     small entity applicants be represented by less than 25 \n     percent of the members of the Patent Public Advisory \n     Committee, at least one of whom shall be an independent \n     inventor. The members of both Committees shall include \n     individuals with substantial background and achievement in \n     finance, management, labor relations, science, technology, \n     and office automation. The patent and trademark examiners' \n     unions are entitled to have one representative on their \n     respective Advisory Committee in a non-voting capacity.\n       The Committees meet at the call of the chair to consider an \n     agenda established by the chair. Each Committee reviews the \n     policies, goals, performance, budget, and user fees that bear \n     on its area of concern and advises the Director on these \n     matters. Within 60 days of the end of a fiscal year, the \n     Committees prepare annual reports, transmit the reports to \n     the Secretary of Commerce, the President, and the Committees \n     on the Judiciary of the Congress, and publish the reports in \n     the Official Gazette of the USPTO.\n       Members of the Committees are compensated at a defined \n     daily rate for meeting and travel days. Members are provided \n     access to USPTO records and information other than personnel \n     or other privileged information including that concerning \n     patent applications. Members are special Government employees \n     within the meaning of section 202 of title 18. The Federal \n     Advisory Committee Act shall not apply to the Committees. \n     Finally, section 4714 provides that Committee meetings shall \n     be open to the public unless by a majority vote the Committee \n     meets in executive session to consider personnel or other \n     confidential information.\n     Sec. 4715. Conforming amendments\n       Technical conforming amendments to the Patent Act are set \n     forth in section 4715.\n     Sec. 4716. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board\n       Section 4716 amends section 17 of the Trademark Act of 1946 \n     by specifying that the Director shall give notice to all \n     affected parties and shall direct a Trademark Trial and \n     Appeal Board to determine the respective rights of those \n     parties before it in a relevant proceeding. The section also \n     invests the Director with the power of appointing \n     administrative trademark judges to the Board. The Director, \n     the Commissioner for Trademarks, the Commissioner for \n     Patents, and the administrative trademark judges shall serve \n     on the Board.\n     Sec. 4717. Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences\n       Under existing section 7 of the Patent Act, the \n     Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioners, \n     and the examiners-in-chief constitute the Board of Patent \n     Appeals and Interferences. Pursuant to section 4717 of \n     subtitle G, the Board shall be comprised of the Director, the \n     Commissioner for Patents, the Commissioner for Trademarks, \n     and the administrative patent judges. In addition, the \n     existing statute allows each appellant a hearing before three \n     members of the Board who are designated by the Director. \n     Section 4717 empowers the Director with this authority.\n     Sec. 4718. Annual report of Director\n       No later than 180 days after the end of each fiscal year, \n     the Director must provide a report to Congress detailing \n     funds received and expended by the USPTO, the purposes for \n     which the funds were spent, the quality and quantity of USPTO \n     work, the nature of training provided to examiners, the \n     evaluations of the Commissioners by the Secretary of \n     Commerce, the Commissioners' compensation, and other \n     information relating to the agency.\n     Sec. 4719. Suspension or exclusion from practice\n       Under existing section 32 of the Patent Act, the \n     Commissioner (the Director pursuant to this Act) has the \n     authority, after notice and a hearing, to suspend or exclude \n     from further practice before the USPTO any person who is \n     incompetent, disreputable, indulges in gross misconduct or \n     fraud, or is noncompliant with USPTO regulations. Section \n     4719 permits the Director to designate an attorney who is an \n     officer or employee of the USPTO to conduct a hearing under \n     section 32.\n     Sec. 4720. Pay of Director and Deputy Director\n       Section 4720 replaces the Assistant Secretary of Commerce \n     and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks with the Under \n     Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director \n     of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to receive \n     pay at Level III of the Executive Schedule.\\22\\ Section 4720 \n     also establishes the pay of the Deputy Director at Level IV \n     of the Executive Schedule.\\23\\\n\n           Subchapter B--Effective Date; Technical Amendments\n\n     Sec. 4731. Effective date\n       The effective date of subtitle G is four months after the \n     date of enactment.\n     Sec. 4732. Technical and conforming amendments\n       Section 4732 sets forth numerous technical and conforming \n     amendments related to subtitle G.\n\n                 Subchapter C--Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n     Sec. 4741. References\n       Section 4741 clarifies that any reference to the transfer \n     of a function from a department or office to the head of such \n     department or office means the head of such department or \n     office to which the function is transferred. In addition, \n     references in other federal materials to the current \n     Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks refer, upon enactment, \n     to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property \n     and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark \n     Office. Similarly, references to the Assistant Commissioner \n     for Patents are deemed to refer to the Commissioner for \n     Patents and references to the Assistant Commissioner for \n     Trademarks are deemed to refer to the Commissioner for \n     Trademarks.\n\n[[Page S14723]]\n\n     Sec. 4742. Exercise of authorities\n       Under section 4742, except as otherwise provided by law, a \n     federal official to whom a function is transferred pursuant \n     to subtitle G may exercise all authorities under any other \n     provision of law that were available regarding the \n     performance of that function to the official empowered to \n     perform that function immediately before the date of the \n     transfer of the function.\n     Sec. 4743. Savings provisions\n       Relevant legal documents that relate to a function which is \n     transferred by subtitle G, and which are in effect on the \n     date of such transfer, shall continue in effect according to \n     their terms unless later modified or repealed in an \n     appropriate manner. Applications or proceedings concerning \n     any benefit, service, or license pending on the effective \n     date of subtitle G before an office transferred shall not be \n     affected, and shall continue thereafter, but may later be \n     modified or repealed in the appropriate manner.\n       Subtitle G will not affect suits commenced before the \n     effective date of passage. Suits or actions by or against the \n     Department of Commerce, its employees, or the Secretary shall \n     not abate by reason of enactment of subtitle G. Suits against \n     a relevant government officer in her official capacity shall \n     continue post enactment, and if a function has transferred to \n     another officer by virtue of enactment, that other officer \n     shall substitute as the defendant. Finally, administrative \n     and judicial review procedures that apply to a function \n     transferred shall apply to the head of the relevant federal \n     agency and other officers to which the function is \n     transferred.\n     Sec. 4744. Transfer of assets\n       Section 4744 states that all available personnel, property, \n     records, and funds related to a function transferred pursuant \n     to subtitle G shall be made available to the relevant \n     official or head of the agency to which the function \n     transfers at such time or times as the Director of the Office \n     of Management and Budget (OMB) directs.\n     Sec. 4745. Delegation and assignment\n       Section 4745 allows an official to whom a function is \n     transferred under subtitle G to delegate that function to \n     another officer or employee. The official to whom the \n     function was originally transferred nonetheless remains \n     responsible for the administration of the function.\n     Sec. 4746. Authority of Director of the Office of Management \n         and Budget with respect to functions transferred\n       Pursuant to section 4746, if necessary the Director of OMB \n     shall make any determination of the functions transferred \n     pursuant to subtitle G.\n     Sec. 4747. Certain vesting of functions considered transfers\n       Section 4747 states that the vesting of a function in a \n     department or office pursuant to reestablishment of an office \n     shall be considered to be the transfer of that function.\n     Sec. 4748. Availability of existing funds\n       Under section 4748, existing appropriations and funds \n     available for the performance of functions and other \n     activities terminated pursuant to subtitle G shall remain \n     available (for the duration of their period of availability) \n     for necessary expenses in connection with the termination and \n     resolution of such functions and activities, subject to the \n     submission of a plan to House and Senate appropriators in \n     accordance with Public Law 105-277 (Departments of Commerce, \n     Justice, and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 1999).\n     Sec. 4749. Definitions\n       ``Function'' includes any duty, obligation, power, \n     authority, responsibility, right, privilege, activity, or \n     program.\n       ``Office'' includes any office, administration, agency, \n     bureau, institute, council, unit, organizational entity, or \n     component thereof.\n\n              Subtitle H--Miscellaneous Patent Provisions\n\n       Subtitle H consists of seven largely-unrelated provisions \n     that make needed clarifying and technical changes to the \n     Patent Act . Subtitle H also authorizes a study. The \n     provisions in Subtitle H take effect on the date of enactment \n     except where stated otherwise in certain sections.\n     Sec. 4801. Provisional applications\n       Section 4801 amends section 111(b)(5) of the Patent Act by \n     permitting a provisional application to be converted into a \n     non-provisional application. The applicant must make a \n     request within 12 months after the filing date of the \n     provisional application for it to be converted into a non-\n     provisional application.\n       Section 4801 also amends section 119(e) of the Patent Act \n     by clarifying the treatment of a provisional application when \n     its last day of pendency falls on a weekend or a Federal \n     holiday, and by eliminating the requirement that a \n     provisional application must be co-pending with a non-\n     provisional application if the provisional application is to \n     be relied on in any USPTO proceeding.\n     Sec. 4802. International applications\n       Section 4802 amends section 119(a) of the Patent Act to \n     permit persons who filed an application for patent first in a \n     WTO \\24\\ member country to claim the right of priority in a \n     subsequent patent application filed in the United States, \n     even if such country does not yet afford similar privileges \n     on the basis of applications filed in the United States. This \n     amendment was made in conformity with the requirements of \n     Articles 1 and 2 of the TRIPS Agreement.\\25\\ These Articles \n     require that WTO member countries apply the substantive \n     provisions of the Paris Convention for the Protection of \n     Industrial Property to other WTO member countries. As some \n     WTO member countries are not yet members of the Paris \n     Convention, and as developing countries are generally \n     permitted periods of up to 5 years before complying with all \n     provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, they are not required to \n     extend the right of priority to other WTO member countries \n     until such time.\n       Section 4802 also adds subsection (f) to section 119 of the \n     Patent Act to provide for the right of priority in the United \n     States on the basis of an application for a plant breeder's \n     right first filed in a WTO member country or in a UPOV\\26\\ \n     Contracting Party. Many foreign countries provide only a sui \n     generis system of protection for plant varieties. Because \n     section 119 presently addresses only patents and inventors' \n     certificates, applicants from those countries are technically \n     unable to base a priority claim on a foreign application for \n     a plant breeder's right when seeking plant patent or utility \n     patent protection for a plant variety in this country.\n       Subsection (g) is added to section 119 to define the terms \n     ``WTO member country'' and ``UPOV Contracting Party.''\n     Sec. 4803. Certain limitations on remedies for patent \n         infringement not applicable\n       Section 4803 amends section 287(c)(4) of the Patent Act, \n     which pertains to certain limitations on remedies for patent \n     infringement, to make it applicable only to applications \n     filed on or after September 30, 1996.\n     Sec. 4804. Electronic filing and publications\n       Section 4804 amends section 22 of the Patent Act to clarify \n     that the USPTO may receive, disseminate, and maintain \n     information in electronic form. Subsection (d)(2), however, \n     prohibits the Director from ceasing to maintain paper or \n     microform collections of U.S. patents, foreign patent \n     documents, and U.S. trademark registrations, except pursuant \n     to notice and opportunity for public comment and except the \n     Director shall first submit a report to Congress detailing \n     any such plan, including a description of the mechanisms in \n     place to ensure the integrity of such collections and the \n     data contained therein, as well as to ensure prompt public \n     access to the most current available information, and \n     certifying that the implementation of such plan will not \n     negatively impact the public.\n       In addition, in the operation of its information \n     dissemination programs and as the sole source of patent data, \n     the USPTO should implement procedures that assure that bulk \n     patent data are provided in such a manner that subscribers \n     have the data in a manner that grants a sufficient amount of \n     time for such subscribers to make the data available through \n     their own systems at the same time the USPTO makes the data \n     publicly available through its own Internet system.\n     Sec. 4805. Study and report on biologic deposits in support \n         of biotechnology patents\n       Section 4805 charges the Comptroller General, in \n     consultation with the Director of the USPTO, with conducting \n     a study and submitting a report to Congress no later than six \n     months after the date of enactment on the potential risks to \n     the U.S. biotechnological industry regarding biological \n     deposits in support of biotechnology patents. The study shall \n     include: an examination of the risk of export and of \n     transfers to third parties of biological deposits, and the \n     risks posed by the 18-month publication requirement of \n     subtitle E; an analysis of comparative legal and regulatory \n     regimes; and any related recommendations. The USPTO is then \n     charged with considering these recommendations when drafting \n     regulations affecting biological deposits.\n     Sec. 4806. Prior invention\n       Section 4806 amends section 102(g) of the Patent Act to \n     make clear that an inventor who is involved in a USPTO \n     interference proceeding and establishes a date of invention \n     under section 104 is subject to the requirements of section \n     102(g), including the requirement that the invention was not \n     abandoned, suppressed, or concealed.\n     Sec. 4807. Prior art exclusion for certain commonly assigned \n         patents\n       Section 4807 amends section 103 of the Patent Act, which \n     sets forth patentability conditions related to the \n     nonobviousness of subject matter. Section 103(c) of the \n     current statute states that subject matter developed by \n     another person which qualifies as prior art only under \n     section 102(f) or (g) shall not preclude granting a patent on \n     an invention with only obvious differences where the subject \n     matter and claimed invention were, at the time the invention \n     was made, owned by the same person or subject to an \n     obligation of assignment to the same person. The bill amends \n     section 103(c) by adding a reference to section 102(e), which \n     currently bars the granting of a patent if the invention was \n     described in another patent granted on an application filed \n     before the applicant's date of invention. The effect of the \n     amendment is to allow an applicant to receive a patent when \n     an invention with only obvious differences from the \n     applicant's invention was described in a patent granted on an \n     application filed before the applicant's invention, provided \n     the inventions are commonly owned or subject to an obligation \n     of assignment to the same person.\n\n[[Page S14724]]\n\n     Sec. 4808. Exchange of copies of patents with foreign \n         countries\n       Sec. 4808 amends section 12 of the Patent Act to prohibit \n     the Director of the USPTO from entering into an agreement to \n     exchange patent data with a foreign country that is not one \n     of our NAFTA \\27\\ or WTO trading partners, unless the \n     Secretary of Commerce explicitly authorizes such an exchange.\n\n                   TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     Section 5001. Commission on Online Child Protection.\n       Section 5001(a) provides that references contained in the \n     amendments made by this title are to section 1405 of the \n     Child Online Protection Act (47 U.S.C. 231 note).\n       Section 5001(b) amends the membership of the Commission on \n     Online Child Protection to remove a requirement that a \n     specific number of representatives come from designated \n     sectors of private industry, as outlined in the Act. Section \n     5001(b) also provides that the members appointed to the \n     Commission as of October 31, 1999, shall remain as members. \n     Section 5001(b) also prevents the members of the Commission \n     from being paid for their work on the Commission. This \n     provision, however, does not preclude members from being \n     reimbursed for legitimate costs associated with participating \n     in the Commission (such as travel expenses).\n       Section 5001(c) extends the due date for the report of the \n     Commission by one year.\n       Section 5001(d) establishes that the Commission's statutory \n     authority will expire either (1) 30 days after the submission \n     of the report required by the Act, or (2) November 30, 2000, \n     whichever is earlier.\n       Section 5001(e) requires the Commission to commence its \n     first meeting no later than March 31, 2000. Section 5001(e) \n     also requires that the Commission elect, by a majority vote, \n     a chairperson of the Commission not later than 30 days after \n     holding its first meeting.\n       Section 5001(f) establishes minimum rules for the \n     operations of the Commission, and also allows the Commission \n     to adopt other rules as it deems necessary.\n     Section 5002. Privacy Protection for Donors to Public \n         Broadcasting Entities.\n       This provision, which was added in Conference, protects the \n     privacy of donors to public broadcasting entities.\n     Section 5003. Completion of Biennial Regulatory Review.\n       Section 5003 provides that, within 180 days after the date \n     of enactment, the FCC will complete the biennial review \n     required by section 202(h) of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996. The Conferees expect that if the Commission concludes \n     that it should retain any of the rules under the review \n     unchanged, the Commission shall issue a report that includes \n     a full justification of the basis for so finding.\n     Section 5004. Broadcasting Entities.\n       This provision, added in Conference, allows for a \n     remittance of copyright damages for public broadcasting \n     entities where they are not aware and have no reason to \n     believe that their activities constituted violations of \n     copyright law. This is currently the standard for nonprofit \n     libraries, archives and educational institutions.\n     Section 5005. Technical Amendments Relating to Vessel Hull \n         Design Protection.\n       This section makes several amendments to chapter 13 of the \n     Copyright Act regarding design protection for vessel hulls. \n     The sunset provision for chapter 13, enacted as part of the \n     Digital Millennium Copyright Act, is removed so that chapter \n     13 is now a permanent provision of the Copyright Act. The \n     timing and number of joint studies to be done by the \n     Copyright Office and the Patent and Trademark Offices of the \n     effectiveness of chapter 13 are also amended by reducing the \n     number of studies from two to one, and requiring that the one \n     study not be submitted until November 1, 2003. Current law \n     requires delivery of two studies within the first two years \n     of chapter 13, which is unnecessary and an insufficient \n     amount of time for the Copyright Office and the Patent and \n     Trademark Office to accurately measure and assess the \n     effectiveness of design protection within the marine \n     industry.\n       The definition of a ``vessel'' in chapter 13 is amended to \n     provide that in addition to being able to navigate on or \n     through water, a vessel must be self-propelled and able to \n     steer, and must be designed to carry at least one passenger. \n     This clarifies Congress's intent not to allow design \n     protection for such craft as barges, toy and remote \n     controlled boas, inner tubes and surf boards.\n     Section 5006. Informal Rulemaking of Copyright Determination.\n       The Copyright Office has requested that Congress make a \n     technical correction to section 1201(a)(1)(C) of title 17 by \n     deleting the phrase ``on the record.'' The Copyright Office \n     believes that this correction is necessary to avoid any \n     misunderstanding regarding the intent of Congress that the \n     rulemaking proceeding which is the be conducted by the \n     Copyright Office under this provision shall be an informal, \n     rather than a formal, rulemaking proceeding. Accordingly, the \n     phrase ``on the record'' is deleted as a technical correction \n     to clarify the intent of Congress that the Copyright Office \n     shall conduct the rulemaking under section 1201(a)(1)(C) as \n     an informal rulemaking proceeding pursuant to section 553 of \n     Title 5. The intent is to permit interested persons an \n     opportunity to participate through the submission of written \n     statements, oral presentations at one or more of the public \n     hearings, and the submission of written responses to the \n     submissions or presentations of others.\n     Section 5007. Service of Process for Surety Corporations\n       This section allows surety corporations, like other \n     corporations, to utilize approved state officials to receive \n     service of process in any legal proceeding as an alternative \n     to having a separate agent for service of process in each of \n     the 94 federal judicial districts.\n     Section 5008. Low-Power Television.\n       Section 5008, which can be cited as the Community \n     Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, will ensure that many \n     communities across the nation will continue to have access to \n     free, over-the-air low-power television (LPTV) stations, even \n     as full-service television stations proceed with their \n     conversion to digital format. In particular, Section 5008 \n     requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \n     provide certain qualifying LPTV stations with ``primary'' \n     regulatory status, which in turn will enable these LPTV \n     stations to attract the financing that is necessary to \n     provide consumers with critical information and programming. \n     At the same time, recognizing the importance of, and the \n     engineering complexity in, the FCC's plan to convert full-\n     service television stations to digital format, Section 5009 \n     protects the ability of these stations to provide both \n     digital and analog service throughout their existing service \n     areas.\n       The FCC began awarding licenses for low-power television \n     service in 1982. Low-power television service is a relatively \n     inexpensive and flexible means of delivering programming \n     tailored to the interests of viewers in small localized \n     areas. It also ensures that spectrum allocated for broadcast \n     television service is more efficiently used and promotes \n     opportunities for entering the television broadcast business.\n       The FCC estimates that there are more than 2,000 licensed \n     and operational LPTV stations, about 1,500 of which are \n     operated in the continental United States by 700 different \n     licensees in nearly 750 towns and cities.\\28\\ LPTV stations \n     serve rural and urban communities alike, although about two-\n     thirds of all LPTV stations serve rural communities. LPTV \n     stations in urban markets typically provide niche programming \n     (e.g., bilingual or non-English programming) to under-served \n     communities in large cities. In many rural markets, LPTV \n     stations are consumers' only source of local, over-the-air \n     programming. Owners of LPTV stations are diverse, including \n     high school and college student populations, churches and \n     religious groups, local governments, large and small \n     businesses, and even individual citizens.\n       From an engineering standpoint, the term ``low-power \n     television service'' means precisely what it implies, i.e., \n     broadcast television service that operates at a lower level \n     of power than full-service stations. Specifically, LPTV \n     stations radiate 3 kilowatts of power for stations operating \n     on the VHF band (i.e., channels 2 through 13), and 150 \n     kilowatts of power for stations operating on the UHF band \n     (i.e., channels 14 through 69). By comparison, full-service \n     stations on VHF channels radiate up to 316 kilowatts of \n     power, and stations on UHF channels radiate up to 5,000 \n     kilowatts of power. The reduced power levels that govern LPTV \n     stations mean these stations serve a much smaller geographic \n     region than do full-service stations. LPTV signals typically \n     extend to a range of approximately 12 to 15 miles, whereas \n     the originating signal of full-service stations often reach \n     households 60 or 80 miles away.\n       Compared to its rules for full-service television station \n     licensees, the FCC's rules for obtaining and operating an \n     LPTV license are minimal. But in return for ease of \n     licensing, LPTV stations must operate not only at reduced \n     power levels but also as ``secondary'' licensees. This means \n     LPTV stations are strictly prohibited from interfering with, \n     and must accept signal interference from, ``primary'' \n     licensees, such as full-service television stations. \n     Moreover, LPTV stations must yield at any point in time to \n     full-service stations that increase their power levels, as \n     well as to new full-service stations.\n       The video programming marketplace is intensely competitive. \n     The three largest broadcast networks that once dominated the \n     market now face competition from several emerging broadcast \n     and cable networks, cable systems, satellite television \n     operators, wireless cable, and even the Internet. Low-power \n     television plays a valuable, albeit modest, role in this \n     market because it is capable of providing locally-originated \n     programming to rural and urban communities that have either \n     no access to local programming, or an over-abundance of \n     national programming.\n       Low-power television's future, however, is uncertain. To \n     begin with, LPTV's secondary regulatory status means a \n     licensee can be summarily displaced by a full-service station \n     that seeks to expand its own service area, or by a new full-\n     service station seeking to enter the same market. This cloud \n     of regulatory uncertainty necessarily affects the ability of \n     LPTV stations to raise capital over the long-term, \n     irrespective of an LPTV station's popularity among consumers.\n       The FCC's plan to convert full-service stations to digital \n     substantially complicates LPTV stations' already uncertain \n     future. In its digital television (DTV) proceeding, the FCC \n     adopted a table of allotments for DTV service that provided a \n     second channel for\n\n[[Page S14725]]\n\n     each existing full-service station to use for DTV service in \n     making the transition from the existing analog technology to \n     the new DTV technology. These second channels were provided \n     to broadcasters on a temporary basis. At the end of the DTV \n     transition, which is currently scheduled for December 31, \n     2006, they must relinquish one of their two channels.\n       In assigning DTV channels, the FCC maintained the secondary \n     status of LPTV stations (as well as translators). In order to \n     provide all full-service television stations with a second \n     channel, the FCC was compelled to establish DTV allotments \n     that will displace a number of LPTV stations, particularly in \n     the larger urban market areas where the available spectrum is \n     most congested.\n       The FCC's plan also provides for the recovery of a portion \n     of the existing broadcast television spectrum so that it can \n     be reallocated to new uses. Specifically, the FCC provided \n     for immediate recovery of broadcast channels 60 through 69, \n     and for recovery of broadcast channels 52 through 59 at the \n     end of the DTV transition. As further required by Congress \n     under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,\\29\\ the FCC has \n     completed the reallocation of broadcast channels 60 through \n     69. Existing analog stations, including LPTV stations and a \n     few DTV stations, are permitted to operate on these channels \n     during the DTV transition. But at the end of the transition, \n     all analog broadcast TV stations will have to cease \n     operation, and the DTV stations on broadcast channels 52 \n     through 69 will be relocated to new channels in the DTV core \n     spectrum. As a result, the FCC estimates that the DTV \n     transition will require about 35 to 45 percent of all LPTV \n     stations to either change their operation or cease operation. \n     Indeed, some full-service stations have already ``bumped'' \n     several LPTV stations a number of times, at substantial cost \n     to the LPTV station, with no guarantee that the LPTV station \n     will be permitted to remain on its new channel in the long \n     term.\n       The conferees, therefore, seek to provide some regulatory \n     certainty for low-power television service. The conferees \n     recognize that, because of emerging DTV service, not all LPTV \n     stations can be guaranteed a certain future. Moreover, it is \n     not clear that all LPTV stations should be given such a \n     guarantee in light of the fact that many existing LPTV \n     stations provide little or no original programming service.\n       Instead, the conferees seek to buttress the commercial \n     viability of those LPTV stations which can demonstrate that \n     they provide valuable programming to their communities. The \n     House Committee on Commerce's record in considering this \n     legislation reflects that there are a significant number of \n     LPTV stations which broadcast programming--including locally \n     originated programming--for a substantial portion of each \n     day. From the consumers' perspective, these stations provide \n     video programming that is functionally equivalent to the \n     programming they view on full-service stations, as well as \n     national and local cable networks. Consequently, these \n     stations should be afforded roughly similar regulatory \n     status. Section 5008, the Community Broadcasters Protection \n     Act of 1999, will achieve that objective, and at the same \n     time, protect the transition to digital.\n       Section 5008(a) provides that the short title of this \n     section is the ``Community Broadcasters Protection Act of \n     1999.''\n       Section 5008(b) describes the Congress' findings on the \n     importance of low-power television service. The Congress \n     finds that LPTV stations have operated in a manner beneficial \n     to the public, and in many instances, provide worthwhile and \n     diverse services to communities that lack access to over-the-\n     air programming. The Congress also finds, however, that LPTV \n     stations' secondary regulatory status effectively blocks \n     access to capital.\n       Section 5008(c) amends section 336 of the Communications \n     Act of 1934 \\30\\ to require the FCC to create a new ``Class \n     A'' license for certain qualifying LPTV stations. New \n     paragraph (1)(A) in particular directs the FCC to prescribe \n     rules within 120 days of enactment for the establishment of a \n     new Class A television license that will be available to \n     qualifying LPTV stations. The FCC's rules must ensure that a \n     Class A licensee receives the same license terms and renewal \n     standards as any full-service licensee, and that each Class A \n     licensee is accorded primary regulatory status. Subparagraph \n     (B) further requires the FCC, within 30 days of enactment, to \n     send to each existing LPTV licensee a notice that describes \n     the requirements for Class A designation. Within 60 days of \n     enactment (or within 30 days of the FCC's notice), LPTV \n     stations intending to seek Class A designation must submit a \n     certification of eligibility to the FCC. Absent a material \n     deficiency in an LPTV station's certification materials, the \n     FCC is required under subparagraph (B) to grant a \n     certification of eligibility.\n       Subparagraph (C) permits an LPTV station, within 30 days of \n     the issuance of the rules required under subparagraph (A), to \n     submit an application for Class A designation. The FCC must \n     award a Class A license to a qualifying LPTV station within \n     30 days of receiving such application. Subparagraph (D) \n     mandates that the FCC must act to preserve the signal \n     contours of an LPTV station pending the final resolution of \n     its application for a Class A license. In the event technical \n     problems arise that require an engineering solution to a \n     full-service station's allotted parameters or channel \n     assignment in the DTV table of allotments, subparagraph (D) \n     requires the FCC to make the necessary modifications to \n     ensure that such full-service station can replicate or \n     maximize its service area, as provided for in the FCC's \n     rules.\n       With regard to maximization, a full-service digital \n     television station must file an application for maximization \n     or a notice of intent to seek such maximization by December \n     31, 1999, file a bona fide application for maximization by \n     May 1, 2000, and also comply with all applicable FCC rules \n     regarding the construction of digital television facilities. \n     The term ``maximization'' is defined in paragraph 31 of the \n     FCC's Sixth Report and Order as the process by which stations \n     increase their service areas by operating with additional \n     power or higher antennae than specified in the FCC's digital \n     television table of allotments. Subparagraph(E) requires that \n     a station must reduce the protected contour of its digital \n     television service area in accordance with any modifications \n     requested in future change applications. This provision is \n     intended to ensure that stations indeed utilize the full \n     amount of maximized spectrum for which they originally apply \n     by the aforementioned deadlines.\n       Paragraph (2) lists the criteria an LPTV station must meet \n     to qualify for a Class A license. Specifically, the LPTV \n     station must: during the 90 days preceding the date of \n     enactment, broadcast a minimum of 18 hours per day--including \n     at least 3 hours per week of locally-originated programming--\n     and also be in compliance with the FCC's rules on low-power \n     television service; and from and after the date of its \n     application for a Class A license, be in compliance with the \n     FCC's rules for full-service television stations. In the \n     alternative, the FCC may qualify an LPTV station as a Class A \n     licensee if it determines that such qualification would serve \n     the public interest, convenience, and necessity or for other \n     reasons determined by the FCC.\n       Paragraph (3) provides that no LPTV station authorized as \n     of the date of enactment may be disqualified for a Class A \n     license based on common ownership with any other medium of \n     mass communication.\n       Paragraph (4) makes clear that the FCC is not required to \n     issue Class A LPTV stations (or translators) an additional \n     license for advanced television services. The FCC, however, \n     must accept applications for such services, provided the \n     station will not cause interference to any other broadcast \n     facility applied for, protected, permitted or authorized on \n     the date of the filing of the application for advanced \n     television services. Either the new license for advanced \n     services or the original license must be forfeited at the end \n     of the DTV transition. The licensee may elect to convert to \n     advanced television services on its analog channel, but is \n     not required to convert to digital format until the end of \n     the DTV transition.\n       Paragraph (5) clarifies that nothing in new subsection \n     336(f) preempts, or otherwise affects, section 337 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934.\\31\\\n       Paragraph (6) precludes the FCC from granting Class A \n     licenses to LPTV stations operating between 698 megahertz \n     (MHz) and 806 MHz (i.e., television broadcast channels 52 \n     through 69). However, the FCC shall provide to LPTV stations \n     assigned to, and temporarily operating on, those channels the \n     opportunity to qualify for a Class A license. If a qualifying \n     LPTV station is ultimately assigned a channel within the band \n     of frequencies that will eventually comprise the ``core \n     spectrum'' (i.e., television broadcast channels 2 through \n     51), then the FCC is required to issue a Class A license \n     simultaneously. However, the FCC may not grant a Class A \n     license to an LPTV station operating on a channel within the \n     core spectrum that the FCC will identify within 180 days of \n     enactment.\n       Finally, paragraph (7) provides that the FCC may not grant \n     a Class A license (or a modification thereto) unless the \n     requesting LPTV station demonstrates that it will not \n     interfere with one of three types of radio-based services. \n     First, under subparagraph (A), the LPTV station must show \n     that it will not interfere with: (i) the predicted Grade B \n     contour of any station transmitting in analog format; or (ii) \n     the digital television service areas provided in the DTV \n     table of allotments; or the digital television areas \n     explicitly protected (as opposed to those areas that may be \n     permitted) in the Commission's digital television \n     regulations; or the digital television service areas of \n     stations subsequently granted by the FCC prior to the filing \n     of a Class A application; or lastly, stations seeking to \n     maximize power under the FCC's rules (provided such stations \n     are in compliance with the notification requirements under \n     paragraph (1)).\n       Second, under subparagraph (B), the LPTV station must show \n     that it will not interfere with any licensed, authorized or \n     pending LPTV station or translator. And third, under \n     subparagraph (C), the LPTV station must show that it will not \n     interfere with other services (e.g., land mobile services) \n     that also operate on television broadcast channels 14 through \n     20.\n       Finally, paragraph (8) establishes priority for those LPTVs \n     that are displaced by an application filed under this \n     section, in that these LPTVs have priority over other LPTVs \n     in the assignment of available channels.\n\n\n                               FOOTNOTES\n\n     \\1\\ See Rust v.

A bill to promote economically sound modernization of \nelectric power generation capacity in the United States, to establish \nrequirements to improve the combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil \nfuel-fired electric utility generating units, to reduce emissions of \nmercury, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, to \nrequire that all fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units \noperating in the United States meet new review requirements, to promote \nthe use of clean coal technologies, and to promote alternative energy \nand clean energy sources such as solar, wind, biomass, and fuel cells; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            clean power plant and modernization act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermonters have a proud tradition of \nprotecting our environment. We have some of the strongest environmental \nlaws in the country. Yet despite this proud tradition of environmental \nstewardship, we have seen how pollution from outside our state has \naffected our mountains, lakes and streams. Acid rain caused from sulfur \ndioxide emissions outside Vermont has drifted through the atmosphere \nand scarred our mountains and poisoned our streams. Mercury has quietly \nmade its deadly poisonous presence into the food chain of our fish to \nthe point where health advisories have been posted for the consumption \nof several species. And, despite our own tough air laws and small \npopulation, the EPA has considered air quality warnings in Vermont that \nare comparable to emissions consistent for much larger cities. Silently \neach night, pollution from outside Vermont seeps into our state, and \nour exemplary and forward-looking environmental laws are powerless to \nstop or even limit the encroachment.\n\n  The Clean Air Act of 1970 was a milestone law which established \nnational air quality standards for the first time and attempted to \nprovide protection for populations who are affected by emissions \noutside their own local and state control. That bill did much to halt \ndeclining air quality around the country and improve it in some areas. \nIt also acknowledged that fossil fuel utility plants contribute a \nsignificant amount of air pollution not only in the area immediately \naround the plant but can affect air quality hundreds of miles away.\n  While the bill has improved air quality, changes in the utility \nmarket since passage of the Clean Air Act make it necessary to consider \nimportant updates to the legislation. States throughout the country are \nderegulating utilities and soon Congress may consider federal \nlegislation on this issue. I support these economic changes but \nCongress and the Administration should keep pace with this changing \nmarket. Breaking down the barriers of a regulated utility market can \nhave important economic consequences for utility customers. More \ncompetition will drive down prices. But these lower costs will come \nwith a price--the cheapest power is unfortunately produced by some of \nthe dirtiest power plants. Most of these power plants were \ngrandfathered under the Clean Air Act.\n  So today I am introducing the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization \nAct'' to address the local, regional, and global air pollution problems \nthat are posed by fossil-fired power plants under a deregulated market.\n  In the last few weeks, the EPA and the Administration have taken some \nimportant steps to address the power plant loophole in the Clean Air \nAct that allows hundreds of old, mostly coal-fired power plants to \ncontinue to pollute at levels much higher than new plants. Closing this \nloophole is critical to protecting the health of our environment and \nthe health of our children.\n  Last week the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection \nAgency filed suit against 32 coal-fired power plants who had made major \nchanges to their plants without also installing new equipment to \ncontrol smog, acid rain and soot. This is illegal, even under the Clean \nAir Act, and it spotlights the glaring need to level the playing field \nfor all power plants. This is particularly as our country moves toward \na deregulated electricity industry.\n\n  Unfortunately, some of our colleagues decided that this move unfairly \ntargeted some of their utilities that have benefitted from this \nloophole for almost thirty years. I would point out that many of us \nfrom New England and New York believe it is unfair that our states have \nbeen the dumping ground for the pollution coming out of these plants \nfor the past thirty years. My colleagues have heard me speak on the \nfloor about how this pollution is contaminating our fish with mercury, \ndamaging our lakes and forests with acid rain, and causing respiratory \nproblems and obscuring the view of Vermont's mountains with summertime \nozone pollution from nitrogen oxide emissions.\n  Now, added to these concerns is the growing body of knowledge showing \nthat carbon dioxide emissions are having an impact on the global \nclimate. More than a decade of record heat, reports from around the \nglobe of dying coral reefs, and melting glaciers should be warning \nsignals to all of us.\n  In Vermont, one of our warning signals is the impact to sugar maples. \nSugar maple now range naturally as far south as Tennessee and west of \nthe Mississippi River from Minnesota to Missouri. Given the current \npredictions for climate changes, by the end of the next century the \nrange of sugar maples in North America will be limited the state of \nMaine and portions of eastern Canada. Vermont's climate may not\n\n[[Page S14727]]\n\nchange so much that palm trees will line the streets of Burlington and \nMontpelier, but the impact on the character and economy of Vermont and \nmany other states will be profound.\n  It is hard to imagine a Vermont hillside in the fall without the \nbrilliant reds of the sugar maples, and it is hard to imagine a stack \nof pancakes without Vermont maple syrup. And it is unlikely that sugar \nmaples will be the only species or crop that will be affected by \nclimate change, or that the effects will be limited to Vermont. Many \nlike to dismiss concerns about pollution from power plants as a \n``Northeastern issue.'' It is not; it affects all of us, perhaps in \nways that we have not even begun to imagine.\n  I can show you maps that mark the deposition ``hot spots'' for these \npollutants in the Everglades, the Upper Midwest, New England, Long \nIsland Sound, Chesapeake Bay and the West Coast. This clearly is not a \nregional issue. Collectively, fossil fuel-fired power plants constitute \nthe largest source of air pollution in the United States, annually \nemitting more than 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, more than 12 \nmillion tons of acid rain producing sulfur dioxide, nearly 6 million \ntons of smog producing nitrogen oxides, and more than 50 tons of highly \ntoxic mercury.\n  These are staggering sums. Consider the fact that it would take \nnearly 25,000 Washington Monuments, weighing 81,120 tons apiece, to add \nup to 2 billion tons. And that is just one year.\n  Why are we continuing to allow pollutants on that enormous scale to \nbe dumped on some of our most fragile ecosystems, much less into our \nlungs through the air we breathe? It is because Congress assumed when \nit passed the 1970 Clean Air Act that these old pollution-prone plants \nwould be retired over time and replaced by newer, cleaner plants. It \nhas not worked out that way, and it is time for the Congress to rethink \nour strategy.\n\n  More than 75 percent of the fossil-fuel fired plants in the United \nStates began operation before the 1970 Clean Air Act was passed. As a \nresult, they are ``grandfathered'' out from under the full force of its \nregulations. Many of the environmental problems posed by this industry \nare linked to the antiquated and inefficient technologies at these \nplants. The average fossil-fuel fired power plant uses combustion \ntechnology devised in the 1950's or before. Would any of us buy a car \ntoday that was still using 1950s technology? Of course not. So why are \nwe still going out of our way to preserve 1950s technology for power \nplants?\n  As long as we allow these plants to operate inefficiently they will \nproduce enormous amounts of air pollution. My bill takes a new approach \nto reducing this pollution by retiring the inefficient \n``grandfathered'' power plants and bring new, clean, and efficient \ntechnologies for the 21st Century on line.\n  Obviously, major changes in this industry will not occur over night. \nThe ``continue-business-as-usual'' inertia is enormous. The old, \ninefficient, pollution-prone power plants will operate until they fall \ndown because they are paid for, burn the cheapest fuel, and are subject \nto much less stringent environmental requirements. ``Grandfathered'' \nplants have the statutory equivalent of an eternal lifetime under the \nClean Air Act loophole.\n  Mr. President, this article in Forbes Magazine describes how valuable \nthe old ``grandfathered'' power plants are. The article cites the \nexample of the ``grandfathered'' Homer City generating station outside \nof Pittsburgh. Until last year, the utility valued this plant at $540 \nmillion. According to the Forbes article, last year the utility sold \nthe plant for $1.8 billion. That works out to $955 per kilowatt of \ngenerating capacity, or about the cost of building a new plant. Why are \nthese old pollution-prone plants suddenly so valuable? Maybe their \n``grandfathered'' status has something to do with it.\n  What does my bill propose to do? First, it closes the ``grandfather'' \nloophole. Second, it lays out an aggressive but achievable set of air \npollution and efficiency requirements for fossil-fired power plants. \nThird, the emissions standards will allow clean coal technologies to \nhave a fair chance to compete in the future mix of electrical power \ngeneration. Fourth, it provides industry decision-makers with a \ncomprehensive and predictable set of regulatory requirements and tax \ncode changes so they can see up-front what the playing field is going \nto look like in the future. This will allow them to make informed, \ncomprehensive, and economically efficient business decisions. Public \nhealth and the environment will benefit, consumers will benefit, and \nthe utility companies will benefit from this approach.\n  As U.S. power plants become more efficient and more power is produced \nby renewable technologies, less fossil fuel will be consumed. This will \nhave an impact on the workers and communities that produce fossil \nfuels. These effects are likely to be greatest for coal, even with \nsignificant deployment of clean coal technology. The bill provides \nfunding for programs to help workers and communities during the period \nof transition. I am eager to work with organized labor to ensure that \nthese provisions address the needs of workers, particularly those who \nmay not fully benefit from retraining programs.\n\n  The bill provides substantial additional funding for research, \ndevelopment, and commercial demonstrations of renewable and clean \nenergy technologies such as solar, wind, biomass, and fuel cells. As \nutilities retire their ``grandfathered'' plants and plan for future \ngenerating capacity, renewable and clean technologies need to be part \nof the equation. My bill also authorizes expenditures for implementing \nknown ways of biologically sequestering carbon dioxide from the \natmosphere such as planting trees, preserving wetlands, and soil \nrestoration.\n  How will the environment benefit from the emission and efficiency \nstandards in my bill? Mercury emissions will be cut from more than 50 \ntons per year to no more than 5 tons per year. Annual emissions of \nsulfur dioxide that causes acid rain will be cut by more than 6 million \ntons beyond the requirements in Phase II of the Clean Air Act of 1990. \nNitrogen oxide emissions that result in summertime ozone pollution will \nbe cut by more than 3 million tons per year beyond Phase II \nrequirements. And the bill would prevent at least 650 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide emissions per year.\n  Of course, this discussion should not just be about the impact to our \nenvironment. This debate should equally be focused on public health. \nThere is mounting evidence of the health effects of these pollutants. \nThe Washington Post Magazine ran an alarming article that documented \nthe escalating number of children with asthma, jumping to 17.3 million \nin 1998 from 6.8 million in 1980. Asthma may not be caused directly by \nair pollution, but it certainly aggravates it and can lead to premature \ndeaths.\n  The American public still overwhelmingly supports the commitment to \nthe environment that we made in the early 1970s. As stewards of the \nenvironment for our children and our grandchildren, we need to act \nwithout delay to ensure that in the new millennium the United States \nproduces electricity more efficiently and with much less environmental \nand public health impact. There is no reason why we should go into the \nnext century still using technology from the era of Ozzie and Harriet.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \noverview of the bill, and an article entitled ``Poor Me'' from the May \n31, 1999, edition of Forbes Magazine, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1949\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States is relying increasingly on old, \n     needlessly inefficient, and highly polluting powerplants to \n     provide electricity;\n       (2) the pollution from those powerplants causes a wide \n     range of health and environmental damage, including--\n       (A) fine particulate matter that is associated with the \n     deaths of approximately 50,000 Americans annually;\n       (B) urban ozone, commonly known as ``smog'', that impairs \n     normal respiratory functions and is of special concern to \n     individuals afflicted with asthma, emphysema, and other \n     respiratory ailments;\n       (C) rural ozone that obscures visibility and damages \n     forests and wildlife;\n       (D) acid deposition that damages estuaries, lakes, rivers, \n     and streams (and the plants and animals that depend on them \n     for survival) and leaches heavy metals from the soil;\n       (E) mercury and heavy metal contamination that renders fish \n     unsafe to eat, with especially serious consequences for \n     pregnant women and their fetuses;\n       (F) eutrophication of estuaries, lakes, rivers, and \n     streams; and\n       (G) global climate change that may fundamentally and \n     irreversibly alter human, animal, and plant life;\n       (3) tax laws and environmental laws--\n       (A) provide a very strong incentive for electric utilities \n     to keep old, dirty, and inefficient generating units in \n     operation; and\n       (B) provide a strong disincentive to investing in new, \n     clean, and efficient generating technologies;\n       (4) fossil fuel-fired power plants, consisting of plants \n     fueled by coal, fuel oil, and natural gas, produce nearly \n     two-thirds of the electricity generated in the United States;\n       (5) since, according to the Department of Energy, the \n     average combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil fuel-fired \n     power plants in the United States is 33 percent, 67 percent \n     of the heat generated by burning the fuel is wasted;\n       (6) technology exists to increase the combustion heat rate \n     efficiency of coal combustion from 35 percent to 50 percent \n     above current levels, and technological advances are possible \n     that would boost the net combustion heat rate efficiency even \n     more;\n       (7) coal-fired power plants are the leading source of \n     mercury emissions in the United States, releasing an \n     estimated 52 tons of this potent neurotoxin each year;\n       (8) in 1996, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United \n     States produced over 2,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide, \n     the primary greenhouse gas;\n       (9) on average--\n       (A) fossil fuel-fired power plants emit 1,999 pounds of \n     carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity \n     produced;\n       (B) coal-fired power plants emit 2,110 pounds of carbon \n     dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity produced; and\n       (C) coal-fired power plants emit 205 pounds of carbon \n     dioxide for every million British thermal units of fuel \n     consumed;\n       (10) the average fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the \n     United States commenced operation in 1964, 6 years before the \n     Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) was amended to \n     establish requirements for stationary sources;\n       (11)(A) according to the Department of Energy, only 23 \n     percent of the 1,000 largest emitting units are subject to \n     stringent new source performance standards under section 111 \n     of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411); and\n       (B) the remaining 77 percent, commonly referred to as \n     ``grandfathered'' power plants, are subject to much less \n     stringent requirements;\n       (12) on the basis of scientific and medical evidence, \n     exposure to mercury and mercury compounds is of concern to \n     human health and the environment;\n       (13) pregnant women and their developing fetuses, women of \n     childbearing age, and children are most at risk for mercury-\n     related health impacts such as neurotoxicity;\n       (14) although exposure to mercury and mercury compounds \n     occurs most frequently through consumption of mercury-\n     contaminated fish, such exposure can also occur through--\n       (A) ingestion of breast milk;\n       (B) ingestion of drinking water, and foods other than fish, \n     that are contaminated with methyl mercury;

COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES FOR \n                   COMMUNITIES ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY REDUCED \n                   CONSUMPTION OF COAL.\n\n       In addition to amounts made available under any other law, \n     there is authorized to be appropriated $75,000,000 for each \n     of fiscal years 2001 through 2015 to provide assistance, \n     under the economic adjustment program of the Department of \n     Commerce authorized by the Public Works and Economic \n     Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3121 et seq.), to assist \n     communities adversely affected by reduced consumption of coal \n     by the electric power generation industry.\n\n      Section-by-Section Overview of ``The Clean Power Plant and \n                      Modernization Act of 1999''\n\n\n What will the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 1999'' do?\n\n       The ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 1999'' \n     lays out an ambitious, achievable, and balanced set of \n     financial incentives and regulatory requirements designed to \n     increase power plant efficiency, reduce emissions, and \n     encourage use of renewable power generation methods. The bill \n     encourages innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking.\n       The bill encourages ``retirement and replacement'' of old, \n     pollution-prone, and inefficient generating capacity with \n     new, clean, and efficient capacity. The bill does not utilize \n     a ``cap and trade'' approach. Many believe that the \n     ``retirement and replacement'' approach does a superior job \n     at the local and regional levels of protecting public health \n     and the environment from mercury pollution, ozone pollution, \n     and acid deposition. On a global level, the ``retirement and \n     replacement'' also does a far superior job of permanently \n     reducing the volume of carbon dioxide emitted.\n\n\n               What will the bill do for the environment?\n\n       The bill would prevent at least 650 million tons of carbon \n     dioxide emissions per year. Over time, even more greenhouse \n     gas emissions will be avoided annually as increases in power \n     plant efficiencies exceed 50%, more combined heat and power \n     systems are installed, and use of renewable energy sources \n     increases. Prevention of greenhouse gas emissions of up to 1 \n     billion tons per year may be possible. Mercury emissions will \n     be cut from more than 50 tons per year to no more than 5 tons \n     per year. Annual emissions of acid rain producing sulfur \n     dioxide emissions will be cut by more than 6 million tons \n     beyond Phase II Clean Air Act of 1990 requirements. Nitrogen \n     oxide emissions that result in summertime ozone pollution \n     will be cut by 3.2 million tons per year beyond Phase II \n     requirements.\n       Over a 50 year period, the proposal laid out in the bill \n     will prevent more than 30 billion tons in carbon dioxide \n     emissions, and maybe as high as 50 billion tons. Carbon \n     dioxide is further addressed in the bill by authorizing \n     expenditures for implementing known ways of biologically \n     sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere such as \n     planting trees, preserving wetlands, and soil restoration.\n       Over a 50 year period, more than 2,200 tons of mercury \n     emissions would be avoided. While this might not sound like a \n     lot in relation to the other pollutants, consider that a \n     teaspoon of mercury is enough to contaminate several millions \n     of gallons of water. And over a 50 year period more than 300 \n     million tons of sulfur dioxide and 160 million tons of \n     nitrogen oxides will be prevented beyond the Phase II \n     emission limits specified in the Clean Air Act of 1990.\n     Section 1. Title; table of contents\n     Section 2. Findings and purposes\n     Section 3. Definitions\n     Section 4. Heat rate efficiency standards for fossil fuel-\n         fired generating units\n       On average, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United \n     States operate at a thermal efficiency rate of 33%, \n     converting just one-third of the energy in the fuel to \n     electricity, and wasting 67% of the heat generated by burning \n     the fuel. Increasing efficiency in converting the energy in \n     the fuel into electricity is really the only way to reduce \n     carbon dioxide ``greenhouse'' emissions from these \n     facilities. According to the Energy Information \n     Administration, fossil-fired power plants in the United \n     States emit more the 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide per \n     year (or the weight equivalent of nearly 25,000 Washington \n     Monuments every year). This is approximately 40% of annual \n     domestic carbon dioxide emissions.\n       Section 4 lays out a phased two-stage process for \n     increasing efficiency. In the first stage, by 10 years after \n     enactment, all units in operation must achieve a heat rate \n     efficiency (at the higher heating value) of not less than \n     45%. In the second stage, with expected advances in \n     combustion technology, units commencing operation more than \n     10 years after enactment must achieve a heat rate efficiency \n     (at the higher heating value) of not less than 50%.\n       If, for some unforeseen reason, technological advances do \n     not achieve the 50% efficiency level, Section 4 contains a \n     waiver provision that allows owners of new units to offset \n     any shortfall in carbon dioxide emissions through \n     implementation of carbon sequestration projects.\n     Section 5. Air emission standards for fossil fuel-fired \n         generating units\n       Subsection (a) eliminates the ``grandfather'' loophole in \n     the Clean Air Act and requires all units, regardless of when \n     they were constructed or began operation, to comply with \n     existing new source review requirements under Section 111 of \n     the Clean Air Act. The average ``in service'' date for \n     fossil-fired generating units in the United States is 1964--\n     six years before passage of the Clean Air Act. More than 75% \n     of operating fossil-fired generating units came into service \n     before implementation of the 1970 Clean Air Act and are \n     subject to much less stringent requirements than newer units.\n       Subsection (b) sets mercury, carbon dioxide, sulfur \n     dioxide, and nitrogen oxide emission standards for units that \n     are subject to the 45% thermal efficiency standards set forth \n     in Section 4. For mercury, 90% removal of mercury contained \n     in the fuel is required. For carbon dioxide, the emission \n     limits are set by fuel type (i.e., natural gas = 0.9 pounds \n     per kilowatt hour of output; fuel oil = 1.3 pounds per \n     kilowatt hour of output; coal = 1.55 pounds per kilowatt hour \n     of output). Ninety-five percent of sulfur dioxide emissions \n     (and not more than 0.3 pounds per million Btus of fuel \n     consumed), and 90 percent of nitrogen oxides (and not more \n     than 0.15 pounds per million Btus of fuel consumed) are to be \n     removed.\n       Subsection (c) contains the same emission standards for \n     mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides as those in \n     Subsection (b). Increased thermal efficiency will result in \n     lower emissions of carbon dioxide, and the fuel specific \n     emission limits at the 50% efficiency level are lowered \n     accordingly (i.e., natural gas = 0.8 pounds per kilowatt hour \n     of output; fuel oil = 1.2 pounds per kilowatt hour of output; \n     coal = 1.4 pounds per kilowatt hour of output).\n       Furthering the public's right-to-know information on \n     emission volumes, Subsection (e) requires EPA to annually \n     publish pollutant-specific emissions data for each generating \n     unit covered by the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act \n     of 1999.'' In addition, at least once per year residential \n     consumers will receive information from their electricity \n     supplier on the emission volumes.\n     Section 6. Extension of renewable energy production credit\n       Section 45(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \n     amended to include solar power,\n\n[[Page S14732]]\n\n     and to extend renewable energy production credit to 2010 (it \n     is currently set to expire in 1999).\n     Section 7. Mega watt hour generation fee, and\n     Section 8. Clean air trust fund\n       The Clean Air Trust Fund is similar to the Highway Trust \n     Fund and the Superfund. Revenue for the Clean Air Trust Fund \n     will be provided through implementation of a fee on \n     electricity produced by fossil-fired generating units that \n     are ``grandfathered'' from the Clean Air Act's Section 111 \n     new source requirements. Utilities will be assessed at the \n     rate of 30 cents per megawatt hour of electricity that they \n     produce from ``grandfathered'' units. For residential \n     consumers receiving power from ``grandfathered'' plants, the \n     cost of the fee would average 25 cents per month. Income from \n     the fee will be placed in the Clean Air Trust Fund to pay \n     for: a.) assistance to workers and communities adversely \n     affected by reduced consumption of coal; b.) research and \n     development and demonstration programs for renewable and \n     clean power generation technologies (e.g., wind, solar, \n     biomass, and fuel cells); c) demonstrations of the \n     efficiency, environmental benefits, and commercial viability \n     of electrical power generation from clean coal, advanced gas, \n     and combined heat and power technologies; and d.) carbon \n     sequestration projects.\n     Section 9. Accelerated depreciation for investor-owned \n         generating units.\n       Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, utilities can \n     depreciate their generating equipment over a 20-year period. \n     New, cleaner and efficient generating technologies will \n     experience shorter physical lifetimes compared to their \n     dirtier, less efficient, but more durable predecessors. Over \n     a 20-year timeframe, most components of new generating units \n     will need to be replaced; some components will be replaced \n     several times. To update the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     reflect this change in the expected physical lifetimes of \n     generating equipment, Section 9 amends Section 168 of the \n     Code to allow depreciation over a 15-year period for units \n     meeting the 45% efficiency level and the emission standards \n     in Section 5(b) above. Section 168 is further amended to \n     allow for deprecation over a 12-year period for units \n     meeting the 50% efficiency level and the emission \n     standards in Section 5(c).\n     Section 10. Grants for publicly-owned generating units.\n       No federal taxes are paid on publicly-owned generating \n     units. Section 10 provides for annual grants in an amount \n     equal to the monetary value of the depreciation deduction \n     that would be realized by a similarly-situated investor owned \n     generating unit under Section 9. Units meeting the 45% \n     efficiency level and the emission standards in Section 5(b) \n     above would receive annual grants over a 15-year period, and \n     units meeting the 50% efficiency level and the emission \n     standards in Section 5(c) would receive annual grants over a \n     12-year period.\n     Section 11. Recognition of permanent emission reductions in \n         future climate change implementation programs.\n       This section expresses the sense of Congress that permanent \n     reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides \n     that are accomplished through the retirement of old \n     generating units and replacement by new generating units that \n     meet the efficiency and emissions standards in the bill, or \n     through replacement with non polluting renewable power \n     generation technologies, should be credited to the utility \n     sector and to the owner/operator in any climate change \n     implementation program enacted by Congress. The base year for \n     calculating reductions will be the year preceding enactment \n     of the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 1999.'' \n     The bill stipulates that a portion of any monetary value that \n     may accrue from credits under this section should be passed \n     on to utility customers.\n     Section 12. Renewable and clean power generation \n         technologies.\n  This section provides a total of $750 million over 10 years to fund \nresearch and development programs and commercial demonstration projects \nand partnerships to demonstrate the commercial viability and \nenvironmental benefits of electric power generation from biomass, \ngeothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cell technologies. Types of projects \nmay include solar power tower plants, solar dishes and engines, co-\nfiring biomass with coal, biomass modular systems, next-generation wind \nturbines and wind verification projects, geothermal energy conversion, \nand fuel cells.\n     Section 13. Clean coal, advanced gas turbine, and combined \n         heat and power generation demonstration program.\n       This section provides a total of $750 million over 10 years \n     to fund projects and partnerships that demonstrate the \n     efficiency and environmental benefits and commercial \n     viability of electric power generation from clean coal \n     technologies (including, but not limited to, pressurized \n     fluidized bed combustion and integrated gasification combined \n     cycle systems), advanced gas turbine technologies (including, \n     but not limited to, flexible mid-sized gas turbines and \n     baseload utility scale applications), and combined heat and \n     power technologies.\n     Section 14. Evaluation of implementation of this act and \n         other statutes\n       Not later than 2 years after enactment, DOE, in \n     consultation with EPA and FERC, shall report to Congress on \n     the implementation of the ``Clean Power Plant and \n     Modernization Act of 1999.'' The report shall identify any \n     provision of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Energy Supply \n     and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974, the Public \n     Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, or the Powerplant \n     and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 that conflicts with the \n     efficient implementation of the ``Clean Power Plant and \n     Modernization Act of 1999.'' The report shall include \n     recommendations for legislative or administrative measures to \n     harmonize and streamline these other statutes.\n     Section 15. Assistance for workers adversely affected by \n         reduced consumption of coal\n       With increased power plant efficiency, less fuel will need \n     to be burned to produce a given quantity of electricity. This \n     section provides a total of $1.125 billion over 15 years ($75 \n     million per year) to provide assistance to workers who are \n     adversely affected as a result of reduced consumption of coal \n     by the electric power generation industry. The funds will be \n     administered under the economic dislocation and workers' \n     adjustment assistance program of the Department of Labor \n     authorized by Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act.\n     Section 16. Community economic development incentives for \n         communities adversely affected by reduced consumption of \n         coal\n       With increased power plant efficiency, less fuel will need \n     to be burned to produce a given quantity of electricity. This \n     section provides a total of $1.125 billion over 15 years ($75 \n     million per year) to provide assistance to communities \n     adversely affected as a result of reduced consumption of coal \n     by the electric power generation industry.

But they're selling \n     them for fancy prices.\n       The Homer City Generation Station is a 34-year-old, coal-\n     fired power plant near Pittsburgh. What's it worth? Until \n     last year it was carried on the books of two utilities for \n     $540 million. Then the companies sold it for $1.8 billion, or \n     $955 per kilowatt--about what it would cost to build a brand-\n     spanking-new electric plant.\n       Are old plants a millstone for utilities as they enter the \n     deregulated future? That's what the utilities are telling \n     rate regulators. We built all these plants over the years \n     because you told us to, they are saying--and now that \n     newcomers are about to undercut us, we need compensation for \n     the ``stranded costs.'' The logic of compensation for \n     stranded costs is unassailable. The only debate is over the \n     amount. Is the average power plant indeed a white elephant?\n       According to data collected by Cambridge Energy Research \n     Associates, the average nonnuclear power plant put up for \n     sale in the last year sold for nearly twice its book value. \n     Granted, the plants being sold tend to be the more desirable \n     ones, by dint of their location or their fuel efficiency. \n     Still, the pricing makes one wonder whether the power \n     industry should be entitled to much of anything for stranded \n     costs.\n       Some states--California, Maine, Connecticut and New York, \n     for example--have ordered utilities to sell all or part of \n     their generation capacity. That should set an arm's length \n     fair price. Thanks largely to the fat prices received for its \n     power plants, Sempra Energy, the parent of San Diego Gas & \n     Electric, says that its stranded-cost charges related to \n     generation--about 12% of a typical customer's bill--will be \n     paid off by July. That is two and a half years ahead of \n     schedule, a savings of $400 million for southern \n     Californians.\n       Not every state legislature or utility commission has the \n     political will to force divestiture, however. If a utility \n     does not want to sell, the utility and the regulators have to \n     estimate the fair market value for a plant and then see if \n     that is a lot less than book value.\n       This is tricky business. Last year Allegheny Energy, parent \n     of West Penn Power Co., estimated the value of its power \n     plant at $148 a kilowatt, half of their book value. An expert \n     hired by a number of industrial energy users suggested the \n     value should be $409. A hearing revealed that Allegheny had \n     bought back a half-interest in one of its plants two years \n     earlier at a price of $612 a kilowatt. Allegheny settled with \n     the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for a\n\n[[Page S14733]]\n\n     valuation of $225 a kilowatt, half again the original \n     estimate. At that price, Allegheny's 700,000 customers in \n     western Pennsylvania are stuck paying $670 million in \n     stranded costs.\n       What happens if the utility doesn't get the compensation it \n     wants? Litigation. In New Hampshire the state legislature \n     passed a law designed to open up the power market in 1996. \n     New Hampshire's power companies and utility commission have \n     been tied up in court ever since over the issue of stranded \n     costs.\n       For this reason, legislators and regulators sometimes feel \n     like they need to cut some deal, any deal, just to get a \n     competitive market moving forward. The state of Virginia, for \n     example, dodged any stranded cost calculation. In a move \n     supported by local utilities, the legislature delayed true \n     competition and simply froze electric rates until 2007. \n     Utilities had donated more than $1 million to Virginia \n     politicians in the last two election cycles.\n       Last year Ohio legislators proposed a bill to open up the \n     power market. They figured stranded costs at $6 billion, \n     spread among Ohio's eight big utilities. Not liking that \n     number, the utilities came up with an $18 billion figure. The \n     latest compromise is $11 billion. This number represents, in \n     effect, the excess of the plants' book value over their \n     market value.\n       Wait a minute, says Samuel Randazzo, an attorney for some \n     industrial power users. That $11 billion number is more than \n     the book value of all the plants. Can the utilities lose more \n     than their investment? Negotiations are to continue.\n       ``We are applying a political solution to an economic \n     problem,'' shrugs Ohio utility commissioner Craig Glazer. \n     ``All intellectual arguments have been thrown out the window. \n     Now it comes down to who screams the loudest.\n       Expect further screaming as utilities enter the deregulated \n     market.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 1950. A bill to amend the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to ensure \nthe orderly development of coal, coalbed methane, natural gas, and oil \nin the Powder River Basin, Wyoming and Montana, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            the powder river basin resource development act\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Powder River \nBasin Resource Development Act of 1999.'' This legislation is designed \nto provide a procedure for the orderly and timely resolution of \ndisputes between coal producers and oil and gas operators in the Powder \nRiver Basin in north-central Wyoming and southern Montana. This \nlegislation is cosponsored by my colleague from Wyoming, Senator \nThomas.\n  Mr. President, the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and southern Montana \nis one of the richest energy resource regions in the world. This area \ncontains the largest coal reserves in the United States, providing \nnearly thirty percent of America's total coal production. This region \nalso contains rich reserves of oil and gas, including coalbed methane. \nWyoming is the fifth largest producer of natural gas in the county and \nthe sixth largest producer of crude oil. The Powder River Basin plays \nan important role in the Wyoming's oil and gas production, and this \nrole promises to grow as the exploration and production of coalbed \nmethane increases over the next several years. This region, and the \nState of Wyoming as a whole, provides many of the resources that heat \nour homes, fuel our cans, generate electricity for our computers, \nmicrowaves, and televisions. In short, there is very little that any of \nus do in a day that is not affected by the resources of coal, oil, and \nnatural gas.\n  The production of these natural resources is a vital part of the \neconomy of my home state of Wyoming. The production of coal and oil and \ngas employs more than 21,000 people in Wyoming. The property taxes, \nseverance taxes, and state and federal royalties fund our schools, our \nroads, and many of the other services that are essential for the \nfunctioning of our state. Since Wyoming has no state income tax, our \nState relies heavily on the minerals industry for our tax base.\n  Given the great importance both the coal and oil and gas industries \nhave to Wyoming's economy, the State of Wyoming and the Federal \nGovernment have tried to encourage concurrent development in areas \nwhere it is feasible and safe to do so. Unfortunately, this is not \nalways possible. This legislation is designed to provide a procedure \nfor the fair and expeditious resolution of conflicts between oil and \ngas producers and coal producers who have interests on federal land in \nthe Powder River Basin in Wyoming and southern Montana.\n  Mr. President, this legislation sets forth a reasonable procedure to \nresolve conflicts between coal producers and oil and gas producers when \ntheir mineral rights come into conflict because of overlapping federal \nleasing. First, this proposal requires that once a potential conflict \nis identified, the parties must attempt to negotiate an agreement \nbetween themselves to resolve this conflict. Second, if the parties are \nunable to come to an agreement between themselves, either of the \nparties may file a petition for relief in U.S. district court in the \ndistrict in which the conflict is located. Third, after such a petition \nis filed, the court would determine whether an actual conflict exists. \nFourth, if the court determines that a conflict does in fact exist, the \ncourt would determine whether the public interest, as determined by the \ngreater economic benefit of each mineral, is best served by suspension \nof the federal coal lease or suspension or termination of all or part \nof the oil and gas lease. Fifth, a panel of three experts would be \nassembled to determine the value of the mineral of lesser economic \nvalue. Each party to the action; the oil and gas interest, the coal \ninterest, and the federal government, would each appoint one of the \nthree experts. Finally, after the panel issues its final valuation \nreport, the court would enter an order setting the compensation that is \ndue the developer who had to temporarily or permanently forgo his \ndevelopment rights. This compensation would be paid by the owner of the \nmineral of greater economic value. A credit against federal royalties \nwould also be available against the compensation price in a limited \nnumber of situations where the value of such compensation was not \nforeseen in the original federal lease bid.\n\n  Mr. President, the ``Powder River Basin Resource Development Act of \n1999'' has several benefits over the present system. First, it requires \nparties whose mineral interests may come into conflict to attempt to \nnegotiate an agreement among themselves before either one of them may \navail themselves of the expedited resolution mechanism. No such \nrequirement exists today. Second, it directs the Secretary of the \nInterior to encourage expedited development of federal minerals and \nthat are leased pursuant to the federal Mineral Leasing Act, that exist \nin conflict areas, and which may otherwise be lossed or bypassed. As \nsuch, this legislation encourages full and expeditious development of \nfederal resources in this narrow conflict area where it is economically \nfeasible and safe to do so. Third and finally, this bill provides an \nexpeditious procedure to resolve conflicts that cannot be solved by the \ntwo parties alone, and it does so in a manner that ensures that any \nmineral owner will be fairly compensated for any suspension or loss of \nhis mineral rights. In turn, this proposal will prevent the serious \neconomic hardship to hundreds of families and the State treasury that \ncould occur if mineral development is stalled for an indefinite amount \nof time due to protracted litigation under the current system.\n  Mr. President, this legislation builds on legislation I introduced \nlast year with Senators Thomas and Bingaman, which passed Congress and \nwas signed into law last November. That bill, S. 2500, ensured that \nexisting lease and contract rights to coalbed methane would not be \nterminated by a decision from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals which \nconcluded that coalbed methane gas was reserved to the federal \ngovernment under earlier coal reservation Acts. As it turned out, the \nSupreme Court earlier this year realized we got in right in our bill \nand held that the coalbed methane was in fact a gas and not a solid, \nand therefore was not reserved to the government under earlier coal \nreservation Acts. As such, the protections we provided in S. 2500 were \nguaranteed to future as well as past oil and gas leaseholders.\n  Mr. President, S. 2500 was an important step in providing certainty \nand resolution to the question of mineral ownership in Wyoming, and \nthroughout the country. This bill, builds on last year's work by \nproviding a means to\n\n[[Page S14734]]\n\nresolve ongoing development conflicts between owners of coal and oil \nand gas in the Powder River Basin. It represents the result of nearly a \nyear of negotiations between the coal and coalbed producers, as well as \nthe deep oil and gas interests, on a method to fairly reconcile mineral \ndevelopment disputes when they occur because of multiple leasing by the \nfederal government. This bill has also incorporated recommendations \nmade by the Bureau of Land Management. I look forward to working with \nall the affected parties during the second session of the 106th \nCongress to pass legislation that will put into place a reasonable, \nbalanced method to ensure that we receive the best return on our \nvaluable natural resources in the Powder River Basin.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1951. A bill to provide the Secretary of Energy with authority to \ndraw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when oil and gas prices in \nthe United States rise sharply because of anticompetitive activity, and \nto require the President, through the Secretary of Energy, to consult \nwith Congress regarding the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                        oil price safeguard act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to join my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Schumer, in introducing legislation \nthat provides an effective option to the President and the Secretary of \nEnergy to address the unfair, harmful manipulation in the global oil \nmarket. The Oil Price Safeguard Act would help to moderate sharp spikes \nin oil and gas prices caused by price fixing and production quotas \nthrough the judicious use of our enormous petroleum reserves.\n  The global oil market is dominated by an international cartel with \nthe ability to dramatically affect the price of oil. The eleven member \ncountries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries known as \nOPEC supply over 40 percent of the world's oil and possess 78 percent \nof the world's total proven crude oil reserves. Their control of the \nworld's oil supply allows these countries to collude to drive up the \nprice of oil. OPEC has power to dominate the market and when it wields \nthis power, consumers lose. Mr. President, if OPEC operated in the \nUnited States, the Department of Justice would undoubtedly prosecute \nthe cartel for violation of U.S. anti-trust laws, but the cartel is \nbeyond the reach of our antitrust enforcement.\n  To appreciate how much economic power OPEC wields, it is helpful to \nreview the historical relationship between world oil prices and the \nU.S. Gross Domestic Product. When OPEC cuts production to increase \nprofits, the American consumer suffers, as does our economy. Rising oil \nprices increase transportation and manufacturing costs, dampening \neconomic growth.\n  The chart behind me entitled, ``Oil is a Vital Resource for the U.S. \nEconomy,'' was prepared by the Energy Information Administration of the \nDepartment of Energy. On this chart, world oil prices are represented \nby the blue line, and U.S. Gross Domestic Product is represented by the \nred line. It is easy to see the inverse relationship between the two. \nWhen world oil prices are high, U.S. Gross Domestic Product drops. For \nexample, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as the price of oil \nclimbed, the U.S. economy slumped into a deep recession. Conversely, \nthe strength currently enjoyed by the U.S. economy was until recently \naccompanied by low oil prices.\n  If these historical trends hold, the current rise in crude oil prices \nis a serious threat to our economic prosperity. This second chart \nentitled ``EIA Crude Oil Price Outlook,'' shows that crude oil prices \nhave risen since January 1999 and are expected to continue rising this \nwinter. To a large extent, this chart demonstrates the ability of OPEC \nto drive the price of oil up. It is chilling, that the Federal agency \nresponsible for projecting energy prices for the government is \npredicting that the price of oil will be above $25 a barrel into \nJanuary of next year. This prediction underscores the need for the \nlegislation Senator Schumer and I introduce today.\n  The bottom line is that consumers, as well as businesses, are hurt by \nexpensive petroleum products. A rise in crude oil prices increases the \nprice of home heating oil and gasoline. Northern states like Maine are \nparticularly hard hit by increased oil prices because of the need to \nheat homes through long cold winters. Since about 6 out of 10 Maine \nhomes burn oil and the average household uses 800 gallons annually \nincreases in oil prices have a dramatic impact on the state's \npopulation and particularly on low-income families and seniors.\n  A rural state like Maine is also hard hit by increased gasoline \nprices at the pump since rural residents often travel further distances \nthan those living in urban or suburban areas. For example, my \nconstituents in Aroostook County are currently paying close to $1.50 a \ngallon for regular octane gasoline. At the same time, higher petroleum \nprices increase the cost of transporting oil and gasoline to rural \nareas, like Northern Maine.\n  At a recent OPEC meeting, the member nations reasserted their resolve \nto maintain high crude oil prices through production quotas. This is \nparticularly troubling considering that the Energy Information \nAdministration has projected that if New England experiences a \nparticularly cold winter, the price of home heating oil could reach as \nhigh as $1.20 per gallon. This is 50 percent higher than what New \nEnglanders paid for oil last year. Even if this winter has normal \nweather, the Energy Information Administration predicts significantly \nincreased oil prices due in large measure to the OPEC production \nreductions. This chart, ``Crude and Distillate Price Outlook Higher \nthan Last Winter'' shows projections for steeply increased prices in \ncrude oil and, consequently, home heating oil. As you can see, prices \nhave risen already and are expected to reach levels higher than those \nexperienced during the winter of 1996-97.\n  Even if our diplomatic efforts fail to break OPEC's choke-hold on the \nworld oil supply, we need not sit idly as oil and gas prices rise well-\nbeyond where they would be in a normally-functioning market.\n  The United States has a tool available to ease the sting of this \nunfair market manipulation. The United States owns the largest \nstrategic reserve of crude oil in the world. The Strategic Petroleum \nReserve (SPR) consists of roughly 571 million barrels of crude oil held \nin salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana. The Energy Policy and \nConservation Act allows the Secretary of Energy to sell oil from the \nreserve if the President makes certain findings set forth in the law. \nIn order to tap into the Reserve, the President must determine that an \nemergency situation exists causing significant and lasting reductions \nin the supply of oil and severe price increases likely to cause a major \nadverse impact on the national economy. In the history of the Reserve, \nthe President has only made this declaration once, during the Gulf War.\n  The legislation I am proud to sponsor with Senator Schumer today, who \nhas been a leader on this issue, will give the President more \nflexibility in using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to protect \nAmerican consumers. Specifically, this measure will amend the Energy \nPolicy and Conservation Act to authorize a draw down of the reserve \nwhen the President finds that a significant reduction in the supply of \noil has been caused by anti-competitive conduct. While many, myself \nincluded, believe that the President currently should consider ordering \na draw down to counteract OPEC's latest market-distorting production \nquotas, this legislation will make it clear that he has the power to do \nso. It will also ensure that the proceeds from a draw-down of the \nReserve are used to replenish its oil. The bill does by mandating that \nthe proceeds are deposited in a special account designed for that \npurpose. We want to give the President the authority to use the SPR to \nrestore market discipline, but not to permanently deplete the reserve \nin the process.\n  To further encourage the use of the SPR to offset harmful and \nuncompetitive activities of foreign pricing cartels, the Oil Price \nSafeguard Act will require the Secretary of Energy to consult with \nCongress regarding the sale of oil from the Reserve. If the price of a \nbarrel of crude exceeds 25 dollars for a period greater than 14 days, \nthe\n\n[[Page S14735]]\n\nPresident, through the Secretary of Energy, will be required to submit \nto Congress a report within thirty days. This report will have four \nparts. First, it will detail the causes and potential consequences of \nthe price increase. Second, it will provide an estimate of the likely \nduration of the price increase, based on analyses and forecasts of the \nEnergy Information Administration. Third, it will provide an analysis \nof the effects of the price increase on the cost of home heating oil. \nAnd fourth, the report will provide a specific rationale for why the \nPresident does or does not support a draw down and distribution of oil \nfrom the SPR to counteract anti-competitive behavior in the oil market.\n  The bill we are introducing today will grant important new authority \nto the President to protect consumers from the market-distorting \nbehavior of foreign cartels. It will require the President to explain \nto Congress and the American people why actions available to the \nPresident have not been exercised to protect consumers. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Schumer and me in working for expeditious \npassage of this important measure.\n  I yield to my colleague, the distinguished Senator from New York, so \nhe may provide further explanation of our legislation. I commend him \nfor his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank Senator Collins from Maine for her leadership on \nthis issue. She has well represented her constituents on an issue of \ngreat concern. Like Maine, northern New York--much of New York--is very \nconcerned with the prices of oil; not only gasoline but some heating \noil, which--just as it is in Maine--is going through the roof in New \nYork as we come into this winter season, which, thus far anyway, has \nbeen colder than people have predicted. I thank the Senator for \ngarnering time to talk about our legislation, and I look forward to \nworking with her on this issue.\n  Two months ago, I wrote President Clinton and Energy Secretary \nRichardson requesting that they look into the possibility of releasing \na modest amount of oil from our Nation's well-stocked Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. I made this request not because the price of crude \noil was rising, but rather because global oil prices had recently more \nthan doubled, primarily due to the new-found unity between OPEC members \nand allies to uphold rigid supply quotas--not free market but rigid \nsupply quotas.\n  OPEC's decision in September to maintain the supply quotas meant the \ndaily global oil supply would remain millions of barrels below last \nyear's levels--and millions of barrels per day below global demand. The \neffects this decision would have on oil prices were clear. Yesterday, \nmy colleagues--listen to this--oil closed at nearly $26 a barrel, and \nmany industry experts now believe it will go to $30 or even $35 a \nbarrel this winter.\n  Most industry and financial experts believe oil prices above $25 per \nbarrel for an extended period will adversely affect economic growth, \neven if you come from Arizona; not only will it raise your gasoline \nprices--you don't have to worry about home heating oil, but $35 per \nbarrel is clearly recessionary.\n  The effects will be felt most among the poor and elderly, both at the \ngas pump and in a sharp increase in the cost of home heating oil. It \nwill effect our manufacturing, transportation, as well as other \nbusinesses that rely on oil.\n  I don't believe in interfering with free markets. But these OPEC \ndecisions are not examples of fair economic play. In fact, OPEC \nrecently announced that it would not even revisit the supply until \nMarch of 2000. With American and global oil demand increasing, and a \ncold winter forecast for North America, OPEC's continued supply quota \ncould have a severely detrimental effect on the U.S. economy over the \ncoming months, and may very well throw sand in the gears of the global \neconomy.\n  Unfortunately, OPEC, with more than 40 percent market share in the \nglobal oil market, can have inordinate power over the global economy.\n  So the question is, Should we rely on the judgment of OPEC ministers \nto make the right decision when it comes to the American and the world \neconomy? The answer is clearly no.\n  The next question is, What can we do about it?\n  My colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and I have worked together \nto formulate what we believe is a reasonable response policy by the \nU.S. Government to instances when foreign oil producers collude to \nmanipulate oil prices to a level that will likely cause a significant \nadverse impact on our economy, not to mention gasoline, which could go \nto a $1.60, $1.70, or even higher a gallon, and home heating oil that \ncould go, in my part of the country, from $1 to $1.25 a gallon.\n\n  Here is how our legislation works. It works within the parameters of \nthe 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which set up the U.S. \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which \ndescribed oil supply reductions leading to severe price increases as a \npotential national emergency.\n  We simply add a provision that allows the Energy Secretary to order a \ndrawdown of the SPR when oil and gas prices in the U.S. rise sharply \nbecause of anticompetitive conduct of foreign oil producers.\n  Oil supply can fall short for many natural, market-based reasons. But \nwhen the shortfall is due to opportunistic manipulations by foreign \nproducers, especially to the degree that it will harm our economic \nwell-being, we have the right to act in our own defense.\n  That is why our bill also requires the administration to report to \nCongress within 30 days after the price of oil sustains a price higher \nthan $25 for more than 2 weeks. This reporting requirement--which will \nget Congress more involved in SPR policies--simply calls for a \ncomprehensive review of the causes and likely consequences of the price \nincrease. It also requires the President to explain why the \nadministration does or does not --we don't force his hand--support the \ndrawdown and distribution of oil from the SPR.\n  Before concluding, I want to make a few things clear about this \nlegislation. First, it doesn't attempt in any way to bring oil prices \ndown to what some would call unreasonable levels. Most of us believe \noil prices were unrealistically low last winter, and that OPEC's \ninitial supply cuts were an understandable strategy to achieve a better \nbalance between global supply and demand.\n  But to maintain the cuts despite the price recovery and the projected \ngrowth in demand amounts to nothing less than price gouging.\n  OPEC is currently enjoying unity as a cartel not seen since the early \n1980s.\n  The bill also protects our national security by requiring that \nproceeds from the sale of oil from the SPR be used only to resupply the \nSPR, with profits from sales remaining in the SPR account. Therefore, \nin the long run, we are not going to deplete the oil reserve. We are \njust going to use it to try to bring oil prices to a reasonable level.\n  And with the SPR currently stocked at 570 million barrels, we have \nmore than enough oil to release several hundred thousand barrels a day \nin the event of a supply crisis without undercutting our stockpile. \nThis should be more than sufficient to pressure oil producers to \nincrease their supply to more realistically meet demand.\n  The bottom line is this legislation would show foreign producers the \nU.S. can and may well intervene when unfair markets threaten our \ndomestic economy. We will say loud and clear our national economic \nhealth is a national security issue. That knowledge may be sufficient \nto prevent OPEC from extensive oil market manipulations in the first \nplace.\n  A signal to OPEC that we are willing to use some of our strategic \nreserves to stabilize oil prices is consistent with the prudent long-\nterm approach toward maintaining a stable economy.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a measured, bipartisan response to \na vital economic issue. I look forward to debating and passing this \nlegislation next year.\n  With that, I yield back my time to the good Senator from Maine and \nthank her for her leadership.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to work with the \nSenator from New York on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1954. A bill to establish a compensation program for employees of \nthe\n\n[[Page S14736]]\n\nDepartment of Energy, its contractors, subcontractors, and beryllium \nvendors, who sustained beryllium-related illness due to the performance \nof their duty; to establish a compensation program for certain workers \nat the Paducah, Kentucky, gaseous diffusion plant; to establish a pilot \nprogram for examining the possible relationship between workplace \nexposure to radiation and hazardous materials and illnesses or health \nconditions; and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                   energy employees' compensation act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along \nwith my colleagues, Senators Thompson and Kennedy, a bill to establish \ncompensation programs for workers at Department of Energy sites, \ncontractors, and vendors who are ill because they were exposed to \nsevere chemical and radioactive hazards while on the job. This bill, \nthe Energy Employees' Compensation Act, will recognize three of the \nmore egregious workplace hazards that were allowed to exist over the \nyears at DOE facilities.\n  The first of these situations was the exposure of workers at DOE \nsites and vendors to beryllium, a metal that has been used for the past \n50 years in the production of nuclear weapons. Even very small amounts \nof exposure to beryllium can result in the onset of Chronic Beryllium \nDisease (CBD), an allergic lung reaction resulting in lung scarring and \nloss of lung function. The only treatment is the use of steroids to \ncontrol the inflammation. There is no cure. Once a person has been \nexposed to beryllium, he or she has a lifelong risk of developing CBD. \nWhile only 1 to 6 percent of exposed people will generally develop CBD, \nsome work tasks are associated with disease rates as high as 16 \npercent. Beryllium was used at 20 DOE sites, including sites in my \nstate of New Mexico. An estimated 20,000 workers may have been exposed, \nincluding 1,000-1,500 in New Mexico. To date, DOE screening programs \nhave identified 146 cases of CBD among current and former workers, \nalthough the number can be expected to grow. The people who are \naffected by this disease were typically blue-collar workers at these \nfacilities. They are not covered by the federal workers' compensation \nsystem, and the various state workers' compensation programs are not \nwell geared to deal with chronic occupational illnesses like CBD. I \nbelieve that, since these workers became exposed to beryllium while \nworking in the defense of their country, the country owes them \nsomething in return, should they come down with Chronic Beryllium \nDisease. That is why I will fight to help the workers and their \nfamilies in New Mexico and elsewhere through this part of the bill.\n  The second situation which this bill seeks to remedy occurred at the \nDOE Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky. Here, workers were \nunknowingly exposed to plutonium and other highly radioactive materials \nthat were present in recycled uranium sent to the plant by the former \nAtomic Energy Commission. The AEC and the managers of the plant knew \nabout this hazard in the 1950s, but enhanced protection for workers at \nPaducah was not implemented until 1992. This is an unbelievable and \noutrageous error. These workers deserve full compensation for the \nhealth effects of exposures that they were subject to without their \nknowledge.\n  The third situation that this bill addresses occurred to 55 workers \nat the DOE's East Tennessee Technology Park, who also suffered \nexposures to radiation and hazardous materials that have resulted in \noccupational illness. Through this provision, DOE can make a grant of \n$100,000 to each worker, if medical experts find that it is \nappropriate.\n  The Department of Energy, under Secretary Richardson's leadership, is \nfacing up to some of its past failures to properly oversee worker \nhealth and safety at its facilities. It is a tragedy that we have to \nintroduce and pass bills like this one, particularly in cases where it \nseems so clear that the problems could have been prevented. But this \nbill is the right thing to do for workers who served their country and \nexpected that they would be kept safe from occupational injury. As the \nCongress considers this bill, I hope that we also remain vigilant to \nthe ongoing challenges to worker safety and health at DOE facilities, \nparticularly in the parts of the Department that are being reorganized \nas a result of legislation we passed earlier this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n         TITLE I--ENERGY EMPLOYEES' BERYLLIUM COMPENSATION ACT\n\n\n                        SECTION 101. SHORT TITLE\n\n       This section designates this title as the ``Energy \n     Employees' Beryllium Compensation Act.''\n\n\n                         SECTION 102. FINDINGS\n\n       Employees of the Department of Energy, and employees of the \n     Department's contractors and vendors, have been, and \n     currently may be, exposed to harmful substances, including \n     dust particles or vapor of beryllium, while performing duties \n     uniquely related to the Department of Energy's nuclear \n     weapons production program. Exposure to dust particles or \n     vapor of beryllium in this situation may cause beryllium \n     sensitivity and chronic beryllium disease, and those who \n     suffer beryllium-related health conditions should have \n     uniform and adequate compensation.\n\n\n                        SECTION 103. DEFINITIONS\n\n       This section provides the definitions of a number of terms \n     necessary to implement this legislation. It also incorporates \n     the definitions of multiple terms from the Federal Employees' \n     Compensation Act, section 8101 of title, United States Code.\n       A beryllium vendor is defined as those vendors known to \n     have produced or provided beryllium for the Department of \n     Energy. The definition allows the Secretary of Energy to add \n     other vendors by regulation.\n       A covered employee is defined as an employee of entities \n     that contracted with the Department of Energy to perform \n     certain services at a Department of Energy facility and an \n     employee of a subcontractor. The definition also includes an \n     employee of a beryllium vendor during a time when beryllium \n     was being processed and sold to the Department of Energy. An \n     employee of the federal government is also a covered employee \n     if the employee may have been exposed to beryllium at a \n     Department of Energy facility or that of a beryllium vendor.\n       Covered illness is defined as Beryllium Sensitivity and \n     Chronic Beryllium Disease. The statute sets forth criteria by \n     which the existence of these conditions may be established. \n     Consequential injuries arising from these conditions are also \n     covered illnesses.\n\n\n        SECTION 104. REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO REVISE DEFINITIONS\n\n       This section provides specific authority for the Secretary \n     of Energy to designate by regulation additional entities as \n     beryllium vendors for the purposes of this title. This \n     section also authorizes the Secretary of Energy to provide by \n     regulation additional criteria through which a claimant may \n     establish the existence of a covered illness.\n       With regard to proposed subsection (a), it is possible that \n     new vendors of beryllium or beryllium-related products will \n     develop contractual relationships with the Department of \n     Energy in the future; as these contractual relationships \n     develop, it will become necessary to designate these vendors \n     as ``beryllium vendors'' for the purposes of this title.\n       With respect to subsection (b), advances in medical science \n     and testing, and in the medical field's understanding of the \n     harmful effects of exposure to beryllium, are expected to \n     occur. The definition of ``covered illness'' in section \n     103(4) of this title represents the understanding of the \n     Department of Energy of the current state of medical \n     knowledge on the demonstrated methods of establishing \n     beryllium sensitivity or chronic beryllium disease. This \n     subsection would allow the Secretary of Energy to specify \n     additional criteria by which a claimant may establish \n     existence of a covered illness.\n\n\n                      section 105. administration\n\n       This section provides that the Secretary of Energy may \n     administer the program or may enter into an agreement with \n     another agency of the United States, such as the Department \n     of Labor, to administer the program. The Department of Energy \n     would reimburse the other agency for its administrative \n     services.\n\n\n     section 106. exposure to beryllium in the performance of duty\n\n       In order to receive compensation under the Energy \n     Employees' Beryllium Compensation Act (EEBCA) for any \n     condition related to exposure to beryllium, a covered \n     employee must be determined to have been exposed to beryllium \n     in the performance of duty.\n       Subsection (a) of this section provides a rebuttable \n     presumption that employees of DOE contractors (section \n     103(3)(A)) and federal employees (section 103(3)(C)) who were \n     employed at a DOE facility, or whose employment caused them \n     to be present at a DOE or a beryllium vendor's facility, when \n     beryllium was present, were exposed to beryllium in the \n     performance of duty. To rebut the presumptions, substantial \n     evidence would have to be introduced into the record \n     establishing that the covered employee was not exposed to \n     beryllium or beryllium dust during the employee's presence at \n     the facility.\n       With respect to employees of beryllium vendors (section \n     103(3)(B)), subsection (b) of\n\n[[Page S14737]]\n\n     this section provides that these employees have the burden of \n     establishing by substantial evidence exposure to beryllium \n     that was intended for sale to, or to be used by, the DOE. \n     Thus, to the extent that employees of beryllium vendors \n     adduce evidence of exposure to beryllium or beryllium dust \n     solely in circumstances where the eventual product was not \n     intended for sale to, or use by, the DOE, this evidence would \n     not support a finding that the employees were exposed to \n     beryllium in the performance of duty.\n\n\n section 107. compensation for disability or death, medical services, \n                     and vocational rehabilitation\n\n       This section incorporates into this statute the relevant \n     provisions of the FECA regarding payment of compensation and \n     other benefits for covered illnesses. Provisions incorporated \n     by reference include FECA sections regarding medical services \n     and benefits (5 U.S.C. Sec. 8103); vocational rehabilitation \n     (Sec. Sec. 8104 and 8111(b)); total (Sec. 8105) and partial \n     (Sec. 8106) disability; schedule awards for permanent \n     impairment (Sec. Sec. 8107-8109); augmented compensation for \n     dependents (Sec. 8110); additional compensation for services \n     of attendants (Sec. 8111(a)); maximum and minimum monthly \n     payments (Sec. 8112); increase or decrease of basic \n     compensation (Sec. 8113); wage-earning capacity (Sec. 8115); \n     three-day waiting period (Sec. 8117); compensation in case of \n     death (Sec. 8133); funeral expenses (Sec. 8134); lump-sum \n     payment (Sec. 8135); and cost-of-living adjustment \n     (Sec. 8146a (a) and (b)).\n       Subsection (b) of this section provides that all of the \n     compensation under this title will come out of the Energy \n     Employees' Beryllium Compensation Fund established pursuant \n     to section 120 of this title and is limited to amounts \n     available in that fund.\n       Subsection (c) of this section prohibits any payment of \n     compensation for any period prior to the effective date of \n     the title, except for the retroactive lump-sum compensation \n     payment specified in section 111 of this title.\n\n\n                    section 108. computation of pay\n\n       This section incorporates 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8114 regarding \n     computation of pay into this title. Subsection (b) of this \n     section contains slight wording changes from 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 8114(d)(3) necessitated by the fact that not all covered \n     employees under this title are federal employees within the \n     meaning of the FECA.\n\n\n           section 109. limitations on receiving compensation\n\n       This section parallels, with some modifications, the \n     restrictions on receipt of compensation simultaneously with \n     receipt of other benefits for the same covered illness set \n     forth in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8116. Subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 109 contain the same prohibitions against dual \n     benefits sete forth in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8116(a) and (b), and \n     apply to federal employees and beneficiaries whose benefit \n     derives from federal employees. Thus, individuals who are \n     eligible to receive benefits under this title may not \n     simultaneously receive those benefits and an annuity from the \n     Office of Personnel Management, whether such annuity is based \n     on length of service or disability. The election required by \n     subsection (b) is not subject to the provisions of section \n     110 regarding coordination of benefits.\n       Subsection (c) applies only to federal employees awarded \n     benefits under this title and under FECA for the same covered \n     illness or death, and requires an election between the two \n     systems.\n       Once an informed election has been made, the election is \n     irrevocable.\n       Subsections (d) and (e) require an individual eligible to \n     receive benefits under this title, and also eligible to \n     receive benefits under a state worker's compensation system \n     based on the same covered illness or death, to elect either \n     benefits under this title (subject to the reduction in \n     benefits set forth in section 110) or under the applicable \n     state workers' compensation system, unless the state workers' \n     compensation coverage was secured by an insurance policy or \n     contract, and the Secretary of Energy specifically waives the \n     requirement to make an election. An informed election under \n     these two subsections, once made, is irrevocable.\n       Subsection (f) requires a widow or widower who would \n     theoretically be eligible for benefits derived from more than \n     one husband or wife to make an election of one benefit. The \n     provision prevents a potential duplication of compensation \n     benefits in unusual, but predictable, circumstances. An \n     informed election under this subsection, once made, is \n     irrevocable.\n\n\n                 section 110. coordination of benefits\n\n       This section provides for reduction of benefits under this \n     title if the claimant is awarded benefits under any state or \n     federal workers' compensation system for the same covered \n     illness or death. This section is intended to prevent a \n     double recovery by individuals who have already received \n     compensation for illnesses covered by this title. Subsection \n     (a) of this section provides for a dollar-for-dollar \n     reduction of benefits under this title by the amount of \n     benefits received under this state or federal workers' \n     compensation system, less than reasonable costs of obtaining \n     such benefits. The determination of the reasonable costs \n     obtaining such benefits is a matter reserved to the Secretary \n     of Energy.\n       Subsection (b) of this section provides that, if the \n     Secretary of Energy has granted a waiver of the election \n     requirement under section 109(d)(2) of this title, the amount \n     of compensation benefits is reduced by eighty percent of the \n     net amount of any state workers' compensation benefits \n     actually received or entitled to be received in the future, \n     after deducting the claimant's reasonable costs (as \n     determined by the Secretary of Energy) of obtaining such \n     benefits. Permitting an employee whose state workers' \n     compensation remedy is secured by insurance to retain an \n     additional twenty percent of state benefits provides an \n     incentive for the employee to seek such benefits in \n     situations where the Secretary of Energy has determined that \n     it is appropriate to waive the election requirement. In these \n     circumstances; value may be obtained for insurance policies \n     purchased prior to the enactment of this title.\n\n\n                 section 111. retroactive compensation\n\n       This section allows an eligible covered employee to elect \n     to receive retroactive compensation of $100,000, in lieu of \n     any other compensation under this title, if the employee was \n     diagnosed, prior to October 1, 1999, as having a beryllium-\n     related pulmonary condition consistent with Chronic Beryllium \n     Disease and if the employee demonstrates the existence of \n     such diagnosis and condition by medical documentation created \n     during the employee's lifetime, at the time of death, or \n     autopsy.\n       When an employee who would have been eligible to elect to \n     receive retroatice compensation dies prior to making the \n     election, of any cause, the employee's survivors may make the \n     election. The right to make an election shall be afforded to \n     survivors in the order of precedence set forth in section \n     8109 of title 5, United States Code, which is based, in \n     essence, on proximity of family relationship to the covered \n     employee.\n       The employee or survivor must make the election within 30 \n     days after the date the Secretary of Energy determined to \n     award compensation for total or partial disability or within \n     30 days after the date that the Secretary informs the \n     employee or the employee's survivor of the right to make the \n     election, whichever is later, unless the Secretary extends \n     the time. Informed elections are irrevocable and binding on \n     all survivors.\n       When an employee or a survivor has made an election, no \n     other payment of compensation may be made on account of any \n     other beryllium-releated illness.\n       A determination that the covered employee had ``beryllium-\n     related pulmonary condition'' does not constitute a \n     determination that he or she had a covered illness.\n       Retroactive compensation is not subject to a cost of living \n     adjustment.\n\n\n     SECTION 112. EXCLUSIVITY OF REMEDY AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, \n                    CONTRACTORS, AND SUBCONTRACTORS\n\n       This section provides that the benefits authorized under \n     this title are an exclusive remedy for individuals against \n     the United States, DOE, and DOE contractors and \n     subcontractors, except for proceedings under a state or \n     federal workers compensation statute, subject to sections 109 \n     and 110 of this title.\n\n\n       SECTION 113. ELECTION OF REMEDY AGAINST BERYLLIUM VENDORS\n\n       This section provides that if an individual elects to \n     accept payment under this title, acceptance also will be an \n     exclusive remedy against beryllium vendors who have supplied \n     DOE with beryllium products, except for proceedings under a \n     state or federal workers compensation statute, subject to \n     sections 109 and 110.\n\n\n                           SECTION 114. CLAIM\n\n       This section adopts the requirements of a claim in section \n     8121, title 5, United States Code, which requires a claim to \n     be in writing and delivered or properly mailed to the \n     Secretary of Energy. The claim must be on an approved form, \n     contain all required information, sworn, and accompanied by  \n     a physician's certificate stating the nature of the injury \n     and the nature and probable extent of the disability, \n     although the Secretary may waive these latter four \n     requirements for reasonable cause.\n\n\n             section 115. time limitation on filing a claim\n\n       This section limits the time for fling a claim under this \n     title.\n\n\n                      section 116. review of award\n\n       This section provides that the decisions of the Secretary \n     of Energy in allowing or denying any payment under this title \n     are final, and are not subject to judicial review or review \n     by another official of the United States. For purposes of \n     this section, decisions issued by the Beryllium Compensation \n     Appeals Panel (to be established under regulations authorized \n     by section 122 of this title) are decisions of the designee \n     of the Secretary of Energy, in the same way that the \n     decisions of the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board \n     established under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8149 are decisions of the \n     designee of the Secretary of Labor.\n\n\n                    section 117. assignment of claim\n\n       This section is identical to 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8130.\n\n\n                       section 118. adjudication\n\n       Subsection (a) provides that, if the Secretary of Energy \n     establishes new criteria for establishing coverage of a \n     covered illness by specifically promulgating a regulation \n     pursuant to the authority granted by section 104(b) of this \n     title, a claimant has the right to request reconsideration of \n     a decision awarding or denying coverage. This provision is \n     intended to permit a claimant whose claim was properly denied \n     under the criteria in effect at the time of the initial \n     denial to seek and obtain reconsideration based on the new \n     criteria, notwithstanding the fact that,\n\n[[Page S14738]]\n\n     under the administrative appeal rights contained in this \n     title, the claimant would not be entitled to reconsideration.\n       Subsection (b) incorporates into this title FECA provisions \n     regarding physical examinations (Sec. 123); findings and \n     awards (Sec. 8124); misbehavior at proceedings (Sec. 8125); \n     subpoenas, oaths, and examination of witnesses (Sec. 8126); \n     representation and attorney's fees (Sec. 8127); \n     reconsideration (Sec. 8128); and recovery of overpayments \n     (Sec. 8129).\n\n\n             section 119. subrogation of the united states\n\n       This section incorporates the provisions of 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 8131 and 8132 into this title. Based on these \n     provisions, the United States has the same statutory right of \n     reimbursement of the compensation payable under this title \n     against the proceeds of any recovery from a responsible third \n     party tortfeasor as that set forth in the FECA.\n       Subsection (c) notes that, for purposes of this title, the \n     last sentence of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8131(a) that an ``employee \n     required to appear as a party or witness in the prosecution \n     of such an action [against a third party] is in an active \n     duty status while so engaged'' applies only to federal \n     employees covered under this title, as defined in section \n     103(3)(C).\n\n\n       SECTION 120. ENERGY EMPLOYEES BERYLLIUM COMPENSATION FUND\n\n       This section creates in the U.S. Treasury the Energy \n     Employees' Beryllium Compensation Fund, which consists of \n     amounts appropriated to it or transferred to it from other \n     DOE accounts and amounts that otherwise accrue to it under \n     this title. Amounts in the Fund may be used for the payment \n     of compensation and other benefits and expenses authorized by \n     this title and for payment of administrative expenses.\n\n\n        SECTION 121. FORFEITURE OF BENEFITS BY CONVICTED FELONS\n\n       Any individual convicted of violating section 1920 of title \n     18, United States Code, which prohibits false statements to \n     obtain federal employees' compensation, or any other federal \n     or state criminal statute relating to fraud in the \n     application or receipt of any benefits under the title, or \n     any other workers' compensation Act, shall forfeit (as of the \n     date of conviction) any benefits for any injury occurring on \n     or before the date of the conviction. This forfeiture is in \n     addition to any action of the Secretary of Energy under two \n     other provisions of the FECA that have been incorporated into \n     this title. Section 8106 of title 5, United States Code, \n     provides that an employee who fails to make a required report \n     or knowingly understates earnings forfeits compensation for \n     any period for which the report was required. Section 8129 \n     provides for the recovery of overpayments made to an \n     individual due to a mistake in fact or law by decreasing \n     later payments.\n       Except for payments to dependents as calculated under \n     section 8133 of title 5, United States Code, an individual \n     confined for the commission of a felony may not receive \n     benefits during the period of incarceration or retroactively \n     after release.\n       State and federal governments must make available to the \n     Secretary of Energy, upon written request, the names and \n     social security numbers of individuals who are incarcerated \n     for felony offenses.\n\n\n     SECTION 122. REGULATIONS--BERYLLIUM COMPENSATION APPEALS PANEL\n\n       This section, modeled after 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8149, authorizes \n     the Secretary of Energy to provide by regulation for the \n     creation of the Beryllium Compensation Appeals Panel. This \n     panel is intended to have the same adjudicatory authority \n     over appeals from adverse determinations of claims under this \n     title that the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board \n     exercises over appeals from adverse determinations of claims \n     under the FECA.\n\n\n              SECTION 123. CIVIL SERVICE RETENTION RIGHTS\n\n       This section provides that a federal employee who meets the \n     definition of a covered employee within the meaning of \n     section 103(3)(C) of this title has the same civil service \n     retention rights as are applicable to federal employees by \n     virtue of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8151. Civil Service \n     retention rights are administered by the Office of Personnel \n     Management; as with 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8151, see Charles J. \n     McQuistion, 37 ECAB 193 (1985), this section is intended to \n     be administered, enforced, and interpreted by OPM.\n\n\n                       SECTION 124. ANNUAL REPORT\n\n       This section provides that the Secretary of Energy will \n     prepare a report with respect to the administration of this \n     title on a fiscal year basis, and will submit this report to \n     Congress.\n\n\n              SECTION 125. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS\n\n       This section authorizes appropriations and authorizes \n     transfers from other DOE accounts, to the extent provided in \n     advance in appropriations Acts, to carry out the purposes of \n     this title. This section also provides that the Secretary \n     limit the amount for the payment of compensation and other \n     benefits to an amount not in excess of the sum of the \n     appropriations to the Fund and amounts made available by \n     transfer to the Fund.\n\n\n                       SECTION 126. CONSTRUCTION\n\n       This section provides that any amendments to provisions of \n     the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 8101-8151, which have been incorporated by \n     reference into this title, will also be effective to \n     proceedings under this title.\n\n\n                   SECTION 127. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS\n\n       This section makes conforming amendments to criminal \n     provisions of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. \n     Sec.

If the employee is eligible for an \n     award under title I, the employee may elect to receive \n     payment under this title in place of compensation under title \n     I.\n\n\n                         section 206. election\n\n       This section provides that the employee is to make the \n     election under section 205 within a certain period of time. \n     Informed elections are irrevocable and binding on all \n     survivors.\n\n\n                    section 207. survivor's election\n\n       If an individual dies before making the election, the \n     employee's survivor may make the election. The right to make \n     an election shall be afforded to survivors in the order of \n     precedence set forth in section 8109 of title 5, United \n     States Code, which is based, in essence, on proximity of \n     family relationship to the covered employee.\n\n\n                      section 208. status of award\n\n       An award is not income under the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n\n section 209. payment in full settlement of claims against the united \n                states, contractors, and subcontractors\n\n       This section provides that employees at the facility \n     eligible for benefits under this title can elect which remedy \n     to pursue.

                   S. Con. Res. 74\n\n       Whereas the Mounted Guard was assigned to the Immigration \n     Service under the Department of Commerce and Labor from 1904 \n     to 1924;\n       Whereas the founding members of this Mounted Guard included \n     Texas Rangers, sheriffs, and deputized cowboys who patrolled \n     the Texas frontier looking for smugglers, rustlers, and \n     people illegally entering the United States;\n       Whereas following the Department of Labor Appropriation Act \n     of May 28, 1924, the Border Patrol was established within the \n     Bureau of Immigration, with an initial force of 450 Patrol \n     Inspectors, a yearly budget of $1 million, and $1,300 yearly \n     pay for each Patrol Inspector, with each patrolman furnishing \n     his own horse;\n       Whereas changes regarding illegal immigration and increases \n     of contraband alcohol traffic brought about the need for this \n     young patrol force to have formal training in border \n     enforcement;\n\n[[Page S14741]]\n\n       Whereas during the Border Patrol's 75-year history, Border \n     Patrol Agents have been deputized as United States Marshals \n     on numerous occasions;\n       Whereas the Border Patrol's highly trained and motivated \n     personnel have also assisted in controlling civil \n     disturbances, performing National security details, aided in \n     foreign training and assessments, and responded with security \n     and humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of numerous \n     natural disasters;\n       Whereas the present force of over 8,000 agents, located in \n     146 stations under 21 sectors, is responsible for protecting \n     more than 8,000 miles of international land and water \n     boundaries;\n       Whereas, with the increase in drug-smuggling operations, \n     the Border Patrol has also been assigned additional \n     interdiction duties, and is the primary agency responsible \n     for drug interdiction between ports-of-entry;\n       Whereas Border Patrol agents have a dual role of protecting \n     the borders and enforcing immigration laws in a fair and \n     humane manner; and\n       Whereas the Border Patrol has a historic mission of firm \n     commitment to the enforcement of immigration laws, but also \n     one fraught with danger, as illustrated by the fact that 86 \n     agents and pilots have lost their lives in the line of duty--\n     6 in 1998 alone: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress recognizes the historical \n     significance of the United States Border Patrol's founding \n     and its 75 years of service to our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14741-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 75--EXPRESSING THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF \nCONGRESS TO THE CONTINUED EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE \n LACK OF PROGRESS TOWARD THE ESTABLISHENT OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF \nLAW IN BELARUS AND CALLING ON PRESIDENT ALEXANDER LUKASHENKA TO ENGAGE \n   IN NEGOTIATONS WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OPPOSITION AND TO \n       RESTORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF THE BELARUSIAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Campbell) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 75\n\n       Whereas the United States has a vital interest in the \n     promotion of democracy abroad and supports democracy and \n     economic development in Belarus;\n       Whereas in the Fall of 1996, President Lukashenka devised a \n     controversial referendum to impose a new constitution on \n     Belarus and abolish the Parliament, replacing it with a \n     rubber-stamp legislature;\n       Whereas Lukashenka illegally extended his own term of \n     office to 2001 by an illegitimate referendum;\n       Whereas Belarus has effectively become an authoritarian \n     police state, where human rights are routinely violated;\n       Whereas Belarusian economic development is stagnant and \n     living conditions are deplorable;\n       Whereas in May 1999, the Belarusian opposition challenged \n     Lukashenka's unconstitutional lengthening of his term by \n     staging alternative presidential elections, unleashing the \n     government crackdown;\n       Whereas the leader of the opposition, Simyon Sharetsky, was \n     forced to flee Belarus to the neighboring Baltic state of \n     Lithuania in fear for his life;\n       Whereas several leaders of the opposition--Viktor Gonchar, \n     Yuri Krasovsky, Yuri Zakharenka, Tamara Vinnikova, and other \n     members of the opposition, have disappeared;\n       Whereas the Belarusian authorities harass and persecute the \n     independent media and work to actively suppress the freedom \n     of speech;\n       Whereas the former Prime Minister Mikhail Chygir, who was a \n     candidate in the opposition's alternative presidential \n     elections in May 1999, has been held in the pretrial \n     detention on trumped up charges since April 1999;\n       Whereas President Lukashenka's government provoked the \n     clashes between riot police and the demonstrators at the \n     October 17, 1999, ``Freedom March'', which resulted in \n     injuries to demonstrators and scores of illegal arrests;\n       Whereas President Lukashenka addressed a session of the \n     Russian State Duma on October 26, 1999, advocating a merger \n     between Russia and Belarus; and\n       Whereas Anatoly Lebedko, Chairman of the Committee for \n     International Affairs of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic \n     of Belarus, Nikolay Statkevich, leader of the Social \n     Democratic Party, and Valery Shchukin, Deputy of the Supreme \n     Council, were arrested and imprisoned for taking part in the \n     Freedom March: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) condemns the current Belarusian regime;\n       (2) further condemns the arrests of Anatoly Lebedko, \n     Nikolay Statkevich, and Valery Shchukin;\n       (3) is gravely concerned about the disappearances of Viktor \n     Gonchar, Yuri Krasovsky, Yuri Zakharenka, Tamara Vinnikova, \n     and other members of the opposition;\n       (4) calls for immediate dialogue between President \n     Lukashenka and the Consultative Council of Belarusian \n     opposition and the restoration of a civilian, democratically \n     elected government in Belarus;\n       (5) calls for a duly constituted national legislature, the \n     rule of law, and an independent judiciary;\n       (6) urges President Lukashenka to respect the human rights \n     of all Belarusian citizens, including those members of the \n     opposition who are currently being illegally detained in \n     violation of their constitutional rights;\n       (7) further urges President Lukashenka to make good on his \n     promise to hold free parliamentary elections in 2000;\n       (8) supports the appeal by the Consultative Council of \n     Belarusian opposition parties to the Government of Russia, \n     the State Duma, and the Federation Council for a cessation of \n     support for Lukashenka's regime;\n       (9) calls on the international community to support the \n     opposition by continuing to meet with the legitimately \n     elected parliament; and\n       (10) calls on the President of the United States to \n     continue to--\n       (A) fund travel to the United States by the Belarusian \n     opposition figures;\n       (B) provide funding for the nongovernmental organizations \n     in Belarus; and\n       (C) support information flows into Belarus.\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1996, President Alexander \nLukashenka imposed a new constitution on Belarus that effectively \ndestroyed its nascent democracy and returned that country to a Soviet-\nstyle police state. Human rights violations are routine and living \nconditions are deplorable because of the stagnant economy. Opposition \nleader Simyon Sharetsky fled to Vilnius, Lithuania.\n  The situation in Belarus has worsened dramatically in recent months \nfor remaining members of the opposition. Some have disappeared, \nincluding Viktor Gonchar, Yuri Krasovsky, Yuri Zakharenka, and Tamara \nVinnikova. Some have been arrested for taking part in the October 17, \n1999 ``Freedom march,'' including Anatoly Lebedko, Chairman of the \nCommittee for International Affairs of the Supreme Soviet of the \nRepublic of Belarus, Nikolay Statkevich, leader of the Social \nDemocratic Party, and Valery Shchukin, Deputy of the Supreme Council.\n  Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia are very concerned about the direction \nBelarus has taken under the Lukashenka regime. Belarus' economy is \napparently imploding, and neighboring countries are concerned about \nregional instability. Our recent experience with Slobodan Milosevic's \nYugoslavia should make us all concerned about the implications of a \nruthless dictator threatening stability in Europe.\n  Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia have successfully transformed \nthemselves from Soviet-dominated Communist states to fully democratic \nmarket democracies integrated with the West and Western institutions. \nWe must be sure that Belarus does not threaten the remarkable progress \nthese stalwart countries have made in only 10 years since the fall of \nthe Soviet empire.\n  Also troubling is a draft treaty that may be signed before the end of \nthe year between Lukashenka and President Yeltsin to effect a political \nunion between Russia and Belarus. All Western countries should be \nconcerned that such a union would only hurt efforts to shore up \nRussia's economy and strengthen its fragile democracy.\n  That is why my colleague, Senator Campbell, and I join together today \nto a resolution condemning the actions of the Lukashenka regime. This \nresolution--a companion measure to one introduced by our colleague in \nthe House of Representatives, Representative Sam Gejdenson--condemns \nthe Lukashenka regime, the arrest of opposition figures and the \ndisappearance of others; calls for a dialog between Lukashenka and the \nopposition, the restoration of a democratically-elected government and \ninstitutions; calls on the U.S. President to fund travel by Belarusian \nopposition figures and for non-governmental organizations in Belarus \nand to support information flows into Belarus. I call on my colleagues \nto join us in cosponsoring this resolution.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14742-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S14742]]\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      FEINGOLD AMENDMENT NO. 2779\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD proposed an amendment to amendment No. 2748 proposed by \nhim to the bill (S. 625) to amend title 11, United States Code, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 1, line 5, strike all after ``(23) and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``under subsection (a)(3) of the commencement or continuation \n     of any eviction, unlawful detainer action, or similar \n     proceeding by a lessor against a debtor involving residential \n     real property----\n       ``(A) on which the debtor resides as a tenant under a \n     rental agreement; and\n       ``(B) with respect to which----\n       ``(i) the debtor fails to make a rent payment that \n     initially becomes due under the rental agreement or \n     applicable State law after the date of filing of the petition \n     or within the 10 days prior to the filing of the petition, if \n     the lessor files with the court a certification that the \n     debtor has not made a payment for rent and serves a copy of \n     the certification to the debtor; or\n       ``(ii) the debtor's lease has expired according to its \n     terms and (a) or a member of the lessor's immediate family \n     intends to personally occupy that property or (b) the lessor \n     has entered into an enforceable lease agreement with another \n     tenant prior to the filing of the petition, if the lessor \n     files with the court a certification of such facts with the \n     court a certification of such facts and serves a copy of the \n     certification to the debtor:\n       ``(24) under subsection (a)(3) of the commencement or \n     continuation of any eviction, unlawful detainer action, or \n     similar proceeding by a lessor against a debtor involving \n     residential real property, if during the 1-year period \n     preceding the filing of the petition, the debtor----\n       ``(A) commenced another case under this title; and\n       ``(B) failed to make a rent payment that initially became \n     due under an applicable rental agreement or State law after \n     the date of filing of the petition for that other case; or\n       ``(25) under subsection (a)(3), of an eviction action based \n     on endangerment of property or the use of an illegal drug, if \n     the lessor files with the court a certification that the \n     debtor has endangered property or used an illegal drug and \n     serves a copy of the certification to the debtor''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end of the flush material at the end \n     of the subsection the following ``With respect to the \n     applicability of paragraph (23) or (25) to a debtor with \n     respect to the commencement or continuation of a proceeding \n     described in that paragraph, the exception to the automatic \n     stay shall become effective on the 15th day after the lessor \n     meets the filing and notification requirements under that \n     paragraph, unless the debtor takes such action as may be \n     necessary to address the subject of the certification or the \n     court orders that the exception to the automatic stay shall \n     not become effective or provides for a later date of \n     applicability.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14742-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE TO MEET\n\n\n                       committee on the judiciary\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I share with my colleagues some \nvery exciting news coming out of my home state of Georgia. Earlier this \nmonth, two giant pandas, Lun Lun and Yang Yang, were delivered safely \nby UPS from Beijing, China to their new home at Zoo Atlanta after a 17-\nhour global journey.\n  Zoo Atlanta Director Dr. Terry Maple ``signed'' for the special \ndelivery during a welcoming ceremony at Atlanta's Hartsfield \nInternational Airport with more than 200 dignitaries and elementary \nschool children looking on. The very special delivery brings to six the \ntotal number of rare giant pandas now residing in the United States.\n  I would like to recognize the special role that UPS has played in \nthis long journey to bring the pandas to their new home. UPS became \ninvolved with the panda transport when Zoo Atlanta officials asked for \ntheir help in the construction and maintenance of the panda habitat. \nThe UPS Foundation agreed to give $625,000 over five years to fund the \nhabitat project at the zoo, and also agreed to provide all the \nlogistical support necessary to move the pandas from Beijing to \nAtlanta.\n  The move involved over 100 UPS employees in six cities from around \nthe world (Atlanta, Louisville, Anchorage, Singapore, Hong Kong and \nBeijing) covering travels of 7,526 miles. There were backup flight \ncrews and a backup aircraft in place in case of health problems or \nmechanical failures, customs support people to smooth the process of \nbringing the animals onto U.S. soil, and even a UPS manager to \naccompany the two-person flight crew and act as load master.\n  UPS also flew two Chinese and one American veterinarians from Beijing \nto Atlanta. The animals were unloaded by UPS air gateway employees and \nplaced in UPS package cars (the familiar brown delivery truck) that \nwere specially marked with panda graphics. The vehicles (four trucks, \ntwo as back ups in case of mechanical problems) were driven by \nspecially chosen Circle of Honor members, UPS drivers who have driven \nfor 25 years or more without an accident. The package cars were \noutfitted with air conditioning and heating units for the animals.\n  This exciting new addition to the Atlanta landscape would not have \nbeen possible without the hard work, dedication and financial support \nof many people, especially at Zoo Atlanta and UPS. I am thrilled that \nAtlanta will be a part of such an important exchange and friendship \nendeavor with the people of China and I am proud of the support and \nenthusiasm that have showered Lun Lun and Yang Yang throughout their \njourney and now that they are in their new home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14742-4", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             WAYNE COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and \ncongratulate the Wayne County Medical Society as they gather in \ncelebration of their 150th Anniversary.\n  The Wayne County Medical Society has set a pioneering tradition in \nhealth care since it was founded on April 14, 1849. They began with \nonly 50 physicians and have grown to include more than 4,200 \nphysicians. They work together to promote unity and loyalty among \nphysicians in the community and to raise awareness of public health \nissues concerning the citizens of Wayne County.\n  What is truly remarkable about this select group is the profound \nimpact they have had on the public health of the people in Detroit and \nWayne County. One of its most notable accomplishments was leading a \npolio immunization drive which vaccinated thousands of Detroiters and \nall but eliminated the threat of the crippling disease.\n  The WCMS continues to provide health care that shows no bounds with \nthe free medical and dental clinic they run at the Webber School in \nDetroit. Every child is offered free services such as physical \nexaminations, dental fluoride sealants and prophylaxis. The WCMS also \ntakes a proactive approach to health care, in 1998 they sponsored a \nteen pregnancy conference with more than 500 Detroit Public School \nstudents in attendance. The children were encouraged to abstain from \nsex and to understand the consequences of not practicing safe sex. By \nsponsoring an annual party for foster children in Wayne the WCMS shows \ntheir commitment to the community extends beyond healthcare. The WCMS \nis truly an asset to the Detroit Community.\n  The accomplishments this elite group has made in the past 150 years \nare to be commended. Guided by the spirit of charity the WCMS has \nimproved and enriched the lives of countless people. It is my hope that \nthey will continue encouraging unity among physicians and be a crusader \nfor public health in Detroit for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14742-5", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14742-S14743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN RECOGNITION OF THE REV. DR. GEORGE ELIAS MEETZE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my good \nfriend, the Reverend Dr. George Elias Meetze, who was recently named \nPastor Emeritus of Incarnation Lutheran Church in Columbia, South \nCarolina.\n  Dr. Meetze has been serving the South Carolina community for over \nsixty years. He led the congregation at\n\n[[Page S14743]]\n\nSt. Barnabas Lutheran Church in Charleston, SC from 1934 to 1937, at \nGrace Lutheran Church in Prosperity, SC from 1937 to 1942 and at \nIncarnation Lutheran Church from 1942 to 1974. In addition, Dr. George \nMeetze has been the chaplain of the South Carolina Senate for fifty \nyears.\n  His honors and affiliations are too numerous to list, but include \nleadership positions within the Lutheran Church and involvement with \nsuch organizations as the Salvation Army, The American Cancer Society, \nand The Rotary Club, which named him a Paul Harris Fellow in 1979. He \nis, as you would imagine, an active supporter of the Lutheran \nTheological Southern Seminary in Columbia, SC and Newberry College in \nNewberry, SC. A fixture in the Columbia, SC community and across the \nstate of South Carolina, Dr. George Meetze knows many people, but is \nknown by even more for his friendliness and genuine interest in every \nindividual he meets.\n  My wife, Peatsy, and I, whom Dr. George Meetze joined in marriage \ntwenty-eight years ago, commend Incarnation Lutheran Church for \nconferring the title of Pastor Emeritus on Dr. George Meetze and we \nsend our warmest congratulations to George and his family on this happy \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14743-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BRIGADIER GENERAL CLAY'S RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's \nattention to the recent retirement of Air Force Brigadier General John \nL. Clay who is retiring after 28 years of dedicated service to our \ncountry.\n  General Clay, a native of Utah, joined the Air Force following his \ngraduation from the United States Air Force Academy. He has served \nhonorably and professionally in a variety of research and development \nassignments encompassing armaments, missiles and space programs.\n  He is renowned as a developer and manager of many space systems \nprograms and currently serves as the Director of Space and Nuclear \nDeterrence in the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force for \nAcquisition.\n  His outstanding leadership, management expertise, and foresight have \nbeen the foundation for the success of major ICBM and space force \nimprovements and the effective use of $50 billion of the defense \nbudget.\n  General Clay directed the effort to replace the Minuteman missile \nguidance system. This vitally important accomplishment now provides the \nnation with a key element of our strategic deterrence capability. This \nwas the first major modification to the Minuteman system in almost 30 \nyears.\n  Additionally, he was instrumental in the comprehensive national \nreview of our nation's space launch program, including the innovative \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program which has resulted in the \nestablishment of two internationally competitive commercial families of \nvehicles capable of meeting government and commercial needs.\n  General Clay also established the Shared Early Warning System program \nfollowing the September 1998 summit agreement between Presidents \nClinton and Yeltsin. This program is a milestone in strategic \npartnerships as it allows the United States and partner countries to \nshare early warning data. It also establishes a first-ever Center for \nStrategic Stability in Colorado Springs for the upcoming Y2K \nchangeover. This Center will provide launch information to a jointly \nmanned U.S.-Russian operations team during the Y2K rollover period.\n  Unquestionably, Brigadier General John L. Clay is a man of unwavering \nloyalty and dedication. He has earned the respect of his colleagues in \nthe Air Force, defense contractors, and members of Congress.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I am pleased to convey to General Clay, my \nfellow Utahns, and his wife, Beverly, our best wishes on the occasion \nof his retirement and express our appreciation for his service to our \ncountry. We wish them well as they embark on this new chapter in their \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14743-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MAYOR FRANCIS H.

Frank's work \nwith city officials and numerous other organizations to open new lines \nof communication between the city government and the people of \nCambridge has created a local government at its best--responsive to the \nneeds of the people, accountable for its actions, and always open to \nnew ideas.\n  Frank worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for Cambridge \nfamilies. He served as the chairperson for the Cambridge Kids' Council, \nwhere he's worked to create greater opportunities in the community, \ngiving hope to children and families and providing a model for cities \nthroughout the state. The Mayor's Summer Youth Employment Program has \nbeen extremely successful in giving young men and women the opportunity \nto serve their city during the summer months, enabling them to explore \ntheir interests and enhance their lives. Frank has fought hard for the \nfamilies of Cambridge, and his legacy will live on through their \nsuccess.\n  In all of these and many other ways, Frank Duehay has served the \npeople of Cambridge with great distinction. I am honored to pay tribute \nto this remarkable leader. His public service and generosity are \nshining examples to us all. I know that I speak for all of the people \nof Cambridge when I say thank you, Frank, for your commitment and \ndedication to public service. You will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14743-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MICHIGAN TEACHER OF THE YEAR MARGARET HOLTSCHLAG TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Margaret Holtschlag on receiving the Michigan Teacher of \nthe Year award given by the Michigan Department of Education.\n  Mrs. Holtschlag, a fourth grade teacher at Murphy Elementary School \nin the Haslet School District, was selected from nearly thirty regional \nfinalists as the Michigan Teacher of the Year. Described by colleagues \nas an innovative, thoughtful and progressive teacher, her dedication is \nsecond to none. As the winning teacher, Mrs. Holtschlag will share her \nexpertise as she travels across the state working with teachers to \nimprove programs and teacher quality.\n  What is truly remarkable about Mrs. Holtschlag is that her classroom \nextends beyond a room filled with desks and chalkboards. Two years ago \nshe took a group of students on a trip to Korea and set up an Internet \npen-pal link between Haslet, China and Korea. In the past, her students \nhave built weather stations and explored nearby wetlands. Additionally, \nher students have spent time at the Michigan Library and Historical \nCenter, discovering and exploring aspects of Michigan history that can \nnot be learned from a text book.\n  For twenty-one years Mrs. Holtschlag has devoted her life to teaching \nand making a positive impact on each and every student she encounters. \nHer captivating teaching style inspires both students and colleagues \nalike. This is truly a rare gift.\n  A quality education is one of the most important tools that a child \nneeds and it gives me great joy to know that such a dynamic and caring \nteacher is helping to shape the lives of Michigan students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14743-4", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14743-S14745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NICHOLAS W. ALLARD ON THE COLLEGE APPLICATION PROCESS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, families across the country know \nthat a college education is essential for their children. A college \ngraduate earns twice what a high school graduate earns in a year, and \nclose to three\n\n[[Page S14744]]\n\ntimes what a high school dropout earns. More and more students are \napplying for college each year--over 2 million freshmen began college \nlast year. The result is increasingly heavy pressures on schools, \nfamilies, and colleges.\n  No one understands these pressures more than prospective college \nstudents and their families who are now filling out applications, \nvisiting college campuses, and preparing to make the all-important \nchoices for their futures.\n  An article by Nicholas W. Allard, in the Washington Post last week, \nprovides excellent common sense advice to prospective students and \ntheir families about the college application process. Mr. Allard, whom \nmany of us recall from his years as a staff member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, has had extensive experience in interviewing \ncollege applicants. I believe his article will be of interest to all of \nus in the Senate, and I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 9, 1999]\n\n               Navigating the College Admissions Process\n\n               (By Nicholas W. Allard, Associated Press)\n\n       A friend who is intelligent, high educated, and a wonderful \n     parent recently called me in a meltdown panic over whether to \n     give white or manila envelopes to their teenager's teachers \n     for college recommendations.\n       My anxious friend has lots of company. Every year this is \n     the season when tree leaves turn color and drop, while common \n     sense about college admissions heads south. Aside from the \n     uselessness of self-inflicted pressure, important decisions \n     by college prospects are often based on inadequate \n     information and worse advice. So I can't resist offering some \n     food for thought.\n\n\n                apply to the colleges you want to attend\n\n       Pretty basic, huh? Yet how many times have you heard advice \n     such as: ``You need some `reach' schools.'' Or ``Where's your \n     `safety' school?'' In other words, you're often encouraged to \n     think about schools in a way that ranks their desirability \n     according to the difficulty of being admitted. This approach \n     will make you feel like you are ``settling'' if you decide to \n     attend anywhere but one of the most selective schools.\n       According to Peterson's Annual Survey of Undergraduate \n     Institutions, in the United States there are almost 2,000 \n     accredited, public and private four-year colleges and \n     universities. They vary tremendously.\n       Find a handful or so of colleges out of this very large \n     number you would be enthusiastic about attending. Then, once \n     you've got your working list together, turn to the issue of \n     how to be admitted to your favorite schools.\n\n\n                     the early application program\n\n       In you're considering participating in an early application \n     program because you are very, very sure that a college is \n     your top choice, then go ahead. If you're not sure, then \n     don't do it. Think about it. What if you succeed and are \n     admitted to a place that you are not sure is your first \n     choice?\n       If the early acceptance is nonbinding, you're going to \n     apply elsewhere anyway. If it is binding, then you are stuck. \n     You are not going to find any college that will tell you it's \n     relatively easy to be admitted at the early stage. But you'll \n     tell me you are worried that some colleges admit so many \n     students early that there seem to be very few places left if \n     you wait.\n       Keep your head. Those people who are so well qualified that \n     colleges are sure they want to offer them a binding offer at \n     the early stage are taken out of the pool of applicants. They \n     are not filing multiple applications to schools that may \n     interest you. You even may appear to be a relatively stronger \n     candidate in the remaining pool come spring, especially after \n     your strong academic performance this fall.\n       And, remember, many, if not most, college applicants are \n     not accepted at the early stage. Are you sure that you want \n     to go through the angst of applying to college for the first \n     time, and then suddenly finding, without any counter-\n     balancing good news, that your hopes have been dashed and you \n     must apply in earnest to several other colleges?\n\n\n                    you and your guidance counselor\n\n       Your job is to learn enough about yourself and about \n     colleges to think clearly about where you would want to \n     attend, and then for you (not your parents) to take the lead \n     applying for admission.\n       Many high school college advisers act as if their job is to \n     make sure that you and all your classmates have been admitted \n     somewhere, anywhere. Also, understandably, they are concerned \n     about managing the bureaucratic demands of processing a large \n     volume of college applications.\n       It's not necessarily a bad thing if your list of favorite \n     colleges makes counselors nervous. Maybe they'll pay a little \n     more attention to your file. The best high school counselors \n     help you match your preferences with colleges. They also can \n     assist your campaign to be admitted where you want to go. \n     That takes a lot of time and dedication.\n\n\n                          make the process fun\n\n       Think about what it's going to be like to be on your own \n     and to live, study and goof off in a new place, meeting new \n     people. Take advantage of the need to pause, to make a \n     detailed report about what you've accomplished in this first \n     part of your life. In this way the college application can be \n     more than a chore. It can be a satisfying inventory of \n     positives and promote honest self-evaluation of how you want \n     to grow or change or improve.\n       The application process doesn't have to be nerve-racking. \n     If you only apply to schools that really turn you on, then \n     you really don't have to worry about being accepted to the \n     wrong place.\n       In the unlikely event that you do not gain acceptance to \n     any of your favorite schools, maybe you should take another \n     year and do something that interests you or prepare yourself \n     to reapply to colleges after spending some time better \n     equipping yourself for college.\n       The dirty little secret is that there simply is no single \n     school that will make or break your future.\n\n\n                          be a `smart shopper'\n\n       You are in the market for one of the most expensive, most \n     valuable things you will ever acquire; a college education.\n       Have you talked to people who have recently attended the \n     colleges that you are considering? What have you read about \n     the colleges? Have you visited colleges that you are \n     seriously considering, alone, without your family?\n       The traditional family summer tour of colleges is a nice \n     starting point and often can be very helpful in eliminating \n     college choices. But in terms of getting a good feel for what \n     it's like to be a student on campus during a term, there is \n     only so much you can learn by staring at bricks and mortar \n     from the outside of empty buildings, while trying to act as \n     if you are not actually part of your family encourage--how \n     embarrassing.\n       Thump the melon, test-drive the car, try to get, on your \n     own, to the few colleges that most interest you. Bring a \n     sleeping bag, arrange to stay, if you can, in the dorm room \n     of a friend or somebody who graduated from your home area \n     high schools. Attend class, find out how bad the food is in \n     the dining hall, attend an athletic event or concert, go \n     read, in the library and work on some homework in the midst \n     of other students doing the same thing.\n       If you're already in your senior year and haven't done \n     this, it's not too late. And, of course, after you are \n     accepted at a college you certainly have the opportunity to \n     visit before you make your decision.\n\n\n                              be yourself\n\n       When you're applying to college you certainly want to put \n     your best foot forward and present an accurate and compelling \n     case for admission. But above all things, remember to be \n     yourself.\n       Suppose, if by some miracle, you actually were able to \n     gussy up your application and essays to come across as a \n     different person or convincingly act out a role in an \n     interview. Would the college be accepting the wrong person? \n     More practically, it just often doesn't work to try to be \n     someone else. Phoniness is difficult to maintain, and in most \n     cases it's transparent.\n       This also means that the application form that you complete \n     should be your own work. Relax; take the task seriously; do \n     the best job you can and don't forget: Parents, teachers and \n     consultants who have too large a hand in preparing \n     applications leave very visible fingerprints.\n\n\n                         the interview process\n\n       Colleges generally do not require interviews, but, if \n     available, they provide an opportunity to learn more about a \n     school and to supplement your written application.\n       If you have an interview with an alumni volunteer, remember \n     they are not decision makers. Their task is to collect \n     information and pass it on. They can be very good or very \n     bad. Count on this: Whatever they report to their alma maters \n     will be taken with a full shaker of salt. Their views will \n     not outweigh the record you have built over time, the \n     evaluations of professional teachers who have seen you in a \n     class context or your own words on your application.\n       Still, alumni interviews can help uncover or reinforce \n     strengths and corroborate the profile that appears on the \n     written application file. Again, be yourself, and be prepared \n     for a variation of the inevitable final interview question: \n     ``Is there anything else you would like to ask me?''\n       Also, if you're wondering about what to wear to an \n     interview, the acceptable range of attire is very broad. On \n     matters of dress, and all such questions about your \n     application, let your own good judgment be your guide.\n\n\n                   don't worry about other applicants\n\n       It is simply not true that somebody else in your school or \n     your neighborhood is competing with you for a spot that they \n     might take away your space at a college that you want to \n     attend.\n       At the very most selective colleges you are not competing \n     against the person sitting next to you in a classroom, you'r \n     competing against the national pool of applicants.\n       In colleges that are less selective, if you make a \n     compelling case that satisfies its requirements, you have a \n     very good chance of being accepted. Your case for acceptance \n     is not diminished, it is not less compelling if other \n     qualified candidates in your community are accepted.\n       In any event, know that any information you have about \n     other candidates for acceptance is suspect: What somebody's \n     board\n\n[[Page S14745]]\n\n     scores supposedly are or are not; whether or not a particular \n     college has a quota for your high school; what a college has \n     supposedly communicated to a candidate; what athletes have \n     been told; whether students with learning disabilities get a \n     fair shake--it's all unreliable.\n       None of it helps you make your case and it will get your \n     stomach juices roiling if you pay attention to such gossip.\n       Have confidence in yourself. Focus on what you can do \n     something about, which is your own application and at the end \n     of the day things will work out just fine. Be happy if people \n     you know also are accepted to a college of your choice. \n     You'll already know people to embrace or avoid when you get \n     to campus in the fall.\n\n\n                          making your decision\n\n       Don't torture yourself about the choice you make. Remember, \n     you've carefully compiled a list of schools that make sense \n     for you. Be liberated in the idea that you can't make a wrong \n     decision.\n       Attending college is expensive. Whether or not you receive \n     scholarships, take out loans, or get a part-time job, it's \n     likely your college education is going to cost a lot. Talk \n     this over with your family and determine your realistic \n     options.\n       In the end, after you carefully weigh the different factors \n     that are important to you, it's probably going to come down \n     to a gut reaction. Trust your own instincts. Make up your \n     mind and then get excited about it. Also make sure to thank \n     your parents, other family members, teachers and advisers.\n\n\n                              and, finally\n\n       I'm not a professional admissions officer or an educator. I \n     don't know any particulars about you or your situation. I \n     just suggest you think about the questions raised.\n       Don't let hopes about college become a black cloud over the \n     best year of high school.\n       Oh, either white or manila envelopes are fine, but don't \n     forget the postage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14745-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING PAULA DUGGAN\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

BOBBY BOSS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great \nAmerican institution and its leader. The American Legion Barrett-Davis-\nWatson Post #233 is located in a small Georgia town called Loganville \nand it is commanded by a true patriot in every sense of the word--Mr. \nBobby Boss. For over 50 years this man's leadership has allowed the \npost to continue offering community services that any American would be \nproud of.\n  Post #233 held its first meeting on November 19, 1946 with the \nLegion's standard program of the day: patriotism, rehabilitation, \ncommunity service, community welfare and membership. Less than ten \nyears after its inception, the Post responded to the town of \nLoganville's need for a medical doctor by building a clinic. The Post \nlater donated a truck and tractor to the city.\n  Over the past 40 years, the Post has continued to make numerous \ndonations to the community, including an annual $1,500 donation to the \ntown's elementary school to help purchase shoes and clothes for the \nneedy and a $12,000 donation for dropout prevention programs in all \nWalton County Schools.\n  Tragedy struck the Post in 1977 when a fire all but destroyed the \nPost building, leaving nothing but ashes and concrete. At the first \nmonthly meeting after the fire, a majority of the members present chose \nnot to rebuild, but Commander Boss was not in that majority. Two weeks \nafter that meeting, he took his own bulldozer and cleared the charred \nremains. His efforts resulted in the fine building the Post uses today.\n  Once the Post was back on its feet, many of the programs that had \nfallen by the wayside due to rebuilding costs were reinstated. In the \npast 10 years alone, Post #233 has supported renovation projects for \nthe city of Loganville and donated $8,000 towards the purchase of \ncomputers for the local high school; donated half the costs of building \na baseball field complete with lights, restrooms and a concession \nstand. Post #233 has also contributed funds to help the local Sheriff's \ndepartment purchase camera equipment for patrol cars. This Christmas \nseason, members of Post #233 will prepare and deliver more than one \nthousand baskets for widows, the disabled and needy families.\n  The good work of Post #233 represents all that is noble in our great \nnation. I applaud their community service and their patriotism. They \nare an asset to their community, the great state of Georgia and the \nUnited States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14745-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HENRI TERMEER PRESENTED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BOSTON'S \n                           GOLDEN DOOR AWARD\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to have this \nopportunity to congratulate Henri Termeer on receiving the Golden Door \nAward from the International Institute of Boston. I also congratulate \nHenri for recently being sworn in as a United States citizen during a \nceremony on October 29.\n  As chairman, chief executive officer and president of Genzyme \nCorporation, one of the largest biotechnology companies in the world, \nHenri is renowned as a pioneer in the industry. He serves on the board \nof directors of both the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the \nindustry's national trade association, and the Pharmaceutical Research \nand Manufacturers of America, a national pharmaceutical trade \norganization.\n  It is very fitting, indeed, that Henri was honored with the Golden \nDoor Award, which is presented to US citizens of foreign birth who have \nmade outstanding contributions to American society. Henri is a native \nof the Netherlands, and in recent years he has received numerous honors \nsuch as the Anti-Defamation League's Torch of Liberty Award and the \nGovernor's New American Appreciation Award. He was also recently \ninducted as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n  Throughout his career in biotechnology, Henri has been a strong \nadvocate for the responsibility of industry and government to make \nlife-saving drug treatments available to all people in need, regardless \nof their economic status or geographic location. Under Henri's \nleadership, Genzyme has worked diligently over the years to make this \nvision a reality.\n  In addition to his commitment to patients, Henri is also a leader in \npromoting educational opportunities for minorities. Since 1995, he has \nbeen a director of the Biomedical Science Careers Project, which \nprovides corporate scholarships to academically outstanding minority \nhigh school students. In May 1999, the group presented Henri with \nhighest honor, the Hope Award.\n  Henri's extensive record of public service includes his role as a \ndirector of the Massachusetts Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, as a trustee \nand vice-chairman of the Boston Museum of Science, and as a member of \nthe Massachusetts Council on Economic Growth and Technology.\n  In receiving the Golden Door award, Henri joins a distinguished list \nof previous recipients including Arthur Fiedler, the famed former \nconductor of the Boston Pops; Jean Mayer, the eminent nutritionist, \neducator, and former president of Tufts University; and An Wang, the \nfounder of Wang Labs.\n  I commend Henri Termeer for this well-deserved award, and for his new \nAmerican citizenship. Massachusetts is proud of him, and I congratulate \nhim for his many impressive contributions to our Nation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14746-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S14746]]\n                       DEATH ON THE HIGH SEAS ACT\n\n Mr. McCain. Mr. President, most unfortunately it appears \nunlikely that House and Senate conferees will be able to reach \nagreement this year on a multi-year bill to reauthorize the Federal \nAviation Administration. I am bitterly disappointed at Congress' \ninability to act on this legislation because of a number of \nparliamentary budget fights that ignore the dire need to pass this \nbill. Yet one of my most prominent disappointments is the likelihood \nthat Congress' efforts to amend the Death on the High Seas Act will \nfall by the wayside in the short term. We will be forced to postpone \nout efforts to make damage recovery fair for all family members of \naviation accident victims who have died.\n  The Death on the High Seas Act is a 1920's-era law that was put in \nplace to help compensate the wives of sailors who died at sea. The law \nallows survivors to recover pecuniary damages, or the lost wages of \ntheir relatives on whom they depended upon financially. Unlike modern \ntort law, the Death on the High Seas Act does not allow family members \nto recover for non-monetary damages, such as for pain and suffering, or \nto seek punitive damages.\n  Despite its benevolent inception, the Death on the High Seas Act has \nbeen used to limit the recovery of damages among the families of \nairline passengers whose lives have been lost over international \nwaters. The family members of those who died on TWA Flight 800 and \nEgyptAir Flight 990, for instance, will not be able to seek the same \ncompensation that they would be entitled to if these accidents had \noccurred over land. The parents of children killed in these accidents \ncannot sustain a legal claim for damages, since they did not depend \nupon their children as the family breadwinners. That is an inequity and \nan unintended consequence that we need to fix.\n  As I said earlier, Congress intended to fix these problems in the \ncontext of the FAA reauthorization bill, yet negotiations have stalled \nfor unrelated reasons. Consequently, I want to pledge every effort to \nmove Death on the High Seas Act legislation independently, as soon as \npossible next year.\n  The Commerce Committee will hold additional hearings on this issue as \nsoon as Congress reconvenes in 2000. I will take the lead in working \nwith my colleagues to ensure that legislation to limit the application \nof the Death on the High Seas Act to aviation accidents moves as \nquickly as possible through Congress. I believe it enjoys enormous \nsupport within Congress. At the very least, it should not be bogged \ndown in unrelated controversies.\n  The families of aviation accident victims over international waters \nhave waited far too long for Congress to make sure that their losses \nare accorded the same respect as those associated with accidents over \nland. Family members should know that their children have value in the \neyes of the law. The recent aviation tragedies only highlight the need \nfor prompt action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14746-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14746-S14747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IMMIGRATION ESSAY CONTEST\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, each year, the American \nImmigration Law Foundation and the American Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation sponsor a national writing contest on immigration. \nThousands of fifth grade students across the country participate in the \ncompetition, answering the question, ``Why I'm Glad America is a Nation \nof Immigrants.''\n  In fact, ``A Nation of Immigrants'' was the title of a book that my \nbrother President Kennedy wrote in 1958 at a time when he was a \nSenator. All his life, he took pride in America's great heritage and \nhistory of immigration.\n  As one of the judges of this year's contest, I was immensely \nimpressed with the quality of the students' writing and the pride of \nthe students in America's immigrant heritage. Many of the students told \nthe story of their own family's immigration to the United States.\n  The winner of this year's contest is Crystal Uvalle, a fifth grader \nfrom Pennsylvania. She wrote about her father's immigrant background \nand how he came to America 20 years ago. Other students honored for the \nhigh quality of their essays were Leif Holmstrand and Eugene Yakubov of \nChicago, Samantha Huber of Fredonia, Wisconsin, Alexa Lash of Miami, \nand Daniel Rocha of Media, Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, I believe these award winning essays from the \n``Celebrate America'' essay contest will be of interest to all of us in \nthe Senate, and I ask that they be printed in the Record.\n  The essays follow:\n\n            Why I am Glad America Is a Nation of Immigrants\n\n                (By Crystal Uvalle, Grand Prize Winner)\n\n     It was about 20 years ago,\n     A man come here from Mexico.\n     He sought a better way to live,\n     And found he had a lot to give.\n     He didn't speak a word of English,\n     So he took a job busing dishes.\n     To learn his new country's ways,\n     He worked and studied everyday.\n     He made Dallas his new home,\n     And before he knew it he was in the know.\n     He worked his way up in that restaurant,\n     And a lady there, his eye she caught.\n     She was a native of another state,\n     And he asked her out on a date.\n     She liked pierogies and roast beef,\n     He liked tamales and spicy meat.\n     It didn't take long, they were in love,\n     Then God sent them a baby from heaven above.\n     I'm so happy for them you see,\n     That man and woman and I make three.\n     I'm so happy America let him in,\n     He's my father and my friend.\n\n       I love you Daddy!\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 America, America--They Came To Be Free\n\n                (By Leif Holmstrand, Chicago, Illinois)\n\n       I dedicate this song to my Farfar (father's father), who \n     came to America from Sweden In 1920.

Lynn, of Texas, to be United States District \n     Judge for the Northern District of Texas.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the confirmation \nof Ronald Gould to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Since 1975, Ron has practiced law at the Seattle law firm of Perkins \nCoie, specializing in commercial litigation, and the numerous letters \nof support and recommendation that I have received throughout this long \nprocess attest to the high regard in which he is held by the legal \ncommunity in Washington state.\n  Ron's admirable professional and academic record, however, while \nalone enough to qualify him for the federal bench, is only a small part \nof what will make him an asset to the Ninth Circuit. While \ndistinguishing himself professionally, Ron has actively participated in \nvolunteer legal, civic, and community organizations and projects too \nnumerous to recite in full.\n  In addition to being a former President of the Washington State Bar \nAssociation, Ron Gould has served on the historical societies for the \nSupreme Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, has co-chaired, \nwith Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire, a project to \ndevelop mediation in high schools, and has been a member of Washington \nWomen Lawyers, and the Washington Association of Lawyers with \nDisabilities.\n  Among the many non-legal, civic organizations in which Ron has been \ninvolved is the Boyscouts of America, for which Ron has served on the \nExecutive Board of the Chief Seattle Council since 1984.\n  Ron's legal and life experience has been extraordinary. So \nextraordinary that I am pleased to vote to confirm him to one of the \npositions of highest honor and responsibility in this country.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening in very strong \nsupport of my friend Ronald Gould's confirmation to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit. This has been a long hard-fought battle \nand I commend him for his patience, perseverance, and persistence. We \nmade it, Ron. Congratulations!\n  Let me share with my colleagues some of the special things about \nRonald Gould that make him a person I was proud to recommend to the \nPresident for a seat on the Federal bench. He has personally supported \nme in my political career and helped others to believe in me. Ron is an \nexcellent lawyer, a strong advocate for the legal profession, a \ncommunity booster, a dedicated family man, a Distinguished Eagle Scout, \nand a man who has overcome much in his personal life to continue to be \nall of these things. I am honored to have been a part of his journey to \nthe Federal bench.\n  I would like to highlight some of Mr. Gould's personal history. He \nmarried his wife Suzanne more than 30 years ago, and they have two \nchildren. their 23-year-old son Daniel, who is also an Eagle Scout, is \na jazz saxophone performer and technology student who recently \ngraduated from Stanford University and founded his own Internet\n\n[[Page S14748]]\n\nstartup business. Their 20-year-old daughter Rebecca is a sophomore at \nHampshire College in Amherst, MA. Rebecca was selected for the Seattle \n``High School Hall of Fame'' for her courage in conquering challenges \nfollowing an auto accident in which she was seriously injured.\n  Mr. Gould also has been supported in this and all other endeavors of \nhis life by his mother, Sylvia Gould. She is an active 81-year old \nwalker and swimmer who justifiably takes some credit for her son's \naccomplishments since she encouraged him to do well in school and \nsucceed as a Boy Scout.\n  Mr. Gould graduated the Wharton School of Business and Commerce at \nthe University of Pennsylvania with a B.S. in economics. He received \nhis J.D. degree in May 1973, graduating magna cum laude from the \nUniversity of Michigan Law School where he won academic awards and \nserved as editor-in-chief of the Michigan Law Review. During law school \nhe received the Abram Sempliner Memorial Award for legal excellence, \nthe Henry Bates Memorial Scholarship, and the Order of the Coif.\n  After law school, Mr. Gould served as a law clerk for Judge Wade \nMcCree on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. He next \nserved as a law clerk for Justice Potter Stewart at the U.S. Supreme \nCourt during the 1974 term.\n  Since December 1975, Mr. Gould has practiced law as an associate and \nthen as a partner with Seattle's largest firm, Perkins Coie. He has had \na varied civil litigation practice, including litigation in antitrust, \nbanking, director and officer liability, and trade secrets. Mr. Gould \nis highly respected in his field and has worked for many of our \nregion's most influential companies and constituencies.\n\n  Mr. Gould's fellow lawyers in the King County Bar Association honored \nhim with the 1987 Award for Distinguished Service to the Legal \nProfession and Public. He was elected to the Board of Governors of the \nWashington State Bar Association for 1988-91 and served as President of \nthe Washington State Bar Association for its 1994-95 term. Also, as \nPresident-Elect and as President of the Washington State Bar \nAssociation, Ron co-founded with Washington State Attorney General \nChristine Gregoire a project to implement mediation in Washington State \nhigh schools to prevent youth violence. This program teaches young \npeople how to avoid the kind of tragedies our nation has seen too much \nof in recent years.\n  Mr. Gould shares my commitment to public education. He has served \nBellevue Community College as a trustee from 1993 to the present and \nwas elected chair of the Board of Trustees in 1996.\n  In addition, Mr. Gould has served as a member of several legal \ndelegations under the People to People Citizen Ambassador Program, \nfounded by President Eisenhower and supported by Presidents since as a \nmeans of enhancing international personal diplomacy and goodwill. He \nhas participated in legal delegations to eastern Asia, Tokyo, and \nEastern Europe.\n  Mr. Gould's long and consistent leadership service to the Boy Scouts \nhas been well-recognized. He became an Eagle Scout in 1962. He serves \non the executive board of the Chief Seattle Council of Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, which serves over 40,000 youth and participating adult \nleaders. Mr. Gould has served as vice president for Programs, vice \npresident for Exploring, vice president for Special Events and chair of \nthe Jamboree Committee. In 1995, he received the Silver Beaver Award \nfor Chief Seattle Council, the highest award given to volunteer \nleaders. In 1998, he received from Boy Scouts of America the \nDistinguished Eagle Scout Award, reflecting decades of service to \nscouting and his profession.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their decision to support \nMr. Gould's confirmation unanimously. Again, I am proud of Ron and look \nforward to seeing him serve justice as a circuit court judge. I have no \ndoubt he will carry his commitment to the profession and to the larger \ncommunity to the federal bench and be one of our outstanding Ninth \nCircuit judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14748-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14748-S14749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume legislative session.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the two nominees who have been \nconfirmed, Ronald Gould for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and \nBarbara Lynn, U.S. district judge for the Northern District of Texas, \nhave indeed received august, important lifetime appointments. Federal \njudgeships are great offices. The persons who receive them are \ncommitted to a lifetime of dedication to law. They must conduct \nthemselves with the highest degree of professionalism and integrity. We \nbelieve both of those nominees will meet that standard. I am pleased \nthis could be concluded tonight.\n  With regard to Mr. Gould, I want to share these thoughts. He is a \nmost capable man who has overcome personal adversity to reach the \nposition to which he has been confirmed this evening. He has achieved a \nreputation as an excellent lawyer and as a person who is respected \nthroughout his area of the country, for both his legal skills, and for \nhis commitment to voluntarism within his community, as evidenced by his \ncontinuing service with the Boy Scouts of America. I am proud for him \ntonight. However, I have supported his nomination with some concern, \nnot because of anything he has done, but because of my concern about \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Over the past 20 years, the Ninth Circuit has established a \nreputation as an extremely activist circuit. It is a large and \nimportant circuit, covering over 20 percent of the American population, \nand I believe that it is a circuit that we have a responsibility in \nthis body to do something about. A couple of years ago, 28 cases from \nthis Circuit were reviewed by the Supreme Court; 27 were reversed. Over \nthe last several years, the Ninth Circuit has had by far the highest \nreversal rate of any circuit in the country. They have been an \nextremely liberal, activist circuit that has consistently gone too far \nin protecting the rights of criminals, and is far too quick to find \nthat legislative acts or referendums have violated the Constitution. \nThat is a fact without dispute by many legal scholars in this country. \nIndeed, the New York Times recently wrote that a majority of the U.S. \nSupreme Court considers the Ninth Circuit to be a rogue circuit.\n  My sole concern about Mr. Gould's nomination is that I don't believe \nhis appointment and confirmation, by itself, will cause any significant \nmovement of that circuit back to the mainstream of American law. We \nwant to confirm the nominees the President gives the Senate when they \nare men and women of demonstrated integrity and ability, and when their \nrecords and backgrounds indicate that they have the ability to adhere \nto the law, to follow Supreme Court rulings, to follow the \nConstitution, to follow laws passed by the people through their elected \nrepresentatives, and to recognize that it is not their function as \njudges to make law.\n  I have concluded that Mr. Gould's confirmation should go forward \ntoday because I think he has demonstrated that he recognizes his proper \nrole as a federal judge, and I have not held up his nomination, as any \nSenator would have a right to do. However, there are other nominees \npending for this circuit who I believe have a record of activism that, \nin my view, does not warrant their confirmation, particularly to a \ncircuit that is already known to be an activist circuit.\n  I wanted to share those remarks because I wanted to state for the \nrecord that this Senate has been very cooperative with the President's \ndesire to get his nominations confirmed, as evidenced by the fact that \nthere have been over 325 Federal judges nominated to this body and \nconfirmed. Only one judge has been rejected, and very few have been \nheld up for any length of time. Those that have been held up are the \njudges with whom many Senators have some serious concerns. Most judges, \nhowever, are moving along in a prompt and efficient manner.\n  Comments and complaints to the contrary notwithstanding, this Senate \nhas a constitutional duty to advise and consent with the President on \nany nomination to the Federal courts, and we have a duty and a \nresponsibility to make sure that each and every circuit judge in this \ncountry understands what the supreme law of the land is, and that \ncircuit judges should respect the prerogatives of the people through\n\n[[Page S14749]]\n\ntheir elected representatives to pass laws which the judges are \nrequired to enforce, whether the judges personally like them or not. We \nneed to make sure our circuits, and every Federal judge we see, are \nconsistent with that view and follow that script.\n\n  Mr. Gould is a capable attorney, an Eagle Scout, and a man of great \npersonal integrity, it appears. He will soon assume a position on the \nU.S. Circuit Court for the Ninth Circuit. It is a great honor, and I \ncongratulate him for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/17/senate-section/article/S14749-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1999\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
