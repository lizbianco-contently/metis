DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S10124]]\n\nwas very faithful. We had a very warm relationship.\n  When I served in the House, I can remember one of the first \nconversations we had was about a national park in Nevada. I had never \ncontemplated a national park in Nevada. We did not have one. I, \nfrankly, did not know the history of Nevada as it related to the area \naround Mt. Wheeler. I did not realize that Key Pittman, a longtime \nSenator from Nevada, had sent President Reagan's Director of the Park \nService, William Penn Mott, there when he was a park ranger in the \n1930s to find a site in Nevada for a national park, and this is the \nspot that he found and gave this information to President Roosevelt.\n  Over the years, many political battles ensued and the park never came \ninto being. I did some wilderness legislation for Nevada. It was \nextremely controversial. But based on my conversations with Bruce \nVento, I decided to peel off some of what we were doing in wilderness \nand go for a national park. It was one of the best things I ever did; \nwe now have a national park in Nevada, Great Basin National Park, which \nis really a world wonder. It has a mountain peak over 13,000 feet high; \nit has Nevada's only glacier; it has the oldest living thing in the \nworld, the bristlecone pine--over 5,000 years old. They were there \nbefore Christ came to Earth; they were there during the time the \npyramids were built. In addition, Lehman Caves is located inside the \npark boundary.\n  Without talking more about the park itself, just the inception of \nthat idea came to me as a result of a conversation I had with Bruce \nVento as a new Member of the House of Representatives. He was very \ninterested in things related to the environment.\n  Bruce Vento being dead now is hard to contemplate because he worked \nso hard on his physical body. A few years ago, while here at his home \nin Washington, he fell off the roof while doing some work and was \nbroken up very badly. But it only kept him from his gym work for a \nshort period of time, even though he had broken bones.\n  Bruce Vento died as a result of asbestosis which he contracted as a \nyoung man while working with asbestos. Out of nowhere he developed a \nlung problem. Last year he had a lung removed. They were hoping that \nthey got it. They didn't. And a few weeks ago it was announced they did \nnot. I am sure his family and those close to him knew that his life was \nnot going to be long, but I didn't know.\n  I am really saddened at the death of Bruce Vento. He is somebody who \nI will always remember. I will always remember him for his smile and \nhis love for the environment and, on a personal basis, for what he did \nto quicken my mind about the possibility of having a national park in \nNevada.\n  Our country is less today than it was yesterday as a result of the \npassing of Bruce Vento. I expressed to his family the great affection \nthat I and many Members, those who work with me in the Congress, have \nfor Bruce. I wish them, no I don't wish them--I give them the knowledge \nthat the passage of time will lessen the anguish they now feel. \nHopefully, as the months pass by, only memories of their love and loss \nwill be in their minds, and not the fact of their loss; the fact of the \nmany things he contributed to this country will be paramount in their \nminds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I heard the remarks of our colleague from \nNevada about our good friend, Bruce Vento. I also express my deepest \nsympathies to his family at their loss. It is a loss to them and it is \na loss to America. Bruce Vento was a man who educated many of us, \nincluding myself, as to the great value of our national parks; that in \nmany ways they are the repositories of America's dream, of what kind of \na country we were and what kind of an America we wish to leave for \nfuture generations.\n  I had the opportunity to talk to Congressman Vento just a few weeks \nago on behalf of a national park that I feel very deeply about, \nEverglades National Park. As always, he was extremely solicitous of \ninformation and forthcoming in his willingness to be of assistance.\n  I am saddened today at the news of Bruce Vento's passing. America, \nand particularly our great natural treasures, have lost a tremendous \nfriend and articulate advocate on their behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10124-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10124-S10127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BUDGETING PROCESS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I come this afternoon to the floor for two \nreasons. The first is to express my general dismay at the status of the \nbudgeting process for this year. Second is to give a specific example \nof how this process has resulted in a program--which was clearly \noutlined and approved by Congress and signed into law by the President \nas the Equity Transportation Act for the 21st Century, generally \nreferred to as TEA-21--has been convoluted.\n  Let me first talk about the general budgeting process for this year. \nWe are now 10 days into the new fiscal year, and substantial parts of \nour budget have yet to be enacted and sent to the President for his \nconsideration. Even more dismaying than that is what is in the budgets \nthat we have passed and sent to the President. I use, as example, No. \n1, the most recent budget this Senate has acted upon when, last Friday, \nwe passed the Transportation appropriations conference committee \nreport.\n  First, the process. I was very interested in this bill, as will \nbecome apparent as I move to point No. 2 of my remarks. Yet it was not \navailable until Friday morning, the same morning that we were called to \nvote upon this very complex bill which will allocate some $58 billion \nof our National Treasury. Even today, specific details are yet to be \ndiscerned. So we are operating as alleged pilots of the national fiscal \ntrust through dark clouds and fog and driving rain, unaware of where we \nare or where we have gone.\n  I am also very concerned about the specific numbers in this \nlegislation. I know this has been an issue of great concern to our \nPresiding Officer, who has, in his period in the Senate, distinguished \nhimself as one who is very concerned about our fiscal discipline.\n  For the fiscal year 2000, which ended September 30, we had a \nTransportation appropriations amount of $50.7 billion. That is what we \nspent over the preceding 12 months. We have been operating under a \nbudget resolution which, because of its own complexities, is difficult \nto align precisely with one of the specific appropriations bills, but \nwe have had a general philosophy that the appropriations for fiscal \nyear 2001 should not grow at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. \nAccording to the Consumer Price Index for the period July 1999 to July \n2000, the rate of inflation for the United States was 3.5 percent.\n  If you add 3.5 percent to last year's Transportation appropriations, \nyou would add, in rounded numbers, $1.775 billion for a total of \n$52.475 billion. That would have been the goal, the destination, the \nceiling for spending under this Transportation account using the \nprinciple that the budget should be restrained to the rate of \ninflation.\n  The administration submitted a budget for this account that was $54.6 \nbillion. The Senate passed a Transportation bill which was $54.8 \nbillion.\n  But when the bill came back from the conference committee with the \nHouse, the total amount of the bill that we voted on favorably last \nFriday was $58 billion, a 14-percent growth over the expenditure on the \nsame account for the previous fiscal year. That is a staggering \nincrease, and it is an increase which puts at risk many of the things \nupon which the political campaigns of the fall of 2000 have focused \ntheir attention: How are we going to spend the non-Social Security \nsurplus? How will we utilize the $2.2 trillion that is projected to \ncome into the National Treasury over the next 10 years? I underscore \nthat the $2.2 trillion is on the assumption that we will hold spending \nfor this 10-year period to the rate of inflation. That rate was 3\\1/2\\ \npercent. Yet in this one budget we have spent 14 percent.\n  If this budget were to be the standard by which we operated--this \nbudget represents about 8 percent of the total discretionary spending \nof the United States. If we exceed every budget by the same amount that \nwe have done with this one budget of Transportation, we will diminish \nthat non-Social Security surplus in the range of 35 to 40 percent. This \nis serious business because we are making representations to the \nAmerican people that we are going to protect that surplus; that we are \ngoing to use it either for targeted tax cuts, to\n\n[[Page S10125]]\n\nuse it to build up our Social Security and Medicare program, and \nfinance a prescription drug benefit or for large-scale tax cuts.\n  We are about to make all of those options unattainable if we do not \nexercise a greater degree of discipline over our spending this year and \nset the standard for what the spending will be over the next 9 years of \nthis decade.\n  I first raise the alarm as to the process and the consequences of the \nbudgets with which we are dealing as we conclude this session of \nCongress and lay out the fiscal plan for the Federal Government for the \nyear 2001.\n  The second reason for my being here this afternoon is to bring to the \nattention of the Senate and the American people what we have done to \none of the most innovative aspects of the Transportation Equity Act for \nthe 21st Century, TEA-21.\n  In March of 1998, Congress overwhelmingly approved this \ngroundbreaking transportation legislation to revamp the distribution of \nFederal highway funds. That legislation established, among other \nthings, the intelligent transportation system, or ITS program, which \nsets aside money for research, development, and deployment of the \ncomponents of an intelligent transportation system. The goal: to \nestablish a sound policy for dealing with traffic congestion in the new \nmillennium. The ITS program will work to solve congestion and safety, \nimprove operating efficiencies in transit and commercial vehicles, and \nreduce the environmental impact of the growing travel demand.\n  The intelligent transportation systems use things such as modern \ncomputers, management techniques, and information technologies to \nimprove the flow of traffic. ITS applications range from electronic \nhighway signs that direct drivers away from accidents or other sources \nof congestion on the highways, to advanced radio advisories, to more \nefficient public transit.\n  Congress has sought to reward States that develop an intelligent \ntransportation system. Demand for roads is increasing, particularly in \nthe most populous and fastest growing areas of our country. Business \ncommutes are getting longer, leisure travel options are becoming wider. \nStates were encouraged to make use of advanced communications \ntechnology to ease gridlock.\n  This plan, developed by the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nwhere our Presiding Officer serves as chair of the subcommittee that \nhas responsibility for this very legislation, was thoughtful and the \nplan had a specific purpose in mind: to foster the growth of \nintelligent transportation systems and, in a scientific manner, to \ngather results from the new ITS programs so that we could make wise \ndecisions about the future direction of ITS when the next \ntransportation bill is authorized in approximately 2003.\n  I am sad to report that this plan has come undone through the \nappropriations process. Allow me to explain how this has happened.\n  The Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A University, in \nconjunction with many State departments of transportation, conducts a \nperiodic study of the traffic conditions in our Nation. The latest \nannual mobility report produced in 1999 ranked the 70 most congested \nurban areas, cities, and small towns in America. It would seem \nreasonable, it would make common sense that those cities with the worst \ntraffic congestion would receive Federal funds to implement, improve, \nor expand their intelligent transportation system. Indeed, the creators \nof the intelligent transportation system program in TEA-21 meant it to \nwork that way. The law says that ITS projects must be selected through \ncompetitive solicitation and meet certain detailed criteria for program \nfunding dollars.\n\n  I will read a few excerpts from that law. The authors set out the \ngathering of effective data as a goal in TEA-21:\n\n       To assure that Federal, State, and local transportation \n     officials have adequate knowledge of intelligent \n     transportation systems for full consideration in the \n     transportation planning process.\n\n  To me, that means we need to be able to offer to Federal, State, and \nlocal transportation officials accurate and scientific data on ITS. The \nauthors of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century spelled \nit out more precisely when they said:\n\n       The Secretary shall select for funding through competitive \n     solicitations projects that will serve as models to improve \n     transportation efficiency, promote safety. . . .\n\n  And for other reasons listed in the statute.\n  Unfortunately, the intent of the legislation has not followed. It was \nnot followed first in the fiscal year 2000. Of the total $221 million \nmade available in the fiscal year 2000, the year that ended September \n30 of this year, all but about 10 percent of that $211 million was \nearmarked. For those who are not familiar with the jargon of the \nCongress, ``earmarked'' means there was a total amount of money \navailable for a particular objective, in this case to fund the \nintelligent transportation systems, which, according to statute, was to \nbe allocated based on competition. Of that $211 million, 90 percent of \nit had a specific designation to a particular State or community within \nthe United States.\n  According to the Texas report, the 15 most congested cities in the \nUnited States as of 1999 were: Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, \nWashington, DC, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, San Diego, \nHouston, New York City, Portland, and San Jose.\n  Mr. President, would you be surprised, would you be stunned and \nappalled, if I were to tell you that in the fiscal year 2000, none of \nthose 15 cities received any of the intelligent transportation system \nmoney? The 15 most congested cities in America, according to the \nnational survey upon which we rely, were allocated a penny for ITS \nmoney.\n  Of the other most congested cities highlighted in the Texas \ntransportation study, only five received funds, while a sixth city \nprobably will receive funds from an overall earmark to the State in \nwhich it was located. Those funds, for the five cities and the one \nState, totaled only $7 million or 3 percent of the total ITS \nappropriation of $211 million.\n  We have 75 of the most congested cities in America, cities in urban \nareas and smaller communities getting 3 percent of the money to assist \nthem, through intelligent transportation systems technologies, in \nimproving their traffic congestion. I was so offended by that that I, \non September 15 of this year, wrote a letter to the Transportation \nappropriations conferees urging them, for the year 2001, which began \nOctober 1 of this year, not to repeat the mistake made in the previous \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I quote the concluding paragraph of the \nletter, which states:\n\n       I encourage you to adhere to the design created by TEA-21. \n     The Congress has the opportunity, through ITS and other \n     programs, to strengthen our national transportation \n     infrastructure in a cost-effective, efficient manner. We \n     undermine those efforts if we don't follow the criteria \n     established and passed by Congress in TEA-21.\n\n  So in that context, it was with dismay that last Friday morning, when \nI finally had an opportunity to look at the Transportation conference \nreport, I realized that again we were committing the same mistake. For \nthe second year in a row, none of the top 15 traffic-choked cities got \nfunding for intelligent transportation system technology to assist them \nin alleviating their gridlock.\n  Taking the list even further, none of the top 20 most congested \ncities received intelligent transportation system funding. Those \nadditional five cities included Denver, Phoenix, San Bernardino, \nMinneapolis-St. Paul, and Tacoma, WA. Those five cities are added to \nthe 15 that I have previously read in the category of cities that are \nthe most 20 congested cities in America, none of whom received any of \nthe intelligent transportation system money. This suggests to me a \ntotal disconnect between the problem that led to the creation of ITS in \nthe first place and the allocation of dollars by the appropriators.\n  In addition to that fundamental disconnect, I am also concerned that \nthe amounts of money that have been earmarked appear to be \nnonscientific. If you look at the conference report, you will see round \nfigures, such as $200,000, $500,000, $1 million, $2 million, and so\n\n[[Page S10126]]\n\nforth. Such figures are unlikely to be to the real dollar amount needed \nto fund well-designed, specific projects.\n  Investment in intelligent transportation technology pays huge \ndividends, but it is expensive. As an example, on February 17 of this \nyear, I did one of my monthly workdays with the evolving ITS technology \nin and around Orlando, FL. Orlando has the most advanced intelligent \ntransportation system program in my State. The first phase of the \nOrlando system cost nearly $8 million. When complete, the Orlando ITS \nsystem will cost about $14 million. In these earmarks, I wonder whether \nsuch small sums, such round numbers, are actually calculated to reach \nthe critical mass needed to get a project underway and completed. Small \nsums, distributed widely across the Nation, are not the most effective, \nefficient way to use these precious dollars to alleviate priority \ncongestion concerns.\n  Lastly and possibly most crucially, we are missing a critical \nopportunity: the opportunity to gather data in a scientific, meaningful \nway about an evolving technology, a technology which has the potential \nto mitigate traffic congestion and make our highways safer.\n  Gathering this information is important because TEA-21 was the first \nsurface transportation bill to focus to such an extent on intelligent \ntransportation systems. The authors of TEA-21 wanted to push the \nenvelope and emphasize the use of technology as a strategy to ease \ntraffic gridlock.\n  In 2 or 3 years from now, when we are reauthorizing the next surface \ntransportation bill, we will need to ask: Did these ITS programs work? \nIf so, what are the key elements in their successes? Should we expand \nITS as a strategy to reduce traffic congestion? If we do not use the \nresources that we have devoted to ITS in a prudent, rational, \nscientific way, will we have the experience and information necessary \nto answer those questions in an informed way?\n\n  The short answer to that is, no.\n  The 2-year history of ITS causes concern for other Senate action. We \nhave just finished debate on the Interior appropriations bill, a \nthoughtful piece of legislation. The Conservation and Reinvestment Act, \nCARA, was sidetracked by that Interior appropriations bill and replaced \nwith language which assures that the appropriators will control \nspecific allocations. The CARA bill had a vision, a vision to provide \nthe American people with a permanent, dedicated source of funding to \ninvest in our children's futures by preserving and protecting our \nnatural resources--the very cause for which our departed friend, \nCongressman Bruce Vento, spent so much of his life and his \ncongressional career.\n  This bill would have bolstered the Federal Government's relationship \nwith our State governments by maintaining the Federal side of a \nrespectful partnership, with the States to develop and support natural \ntreasures, from urban parks and historic sites to the preservation of \nour coastal resources.\n  But instead of this carefully constructed program, which enjoyed \nwidespread support, we were left with the following by the \nappropriations conference report. Quoting from that conference report \nfor the Department of the Interior:\n\n       This program is not mandatory and does not guarantee annual \n     appropriations.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have \n     discretion in the amounts to be appropriated each year, \n     subject to certain maximum amounts as described herein.\n\n  With that language, we have declared failure. We have failed to take \nadvantage of our opportunity to enact landmark conservation \nlegislation. We would be wildly optimistic to expect that the goals of \nthe CARA legislation will be met.\n  With what we now see has happened to ITS, to intelligent \ntransportation systems, what confidence can Americans have that the \ngoal of protecting our natural resources will be met? What reason do we \nhave to expect a different outcome, with the dream of sustained \ninvestment in protecting our natural resources, than the shredded \nresults of reduced traffic congestion through intelligent \ntransportation systems? The short answer is, none.\n  Returning to the Transportation appropriations bill, earmarks, in my \nview, are more acceptable in mature transportation programs than where \nwe are attempting to learn about new technologies and policy \napproaches. We can and should address the needs of specific \ncommunities. ITS, however, is an evolving resource in transportation, \nand we should adhere to the intent of the law in seeking a competitive, \nscientific process to distribute these ITS funds.\n  This appropriations process, with respect to ITS, has foreclosed the \nvaluable information which a rational distribution of funds would have \ngiven us.\n  In conclusion, I am concerned about the broad path upon which we are \ntraveling as we conclude the consideration of the appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2001. We are dramatically overspending the standard we \nset for ourselves just a few months ago. By that overspending, we are \nputting at risk the opportunity to use a significant Federal surplus \nfor a variety of very beneficial purposes which will aid our people not \nonly this year but for decades to come. And, within our appropriations, \nwe are losing the opportunity to intelligently allocate funds against \nthe targeted goals, such as the reduction of traffic congestion or the \nprotection of our natural resources. Rather, we are succumbing to the \ntemptation to earmark, to specify, based on considerations other than \nwhat is in a rational, long-term plan of prioritization of our Nation's \nneeds.\n  We have but a few days left in this session, I hope. It would be my \nfondest expectation--or at least my optimistic dream--that we would use \nthese few remaining days in a more constructive manner than has been \ndemonstrated in the past few days, that we would use these to exercise \nprinciples of fiscal discipline and vision and the willingness to put \naside our personal and parochial interests for what is in the broader \nnational interest.\n\n  That is our challenge. That is what the American people expect of \ntheir elected representatives. It is a goal on which we have faltered \nin recent days. Let us use the remaining days to regain our solid \nfiscal footing.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2000.\n       Dear Conferee: I have been concerned about the distribution \n     of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) money in the \n     Transportation Appropriation process.\n       The Environment and Public Works Committee designed TEA-21 \n     so that ITS projects would be selected through competitive \n     solicitation and meet certain detailed criteria. There was an \n     overall plan: a portion of the money would specifically go to \n     rural areas, and no state could receive more than $35 million \n     per fiscal year. Other than that, the competitive process \n     would be used to ensure the most efficient, effective use of \n     the dollars. Essentially, the ITS theory is to make our \n     highways, especially in high congestion areas, as efficient \n     as possible, recognizing the tremendous costs of building \n     additional lanes or other high capacity improvements. The \n     intent is to make our existing highways serve to maximum \n     capacity.\n       There are two major concerns about the current manner of \n     distribution of ITS funds. First, the current earmarks appear \n     to be allocated on a non-scientific, non-competitive basis. \n     The Texas Transportation Institute in the Texas A \n     University System is the organization that the U.S. \n     Department of Transportation and the Congress look to for a \n     professional assessment of highway congestion in our nation. \n     Comparing recent appropriations bills with the institute's \n     annual traffic congestion study show how far apart reality is \n     from what is needed. For example, the ten most congested \n     cities in the United States are: Los Angeles, Washington, DC, \n     Miami, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Detroit, Atlanta, San \n     Diego and San Bernardino. Looking at the ITS FY01 earmarks, \n     none of these most congested cities got funding for ITS \n     technology to alleviate gridlock. Of the other 60 most-\n     congested-cities featured in the study, only 5 receive funds, \n     while a sixth city probably receives funds from an overall \n     state earmark. These six funds total only $7,000,000 or 3% \n     out of a total ITS appropriation of $211,200,000.\n       Second, the amount of money that has been earmarked appears \n     to be non-scientific. They are round figures of $200,000, \n     $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,000,000 and the like. Investment in \n     intelligent transportation technology pays huge dividends, \n     but it is expensive. We wonder whether such small sums, while \n     helpful, actually reach the critical mass needed to get a \n     project underway. Small sums, distributed widely across the \n     nation, are not the most effective, efficient way to use \n     these funds in alleviating priority congestion concerns.\n       This is important because TEA-21 was the first surface \n     transportation bill to focus to such an extent on ITS. We \n     wanted to push the envelope and emphasize the use of \n     technology to ease traffic gridlock. In two to three years \n     from now when we reauthorize\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\n     the next surface transportation bill, we will need to ask: \n     did these programs work? If we do not use the resources that \n     we have devoted to ITS in a prudent, rational, scientific \n     way, we will not have the experience and information \n     necessary to answer that question in an informed way. \n     Earmarks, in my view, are more acceptable in mature \n     transportation programs. We can and should address the needs \n     of specific communities. ITS, however, is an evolving \n     resource in transportation, and we should adhere to the \n     intent of the law in seeking a competitive, more scientific \n     process to distribute ITS funds.\n       I encourage you to adhere to the design created by TEA-21. \n     The Congress has the opportunity, through ITS and other \n     programs, to strengthen our national transportation \n     infrastructure in a cost-effective, efficient manner. We \n     undermine those efforts if we don't follow the criteria \n     established and passed by the Congress in TEA-21.\n       With kind regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bob Graham,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10127-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10127-S10129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNFINISHED BUSINESS IN HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of the 106th \nCongress. No one is quite sure where the finish line is. My expectation \nis that within a week or two this Congress will be history.\n  Many will ask what this Congress did and what it did not do. There \nwill be some people who will be joyous about its accomplishments and \nsome who will be sorely disappointed over its failures. I think its \naccomplishments, however, will be a rather short list, and the areas \nwhere we could have and should have done better will represent a very \nlong list. I rise to briefly discuss two of those areas before we near \nthe end of the session.\n  I have spoken many times in the Senate about health care, and \nespecially the two issues this Congress has a responsibility to \naddress. One issue is providing a prescription drug benefit to the \nMedicare program. We have talked about providing a prescription drug \nbenefit to the Medicare program for some long while. We are near the \nend of this session, and it looks as though it will not get done. Why? \nBecause some people don't want to do it well. Everybody here talks \nabout wanting to do this, but somehow they are not willing to support a \nplan that really accomplishes it.\n  On the second issue, we are nearing the end of the legislative \nsession and we are apparently not going to pass a Patients' Bill of \nRights. The Patients' Bill of Rights has been an issue over which we \nhave battled for 2 to 3 years, and it has been a tough battle. I don't \nthink there ought to be room left for those who believe there is not a \nneed for a Patients' Bill of Rights. All we have to do is look at the \nevidence. The evidence is overwhelming that we need to pass a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights. The House did it; we have not. This Senate \nhas dug in its heels and has not moved on either of these issues.\n  I will talk first about the issue of a prescription drug benefit in \nthe Medicare program. When the Medicare program was developed, many of \nthe miracle drugs that now exist weren't available. People got old. \nThey did what they were expected to when they got old. They retired and \nled a more sedentary life. Then something might happen to them. They \nwould be hospitalized. They would stay for long periods in acute care \nbeds in the hospital. It was very expensive. The kinds of prescription \ndrugs that are available now were not available then.\n  So when Medicare was created, a prescription drug benefit was not \nmade a part of the Medicare program. When Medicare was developed, that \ntoo was fairly controversial. In the early 1960s, a fair number of \nMembers of this Senate said: No, we can't do that. We can't provide \nhealth insurance for older Americans. We oppose that. That is some sort \nof encroachment of government into our lives.\n  I wasn't here at the time of that debate. But when they had that \ndebate, fully one-half of all senior citizens in this country had no \nhealth insurance coverage at all. Why? Because it was too expensive.\n  Insurance companies aren't running around this country trying to find \nold people to sell health insurance to. That is just a fact of life. \nThey want to find somebody who is 22 years old and healthy as a horse \nand isn't going to need any health care treatment for a long while. \nThere are not people running around trying to figure out how they can \nattract a 70-year-old or a 75-year-old to buy their health insurance \npolicy. They are not doing that because it is much more expensive to \ninsure people who are 70 and 80 years of age. The result was, nearly 40 \nyears ago half of the senior citizens in this country had no health \ninsurance coverage at all.\n  So this Congress had a big debate. As is typical, those progressive \nvoices who said this is something we should do were met by those voices \nof negativity who oppose everything for the first time. There are \nalways people who just dig in their heels at any suggestion and say, \nno, this can't be done; no, it won't work.\n\n  Well, enough votes prevailed in the Congress over time that it passed \na Medicare proposal. Now 99 percent of America's senior citizens are \ncovered with health insurance under the Medicare program. What a \nremarkable success. People are living longer, better, healthier lives.\n  Now we know, however, that there is a deficiency in the Medicare \nprogram. The deficiency is that it does not cover prescription drugs. \nLet us me read some letters from North Dakotans. We could name a \ndifferent State, and we would get exactly the same letters. My \ncolleague from Florida just spoke. His constituents, I am sure, are \nwriting exactly the same letters.\n  This is from a woman who lives in Bismarck, ND. She writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: I am writing in regard to the \n     medication I take. I think something has to be done about the \n     prices they charge. I get $303 each month in Social Security. \n     I pay $400 a month for my medication. I have had heart \n     surgery and I have osteoporosis and this medicine is very \n     high-priced. We are using our savings now and I am 86 years \n     old so I can't work. Can you help?\n\n  This is a letter from a fellow in Rolla, ND. He writes:\n\n       Between me and my wife, we pay $350 to $400 a month on \n     prescription drugs. We receive less than $900 a month in \n     combined Social Security benefits. We have trouble paying for \n     our prescription drugs.\n\n  A person from Rocklake, ND, writes:\n\n       One-fourth of my Social Security check goes for my \n     prescription drugs, so that doesn't leave a lot for household \n     and personal expenses. It would sure help if Medicare covered \n     these.\n\n  A man from Cavalier, ND, writes:\n\n       Our drugs for the two of us--he is referring to his wife \n     and himself--just about tripled last year from the year \n     before. The total for last year was near $2300, and it only \n     gets worse. We need a little help.\n\n  A woman from Williston, ND, who titled her letter ``Message In A \nBottle,'' writes:\n\n       I have asthma and my medications and inhalers cost me over \n     $100 each month, and my health insurance does not cover \n     prescriptions. I am 84 years old, and it would be a great \n     help to me to get Medicare coverage on my medications.\n\n  A woman from Bismarck, ND, writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: Enclosed please find my prescription \n     bottles. I just had these medicines filled today. I am having \n     a hard time financially with a Social Security check of $400 \n     a month. My medicines cost $175 per month. That doesn't leave \n     much to pay for food, rent, utilities and gas. Something has \n     to be done with the high cost of prescription medicines. I am \n     thinking of stopping some of my medicines. Please help!!!\n\n  These letters could have come from any State, from senior citizens \neverywhere struggling mightily to pay for their prescription drugs. \nSenior citizens make up 12 percent of America's population, but they \nconsume one-third of all the prescription drugs in our country because \nthey have reached that age where they have various ailments and \nproblems and they need prescription drugs.\n  We need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program. \nWe have been trying very hard to do that. Some have said, well, let's \nnot put it in the Medicare program, let's pay the insurance industry so \nthey will sell an insurance policy providing for prescription drug \nbenefits. The problem with\n\n[[Page S10128]]\n\nthat is, the Health Insurance Association of America says insurance \ncompanies will not be able to put together a policy like that which is \naffordable. In fact, I had CEOs from two insurance companies come to my \noffice, and one said: In order to provide $1,000 worth of benefits to a \nsenior citizen for prescription drugs, I would have to charge $1,100 \nfor the premium. Do you know anybody that will pay $1,100 for an \ninsurance policy that provides $1,000 worth of benefits? Not where I \nlive.\n  I say to those who say we can have the private insurance industry \ndeal with this: it won't work. Even if they could offer the policy, it \nwould not be affordable. We must, it seems to me, put a prescription \ndrug benefit in the Medicare program, and we ought to do it now.\n  We are nearing the end of this session and this ought to have been \none of the top priorities for the Congress. It just should have been \none of our top priorities. We live in good economic times, we have \nunprecedented economic growth, and we are going to have some surpluses \nthis year and, we hope, in the years ahead. But do you know what the \npriority was for the surpluses? The priority was to run out here on a \nbig trolley a huge batch of tax proposals that would give big tax cuts \nreally fast. Let's provide very large tax cuts, most of which will go \nto the upper-income folks in this country, and let's do it even before \nwe experience these surpluses.\n  My feeling is that we ought to have a more balanced approach. First, \nif we have surpluses, let's use some of those funds to pay down the \nFederal debt. Yes, we can use some, perhaps, for middle-income tax \ncuts, and we could use some of it to make the other investments we need \nto make. We should put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nProgram that is optional, has a copayment, and provides Medicare \nrecipients protection against these high drug prices.\n  The proposal I support also has the ability, through purchasing \npower, to drive down prescription drug prices. So I say to those who \nschedule the Senate: Time is wasting here. Let's see if between now and \nthe end of this week or next week we can perhaps get a prescription \ndrug benefit bill to the floor of the Senate and get it passed. Those \nwho want to give tax cuts to the top 1 percent of the income earners \nwere certainly quick to get that to the floor of the Senate. Let's see \nif we can't do something similar in terms of legislative speed to try \nto add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. We have \ntime to do that. The question is, Do we have the will to do it?\n  Just one other point. I want to talk for a moment about the issue of \na Patients' Bill of Rights. A Patients' Bill of Rights is not some \ntheory that represents our interests or a wish. It is an absolute \nnecessity to provide protection for patients in this country. Some \nmanaged care plans--although not all of them--have decided that health \ncare is a function of their profit and loss. They administer their \nhealth care plans that way. The result has been devastating to some \npatients in our health care system. In fact, in some cases an HMO will \nnot tell you all of your options for medical treatment, only the \ncheapest options. That is not fair.\n\n  Every patient in this country ought to have a right to understand all \nof his or her options for medical treatment, not just the cheapest one. \nThere are some HMOs that don't give you the opportunity to have \nemergency room treatment when you have an emergency. That ought to be a \npatient's right. There have been instances of people hauled into an \nemergency room unconscious who are denied coverage because the HMO said \nthey didn't get prior approval for the emergency room. It ought to be a \npatient's right, if you have insurance through an HMO, to have \nemergency room treatment when you have an emergency.\n  How about oncology care? In the case of a woman who has breast cancer \nand whose spouse's employer switches to a different health care plan, \nshould that woman not be able to continue with her same oncologist and \nwith the same cancer treatment under the new plan? Of course she ought \nto be able to. That ought to be a right.\n  I had a hearing recently with some of my colleagues on this subject, \nand a woman named Mary Lewandowski came. It was the third time Mary has \ncome to Washington, DC, at her own expense. I want, for Mary's benefit, \nto put in the Record her complete testimony from this hearing. I ask \nunanimous consent that her entire testimony be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Testimony of Mary Munnings Lewandowski Before the Democratic Policy \n                     Committee, September 21, 2000\n\n       My name is Mary Munnings Lewandowski. I reside in \n     Scottsville, NY. The picture that I have brought with me, is \n     my youngest daughter Donna Marie at age 18.\n       This is my third trip to Washington to plead for passage of \n     a bill that will protect patients rights. I've pounded on \n     doors, handed out pictures of Donna and a picture of her \n     headstone. I've done most anything I can to make people here \n     aware that the Patients Bill of Rights is a Life and Death \n     issue.\n       The week of February 3rd, 1997 Donna went to our PCP 4 \n     times in 5 days. With each visit her symptoms were worsening. \n     She was told that she had an upper respiratory infection and \n     panic attacks. On Saturday Feb 8th, she could barely get off \n     the couch. I assisted her up the stairs to get cleaned up at \n     8 PM. At 8:30 she started crying that she was very ill. I \n     tried repeatedly to reach our PCP but only reached the \n     answering service, as this was a Saturday evening.\n       I called the hospital at 9 and was told I couldn't bring \n     her in unless her doctor authorized it or if I thought it was \n     a life and death situation.\n       I am a school bus driver and a mom not a doctor or a nurse. \n     At 9:10 I called 911, at 9:12 she screamed that her back hurt \n     and that she thought she was going to die. She lapsed into a \n     coma. My husband tried in vain to do CPR on her. She was \n     pronounced dead at 10:45 PM at the young age of 22.\n       I went to our PCP on Monday and the very first thing that \n     was told to me, was ``they couldn't justify to her HMO to \n     send her for the diagnostic tests that would have shown what \n     was wrong with her''.\n       22 year old kids, don't die. There were no tests done, \n     none. In my subsequent research I found that HMO's can and do \n     penalize and sanction doctors for ordering tests which HMO's \n     feel are unnecessary.\n       I found out on Tuesday, February 11th, that she died from a \n     bloodclot on her lung, literally the size of a football. A \n     $750 lung scan would have shown this. But all for the sake of \n     money, we lost a vital beautiful young lady that had only \n     begun her life.\n       We were at the cemetery in August and my 6 year old \n     granddaughter was with me. She went to Donna's grave and \n     started crying. ``Grandma, I shouldn't have to come here to \n     see my Aunt Donna'' Why did God take her.\n       Please, it is up to you, the Senators, our elected \n     officials to change things. Health insurers should not be \n     able to put profits before a person's life.\n       There is evidence that lives have been lost because of HMO \n     decisions. Isn't that enough reason to pass legislation that \n     would provide direct protection to patients?\n       Please, pass legislation that ensures that patients like my \n     daughter get the test they need and access to emergency care \n     before it is too late.\n       It could be your loved one.\n       Thank you for your time.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mary lost her youngest daughter, Donna, at age 22.\n  She said:\n\n       The week of February 3, 1997, Donna went to our PCP--that \n     is her primary care provider--4 times in 5 days.\n       With each visit her symptoms were worsening. She was told \n     she had an upper respiratory infection and panic attacks. On \n     Saturday, February 8th, she could barely get off the couch. I \n     assisted her up the stairs to get cleaned up at 8 p.m. At \n     8:30 she started crying that she was very ill.

At 9:10 I called 911, at 9:12 she screamed that her \n     back hurt and that she thought she was going to die. She \n     lapsed into a coma. She was pronounced dead at 10:45 p.m. at \n     the young age of 22.\n       I went to our PCP on Monday and the very first thing that \n     was told to me was they couldn't justify to her HMO to send \n     her for the diagnostic tests that would have shown what was \n     wrong with her. Twenty-two-year-old kids don't die, so there \n     were no tests done. None. In my subsequent research, I found \n     that HMOs can and do penalize and sanction doctors for \n     ordering tests which HMOs feel are unnecessary. I found out \n     on Tuesday, February 11, she died from a blood clot on her \n     lung literally the size of a football. A $750 lung scan would \n     have shown this. But all for the sake of money, we lost a \n     vital beautiful young lady that had only begun her life.\n\n  I have about 50 stories just like this which have been compiled from \nall around the country--people dealing with HMOs and discovering they \nhave\n\n[[Page S10129]]\n\nto fight their cancer and their health plans at the same time. That is \nnot a fair fight.\n  We should pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. Now, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights and this \nSenate passed what I call a ``patients' bill of goods.'' It is a hollow \nvessel, one of those charade-like things that doesn't do anything. In \nfact, the Republican Congressmen from the House have said the Senate \npassed proposal is a step backward, even worse than nothing. It is a \ncharade. We still have an opportunity to enact a real Patients' Bill of \nRights. This legislation is still in conference. This Congress can, in \nits final days, pass the Patients' Bill of Rights. When Mary \nLewandowski comes to Washington, DC, three times because her daughter \ndied--and this young woman should not have died--and says, ``Do \nsomething, please,'' we have a responsibility to respond. We ought to \ndo it now.\n  If the past is prologue, of course, we will end this session and we \nwill not do the kinds of things we should--putting a prescription drug \nbenefit in the Medicare program or enacting a real Patients' Bill of \nRights. The American people will have lost. We will be back in January \norganizing as a new Congress and many of us will reintroduce exactly \nthe same legislation. We will, once again, engage in this battle. The \nbattle will not be over until we get done what needs to be done. Go \nback 40 years and the same people who stood on the floor of the Senate \nand opposed Medicare, oppose doing these important tasks. They do not \nthink the Federal Government should do it. This same mentality is what \nis now providing the roadblock for doing what we should and adding a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare and passing a real Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  We can alter that result. We can do it this week, if there is the \nwill. There is a way. The question for the Members of this body is, \nDoes the will exist in the Senate to do the right thing in these final \ndays? I hope so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from North Dakota that \nI very much agree with him that we should be taking up the Patients' \nBill of Rights legislation. I hope he will join those of us on this \nside of the aisle when we bring a conference report to this body which \nwill report a very important Patients' Bill of Rights piece of \nlegislation. We would then hope to pass it in the Senate, send it over \nto the House of Representatives, and have the President sign it.\n  I am very much hopeful that we can get such a conference report to \nthe Senate and that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nhelp us to pass it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10129-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10129-S10133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CHINA'S THREAT TO U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to talk about something this \nafternoon that I think is of great importance to this country and one \nof the biggest challenges we are going to face in the coming years; \nthat is, the challenge of how the United States manages our \nrelationships with countries that potentially present threats to our \nnational security.\n  While few would like to admit it, I think China cannot be omitted \nfrom this scrutiny, and I, therefore, would like to discuss that \nquestion with respect to China today.\n  As my colleagues know, it was not long ago that the bill to grant \npermanent normal trade status to China passed through the Senate \nwithout amendment. I voted for this bill because I recognize the \neconomic benefits it will have for many American workers, businesses, \nand consumers. That said, it is of utmost importance that we not lose \nsight of the fact that trade alone does not define our relationship \nwith China. The actions and the heated rhetoric of China's communist \nleaders should be of great concern. So now, in the aftermath of our \nrecent decision to grant PNTR to China, we are obligated to face the \nother challenges presented by the communist Chinese government.\n  Time and time again, Chinese officials and state-sponsored media have \nmade bellicose and threatening statements aimed at the United States \nand our long-standing, democratic ally, Taiwan. They have even gone so \nfar as to issue implied threats to use nuclear weapons against the \nUnited States. The question is, will we take them at their word on \nthese defense matters as we did when they made trade commitments.\n  For example, in 1995, General Xiong Guangkai warned a visiting U.S. \nofficial that China could use military force to prevent Taiwan's \ngaining independence without fear of U.S. intervention because American \nleaders ``care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan.'' An \neditorial in a military-owned newspaper this March was more blunt, \nwarning that, ``The United States will not sacrifice 200 million \nAmericans for 20 million Taiwanese.''\n  In February of this year, a state-owned paper again warned the United \nStates against becoming involved in a conflict with China over Taiwan. \nThe People's Liberation Army Daily carried an article which stated, \n``On the Taiwan issue, it is very likely that the United States will \nwalk to the point where it injures others while ruining itself.'' The \narticle went on to issue a veiled threat to attack the U.S. with long-\nrange missiles, stating, ``China is neither Iraq or Yugoslavia * * * it \nis a country that has certain abilities of launching a strategic \ncounterattack and the capacity of launching a long-distance strike. \nProbably it is not a wise move to be at war with a country such as \nChina, a point which U.S. policymakers know fairly well also.''\n  Not only has China warned against U.S. military intervention in the \nevent that Taiwan declares its independence, Chinese officials have \nalso issued threats against U.S. sale of theater missile defenses (TMD) \nto Taiwan. In February 1999, China's top arms control official, Sha \nZukang, was interviewed by a reporter for the publication Defense News. \nWhen asked if U.S. assistance on theater missile defense for Japan, \nSouth Korea and possibly Taiwan could cause damage to U.S.-China \nrelations, he replied, ``If the U.S. is bent on its own way on this \nissue, it will not, to put it lightly, be conducive to the development \nof legitimate self-defense needs of relevant countries.'' When further \nquestioned about theater missile defense for Taiwan, he stated, ``In \nthe case of Taiwan, my God, that's really the limit. It constitutes a \nserious infringement of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. \nIt also represents a deliberate move on the part of the United States \nto provoke the entire Chinese people. Such a move will bring severe \nconsequences.'' (Emphasis added) According to the Washington Post in \nJuly, that same Chinese official warned that the sale of U.S. \ntechnology to Taiwan for a smaller scope theater missile defense system \nwould ``lead to serious confrontation'' because it would be tantamount \nto restoring a military alliance between Taipei and Washington. He \nstated, ``This is of supreme national interest. It will be defended at \nany cost.'' (Emphasis added)\n  These are not examples of isolated threats. They are a small sample \nof the bellicose statements that China's government has made recently. \nI have compiled dozens of such statements and am disappointed at the \nsparse attention they have received. Mr. President, I have compiled a \ndocument containing 14 pages of threats issued by communist Chinese \nofficials. It is by no means a comprehensive compendium of such \nstatements, and is merely a sample. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDENT OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the rhetoric from Beijing has also been \naccompanied by troubling actions. China has long-range nuclear-tipped \nmissiles targeted at American cities, and is already increasing its \narsenal of such weapons. It is greatly increasing the number of short-\nrange missiles aimed at Taiwan, and has taken steps to improve its \nability to invade or blockade the island.\n  China has also been the world's worst proliferator of missiles and \nweapons of mass destruction. It has sold ballistic missile technology \nto Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, and Pakistan, despite promising to \nadhere to the Missile Technology Control Regime. It has sold nuclear \ntechnology to Iran and Pakistan. It has aided Iran's chemical\n\n[[Page S10130]]\n\nweapons program and sold that nation advanced cruise missiles. Because \nof China's assistance to rogue nations and its military advances, the \nAmerican people, and our forces and friends abroad, face a much greater \nthreat.\n\n  Mr. President, as we craft effective national security policies for \nthe United States, it's important that we look for warning signs of \nproblems. As Winston Churchill said, in his ``Iron Curtain'' speech in \n1946, less than one year after the end of World War II, ``Last time, I \nsaw it all coming and I cried aloud to my own fellow-countrymen and to \nthe world, but no one paid any attention. Up till the year 1933 or even \n1935, Germany might have been saved from the awful fate which has \novertaken her * * * There never was a war in all history easier to \nprevent by timely action than the one which has just desolated such \ngreat areas of the globe * * * but no one would listen * * * We surely \nmust not let that happen again.''\n  Now, more than 50 years later, we live in a very different world. The \ncollapse of the Soviet empire, the spread of democracy and civil \nsociety in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, and the emergence of the \nUnited States as the sole-surviving superpower could lead some to \nmistakenly assume that the world is no longer a dangerous place.\n  To the contrary, the threats we face today are even more complex and \nharder to predict than those we faced during and before the Cold War. \nWe must now be more clear than ever in our own minds about our \nstrategic intentions, and just as clear in signaling these to our \npotential aggressors.\n  Obviously, China is not Nazi Germany, and it presents different \nchallenges, yet the message delivered by Churchill about the need to \nheed warning signs is timeless. Many are quick to dismiss the rhetoric \nfrom Beijing as empty threats. This could be true, but I believe we \nmust be prepared for another possibility--what if China's leaders mean \nwhat they say?\n  China's proliferation of the technology for ballistic missiles and \nweapons of mass destruction has increased the threat faced by the \nUnited States and our allies. China is increasing the size and \ncapabilities of its strategic nuclear force targeted on the United \nStates. And furthermore, China has tried to use the threat of missile \nattack to coerce the United States into staying out of any future \nconflict in the Taiwan Strait.\n  These are but three of the many compelling reasons why we need a \nnational missile defense system to protect the United States and to \nguarantee our freedom of action. I disagree with those who claim \nChina's objection to our proposed national missile defense, NMD, system \nwill lead to an arms race with that country. As Secretary of Defense \nWilliam Cohen testified to the Senate in July of this year, ``I think \nit's fair to say that China, irrespective of what we do on NMD, will in \nfact, modernize and increase its ICBM capability.'' Of course, that is \nprecisely what China has done. Left with this reality, we have no \noption but to deploy a national missile defense system that will \nprotect the United States.\n  Frankly, I am disappointed that for the last eight years, the \nClinton-Gore Administration has failed to pursue the most promising \nforms of missile defense and has underfunded the limited programs it \nhas authorized due to loyalty to the ABM Treaty. For example, one of \nthe Administration's first decisions in early 1993 was to return \nunopened proposals the Defense Department had requested from three \nteams of companies that had bid to develop a ground-based national \nmissile defense interceptor. In 1993, the Clinton Administration also \ncut the budget for missile defense for fiscal year 1994 by $2.5 billion \nover the amount requested in President Bush's final budget, and has \ncontinued to underfund missile defense programs every year.\n  I believe that the ABM Treaty is obsolete. It was made with an entity \nthat no longer exists. In the words of former Secretary of State Henry \nKissinger, this treaty ``constrains the nation's missile defense \nprograms to an intolerable degree in the day and age when ballistic \nmissiles are so attractive to so many countries.'' Dr. Kissinger has \nalso stated that, ``Deliberate vulnerability when the technologies are \navailable to avoid it cannot be a strategic objective, cannot be a \npolitical objective, and cannot be a moral objective of any American \nPresident.'' We must not allow loyalty to an outdated piece of paper \ncalled the ABM Treaty to stand in the way of a sound defense given the \nthreats we face.\n  In addition to the deployment of a national missile defense system, \nit is important for the United States to use the full range of economic \nand diplomatic tools to halt China's proliferation of the technology \nfor missiles and weapons of mass destruction. I believe the Senate \nmissed an opportunity when we failed to pass an amendment offered by \nSenator Thompson to combat this problem. I hope this legislation will \nbe considered and passed next year. In addition, we need to ensure that \nstrong export controls on U.S.-made products are in place so we don't \ninadvertently help China modernize its military.\n  It remains to be seen whether the rhetoric from Beijing will become \nreality, but in light of China's troubling actions, prudence demands \nthat we take steps to address China's behavior. We ignored warnings in \nthe past and paid a high price. We surely must not let it happen again.\n\nThreatening or Bellicose Statements by Chinese Officials or Drawn From \n                        Official State-Run Media\n\n\n                  MISSILE THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n       The PLA could use military force to prevent Taiwan's \n     gaining independence without fear of U.S. intervention, \n     because American leaders, ``care more about Los Angeles than \n     they do about Taiwan.''--Remark by an officer in the People's \n     Liberation Army (PLA) to former Assistant Secretary of \n     Defense, Chas Freeman, Jr., ``As China Threatens Taiwan, It \n     Makes Sure U.S. Listens,'' New York Times, January 24, 1996.\n       ``On the Taiwan issue, it is very likely that the United \n     States will walk to the point where it injures others while \n     ruining itself. As is known to all, if the `Taiwan \n     independence' elements openly and brazenly advocate \n     separatism, the PRC government will be forced to resort to \n     the use of force ultimately to resolve the Taiwan issue. Once \n     the cross-strait war breaks out, the U.S. government will \n     face a dilemma: If it chooses not to intervene, the United \n     States has to consider the `Taiwan Relations Act;' besides, \n     U.S. allies will doubt whether the promises made by the \n     United States will hold. If the United States chooses to \n     engage in substantial interventions, U.S. policymakers will \n     be left with no choice but to consider the possible enormous \n     pressure to endure and the possible exorbitant price to pay. \n     China is neither Iraq or Yugoslavia, but a very special \n     country: on one hand, China is a permanent member of the U.N. \n     Security Council; on the other hand, it is a country that has \n     certain abilities of launching a strategic counterattack and \n     the capacity of launching a long-distance strike.

Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to \nspeak about Congressman Bruce Vento from Minnesota, the Fourth \nCongressional District, who passed away today.\n  Bruce Vento was a fierce advocate for justice and a true \nrepresentative, in the best sense of that word, of the people of the \n4th District. He was generous and good-humored, with a seriousness of \npurpose that energized his work and inspired others. A gentle teacher \nand great friend, we were all ennobled, challenged and made greater by \nhis presence among us, and will be less for his absence. The model he \noffered, of a life of public service for the common good, beckons us \nforward, toward the light, and for that we are grateful.\n  From working to protect our nation's vulnerable homeless, to fighting \nto protect and preserve earth's natural treasures from the Boundary \nWaters Canoe Area Wilderness to South American Rain Forests, Bruce's \nlegacy will last many generations. His leadership resulted in enactment \nof hundreds of conservation-related measures through the years, and \nprotected millions of acres of our nation's parks, forests and \nwilderness areas. Close to home, when we look at a map of Minnesota we \nliterally are looking at an image created in part by Bruce Vento. Our \nstate's parks and green spaces are as healthy as they are in large part \nbecause of Bruce's work over these many years.\n  Sheila and I will miss him terribly, and our thoughts and prayers are \nwith his family.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an AP story by \nFrederic Frommer from today, a piece in the Minnesota Star Tribune by \nGreg Gordon, and a piece from Tom Webb from the Pioneer Press.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Associated Press]\n\n                 Minnesota Rep. Bruce Vento dead at 60\n\n                        (By Frederic J. Frommer)\n\n       Washington (AP).--Minnesota Rep. Bruce Vento, a 12-term \n     liberal Democrat who championed environmental and homeless \n     causes, died Tuesday after a bout with lung cancer.\n       Vento, who was diagnosed in February, died at 12:20 p.m. at \n     his home in St. Paul, Minn., surrounded by his family, \n     spokesman Rick Jauert said. He had malignant mesothelioma, a \n     rare type of cancer caused by inhaling asbestos fibers.\n       Vento, who was 60, announced in February that he had cancer \n     and would not seek re-election. His treatment included the \n     removal of one lung, chemotherapy and radiation, but doctors \n     discovered more cancer last month.\n       As a young man, Vento worked as a state-paid laborer in \n     several St. Paul-area facilities that he claimed exposed him \n     to asbestos fibers. Two weeks ago he filed a lawsuit against \n     11 companies that allegedly supplied or installed asbestos \n     products at those job sites.\n       Vento made his most significant legislative contributions \n     on environmental issues, which he called his ``true \n     passion.''\n       ``I have been a member of Congress for the past 24 years, \n     dedicated to making the federal government work for the \n     people, to do for our community and state--and, yes, even \n     internationally--that which we cannot do for ourselves,'' \n     Vento said in February. ``The federal government can and \n     should make a difference.''\n       When Democrats controlled the House, Vento was chairman of \n     the Natural Resources subcommittee on national parks, forests \n     and lands for 10 years, pushing for more money for national \n     parks and other environmental priorities.\n       ``I think Bruce Vento has been one of the most impressive \n     and effective congressmen in modern Minnesota history,'' said \n     former\n\n[[Page S10134]]\n\n     Vice President Walter Mondale. ``It's hard to think of an \n     environmental issue where his leadership has not been \n     found.''\n       Vento worked on efforts to ban oil drilling on the coastal \n     plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and on \n     preserving tropical rain forests. The Wilderness Society \n     recognized Vento's work in 1994 with the Ansel Adams \n     Conservation Award.\n       ``He's been a hero,'' said Debbie Sease, legislative \n     director for the Sierra Club. ``He's done more for parks than \n     anyone I know.''\n       Vento also helped establish the emergency shelter grants \n     program and preserve the Federal Housing Authority.\n       President Clinton paid tribute to Vento at a dinner in June \n     for his environmental record and work on behalf of the \n     homeless.\n       ``He has steered into law more than 300 bills to protect \n     our natural resources,'' Clinton said. ``The thing I like \n     even more about Bruce Vento is he cares about people, \n     especially people without a voice--the homeless.''\n       Vento was born Oct. 7, 1940, in St. Paul and attended the \n     University of Minnesota and Wisconsin State University. He \n     worked as a science and social studies teacher before winning \n     a seat to the state House in 1970. He was first elected to \n     Congress in 1976.\n       For the last decade, Vento pushed a bill to make it easier \n     for the Hmong--an ethnic group in Laos--who fought with U.S. \n     forces during the Vietnam War to become U.S. citizens by \n     waiving the English-language requirement for them.\n       After he was diagnosed with cancer, Vento made passage of \n     the bill a top priority. His effort ended successfully when \n     Congress approved the measure in May.\n       ``This bill would have never been conceived or passed if it \n     had not been for Bruce Vento,'' said Philip Smith, Washington \n     director of Lao Veterans of America, which lobbied on behalf \n     of the legislation.\n       ``He reached across the aisle and worked and persevered to \n     make this happen. He is our hero.

Bruce Vento, D-Minn., died at his \n     St. Paul home this morning after an eight-month battle with \n     mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer usually associated \n     with asbestos exposure.\n       Vento, a longtime environmental champion who planned to \n     retire when his 12th term in office ends in January, \n     celebrated his 60th birthday on Saturday.\n       Rick Jauert, Vento's press secretary, said the congressman \n     died at 11:20 a.m. Twin Cities time at his home in St. Paul \n     with his family by his side. He said he had no further \n     details, and that Vento's chief of staff, Larry Romans, was \n     flying to Minnesota, apparently to be with Vento's family and \n     help with funeral arrangements.\n       Vento underwent surgery at Rochester's Mayo Clinic last \n     February for removal of his left lung and diaphragm shortly \n     after the fast-moving disease was discovered. But despite \n     months of chemotherapy and radiation treatments, a person \n     familiar with Vento's condition said in late September that \n     the cancer had spread to his remaining lung. Doctors had \n     drained fluid from Vento's remaining lung on at least two \n     occasions.\n       ``It's too bad he died so fast,'' former U.S. Sen. Eugene \n     McCarthy, who held the same Fourth District congressional \n     seat as Vento from 1948-58, said this afternoon. ``It's too \n     bad to lose him. He was such an established person in the \n     Congress, but cancer is pretty impartial.''\n       The former school teacher and state legislator leaves \n     behind one of the most tangible legacies of any Congress \n     member: He shepherded more than 300 laws that preserved \n     natural lands from the Florida Everglades to the Alaska \n     wilderness.\n       Since February 2000, Vento had been treated for malignant \n     mesothelioma, a virulent form of cancer usually caused by \n     asbestos exposure. Yet his final year in office included some \n     of his most important legislative accomplishments, including \n     easing citizenship requirements for Hmong veterans living in \n     the United States.\n       Vento approached his ailment and last months in office with \n     a graceful determination that won him the admiration of \n     political friends and foes in Washington.\n       President Clinton hailed his fellow Democrat at a \n     testimonial in June as a man who ``never stops being a \n     teacher. As he fights a disease that has not yet yielded all \n     it secrets to science, he's our teacher again. He's shown us \n     all a lot about courage.''\n       Clinton made the comments at a bipartisan tribute dinner \n     that Vento helped turn into a fund-raiser for scholarships to \n     train future high school science teachers.\n       Vento was like that. As a legislator he was known for using \n     every opportunity to pursue causes he held dear: Directing \n     more resources to poor city neighborhoods, helping Hmong \n     veterans, promoting public schools, raising the minimum wage \n     and, always, protecting the environment.\n       Throughout the Reagan, Bush and Clinton years in \n     Washington, he never gave up his belief in activist \n     government.\n\n\n                           saving wilderness\n\n       In his first year in Congress he worked with others for the \n     establishment of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. \n     In every one of his 23 years in Congress, his name was \n     associated with wilderness preservation legislation. He was \n     best known in Minnesota as a defender of the ban on the use \n     of motorized vehicles in the BWCA. At the beginning of his \n     last term in Congress he ended up having to embrace a painful \n     compromise that allowed two motorized portages there.\n       Vento was at the center of similar fights in dozens of \n     other states because, before the Republican takeover of \n     Congress in 1994, he was chairman of the House Subcommittee \n     on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands.\n       In relentlessly pushing that legislation, Vento became \n     better known in some parts of the West than he was in \n     Minnesota.\n       ``He spends all of his waking hours working against our \n     interests,'' complained Charles Cushman, president of an \n     organization of private property owners in Washington state \n     in 1993. ``The name Bruce Vento is without a doubt a very \n     dirty word in many communities in the West,'' Cushman said in \n     an interview. ``Any place there's a national park, they fear \n     Mr. Vento with a passion.''\n       Indeed, the Sierra Club credits him in part for preserving \n     and protecting 5 million acres of wild lands during the \n     decade he was chairman of the subcommittee. In addition, he \n     tended the designation of 76 ``wild and scenic'' rivers. His \n     passion for parks came to him through personal experience. \n     His father, a Machinists union officer, was not wealthy and \n     couldn't afford fancy holidays or a lake cabin.\n       ``We depended on the parks along the St. Croix River,'' \n     Vento recalled in an interview a few years ago. ``That was \n     our Sunday picnic, our vacation.''\n\n\n                             high rankings\n\n       If Vento received poor marks from conservative property \n     rights groups, he was generally adored by environmentalists, \n     though his occasional willingness to compromise--as on the \n     motorized portages in the BWCA--cost him support from a few \n     die-hards.\n       At the June testimonial dinner, Interior Secretary Bruce \n     Babbitt called him ``a hero of the nation's parks'' and said \n     Vento coached him on how to handle the Republican takeover of \n     Congress, which threatened continued investment in some \n     national parks.\n       ``Bruce said to me, `Don't panic. Don't make a deal with \n     these guys,'' Babbitt recalled. The interior secretary said \n     the GOP threat to cut parks funding evaporated after Vento \n     advised him to draw a chart of national parks units in the \n     districts of congressional opponents, including House Speaker \n     Newt Gingrich.\n       It wasn't just the environmentalists who considered Vento a \n     hero. He also received 100 percent rankings most years from \n     labor and liberal interest groups, while getting extremely \n     low ratings from conservative and Christian fundamentalist \n     organizations.\n       In 1992, Vento, a Catholic, shifted his position on \n     abortion legislation, saying his views had ``evolved'' to the \n     point that he would support abortion rights while remaining \n     personally opposed to abortion.\n       That shift brought him fully in line with the dominant \n     views of the DFL in Minnesota and the liberal wing of the \n     Democratic party nationally.\n       From his seat on the House Banking and Urban Affairs \n     Committee, Vento in 1982 became one of the first members of \n     Congress to urge action to deal with homelessness. His \n     proposal that year to provide $50 million to repair derelict \n     buildings for temporary shelter was never brought to a vote \n     by the full House.\n       Vento persevered, however, and eight years later he was the \n     prime sponsor of the $1.3 billion McKinney homeless aid bill, \n     which won approval and was signed into law.\n       Vento's work on low-income housing was enhanced when he \n     became chairman and later ranking member of the Housing and \n     Community Opportunity Subcommittee.\n       On the Banking Committee he was an advocate for smaller \n     banks and credit unions and for community reinvestment \n     requirements for major financial institutions.\n       Before coming to Washington, Vento served several terms in \n     the Minnesota House, where he was assistant majority leader \n     under Speaker Martin Sabo, who would later be Vento's close \n     colleague in Congress.\n       The two Twin Cities congressmen were twins only in voting \n     record. In demeanor they couldn't have been more different. \n     While the Scandinavian Sabo was reticent and disinclined to \n     give speeches, Vento was known as a ceaseless orator who \n     didn't seem to know how to end a sentence.\n       When St. Paul's nine-term congressman Joseph Karth decided \n     to retire in 1976, he endorsed the voluble Vento for his \n     seat. That and strong labor support got Vento the party \n     endorsement despite opposition in the primary from St. Paul \n     attorney John Connolly and State Auditor Robert Mattson. \n     Vento won that year with 52 percent of the vote, and would \n     win reelection 11 more times.\n\n\n                           fighting for hmong\n\n       After St. Paul became one of the major centers of Hmong \n     immigration in the 1980s, Vento embraced the needs of the \n     former Laotian hill tribespeople who had fought for the CIA's \n     Secret Army during the Vietnam War. He pushed for federal \n     housing and educational assistance and to waive the English-\n     language requirement for citizenship for those who had fought \n     with the United States in Laos.\n       In the 1990s, Vento's office became an informal Washington \n     headquarters for this new\n\n[[Page S10135]]\n\n     group of Americans. His office wall was decorated with an \n     enormous Hmong tapestry given in appreciation. And, on \n     occasion, his inner and outer offices were lined with former \n     Hmong soldiers in fatigues using his phones and desks to plan \n     their lobbying assault on Washington.\n       After years of persistent advocacy by Vento and others, the \n     bill easing citizenship requirements of Hmong veterans was \n     passed by both Houses and signed into law in 2000 by \n     President Clinton.\n       Lee Pao Xiong, a Hmong member of the Metropolitan Council, \n     called Vento's decision to leave Congress at the end of his \n     12th term ``a great loss to our community. Bruce Vento was a \n     strong advocate for the Hmong community, always willing to \n     bear our concerns.''\n       The advocacy of the latest immigrant group by a man who was \n     himself the descendent of immigrants was in the tradition of \n     St. Paul, said Garrison Keillor, Minnesota's homegrown \n     humorist. He said at the testimonial dinner that Vento never \n     seemed like a slick Washington pol. ``Bruce is like St. \n     Paul,'' he said, later describing Vento as a man of ``modesty \n     and courage and passion.''\n\n\n                             personal life\n\n       Vento's final year in Washington was not filled with \n     funereal sentiment. In August he married a fellow educator, \n     Susan Lynch of Chatfield, Minn.\n       It was the first wedding for Lynch but not for Vento, who \n     has three adult sons from his first marriage, Michael, Peter \n     and John.\n       A week before the nuptials, Vento, smiling but wan, \n     attended the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, \n     appearing with former Vice President Mondale and Minneapolis \n     Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton as the Minnesota delegation cast \n     its ballots for Vento's friend from their first days together \n     in the House, Vice President Al Gore.\n       Vento's energy astonished his colleagues. After his cancer \n     was diagnosed in February, he underwent surgery at the Mayo \n     Clinic for removal of his left lung and diaphragm. He lost 25 \n     pounds and some of his hair as he completed a draining \n     regimen of chemotherapy and radiation treatment.\n       ``I'm looking forward to fishing,'' Vento told reporters \n     and supporters who asked what he planned to do next. ``That's \n     the ulterior motive in all the environmental protections I've \n     fought for.''\n       His longtime colleague and partner in liberal Democratic \n     legislative ventures, Sabo, seemed stunned by Vento's news, \n     saying over and again, ``I can't imagine this place without \n     Bruce around.''\n       In the weeks after Vento announced his illness and his \n     plans to retire, Republicans--from former Rep. Vin Weber to \n     Sen. Rod Grams--acknowledged his 24 years of service.\n       ``Put the partisan differences aside,'' said St. Paul Mayor \n     Norm Coleman. ``He delivered a lot for this community, and \n     his passion will be missed.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Oct. 10, 2000]\n\n                          U.S. Rep. Vento Dies\n\n                             (By Tom Webb)\n\n       U.S. Rep. Bruce Vento, St. Paul's unwavering voice in \n     Congress for 24 years, died Tuesday morning at his home in \n     St. Paul after a long bout with cancer. He was 60.\n       A native of St. Paul's East Side, Vento was famed as a \n     champion for wilderness, consumers, working people and the \n     homeless, who never forgot the everyday struggles of average \n     folks fighting to build a better life.\n       Vento died at 11:20 a.m., with his family at his bedside, \n     his staff announced.\n       Vento was elected to Congress in 1976 from the Fourth \n     Congressional District, covering Ramsey County and a sliver \n     of Dakota County. He was the longest serving of a trio of \n     notable DFLers who for a half-century have served the Fourth \n     District in Congress, a group including Eugene McCarthy and \n     Joseph Karth.\n       He was suffering from mesothelioma, a form of cancer \n     usually linked with exposure to asbestos.\n       He is survived by his wife, Susan Lynch; his three sons, \n     John, Peter and Michael; their spouses, four grandchildren; \n     his parents, Frank and Anne Vento; and seven brothers and \n     sisters and their families.\n       Funeral arrangements are pending.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, Bruce was elected to the State \nlegislature in 1970 and to the House of Representatives in 1977. Before \nthat, he had been a science teacher on the lower east side of St. Paul. \nHe is a true product of the lower east side.\n  His family is wonderful. Sheila and I have had the chance to spend a \nlot of time with his family. It is a wonderful, caring, Italian \nCatholic family. I believe Frank and Annie had eight children; Bruce \nwas the second oldest.\n  I want to say two or three things if I may. One, I want to say to \nBruce's family and to his wife Sue: Sue, you have been a gift from \nHeaven for Bruce and his family.\n  I talked to Bruce Saturday. He turned 60. Today he passed away. When \nhe passed away, all of his family were with him. All of them said: You \ncan let go.\n  What a beautiful, caring, loving, wonderful family. And what a \nbeautiful, loving, caring man. Bruce has done so much for so many \npeople. He was so committed to public service. But most important of \nall, to me, he was a friend whom I will miss.\n  I remember once he was going to come over to our home in St. Paul to \ntalk about a big dispute over the Boundary Water Wilderness Area. We \nwere supposed to meet early in the morning, but there was a huge \nsnowstorm and all the weather reports were that all the schools were \nclosed. People weren't going to be able to go to work. Everything was \nshut down. It was impossible to get around. We were supposed to meet at \n8 o'clock in the morning. At 5 minutes to 8 o'clock, there was a knock \non the door. There was Bruce. He was in seventh heaven. This was like \nthe outdoors, this was snow, this was Minnesota, and he was there. He \nloved the environment and did so much for our State and our country.\n  I say to Bruce's family, what a great Congressman. It is easy to say \nthat when someone has passed away, but he truly was. People in \nMinnesota loved this man. They always will. They will never forget him, \nwill never forget all he has done for our Fourth Congressional District \nand for our State. Sheila and I will never forget Bruce.\n  Bruce is like my friend, Mike Epstein, about whom I spoke. Mike was \nhere for all these years, so committed to public service. Two men, they \ndied too young, from the horrible disease of cancer, two men who were \nso committed to public service, so committed to people.\n  From this day on, my belief is I have two friends who are looking \ndown from heaven. I will be talking to them every day. I know Bruce's \nchildren and grandchildren will be talking to him every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I certainly commend the Senator on his \nmoving tribute to Bruce Vento. Certainly we can tell how emotionally \nattached the Senator was to that gentleman.\n  I knew him also. I served with him on the Resource Committee in the \nHouse. Certainly he was a fine gentleman. The Senator has described him \nwell. We are all very sad at this loss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10135-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10135-S10137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to go back to the remarks of the \nSenator from North Dakota as he talked about some of the issues that \nall of us are concerned about, issues such as pharmaceuticals--how we \nmake that work; issues such as Medicare--which needs, after these \nyears, some real, examination, some changes so over time we can ensure \nprovision of health services to all who are beneficiaries. No one \nargues with that.\n  He also mentioned the Patients' Bill of Rights, which is interesting. \nI do not know of anyone in the Senate or the other body who is not for \nsome form of the bill of rights. The unfortunate part is that there are \nsome defining issues within that subject, defining issues that mean a \nlot in terms of where it goes in the future. The Senator failed to \nmention that. This is sort of the technique of those who favor more \ngovernment. That is to simply talk about the title without talking \nabout what is involved.\n  We have had in the Senate for a good long time--the Presiding Officer \nhas participated--in a conference report, language designed to bring \nout a Patients' Bill of Rights that we could pass. Frankly, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and others have opposed that.\n  One of the questions that is very important is whether or not it is \ngoing to be a bill of rights for patients or whether it is going to be \na bill of rights for tort lawyers. If you have to go to court whenever \nthere is a controversy, that is, of course, not what we seek to do.\n  So I want to make the point that you can talk in general terms about \nmany issues. Everyone embraces those issues. But when you talk about \nthe kinds of things that are important, within those issues, to \nimplement them in a manner in keeping with the philosophy that you have \nover time, then that becomes quite a different matter. Of course, that \nis why we find ourselves at some loggerheads from time to time.\n\n[[Page S10136]]\n\n  I have spoken before, and will again, about the amount of effort we \nhave seen from the other side of the aisle to put obstacles in front of \nthese issues and to, really, be more interested in making an issue \nrather than a solution. I am sorry for that. We are, of course, down \nnow to the end, and we need to do something.\n  Let me talk for a moment or two about some of the things I think we \nface, not only in this body right now but that we will face in the \nfuture, we will face in this election. We need to make decisions as to \nwhere we are going. The key to those decisions in my view, regardless \nalmost of what the decisions are--whether they are business decisions, \nwhether they are personal decisions, whether they are political \ndecisions--is to get some idea of what we want the result to be and \nwhere we are going to go over a period of time, and then measure \nwhether or not what we are doing in the interim leads us to the \naccomplishment of those goals. It seems to me that is one of the most \nimportant things we can do.\n  So we are going to find ourselves, I think--I half hope, maybe--with \nsome different philosophies from this past year, and we are going to \nhave to choose.\n  I just returned from my State. I am going to get back, I hope, pretty \nsoon and spend some time in schools with a voting program to get kids \ninvolved in politics, involved in elections; to talk about the issues \nand begin to get some feel about what it means to have a government of \nthe people and by the people and for the people. I am excited about \nthat because there are differences in philosophy.\n  Sometimes we find it difficult to define them, as we have these \ndebates, as we will have tomorrow night. It is true; politicians have a \nlittle affinity for making things a little bit blurred. But it is up to \nus, then, as voters, to really separate those things and decide where \nwe want to go; do we want more Federal Government in our lives or do we \nwant less? It is up to us to define what we think the role of the \nFederal Government is and how it impacts us as citizens. What is the \nrole of local and State governments? What is the role, then, really of \nindividuals? That is what it is all about: individual freedom--\nopportunities for success.\n  We talk about taxes. Do we want more taxes and more Government? Do we \nwant less Government so people can keep more of the money they earn? \nThe real issue, of course, is Federal control down into communities, \ndown into counties, down into schools. Or, indeed, do we want county \ncommissioners and school boards and State legislators to make decisions \nthat fit the decisions made by the people who have to live with them. \nThere is a great deal of difference between the needs we have for the \ndelivery of services in Philadelphia and in Greybull, WY. So those are \nthe kinds of things that are taken into account.\n  We have talked about a surplus. There are reports of a surplus, \ncertainly. I might say, it is more difficult to control the size of \nGovernment when you have a surplus than it is when you do not because, \nregardless of what the issues are, why, where we have a surplus we \nought to spend the money. The other side of that, of course, is if we \nhave a surplus there are certain priority things we ought to do but \nmaybe we ought to put some of those surpluses back with the people who \nown them. They will be very important there.\n\n  We have different plans to deal with them. One of the plans that is \nout there takes about half of those surpluses and puts them into Social \nSecurity. One of the real issues before us is young people who are in \ntheir first jobs and pay 12.5 percent of their income, along with their \nemployer, into the Social Security fund. In 40 years, are they going to \nhave any benefits accruing to them? Not unless we make some changes.\n  The options are just to continue what we are doing and take more tax \nmoney to put into it, or to make some changes--for instance, to give \nsome opportunities, based on the choice of the recipient, to put some \nof that money into the private sector, to get the return on that \ninvestment up from 2.5 to 3 percent, up to 4 percent or 5 percent or 6 \npercent, which certainly would make it more likely that those benefits \nare going to be there when their benefits are earned and ready to serve \nthem.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota talked about tax cuts for the top \n1 percent, that is not what is being proposed. Indeed, regarding the \nproposal that is out there that has caused all the 1 percent talk, the \npeople who make the 1 percent, who make the most money in this country, \nwill have a higher proportion of taxes on them than they have had \nbefore. Those taxes are for everyone who pays taxes. I think that is an \nexcellent way to do that, to have marginal cuts and double the tax \ncredits. Let's get rid of the estate tax. That doesn't do away with tax \non the value, by the way, because that will be taxed when that asset is \nsold with the capital gains tax. But why should death cause you to have \nto sell the farm to pay the taxes? It should not.\n  These are some of the decisions that are out there to be made. \nCertainly they are important ones. I will not argue about what is \nright. We hear a lot of this: Let's do the right thing.\n  That depends on about whom you are speaking, what the right thing is, \nof course. So there are choices we have to make, legitimate choices. I \nhope all of us have a chance in this election to sort those out for \nourselves and be able to do something with them.\n  Medicare is another one. I mentioned that before. You know, what we \nhave is a Medicare program that, unless it is changed, cannot continue \neither.\n  There is something on which all of us can agree: We want to continue. \nIf that is the goal, what do we have to do in the interim to ensure \nthat happens?\n  One of the things we have to do is give people some choices. The way \nit is now, when you are 62, 63, 65, you have to take what is there, and \nthat is the only choice.\n  There are people who have supplementary policies. My mother has a \nsupplementary policy that provides pharmaceuticals. She is perfectly \nhappy with that and wants to continue with that. There are people who \ndo not have supplementary policies. They cannot afford them. They ought \nto have pharmaceutical coverage, and there ought to be choices in the \nway that is done. That is very possible. People ought to be able to \nchoose. The alternative to what we suggested has no choice.\n  Education: It has been a very long time since we have been able to do \nsomething quite different on elementary and secondary education. We \ntalked about it. We have had 5 weeks of discussion in this Congress on \neducation. Again, everyone is for education. I do not know anyone who \ndoes not want to make education more effective, who does not want to \nmake it better for everyone. What holds it up is who makes the \ndecisions.\n  This administration has insisted on those dollars that go from the \nFederal Government to the States, regardless of what the needs are in a \nparticular school district, that they either be for 100,000 more \nteachers or they be for buildings. Both of those are legitimate needs, \nbut there are school districts that do not need more teachers and the \nschool buildings are in pretty good shape. What they need is high-tech \nequipment, for example, and they should have an opportunity to spend \nthat money as their needs dictate. That is the debate.\n  Sometimes it is a little hard to cut through: ``Those guys are \nagainst education.'' That is not so. These are the choices and these \nare the choices of how we get around to resolving the problems. I hope \nwe will soon.\n  There are always going to be differences of view. That is why we \nvote. The problem is we have not been able to bring those things to the \nfloor, and every time we bring up education, someone brings up one of \nthe issues on which we have already voted three or four times--gun \ncontrol, minimum wage, whatever--to make sure that what we are focusing \non does not happen.\n  Here we are now 1 week past our dedicated time to adjourn. Frankly, I \nam one who thinks that if we have business to do here, we ought to be \nhere until we get it done. That is our job. We ought to get the bills \nout here, vote on them, move them on up. If the President wants to veto \nthem, if he wants to try to use leverage to threaten and shut down the \nGovernment, let him do that, but he is the one who is going to shut \ndown the Government. That is where we are.\n\n[[Page S10137]]\n\n  It is an interesting time, an important time. I am confident we will \nmove more quickly to resolve these items this week than perhaps we have \nover the last couple of weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10137-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ACCESS TO NATIONAL PARKS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to express my views on a more \nparochial issue--not entirely parochial, as a matter of fact; it has to \ndo with access to national parks. I have served over the last 6 years \nas chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee. We have been very \ninvolved with where we are going and have hopefully some idea where we \nwant to be with parks.\n  Everybody recognizes the value of the national assets. It is one of \nthe neat things. In the United States, we have 379 national parks that \nwork in conjunction, of course, with State parks and local parks. The \nreasons for having a park, it seems to me, are, No. 1, to preserve the \nresource, of course, and, No. 2, to allow that resource to be enjoyed \nby the people who own it --the taxpayers.\n  We have a little difficulty from time to time with both of those \nthings. We passed a bill, Parks 2020, last year which puts more \nemphasis on inventory, taking care of the resources. We need to put \nmore effort into that, and we are working on that.\n  We have had a lot of talk about infrastructure in some of the larger \nparks and the things that need to be done, the money that needs to be \nspent for preserving the resource, such as on sewers. In the last \nbudget that came from this administration, there was more money for \nacquisition of new parks than there was for maintenance of the parks we \nhave. To me that is a problem.\n  If you want to enjoy it, you have to have access. One of the things \nthat is controversial in our part of the world--in Yellowstone, Teton \nPark--which is equally true in New England and other places, is access \nfor snow machines. For 3 years we have had an ongoing study in \nYellowstone Park prompted by a lawsuit. Today they are coming out with \ntheir report on the environmental study and their recommendations as to \nwhat we should do. It is out for public comment for 30 days. I am going \nto ask that the 30 days be extended to 60 so people have an opportunity \nto review it.\n  There are difficulties with snow machines. There is difficulty with \nthe noise. There is some difficulty with the pollution. The problem is \nthe Park Service for 20 years has not sought to manage that growing \nindustry and has simply avoided doing anything with it. Then suddenly \nthere is a lawsuit filed against them, and there are some things that \nneed to be changed. Instead of seeking to manage it, instead of seeking \nto find some remedies, instead of seeking to make some changes, they \nsimply want to eliminate it. That is a mistake. There are ways the Park \nService can manage those things. They can separate cross-country skiers \nfrom snowmobilers. They can limit the number if there are too many. But \nthe EPA and the Park Service have never looked toward establishing \nstandards for these machines.\n  I have visited a number of times with the manufacturers, and they are \nwilling to change those machines. They did some experimental work in \nJackson Hole, WY, last year and had machines that are only as loud as \nnormal voices. Of course, no one is going to invest in those unless \nthey have some idea that there are standards, and if they comply with \nthem, they will be useful.\n  I hope we can change the idea of either nothing or no management and \ngive some time to move toward the adjustments that can be made, toward \nsome management in the parks so people can continue to enjoy them.\n  I see my friend from Kansas. I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Wyoming \nallowing me to speak on a topic that we will be taking up fully \ntomorrow. Tomorrow this body will take up the Victims of Trafficking \nand Violence Protection Act of 2000. That will be the business of the \nday. Tomorrow we will vote on two bills associated therewith. The \ndevelopment of this legislation has been in progress for most of this \nyear, and there are several pieces in this bill.\n  What I will do today is discuss with my colleagues what is in this \nbill, why it is important, why it passed the House of Representatives \n371-1, and why it is important that we address this important issue at \nthis particular time.\n  Senator Wellstone and I have been working on this legislation for \nthis past year. It is the companion piece to a bill that passed in the \nHouse, sponsored by Chris Smith and Sam Gejdenson. The House bill is \nknown as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.\n  Our antitrafficking bill is the first complete legislation to address \nthe growing practice of international trafficking worldwide. This is \none of the largest manifestations of modern-day slavery \ninternationally. Notably, this legislation is the most significant \nhuman rights bill of the 106th Congress if it is passed tomorrow as is \nexpected. This is also the largest anti-slavery bill the United States \nhas adopted, arguably, since 1865 and the demise of slavery at the end \nof the Civil War. Therefore, I greatly anticipate this vote tomorrow in \nthe Senate on this very important legislation.\n  Senator Wellstone's and my trafficking bill, which passed in the \nSenate on July 27 of this year, was conferenced to reconcile the \ndifferences with the House bill. The conference report was filed on \nOctober 5, Thursday of last week. The final conference package contains \nfour additional pieces of legislation which are substantially \nappropriate to our bill.\n  Most significant among those bill amendments is the Violence Against \nWomen Act, which is part of this overall conference report--it is known \nas VAWA--which provides relief and assistance to those who suffer \ndomestic violence in America. It is an important part of the package. \nIt is a key piece of legislation that this body has previously passed. \nI am glad that it is part of this package. And it will pass as well \nwith this overall package so we can help people caught in domestic \nviolence.\n  Thus, the overall four bills included in this conference report are: \nThe sex trafficking bill that I mentioned at the outset; VAWA, the \nViolence Against Women Act; Aimee's law, which provides for interstate \ncompensation for the costs of the incarceration of early-released sex \noffenders who commit another sex crime in a second State. The 21st \nAmendment Enforcement Act is also in this overall conference report. It \nallows for State attorneys general to enforce their State alcohol \ncontrol laws in Federal court, including laws prohibiting sales to \nminors, which strengthens the grant of authority to States under the \n21st amendment to the Constitution. The final piece of legislation in \nthis conference report is the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, \nwhich authorizes the payment of foreign seized assets to victims of \ninternational terrorism.\n\n  The last step to adopting this legislative package rests with the \nSenate tomorrow. As I stated previously, it cleared the House on Friday \nby a vote of 371-1.\n  This legislation is our best opportunity to challenge the largest \nmanifestation of current slavery worldwide, known as trafficking. I \nwant to describe that term and what this bill does to get at what is \ntaking place in the form of trafficking.\n  This practice of trafficking involves the coercive transportation of \npersons into slavery-like conditions, primarily involving forced \nprostitution, among other forms of slavery-like conditions.\n  Trafficking is the new slavery of the world. These victims are \nroutinely forced against their will into the sex trade, transported \nacross international borders, and left defenseless in a foreign \ncountry.\n  This bill also addresses the insidious practice known as ``debt \nbondage,'' wherein a person can be enslaved to the money lender for an \nentire lifetime because of a $50 debt taken by the family\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\nfor an emergency. This is a common practice in countries such as India \nand Nepal, among other places throughout the South Asian region.\n  People of conscience have fought against the different manifestations \nof slavery for centuries.\n  I might note that my State came into the Union under the fight of \nwhether or not it would be a free or slave State in the 1860s. That was \nthe big fight. In my State, we had bleeding Kansans, where they were \nreferred to as those who were pro-slavery and those who were \nabolitionists.\n  The freedom forces fought guerrilla warfare to determine whether the \nState would be slave or free. The first election was actually stolen by \nthe slave-State proponents, and there was a constitution they put \nforward that would allow slavery in Kansas. The free-State forces \novertook them. They had a free election. The free-State ballot was \nelected and won. Kansas came in as a free State--probably one of the \ndecisive events in setting off the Civil War--because then the balance \nof power in Washington shifted.\n  Under the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Nebraska was thought to come in as a \nfree State, Kansas as a slave State, and Washington's balance of power \nwould be maintained. When the abolitionists moved out of the Northeast \nto Kansas to settle, and to make sure it would be a free State, that \ntipped the balance of power and clearly led, according to historians, \nto the start of the Civil War. That is the history of my State. It is a \nnoble one of fighting for freedom.\n  This anti-slavery legislation is in the tradition of William \nWilberforce and Amy Carmichael of England, who were ardent \nabolitionists against slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries. Amy \nCarmichael was a British missionary to India at the turn of the last \ncentury and in the early 1900s. Upon arriving in that country, she was \nmortified to discover the routine practice of forced temple \nprostitution taking place. This was and continues to be a practice \nwhere young girls, from age 6 onward, are dedicated to the local \ntemple, and are then forced into prostitution against their will to \ngenerate income.\n  Upon this morbid discovery, Amy Carmichael began to physically steal \nthe young girls away from this incredibly degrading form of slavery. \nShe would then hide the girls so they would escape the inevitable \nbacklash of violence against these little girls. Eventually, the \ngovernment outlawed this practice of forced temple prostitution as a \nresult of Amy Carmichael's efforts. However, it bears noting that this \nterrible practice continues today in some rural villages throughout \nSouth Asia.\n\n  This bill challenges the myriad forms of slavery, including sex \ntrafficking, temple prostitution, and debt bondage, among other forms.\n  This new phenomenon of sex trafficking, unfortunately, is growing \nexponentially. Some report that it is, at least, a $7 billion-per-year \nillicit trade, exceeded only by the international drug and arms trade \nin the illegal category.\n  Its victims are enslaved into a devastating brutality against their \nwill, with no hope for relief or justice, while its perpetrators build \ncriminal empires on this suffering with impunity. Our legislation will \nbegin to challenge these injustices.\n  This is the new slavery of the world. As hard as it is to believe, \nwomen and children are routinely forced against their will into the sex \ntrade internationally. They are usually transported across \ninternational borders so as to ``shake'' local authorities, leaving the \nvictims defenseless in a foreign country, virtually held hostage in a \nstrange land. The favored girls are in the age range of 10 to 13 years \nold.\n  I hope some people here can look at their own children or \ngrandchildren and ask how this could possibly happen to somebody so \nyoung.\n  This bill is the first complete legislation to address this practice \nknown as sex slavery, which has risen dramatically in the past two \ndecades. It has risen dramatically with the increase of child \npornography, sex tours in Eastern Asia, and the general popularizing of \nthe sex industry worldwide. This mass trafficking of women and \nchildren, which includes both girls and boys, has been compared to some \nof the slave trade practices in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n  Professor Laura Lederer of Johns Hopkins University has identified \nthe trafficking routes internationally. I want to put some of these \nroutes up on a chart so my colleagues will be able to see where she has \ntracked these routes to take place.\n  You can see on the chart the trafficking routes from Russia and the \nNewly Independent States to other places around the world. We actually \nhad a lady in the Foreign Relations Committee who testified she had \nbeen trafficked out of the Ukraine into Israel.\n  You can see all these routes being described going into Canada, into \nthe United States, into Mexico, into Europe, and into other places in \nSouth Asia, into Australia and into South Africa.\n  These are the trafficking routes on which Professor Lederer has \nworked. She has studied this for nearly 10 years, describing and trying \nto put a finger on where these routes go.\n  This chart shows trafficking routes going into the United States. By \nour own Government estimates, about 50,000 girls are trafficked into \nthe United States annually by this sex trafficking, this sex \nprostitution business. These are the routes shown here on this chart, \nwith 50,000 girls per year trafficked into the United States. According \nto the State Department estimates, these are the routes coming in from \nAsia, the ports of entry they come in to the United States. Here on \nthis chart is shown the routes coming from Central America and South \nAmerica.\n\n  Shown here on this chart are the routes coming in from Europe and \nAfrica and the ports of entry where they have been trafficked. Again, \nDr. Lederer's Protection Project work showcases the same. Here is where \nthey are coming from.\n  It is of note to say, as well, that by our Government estimates this \nis a growing practice. It is growing more because organized crime is \ngetting more and more into it. We heard testimony in committee that \norganized crime is actually favoring going into this over drugs because \nthey can sell their product more than one time. And in some places \nwhere they traffic in prostitution it is not illegal. So they are going \ninto it in a nonillegal category, where it is a legal business. The \ncategory of sex trafficking is growing rapidly.\n  Other routes that have been discussed with us in committee include \ngirls sold or abducted from Nepal into India. Nepalese girls are prized \nbecause of their beauty and their inability to defend themselves given \nthe situations out of which they are coming.\n  In Eastern Asia, most abductees are innocent tribal girls from \nisolated mountain regions; they are forced into sexual service, \nprimarily into Thailand and Malaysia.\n  I met with some of these Nepalese girls as they had returned, being \ntaken back from the brothels of India. I met with them in January of \nthis year in Katmandu. It was despicable to see these girls, many of \nthem taken at 11, 12 years of age, coming back 16, 17 years old, two-\nthirds of them having AIDS and/or tuberculosis. It is a deplorable \nsituation.\n  This is how the traffickers obtain their unsuspecting victims. Fraud \nis commonly used by traffickers against villagers in underdeveloped \nareas. Typically the buyer promises the parents that he or she is \ntaking their young daughters to the city to become a nanny or domestic \nservant, giving the parents a few hundred dollars as a down payment for \nthe future money she will earn for the family. Then the girl is \ntransported across international borders, deposited in a brothel and \nforced into the trade, until she is no longer useful, having contracted \nsome disease. She is held against her will on the false premise that \nshe must work off her debt which was paid for the cost of her \ntransportation, which typically takes several years. In fact, in India \nit is common for indentured laborers generally, not even sex workers, \nsimply manual labor, to work 10 years or more to pay off a $50 debt.\n  The use of force to obtain the victim is common in the cities, where \na girl is physically abducted, beaten, and held against her will, \nsometimes in chains. I have talked with these girls myself, as they \nappeared in two hearings that Senator Wellstone and I held before\n\n[[Page S10139]]\n\nthe Foreign Relations Committee. Some of them came in disguise because \nthey feared the retribution their families might suffer back home, for \nreason of their testimony in exposing the slave trade mafia. That is \nhow insidious and widespread this practice is.\n  Existing laws internationally fail to make clear distinctions between \nvictims of sexual trafficking and the perpetrators. Also, the victims \nfrequently do not have legal immigrations status in the countries into \nwhich they are trafficked, and the victims are punished even more \nharshly than the traffickers.\n  Our legislation establishes an entirely different approach of \npunishing the perpetrators but not the victims. Our legislation also \nfacilitates important and baldly needed advocacy to raise awareness \nregarding sexual trafficking throughout the world.\n  Additional legislative measures include:\n  Providing new criminal punishment with enhanced sentences for persons \nconvicted of operating such slavery enterprises in the U.S., as present \ncriminal statutes are inadequate to obtain sentences commensurate with \nthis new form of sex trafficking and slavery;\n  Establing a reporting and advocacy mechanism at the State Department \nwhich would monitor efforts taken by foreign countries to criminalize, \npunish and combat international sex trafficking within their borders; \nand\n  Assistance for victims in the U.S., including authorization of grants \nto shelters and rehabitation programs.\n  The legislation further includes the creation of a new form of visa \nfor trafficking victims. This will substantially allow for more \naggressive prosecution, as well as the protection of these witness \nvictims.\n  It enhances cooperation and assistance with law enforcement agencies \nin foreign countries for the investigation and prosecution of \ninternational sexual trafficking, as well as promoting assistance in \ndrafting and implementation of legislation.\n  And it promotes the creation of worldwide awareness programs to alert \nunsuspecting, potential victims of this practice.\n  Senator Wellstone and I believe this is the first sex trafficking \nlegislation to pass around the world. We are hopeful it will become a \nmodel for other countries to deal with this pernicious, insidious \npractice that is part of the dark side of the new globalization of the \neconomy.\n  I support the expansion of the economy. The globalization taking \nplace can be a very positive thing, such as what is taking place today \nwith the signing of permanent normal trade relations with China by the \nPresident that this body passed. But we also have to recognize that \nthere are dark aspects of globalization; this being one of them. We \nneed to deal with that as well.\n  Trafficking victims are the new enslaved of the world. Until \nrecently, they had virtually no advocates, no defenders, no avenues for \nescape, except death, to release them from their obscene circumstances. \nThis is changing rapidly, and a new human rights movement is forming on \nbehalf of these victims and against the trafficking networks.\n  This growing movement runs from right to left, from William Bennett \nand Chuck Colson to Gloria Steinem; all are involved in supporting this \nlegislation. Our legislation is part of that movement, providing \nnumerous protections and tools to empower these brutalized people \ntowards re-capturing their dignity and obtaining justice.\n  Trafficking has risen dramatically in the last 10 to 15 years with \nexperts speculating that it could exceed the drug trade in revenues in \nthe next few decades. It is sadly observed that drugs are sold once, \nwhile a woman or child can be sold 20 and even 30 times a day. This \ndramatic increase is attributed also to the popularizing of the sex \nindustry worldwide, including the increase of child pornography and sex \ntours in Eastern Asia that I previously mentioned.\n  A Washington Post article entitled, ``Sex Trade Enslaves East \nEuropeans,'' dated July 25th, vividly captures the suffering of one \nEastern Europe woman who was trafficked through Albania to Italy:\n\n       As Irina recounts the next part of her story, she picks and \n     scratches at the skin on her face, arms and legs, as if \n     looking for an escape--she says the women were raped by a \n     succession of Albanian men who stopped by at all hours, in \n     what seemed part of a carefully organized campaign of \n     psychological conditioning for a life of prostitution.\n\n  This awful practice must be challenged, and our legislation would do \nexactly that.\n  In closing, there is a unique generosity in the American people, who \nare respected internationally for their love of justice. As we \nchallenge this dehumanizing trade, an inspired movement is growing in \nAmerica and worldwide, a modern-day abolitionist movement. Please make \nthis legislation a reality for the countless people who are presently \nlost to this modern day slave trade. Please vote for passage of this \nhistoric anti-slavery legislation and move forward this modern \nabolitionist movement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, we have all heard the phrase that in this \nworld--especially in this body--there are workhorses and there are show \nhorses. That is very true. I would like to reflect on one of the \nworkhorses of the Senate who will be retiring at the end of this \nCongress, someone who has served his State, served his country, and \nserved in this body with distinction.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``Far and away the best prize that life \noffers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.'' Senator Bryan, \none of the workhorses of the Senate, has made the most of his chance to \nwork hard at work worth doing.\n  In addition to serving his constituents well, Senator Bryan also has \nserved the Senate well. He was asked to serve on the ad hoc committee \nthat took testimony in the impeachment trial of U.S. District Judge \nAlcee L. Hastings in 1989. In 1991, in the aftermath of the Keating \nFive scandal, Senate leaders named Senator Bryan to a new task force to \ndecide where to draw the line of propriety in such situations. His \nsteady service helped to restore public confidence in the Senate, \nshaken by that troubling incident.\n  During the 103rd Congress, he was chairman of the Ethics Committee \nwhen the committee began an investigation into charges of sexual \nharassment leveled against former Senator Bob Packwood. Serving on the \nEthics Committee is a thankless task. No Senator ever asks to serve on \nthat committee. It does not generate the appreciation of constituents, \nnor does it particularly endear a Senator to his colleagues. This is \nimportant work, however--work that protects the integrity of this body. \nAnd as one who has great respect for this institution, I appreciate the \nexemplary job that Senator Bryan did in steering the Senate through \nsome tumultuous times.\n\n  Senator Bryan has used his position in the U.S. Senate not only to \nadvocate for his constituents in the great State of Nevada but also to \nprotect consumers across the Nation. Ten years\n\n[[Page S10140]]\n\nago, as the chairman of the Commerce Committee's Consumer Subcommittee, \nSenator Bryan oversaw the first stand-alone reauthorization of the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission since 1981. This was a hard-earned \nvictory for consumers nationwide. Senator Bryan was also successful in \nsecuring passage of legislation that he authored requiring the \ninstallation of passenger-side airbags in all automobiles sold in this \ncountry, a safety feature responsible for saving hundreds of lives.\n  Senator Richard Bryan's career has been one of true and diligent \npublic service. I am told that his experience in elected office began \nwhen he was chosen to be president of his eighth grade class at John S. \nPark Elementary School. He served in the U.S. Army, completing his \nmilitary service in the Army Reserves as a captain. Upon completion of \nlaw school, Richard Bryan returned to Nevada and began a career in \npublic service that has spanned more than three decades. In 1964, Mr. \nBryan became a deputy district attorney in the Clark County District \nAttorney's Office. Two years later, he was appointed Clark County's \nfirst public defender. His legislative service to Nevada began in 1968 \nwhen he was elected to the Nevada State Assembly. Following a second \nterm in the State Assembly, he was elected to the Nevada State Senate \nin 1972 and was reelected in 1976.\n  Senator Bryan won his first statewide election to become Nevada's \nattorney general in 1978. He served as the State's chief law \nenforcement officer until 1982, when he was elected to the first of two \nterms as Nevada's 26th Governor. In 1988, Senator Bryan ran for the \nU.S. Senate, defeating the incumbent Senator, and went on to be \nreelected to the Senate in 1994. That is a very respected and \nimpressive record, Mr. President--a life devoted to public service at \nvirtually every level of our government.\n  Senator Bryan leaves the Senate as a young man--youth being relative. \nAs I look back on his many years of public service, I am confident that \nin whatever endeavor he chooses next, we can expect more fine work--\nwork worth doing--from Senator Bryan. He is a man who can always be \nproud to look at himself in the mirror each morning. He will see a \nreflection of fine work in the past, as well as the great opportunity \nto do well each day.\n  Mr. President, I wish Richard Bryan and his lovely wife every good \nthing in the years ahead. I hope he will come back to see us often.\n  Mr. President, before I was recognized, I saw another Senator on the \nfloor and I think he was about to seek recognition. I suggested that he \ngo ahead and get recognition. But he suggested that I get recognition. \nSo I did. If my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, wishes to be \nrecognized, I will be very glad to yield the floor. I have a couple of \nother speeches, but I will be happy to listen to him before I continue.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I \nhave a few articles on U.S. policy that I would like to have printed in \nthe Record and make a couple of comments on them.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield the floor with the \nunderstanding that I retain the floor when the distinguished Senator \nhas completed his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I take this opportunity to relate how those policy \nissues are being viewed in Wyoming. I know that is kind of the melting \npot and the test center for the United States. I say that in all \nsincerity because I talk to these people every weekend when I go home, \nand I know it is a real center of common sense with a real concern \nabout a lack of national policy on some very important issues.\n  They talk about foreign policy and how we don't appear to know how to \ngo into a war. They talk about energy policy, the price of gasoline, \nand how long we have been addressing that. They talk about Social \nSecurity policy.\n  They hear about the lockbox, and they have watched six or seven \nfilibusters against the lockbox to protect Social Security. They hear \nabout needing to save Social Security first and then not seeing any \naction on that.\n  I want to suggest, too, that our country needs policy. We are not \ntalking about hindsight; we are talking about foresight. We are not \ntalking about polls; we are talking about leadership.\n  There were a couple of editorials in Wyoming that dealt with the \nrecent tapping of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. One of them was in \nthe Wyoming Tribune-Eagle, which is the main paper in Cheyenne, WY, the \nState capital of Wyoming. It starts off by saying:\n       President Bill Clinton's decision to direct the Department \n     of Energy to release 30 million barrels of oil from the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve is viewed by the White House as a \n     way to lower fuel prices and reduce our country's dependence \n     on foreign oil.\n       Nice try, Mr. Clinton.\n       Each day, the world oil market produces 77.1 million \n     barrels of oil and consumes 75.6 million barrels. The United \n     States consumes 20 million barrels per day. The additional 30 \n     million barrels is equal to about a 36-hour supply.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Higher energy prices fall squarely on the shoulder of the \n     American people, the government's strangle-hold on refineries \n     and the White House.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Let's not forget our country's thirst for oil. Since 1991, \n     the amount of oil imported by the United States has increased \n     an average of 5.3 percent per year.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire editorial be \nprinted in the Record. I hope everybody will read it. It gets into more \ndetail about policy and suggests some things that need to be done.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Our View\n\n    Oil Reserves--Tapping This Supply Won't Solve Energy Dependency\n\n       President Bill Clinton's decision to direct the Department \n     of Energy to release 30 million barrels of oil from the \n     Strategic petroleum Reserve is viewed by the White House as a \n     way to lower fuel prices and reduce our country's dependence \n     on foreign oil.\n       Nice try, Mr. Clinton\n       Each day, the world oil market produces 77.1 million \n     barrels of oil and consumes 75.6 million barrels. The United \n     States consumes 20 million barrels per day. The additional 30 \n     million barrels is equal to about a 36-hour supply.\n       What Mr. Clinton did was wrong. Releasing the oil from the \n     reserve to influence market prices sets a dangerous \n     precedent. The oil reserve was created in 1975 to protect \n     Americans from countries that decide to cut off oil exports \n     to the United States, not to manipulate prices. Any \n     unexpected cold snap, natural disaster, cutback in OPEC \n     production or political unrest that leads to a disruption in \n     world supply could quickly overwhelm any short-term benefit \n     from tapping into our oil reserves.\n       Granted, releasing the oil may have a short-term effect on \n     prices, but markets eventually will refocus on the long-term \n     conditions--influenced primarily by world supply and demand \n     for oil--that have driven up prices during the past years.\n       Higher energy prices fall squarely on the shoulder of the \n     American people, the government's strangle-hold on refineries \n     and the White House.\n       Since 1983, access to federal land in the West--where 67 \n     percent of America's onshore oil reserves are located--has \n     declined by 60 percent. Mr. Clinton has used his executive \n     powers to severely limit oil and gas activity on government \n     land, and the search for new domestic offshore oil has been \n     limited to parts of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaskan waters.\n       Let's not forget our country's thirst for oil. Since 1991, \n     the amount of oil imported by the United States has increased \n     an average of 5.3 percent per years.\n       While American refineries are operating at a 95.4 percent \n     utilization rate, up from 94.1 percent a years ago, there is \n     little margin for error. It's uncertain if American \n     refineries will be able to process the oil released from the \n     reserves fast enough to make a difference in gasoline prices \n     or home heating oil inventories. The newest oil refinery was \n     built nearly 25 years ago. That's because the Clean Air Act \n     and other environmental requirements tied to upgrading or \n     building new refineries restrict private business from \n     building additional refining capacity.\n       The administration's failure to establish a long term \n     domestic energy policy that guarantees America's energy \n     independence is largely to blame for high gas prices at the \n     pump.\n       The next president will need to address this nation's \n     dependence on foreign oil that leaves both the economy and \n     national security at risk. Unless the White House is ready to \n     encourage the development of domestic energy resources, \n     America will remain overly depend on foreign production.\n\n[[Page S10141]]\n\n       That's the real tragedy.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I also cite an editorial that appeared in \nthe Riverton Ranger, Riverton, WY, with some of the same sentiments:\n\n       The Clinton-Gore administration has announced its intention \n     to sell 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's strategic \n     reserve.\n       This amounts to less than a two-day supply of oil for a \n     country that uses 19 million barrels of oil a day.\n       The rationale for the release of oil from the salt mines is \n     that the administration wants to make sure that no Americans \n     are cold this winter, due to a shortage or too high prices \n     for home heating oil.\n       The image of householders backing up to their burned-down \n     home comes to mind. The optimist in the family warmed by the \n     glowing embers as the fire dies down after consuming the \n     house, remarks that ``at least we'll be warm tonight.''\n\n  That is about what the energy policy amounts to--burning down our \nstrategic house to take care of a little blip that doesn't solve the \nproblem at all--again, lack of an energy policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the complete editorial from the Riverton \nRanger be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Clinton-Gore administration has announced its intention \n     to sell 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's strategic \n     reserve.\n       This amounts to less than a two-day supply of oil for a \n     country that uses 19 million barrels of oil a day.\n       The rationale for the release of oil from the salt mines is \n     that the administration wants to make sure that no Americans \n     are cold this winter, due to a shortage or too high prices \n     for home heating oil.\n       The image of households backing up to their burned-down \n     home comes to mind. The optimist in the family, warmed by the \n     glowing embers as the fire dies down after consuming the \n     house, remarks that ``at least we'll be warm tonight.''\n       How ironic that the same administration that continues to \n     lock up more of the public land from whence comes much of the \n     nation's oil, designates more acreage as national monuments, \n     classifies more of the public lands as defacto wilderness \n     through roadless designation, would then provide temporary \n     relief from an oil shortage by selling a few barrels of \n     reserves, on the condition the oil companies replace the \n     borrowed oil within a short period of time.\n       President Carter made quite a fuss when the domestic supply \n     of oil dropped perilously close to 50 percent. Now we think \n     nothing of having foreign sources 75 percent of our U.S. oil \n     supply.\n       The same situation applies to uranium, or even worse. We \n     have a law on the books of Washington that requires the \n     maintenance of a viable domestic uranium industry, for \n     strategic defense purposes, and for our nuclear utility \n     industry.\n       With uranium mines closing and throttling back in Wyoming, \n     the last of the 50 states still mining uranium, our domestic \n     companies can supply less than 15 percent of the uranium \n     needed by our nuclear utilities which supply now 23 percent \n     of the nation's electricity. The rise from the traditional 20 \n     percent share comes from the greater availability of the \n     remaining almost 100 nuclear power stations for generation of \n     electricity.\n       If our national leadership wanted to help our people stay \n     warm, other than by backing up to our burning houses, a \n     national policy ought to be developed that encourages \n     domestic exploration and production, rather than impeding it \n     at every turn.\n       The promised release of oil from our reserves appears to be \n     politically timed and motivated.\n       Any hope for a sound national energy policy that will keep \n     more companies finding oil on our own continent seems faint, \n     indeed.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, finally, in the area of forest fires and \nforest fire policy, Mr. H.B. Davis writes the letter to the editor \nwhere he explains in some detail how we are failing on our forests.\n\n       Well, the West is again being managed by nature because a \n     few people block the true management of our replenishable \n     environment. Ignorance has again led us to ashes. Some of the \n     very forests that have been ``protected'' against harvesting \n     for years, have this summer burned. To those who wanted their \n     homes surrounded by the pristine (I'm sorry), do they look \n     better in ashes? The pristine that we admire will never \n     remain, for it changes by growing old, weak, and ravaged, by \n     nature, not just man. We can help it by maintenance, with \n     harvest, common sense use, and stewardship. Nature does it by \n     random (and sometimes violent) ways but we (some) have the \n     intelligence to do it selectively and sensibly unless our \n     hands are tied.\n\n  He goes on to explain how a sensible forest policy will allow us to \nenjoy the beauty of the forests rather than the devastation of forest \nfires, and even though forest fires help to rejuvenate forests, they do \nit in a very poor stewardship way.\n  As one lady at a hearing recently said: The difference between the \nclear-cutting that my little family business does and what Mother \nNature does, we respect 200 feet from a stream. We protect against \nerosion. We don't kill the fish. Mother Nature often does.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Ignorance to ashes\n\n       Editor: Well, the West is again being managed by nature \n     because a few people block the true management of our \n     replenishable environment.

We want clean air and to stop the \n     greenhouse effect so we promote wildfire. Does it do the job?\n       Some people have the idea you can keep a living organism \n     from growing old. Maybe some people, through money and \n     surgery appear not to age, but they do age. That ``stop-\n     aging'' or use attitude leads to fuel for wildfires, disease \n     and starvation in animals, and imbalance in nature. To the \n     people who take on a specific issue, you appear to forget an \n     issue is not the book of life but a single page and until you \n     can see all of life don't kill it with an issue, as is now \n     happening. Closure does not guarantee protection, only lack \n     of observation, thus allowing good conditions to go bad until \n     it is all destroyed. On the other hand, careful harvesting, \n     replanting, and maintenance does protect. It keeps it \n     renewing and healthy. The cartoon, in Wed, Aug. 23, by \n     Deering would have had a better caption of ``what is this \n     stuff?'' ``It is what's left when the environmentalists'' \n     protect the environment.'' I'll bet the burned bear cub \n     (Signey) would prefer his mother protecting him and not some \n     short sighted environmentalists.\n       We can't use and abuse, but we can harvest, replant, and \n     maintain so Mother Nature doesn't have to do on a big scale \n     what we should have done a little at a time.\n       Personally, I'd rather see the timber used to build (at a \n     reasonable price, with jobs) than as smoke, ashes and charred \n     pieces in mud to smother our wildlife and fish come the next \n     rain. If our ``do-gooders'' would quit looking at a single \n     page of aging life and work with the folks who would, with \n     responsibility, harvest, replant, and maintain, we'd not need \n     the tears of regret when Mother Nature has to manage.\n                                                       H.R. Davis,\n                                                         Riverton.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will take an opportunity at a later time \nto talk about lack of policy on Social Security. I would like to \naddress the type of accounting we have where we are kind of fudging \nsome things that will cost future generations their Social Security \nunless we take some action now.\n  We also need to take some action in the area of paying down the debt, \ntax policy, and education policy. If we don't address these policies \nusing foresight instead of hindsight, if we don't do policy instead of \npolls, we are going to run into a situation similar to what we had when \nwe hired 100,000 new teachers and then discovered we didn't have \nbuildings to put them in. That was easy to solve; we just threw in a \nlittle more money. We put more buildings in there, except we are \nputting buildings in places where the voters themselves chose not to \nput buildings.\n  I hope we will look at policy.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his courtesy in letting me \nput those letters in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CLAIR\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my State of West Virginia has provided to \nour Nation numerous individuals who have dedicated their lives to \npublic service. Some have appeared, for a time, in the national \nspotlight. Others have labored quietly behind the scenes. One such \nindividual, who has for more than 50 years contributed to the \nbetterment of his community, his State, and his country, sits among us \ntoday in this\n\n[[Page S10142]]\n\nSenate Chamber. Arthur Malan St. Clair, the senior Doorkeeper of the \nSenate, caught me by surprise recently when he handed me a letter \ninforming me of his decision to retire from his post after serving this \nbody since 1979. Arthur St. Clair, better known to us Senators as \n``Tinker,'' has served the Senate with distinction for 21 years.\n\n  But that is just a small part of his remarkable story. Now, \nspeculation as to the age of another person is always something to be \napproached with some temerity, and not often approached, as a matter of \nfact. But there has been speculation as to Tinker's age. It has been a \nhot topic of debate among some Senators and Senator's staffs for a \nnumber of years. I understand, however, that Tinker is finally willing \nto let that particular cat out of the bag.\n  So, for the benefit of the curious, I shall start at the beginning: \nTinker St. Clair was born in Pageton, McDowell County, West Virginia, \nin 1916. As his colleagues on the doors may be quickly calculating, \nthat will make Tinker 85 years come next January.\n  Tinker was the son of a coal miner, small businessman, and local \nschool board member. He was reared in what he is often heard to call \nthe ``free State of McDowell.''\n  It is a county located in southern West Virginia right on the \nborderline there. It used to have a population of about right at \n100,000 people. Today it has probably 30,000. It was a great coal \nmining county. When the mines took on mechanization and huge mining \nmachines took the place of men, the population dropped. Many of the \nmines are worked out and are no longer mining coal. So it has become a \ncounty that, unfortunately, has many unemployed people who still live \nthere.\n  That county is represented by Nick Joe Rahall, who claims to be my \nCongressman because my voting residence is still at Sophia, WV, which \nis located in the congressional district represented by Nick Rahall. \nNick Rahall has a lot of friends in those counties, and they are very \nproud of him as their representative. Nick and I often talk about \nTinker St. Clair.\n  Tinker is from that great free state of McDowell. Back in those days, \nwhen McDowell County had almost 100,000 people, West Virginia had \n97,600 farms and had 90,000 horses. The State of West Virginia had \n90,000 horses and 6,000 mules. That was back in the days when Tinker \nwas younger, I was younger, and McDowell County was more highly \npopulated. Many of those 6,000 mules were used in the mines to pull the \ncars of coal.\n  I was trying to remember how much money was required to build that \nfirst capitol in West Virginia--not the first capitol; the first \ncapitol burned down, but the capitol that replaced the capitol that \nburned down had gold leaf put upon it. That capitol was completed in \nFebruary 1932. I will tell you what that capitol cost in 1932. Pay \nclose attention: $9,491,180.03. That was the total cost of that \ncapitol. Any person traveling in West Virginia must stop and see that \nbeautiful capitol. It would cost many times that much to build it \ntoday. It was completed in the heart of the Great Depression: \n$9,491,180.03. That was a real bargain.\n  Well, McDowell County is in the heart of a region that is rich in \ncoal and, more importantly, rich in the old values. It was in that \nenvironment that Tinker grew up. That was the environment in which he \nwas raised. That was the environment in which he was instilled with \npatriotism and loyalty, honesty and determination and drive, and a \nstrong sense of community.\n  Tinker graduated in 1937. That was the year in which I married. That \nwas the year in which Erma and I married. I paid a hard-shell preacher \n$10 to marry her and me. We have been married ever since, 63 years ago. \nNineteen hundred and thirty-seven was the year Tinker graduated from \nGary High School where he played football and baseball.\n  Upon graduation, Tinker worked as a schoolbus driver and later worked \nas a driver for the Consolidated Bus Lines. He came to own a taxi \nbusiness that operated in the towns of Welch, Oceana, and Pineville. \nFor anyone unfamiliar with those communities, I should note that \ndriving a bus or a taxi along those particular local roads, around the \nwinding hills and in the gulches and the valleys and the hollows, \nrequires a real talent, courage, and certainly a strong stomach.\n  It was at about that time in his life--in fact, on May 25, 1940--that \nTinker married Elnora J. Hall and they later became the proud parents \nof two daughters, Patty and Linda.\n\n  As we have all observed in the Senate, and as I have known for many \nyears, Tinker is always cheerful--always cheerful. He always has a nice \nsmile on his face. He is always a very personable individual. He is \njust down to Earth, a plain, honest, hard-working, fine Christian \ngentleman.\n  He is a ``people person.'' We hear a lot of talk these days about \n``people persons.'' Well, he is a ``people person.'' His entrance into \nthe realm of politics and public service, therefore, was just plain \nnatural. Beginning in 1948, Tinker's career included service as a \ndeputy sheriff. When Tinker came to get you, you better go--you better \ngo. He had that big .45 slung on his hip and he was an excellent \nmarksman. You just better go; better get ready. That fellow, the \nsmiles, was the real Matt Dillon of McDowell County--Matt Dillon. And \nhe was a court bailiff, criminal investigator for the prosecuting \nattorney, and justice of the peace.\n  In 1968, Tinker was elected county clerk, and he has held all the \noffices at the county level. That is where government starts, you know, \nat the county level. And he was overwhelmingly reelected in 1974, with \n89 percent of the vote; 89 percent of the votes in a county that never, \never heard of a political machine.\n  Well, I better take that back, the part about a political machine; If \nthere ever was a political machine, that was it, in McDowell County.\n  Well, anyhow, Tinker didn't need any machine. He had the votes--89 \npercent of the vote while running on the slogan, ``The man to give the \noffice back to the people.'' How about that for a slogan? If I had my \npolitical career to start over again, that is the slogan I would use, \n``The man to give the office back to the people.''\n  It was in 1979, after serving 4 years of a 6-year term as county \nclerk, I received a telephone call. I will never forget that call. It \ncame from Tinker. Over the phone, Tinker related to me a conversation \nthat he had just had with Elnora. Elnora, as I recall it, had told \nTinker that she was coming to Washington to visit their daughters and \ntheir grandchildren.\n  ``Fine,'' said Tinker. ``When will you be coming back?''\n  ``I'm not,'' was the answer. ``I'm not.'' She went on to say, ``I \nmiss the girls and the grandchildren and I'm going to Washington to \nstay.''\n  Well, Tinker and I both knew that she meant business. And so I said \nto Tinker, ``Well, you just come on up to Washington with Elnora, and \nwe'll find work in my office somewhere for you.''\n  That conversation took place during the first week of July, 1979. And \non July 9, 1979, the Senate employed Tinker St. Clair as the newest \nmember of our Senate family, and he has been a member of the Senate \nfamily ever since.\n  During his career, Tinker has played an important role in escorting \nleaders of this Nation throughout southern West Virginia. Nobody can \nescort one through southern West Virginia quite like Tinker. He walked \nwith President Truman through the coal fields. He stood with candidate \nJohn F. Kennedy and campaigned with him in the hills and the hollows of \nWest Virginia. And one time back home, he greeted a helicopter that was \nlanding and he welcomed its passenger, Lyndon Baines Johnson. He was \nwith another Kennedy--Bobby Kennedy--in 1968.\n\n  He traveled with another West Virginian, many times, day and night: \nRobert C. Byrd. He traveled with Jay Rockefeller. And Jay can tell of \ntrips to Welch where he was greeted by the dapper and dedicated Tinker. \nAnd the late Senator Jennings Randolph often found at Elnora's supper \ntable some fine pastries and goodies. And so was Nick Rahall there, \nfrom time to time, in Tinker's house.\n  Many a campaign strategy was cooked up at Elnora's supper table. \nTinker and Elnora, in fact, serve as proof that anyone with the \ndetermination and the desire to make a difference in this Nation can \nplay a valuable role in the political arena.\n  It was on April 24, 1996, that Tinker lost his beloved Elnora. I was \nconcerned for my friend. The sudden loss of his dear wife had to have \nbeen quite\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\na blow. Yet Tinker handled that difficult personal tragedy with \ntremendous inner strength that is so indicative of people who have come \nup the hard way in West Virginia's coal mining communities.\n  So now it has come to pass, Mr. President, that Tinker St. Clair will \nbe retiring, and I am glad for him that he will be able to spend more \ntime with his daughters, Patty and Linda; and with his grandchildren, \nKimberly and Eddie and Mack; and with his two great-grandsons, Nicholas \nand Jack.\n  But I must admit, it does sadden me to think of our daily labors in \nthis Chamber without Tinker; He has given so much. We will all miss \nTinker's ready smile, his warm handshake, his full head of white hair, \nand his warm and reassuring presence in the Senate Chamber.\n  He won't be leaving for a while yet, but the day will come when \nTinker will walk out of the door for his last time. So I say goodbye to \nmy fellow West Virginian, and my dear friend, with these words of \nverse:\n\n                           Word to the Living\n\n     It isn't enough that we say in our hearts\n     That we like a man for his ways;\n     And it isn't enough that we fill our minds\n     With psalms of silent praise;\n     Nor is it enough that we honor a man\n     As our confidence upward mounts;\n     It's going right up to the man himself\n     And telling him so that counts.\n     Then when a man does a deed that you really admire,\n     Don't leave a kind word unsaid,\n     For fear to do so might make him vain\n     Or cause him to lose his head;\n     But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done'',\n     And see how his gratitude swells;\n     It isn't the flowers we strew on the grave,\n     It's the word to the living that tells.\n\n  I will say this to Tinker. I hope to serve 6 years more after this \nyear in this Senate, but the sight of him back there on that bench will \nnever fade from my view. I will always see him there. I will always see \nhim returning my gaze and always with a smile. We will never, never \nforget him because he is the true symbol of service. And as the old \nsaying goes: Service with a smile. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I consider myself very lucky to be on \nthe floor right now. I thank Senator Byrd for his words. I cannot even \ncome close to matching what my colleague from West Virginia said. I \nhave not known Tinker a whole lifetime, but I will say this: What I \nknow about Tinker today and every day, I say to Senator Byrd, is that \nhe is the kind of person who, when we debate, when we come out on the \nfloor to speak, and sometimes we do not necessarily get the votes we \nwant--that happens sometimes; with me, more than sometimes--Tinker is \nthe person who is always there to give encouragement, always there to \nsay: You keep speaking out for what you believe; you keep at it; \neverything will be all right.\n  I appreciate Tinker's wisdom. I appreciate his help. I appreciate his \ncommitment to service. I appreciate his commitment to West Virginia. \nMost important of all, I appreciate his patriotism, because to me he is \na true patriot. A patriot is someone who takes a part of their life and \ngives it to their country, and he has done that. So I am honored to be \non the floor at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10143-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF REPRESENTATIVE BRUCE F.

Mr. President, the Senate has lost an honored and esteemed \nfriend. I rise to pay tribute to Murray Zweben, former Senate \nParliamentarian, Senate Parliamentarian Emeritus, who passed away on a \nSunday recently.\n  A few years before his own death, Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter \nto John Adams:\n\n       It is of some comfort to us both that the term is not very \n     distant at which we are to deposit in the same cerement our \n     sorrows and suffering bodies, and to ascend in essence to an \n     ecstatic meeting with the friends we have loved and lost, and \n     whom we shall still love and never lose again.\n\n  As we reflect upon and mourn the passing of Murray Zweben, these \nwords remind us that death is but a temporary separation between this \nlife and the next life. While we regret the loss of dear friends, and \nespecially one who so ably served this body for many years, we can \ncontemplate with assurance that there is the promise that we can be \nreunited.\n  A Parliamentarian emeritus of the Senate, Murray Zweben served this \nbody as Assistant Senate Parliamentarian from 1963 to 1975. He served \nas the Senate Parliamentarian from 1975 until 1981, a position he held \nwhen I became majority leader. Murray Zweben first came to the \nParliamentarian's office as Secretary to Parliamentarian Charles L. \nWatkins. He served 3 years as communications officer in the \nCommunications Office of the Chief of Naval Operations following his \ngraduation from naval officer candidate school in September 1953.\n  While serving as Secretary to the Parliamentarian, Murray Zweben \nattended the George Washington University Law School and achieved the \nhonor of being on the Law Review there.\n  After clerking for Judge Laramore of the U.S. Court of Claims, and \npracticing law, he was called again to the Senate to fill the newly \ncreated position of Second Assistant Parliamentarian in January 1963. \nHe was promoted to Assistant Parliamentarian in December 1964 where he \nserved for 10 years under the tutelage of Dr. Floyd Riddick.\n  In 1974, Mr. Zweben was appointed Parliamentarian of the Senate, and \nhe served in that post with distinction. He served as Parliamentarian \nduring some turbulent years in the Senate. In his first year, Nelson \nRockefeller, then Vice President of the United States and President of \nthe Senate, relied heavily upon the advice of the Parliamentarian as he \npresided over the fight to amend the rules of the Senate.\n  Also during Mr. Zweben's first year as Parliamentarian, the Senate \nwas faced with the unprecedented debate over the rightful claim to a \nSenate seat from New Hampshire, which required great skill to resolve.\n  The Senate saw other battles during Murray Zweben's tenure as \nParliamentarian. Through all of those encounters, Mr. Zweben was fair, \nimpartial, and judicious in the conduct of his duties. His unfailing \ngood humor, even under stressful circumstances, will be remembered by \nall who knew him. Murray was unflappable in a post where a cool head is \nessential.\n\n[[Page S10144]]\n\n  He was a shining example of public service. Although public service \nin general and public service careers in Washington have in some \nquarters fallen out of favor, I believe Murray Zweben's work represents \na compelling case against the cynicism about the many fine people who \nserve in the Senate in various capacities. Their names are never in the \npapers, they experience few public kudos, and yet they work as many \nlong hours--probably more so--than we Members do. They are dedicated, \ncapable, patriotic individuals who represent the best that America \nproduces from all over this Nation. Murray Zweben served this \ninstitution and his country well. His love of the institution, and his \nzest for politics, and for life made him a pleasure to know.\n\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Murray's family. When we lose \nfriends and loved ones, we may lose the mortal companion, but this is \nbut a temporary--but a temporary--one.\n\n     For as the rolling seasons bring\n     The hour of fate to those we love,\n     Each pearl that leaves the broken string\n     Is set in Friendship's crown above.\n     As narrower grows the earthly chain,\n     The circle widens in the sky;\n     These are our treasures that remain,\n     But those are stars that beam on high.\n\n  Those words were penned by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10144-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10144-S10145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO FRANK R. LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the 106th Congress winds to a close, I \nwant to take just a moment, as it were, to say farewell and to pay \ntribute to my friend and colleague, Senator Frank Lautenberg, who, \nafter serving three terms, will be retiring from the United States \nSenate. He has dutifully served the people of New Jersey, and served \nthem well, for 18 years, and he has often been outspoken about the \nvalue of government and its ability to improve people's lives.\n  This belief stems from personal experience. As the son of immigrants \nwho fled poverty and religious persecution, he raised himself from \npoverty to become a world leader in computer services. Frank did well. \nHe well understood the words of Thomas H. Huxley, who said, ``The rung \nof a ladder was never meant to rest upon, but only to hold a man's foot \nlong enough to enable him to put the other somewhat higher.'' Senator \nFrank Lautenberg has never rested, and I am sure that, for him, \nretirement from the Senate simply means that he is moving on to the \nnext rung on his life's ladder.\n  Frank Lautenberg was born in Paterson, NJ, on January 23, 1924, and \nduring his childhood moved about a dozen times with his parents in \ntheir pursuit of work in New Jersey. After graduating high school, \nFrank enlisted and served in the Army Signal Corps in Europe during \nWorld War II. Benefitting from the GI bill following the war, he \nattended the Columbia University School of Business, where he earned an \neconomics degree in 1949. In 1952 he cofounded a company called \nAutomatic Data Processing and, by 1982, when he was elected to the U.S. \nSenate, his company employed 16,000 people. Think of that. His company \nemployed more people than today work in the coal mines of West \nVirginia. And it was a company that processed the payroll for one of \nevery 14 non-Government workers in the entire country. It had become \none of the largest computing services companies in the world.\n  Because of his working-class roots and the values instilled in him by \nhis parents, Senator Lautenberg came to realize that America really was \nthe land of opportunity. America had provided him with many \nopportunities, and Senator Lautenberg decided that it was time to give \nsomething back to this wonderful country. He therefore launched his \ncareer in public service, and during his tenure of three terms, Frank \nLautenberg has fought hard to protect the health, safety, and security \nof American families.\n  Senator Lautenberg has an appreciation of the Senate and its special \nplace in our Nation. He has fought to preserve the prerogatives of the \nSenate and of the Congress as a whole. As the senior member of the \nBudget Committee, he actively resisted the so-called balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. Senator Lautenberg was also one of a \nminority of Senators to oppose the Line Item Veto Act.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Lautenberg \nhelped to craft the 1997 balanced budget agreement that helped to put \nour national finances in order. His work helped to demonstrate that the \nConstitution did not have to be amended to balance the budget and that \nhard work and hard choices are what is needed in budgets, as in life.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I share a commitment to our transportation \ninfrastructure and we have made it one of our top priorities. He is the \nranking member of the Transportation Appropriations subcommittee. I \nhave worked very closely with my friend from New Jersey, who serves \nwith me on that subcommittee. We have toiled together on a wide variety \nof projects important to West Virginia and the Nation. And we have been \ndoing this for a long time. When we were in the majority, when I was \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Frank Lautenberg was \nthe chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee. For too long, the \nFederal Government has underinvested in our Nation's highways. As a key \nmember of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Frank \nLautenberg played an active role in crafting TEA-21, the historic \ntransportation bill that was enacted last Congress which is an \nimportant step toward fixing past mistakes and assuring Americans of \nsafer, more modern highways and improved public transit. We share the \nbelief that a strong infrastructure is vital and makes a profound and \npositive difference for hundreds of millions of Americans by saving \nlives, reducing injuries, increasing business investment, expanding \nemployment opportunities, and producing savings to the public and to \nthe private sectors.\n\n  Senator Lautenberg has also worked to make transportation safer. He \nchampioned laws to make 21 the national drinking age, which has saved \nan estimated 12,000 lives since 1984. And he has sponsored \nlegislation--and I have been proud to cosponsor it with him--to make \n.08 blood alcohol content the national standard for the illegal \noperation of a vehicle. In addition, Senator Lautenberg and I have \nworked together on efforts to combat underage drinking.\n  Senator Lautenberg is a strong environmental leader who helped to \nwrite the Superfund, Clean Air, and Safe Drinking Water Acts. Most \nAmericans take safe drinking water for granted; however, the sad fact \nis that, in this, the most prosperous Nation in the world, millions of \npeople rely on possibly contaminated water supplies. Frank Lautenberg \nunderstands that. He understands that like improved highways and \nbridges, effective and efficient and clean water systems are vital to \nthe continued economic expansion of our Nation and the health and \nsafety of our people.\n  In his statement on February 17, 1999, announcing his plans for \nretirement, Frank Lautenberg cited as one of the main factors of his \ndecision his frustration with the overwhelming amount of financial \nresources needed for his upcoming reelection campaign. That is a shame; \nthat is a shame. He believes--and has so stated--that without \nmeaningful campaign finance reform, special interest funding will grow \nsubstantially, and even larger amounts of money will be necessary. That \nis a shame and a disgrace. I regret that we have not been able to \naddress campaign financing in a meaningful way. I regret that the \ndeplorable influence of money--filthy lucre--in politics has had such a \ndetrimental impact on the Senate.\n  Senator Lautenberg knows what it is like to start from nothing and \nless than nothing and make the most of every opportunity. He has worked \nto make the lives of his constituents, and all Americans, better. From \nbuilding up our country's infrastructure, to battling those who would \nattack our constitutional liberties, to protecting our environment, \nSenator Lautenberg has worked to provide a brighter future for our \nNation. He has worked to improve our public schools. I have no doubt \nthat my good friend and colleague will not rest on his laurels after he \nleaves the halls of Congress. Frank Lautenberg will continue to serve \nso that others will have the opportunities that have lifted him to a \nplace where he could serve the greatest Nation on Earth.\n\n[[Page S10145]]\n\n  I thank Senator Lautenberg for his service to the Senate and to the \nNation. I tried to talk him out of retirement. I urged him to think \nagain, change his mind, change his decision for the good of the Senate \nand for the good of the country and, I am sure, for the good of New \nJersey, but I know that it would be for the good of the Senate. I wish \nhe could still change his mind. I am sorry he made that decision, but \nhe had his reasons. He did what he thought was best, I am sure.\n  I thank him for his service to the Senate. He won't be leaving this \nafternoon or tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but the time for him \nwith us is all too short. The Senate will have lost a good man and a \nfine, fine Member. America will have lost a good servant. But, as I \nsaid, it may be that he will serve elsewhere. In any event, I wish him \ngood health and happiness in his retirement.\n  As I say farewell to him, I recall these words from the great \nAmerican author of the 19th century, Ralph Waldo Emerson. It is \nentitled ``A Nation's Strength.''\n\n       What makes a nation's pillars high\n       And its foundations strong?\n       What makes it mighty to defy\n       The foes that round it throng?\n       It is not gold. Its kingdoms grand\n       Go down in battle shock;\n       Its shafts are laid on sinking sand,\n       Not on abiding rock.\n       It is the sword? Ask the red dust\n       Of empires passed away;\n       The blood has turned their stones to rust,\n       Their glory to decay.\n       And is it pride? Ah, that bright crown\n       Has seemed to nations sweet;\n       But God has struck its luster down\n       In ashes at His feet.\n       Not gold but only men can make\n       A people great and strong;\n       Men who for truth and honor's sake\n       Stand fast and suffer long.\n       Brave men who work while others sleep,\n       Who dare while others fly--\n       They build a nation's pillars deep\n       And lift them to the sky.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10145-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10145-S10146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SERVING IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what a wonderful coincidence it is \nthat I came to the floor to hear my good friend, Senator Byrd, make \nsuch exaggerated remarks about my accomplishments but never about our \nfriendship.\n  Around here, our seats are based on seniority. You kind of move to \nthe middle or to the front as your seniority improves. But it is not \nwhere you sit that counts; it is where you stand.\n  Senator Byrd has stood for the right things for this country for more \nyears than any of the people in this room will remember because it has \nbeen such a long history. It is not newly emplaced.\n  There is a commercial around that is often seen on television and \nradio that says--I think it is for PaineWebber --when PaineWebber \nspeaks, everybody listens. That is an adaptation because when Senator \nByrd speaks, everybody listens. And everybody can read Senator Byrd's \nbooks on the history of the Senate to learn what it really takes to be \na Senator.\n  It takes more than just getting a slice of the largess that we call \nfunds; it takes more than the incredible loyalty, as profound as it is, \nsuch as Senator Byrd has to this State--it transcends those things--\nthat, frankly, has made a difference in the world in which we live. \nWhenever there is a question, whenever Senator Byrd speaks--and my \nexperience is principally on our side of the aisle because we have our \nweekly meetings and occasional get-togethers--people listen because he \nis the historian of the Senate. He is, in many ways, the conscience of \nthe Senate. He is a spokesman for the Senate, not just because he is an \neloquent speaker but because of his knowledge and character.\n  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, my \nfriend, Robert C. Byrd, for his comments. There is always a degree of \neloquence and recall when he speaks. And if you have some spare time, \nif you ever want to hear about the history of battles that took place \nin Roman times or the list of Kings and Queens of the UK from a time \nearlier than William the Conqueror to the present date, how they died \nand what they stood for or what counts in terms of the Constitution of \nthis country, Senator Byrd has that knowledge. Senator Byrd walks \naround with the Constitution in his pocket just as people walk around \nwith phone numbers, and it is used and remembered.\n  It was a happy day for me when I was able to get on the \nAppropriations Committee and join Senator Byrd on so many issues for \nwhich we have fought. He reminds us that there is kind of a cultural \naspect in the United States that so many of us want to give something \nback. I learned to give back by watching my parents as they struggled \nto raise a family in very tough times, with very modest wages and \nopportunities. I understood it in the Army when my father was on his \ndeathbed, my mother was 36 years old, and my sister was 12. That was \nour family. My father was 42. I did it because it was my duty. At that \ntime, I saw what happened to a family that was without health \ninsurance, without any Social Security, without any kind of a benefit \nthat would really help a widow with a small family.\n  Not only did my father die and leave the grief that followed, but his \nsickness, which lingered for a year, took any and all resources the \nfamily had. As a matter of fact, debts piled up as my father \ndisintegrated. So I saw what happens to people who don't have a way of \ntaking care of these needs. I saw what happens when a family is bereft \nof the opportunity to recover from that kind of a challenge.\n  I was lucky in some ways because as we lost a great man in our \nhousehold, I was the beneficiary of an opportunity to help my family \nlater on. The GI bill allowed me to go to a university that otherwise \nwould have been out of my reach, no matter how far we stretched. We \ndidn't have student loans and the kind of scholarships that exist now. \nI was a soldier and I had the GI bill. It armed me with an avenue to \nthe future not simply because, as I have said here before, of the \nsubjects I studied but because of the horizons that were opened to me \nabout what could be, not that to which I was accustomed.\n  My experiences taught me about giving back. It is an honor and a \nprivilege to be able to give back, whether it is to help create an \nindustry--Senator Byrd referred to our business success. Two colleagues \nand I started a business, as they say, without a dime. Today, that \ncompany employs not 16,000, as it did when I came to the Senate in \n1983, but 33,000 people. It is a business that was begun by three kids, \nliterally, who came from the wrong side of town--the right side of the \nstreet but the wrong side of town. On our side of the street there were \nhard-working people. Most of them were immigrants, I would say. They \nknew they had to work with their hands to make a living. They weren't \nthe scientists, the doctors, and the professionals we see today coming \nout of colleges. They didn't even have a chance, for the most part, to \nget to high school. So we created an industry, not just a company. What \ngood fortune there was in our lives. The fact is that we are all \nhealthy and we have terrific grandchildren. I have eight of them and \nthe oldest is only 6, and they are more satisfied to see and talk to \nSenator Byrd than anything else in life.\n  The next great honor to me, after fatherhood, was to come to the \nSenate and to be able to be in this body--even with all of its \ndefects--which reflects the structure of man and the structure of \ncommunity. But if you look beyond the defects, you can see how many \ngreat people have come through this place and how many great people \nhave yet to be recognized who are now Members of this great \ninstitution.\n  Mr. President, I leave with considerable misgivings. I am not happy \nabout the decision I have made to leave. I do know this: Just as we \ncame at different times in our lives, others will follow us who will \nalso make contributions, who also will do the right thing for the \npeople of our country. This country is in good hands. Every moment may \nnot be a great moment, but this country's fundamentals are in place to \nmake sure society will continue to grow and progress and harmonize in \nthe years ahead. When we look at the defects, we see problems here and \nthere and everywhere. But look beyond that. Look at the number of great \npeople we have in our country who are fair-minded people. Look at what \nis happening now in the Presidential race, where one fellow is an \nOrthodox Jew who has been accepted and embraced across the country \nbecause the country is so fair. They\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\nare looking at this person as an individual and judging him on his \nability to serve. That is what tells us about the character of our \npeople. When you look at places in Government, you see people who, \nthough listed as minorities, are great achievers, whether in \nadministrative posts or law or science. That is what we are looking at \nas we look ahead into this 21st century.\n  I thank all of my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats. I believe \nthat I am considered at times an argumentative fellow by some of my \ncolleagues on the other side. That doesn't mean there is no affection.\n  One of the things that Senator Byrd portrays is character--a very \nspecial kind of character.\n  It is amazing to me how much respect and admiration one can have for \npeople with whom one can have enormous differences and yet have \nincredible affection for them because they are respected for their \nbeliefs, even though those beliefs may differ at times with the ones \nyou hold. Whether it is the most ardent progressive or liberal or the \nmost ardent conservative, they are done honestly. They are expressed \nhonestly with respect for people.\n  That should be our mission--not to try to overturn or lecture people \nat various stages, but when someone comes here, having been selected by \nhis or her State to serve, that is their entrance to the debate; their \nentrance to legislate; their entrance to decisionmaking and how this \ncountry is going to function.\n  I don't want to leave here with a tear in my eye. I may feel that \nway, perhaps, but I am so proud that I was able to serve my country and \nto be a part of the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd could give you the statistics immediately. I round it \noff. I think it is about 1,820 people--1,853. I knew Senator Byrd would \nbe precise--1,853 have had the privilege of serving here since the \nfounding of this country.\n  Think about it. Millions of people have lived and passed through \nsociety, and, in all those 200 years, 1,853 have been granted the honor \nand the privilege of serving here.\n  When it comes time to pack up the bags and leave, I will not do it \nnecessarily willingly, but I will do it gratefully, knowing that I have \nhad a chance to be here to witness history in the making, which occurs \nalmost daily, and to know that someday one of my grandchildren--the \noldest is six; he has some way to go before he goes to college--will be \nable to look in the database from his home, from his school, and say: \nThere was my grandfather. He was the one who stopped smoking on \nairplanes. He was the one who raised the drinking age to 21--saving \nthousands of families from having to mourn the loss of a child. But he \nwas the one who did other things to help this country that will last \nway beyond his service in the Senate.\n  I say to Senator Byrd that when he gives testimonial, it has meaning \nand credibility. It is special, and I truly appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I ask whether the Senate is going to remain open for a \nwhile or do we have an order that would have us be closing down soon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no such order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10146-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10146-S10147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am thoroughly upset about what is \nhappening in the Middle East--watching people cower in fear, and some \ndying moments later as violence escalates. It is a terrible sight to \nsee on television. It is a terrible sight to see in pictures and in the \nnewspapers. It is terrible news to hear reports that after so much \neffort and so much concern for peace there is this carnage.\n  I think everyone probably knows that I have had a longtime interest \nin Israel. I have been there many times. But I also have an active \ninterest in a peace resolution. I got to know some of our friends in \nthe Palestinian community. I got to know Mr. Arafat and the people who \nassisted him--and the Palestinian Authority.\n  Whether a child is Jewish or Moslem or whether he or she is an \nIsraeli citizen or whether he or she is someone out of the refugee \ncamps in Palestine and the surrounding areas, or from the nation of \nLebanon, I don't like to see any child taken from a family.\n  I want to make a point. I visited Gaza. I was at the airport just \nweeks before it opened--maybe days. It was very close in time. I was \nvery enthusiastic about giving help to the Palestinians to get their \neconomy going and providing some hope and vision for them so their \nlives could be improved and their freedoms expanded.\n  I think it is fair to say that Israel is taking enormous risks in \nthat promotion, particularly the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Barak, \nwho went further, I believe, than anybody else in Israel. We all know \nthat Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated because of his beliefs by \nsomeone in the Israeli community of the same faith--Jewish. He died for \nhis interest in peace.\n  But I don't understand how there can be joy expressed in the \ndestruction of Joseph's tomb or to see books and artifacts destroyed \nand burned, and people taking joy and gloating over the killing of an \nIsraeli. They are people who are beyond control. We condemn their acts \nof violence against the Arabs in the area and within the state of \nIsrael. I condemn that violence. It is not acceptable wherever it \noccurs.\n\n  However, I say to the Palestinian Authority, they have no right to \nuse weapons that were given to provide police and law enforcement \nagainst the country that gave it to them in the first place. They have \nno right to promote violence, no right to have television programs \ncoming over Palestinian television that talk about it being necessary \nto kill people in Israel, to destroy the country.\n  That kind of action, that kind of encouragement, is antithetical to \nthe possibilities of peace or the possibilities of life. Anti-Semitic \narticles, cartoons, and newspapers, whether it be in Syria or even with \nour friends in Egypt or Lebanon, are unacceptable. Those are the kinds \nof things that ultimately promote violent action from one people to \nanother.\n  I want our friends--Mr. Arafat, the people in the Palestinian \nAuthority--to understand they will get nowhere by promoting assaults on \nIsrael, whether they be on person or territory. It is not going to do \nthem any good in the final analysis. A state of conflict, of war, is \ngoing to be painful to people on both sides. There will be no victors.\n  Help came from the United States to try to elevate the standard of \nliving in the Palestinian community because people such as I promoted \nit. I was active on the issue. I wanted to show good faith and provide \nfunds for the Palestinians to get their airport open. I visited the \neconomic settlements they were erecting, development settlements to \ngive jobs to people, to give hope to people. I supported it \nenthusiastically.\n  I think what is going on is unacceptable by any standard. The United \nNations resolution issued last week was so lopsided that it looked as \nif they were trying to eliminate Israel from the family of nations. I \ndon't understand it--encouraging the criticism of Israel and \ndenigrating Israeli efforts to make peace, at some considerable risk \nagain, as we have seen. Those young men captured and taken someplace in \nLebanon or wherever, captured by a group that considers violence the \nway to resolve things--Hezbollah is proud of the fact they kidnap \npeople. That is not the way peace is going to evolve or relationships \ndevelop.\n  I hope sense will come to the area very soon because what we see \nthere is not, in my view, a limited conflict but, rather, a possibility \nthat we will be seeing a conflict that will be very hard to put out. I \nhope we will soon hear better news from that area. I urge Mr. Arafat to \ncurb violence where he sees it among his people. It cannot be fostered. \nIt cannot be encouraged and at the same time gain the advantages that I \nam sure he would like to see for his people; that is, a peaceful \nexistence and an improved quality of life.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nsection 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the \nrequirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of S. Con.

The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2001 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. \nRes. 290), which replaced the 2000 concurrent resolution on the budget \n(H. Con. Res. 68).\n  The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $19.3 billion in budget authority and by $20.6 billion in \noutlays. Current level is $28 million below the revenue floor in 2000.\n  Since my last report, dated September 5, 2000, the Congress has \ncleared, and the President has signed, the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-259). This action changed the \n2000 current level of budget authority and outlays.\n  This is my last report for fiscal year 2000.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following \nmaterial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 2000.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, the House of Representatives has, again, \nthwarted the will of a bipartisan majority of the Congress.\n  After strong votes in both the House and Senate to lift sanctions on \nthe sale of food and medicine to Cuba, the Republican conferees on the \nAgriculture appropriations bill have added a provision to prohibit \npublic financing which makes it virtually certain that few, if any, \nsales will actually occur.\n  It is bad for America's farmers, bad for the people of Cuba, and bad \nforeign policy.\n  Even worse, the conferees would codify the restrictions on travel to \nCuba, a position which is at odds with the fundamental right of every \nAmerican to travel freely.\n  Senator Dodd and I introduced legislation earlier this year that \nwould lift the ban on travel to Cuba. It is ironic--or I should say it \nis outrageous--that Americans can travel to North Korea, or Syria, or \nVietnam, but not Cuba. What a hypocritical, self-defeating, \nanachronistic policy.\n  Senator Dodd spoke eloquently last Friday about this misguided \nprovision and I want to associate myself with his remarks. I will not \ntake more time today.\n  But I want to say that this is a terrible decision, a partisan \ndecision, a decision driven by politics, and one of the many, many \nreasons why the election on November 7 is so important. It is far past \ntime that we inject some intelligence and bipartisanship into our \nforeign policy.\n  This Congress has had its chance. It has fallen short in too many \nways to count. This decision on Cuba is just another example of the \n106th Congress' failures to do what is right for America, and right for \nthe American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10147-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10147-S10148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge that \nOctober is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n  During this month, a number of public and private agencies, \norganizations, and foundations will increase their efforts to make \nAmericans more aware of the impact of this disease, as well as the need \nfor early detection and increased resources to search for better \ntreatments and ultimately for a cure.\n  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among all \nwomen, and the leading cause of cancer death among women aged 40 to 55. \nBy age 80, women have a 1-in-12 chance of developing the disease. This \nyear alone, an estimated 175,000 women and 1,300 men will be diagnosed \nwith breast cancer. Of those diagnosed, more than\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\n41,000 women and 400 men can be expected to die from the disease. \n41,000 women, that is about 117 per day--117 mothers, daughters, wives, \nand sisters whose lives will be cut short and whose families will be \ndevastated by their loss. And, as I noted, the disease can also affect \nmen with no less impact on them and their families.\n  But many of these deaths can be prevented, through regular screening \nand early detection and treatment. In fact, if detected early through \nself-exams and mammograms, the survival rate for most types of breast \ncancer exceeds 90 percent. And, while the number of breast cancer \ndiagnoses continues at an unacceptably high level, the overall survival \nrate is increasing. We are beginning to turn the tide against breast \ncancer.\n  Though the phenomenal activities of private groups like the Susan G. \nKomen Foundation, of which I am proud to have been a founding \nsupporter, more and more women are getting the message: get smart and \nget screened. Through events like the wildly popular ``Race for the \nCure,'' the Komen foundation has also raised over $215 million to help \nfund breast cancer research. My friend Nancy Brinker, sister of the \nlate Susan G. Komen, has led the group from an idea to a leading force \nin health care that has, without doubt, helped to save and improve \nthousands of women's lives.\n  Many other groups and individuals are also helping to further the \ncause. The National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations has worked \nto expand research and public education in this area. The Y-ME National \nBreast Cancer Organization is another group that has been very active \nin supporting those directly and indirectly affected by breast cancer.\n  With regard to research, I have worked with my colleagues in the \nSenate, leaders like Senator Mack of Florida and Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania, to ensure that our Federal commitment to disease \nresearch, and particularly that for breast cancer, continues to grow.\n  We have made remarkable progress. While federally-supported breast \ncancer research was not a large part of our overall federal disease \nresearch budget even a few years ago, that has changed dramatically in \nrecent years. NIH funding alone on breast cancer totaled almost $500 \nmillion last year, and is expected to top $525 million this year. In \nfact, over the last decade, NIH breast cancer research funding has \nincreased by 600 percent.\n  In addition, I have worked hard as a member of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee to ensure that our breast cancer research \nthat is conducted under the auspices of the DOD health research \ninfrastructure continues. This contributes an additional $175-plus \nmillion per year to this cause.\n  Most recently, I was proud to have joined forces with my colleague, \nSenator Dianne Feinstein, to extend the issuance of the Postal \nService's new Breast Cancer Awareness Stamp. To date, over 214 million \nof these stamps have been sold, generating $15.1 million for research. \nThe first round of grant announcement using these funds was actually \njust made. These funds will support innovative and promising new \nresearch opportunities in understanding and treating breast cancer.\n  These efforts have begun to pay off. Through the development of ever-\nmore effective diagnostic tools, like digital mammography, and through \nthe development of innovative new treatment and preventative drugs, \nlike Tamoxifin, we are slowly but surely beginning to get the upper \nhand on this disease.\n  But early detection remains the key. That is why the American Cancer \nSociety recommendations on screening are so important: women aged 40 \nand above should have annual mammograms and clinical breast \nexaminations; women aged 20 to 39 should have clinical examinations \nevery three years; and all women 20 and over should conduct a breast \nself-examination every month.\n  Finally, I would note that the Senate just this week passed the \nBreast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, a bill that ensures that \nwomen who do not have health insurance and who are found to have either \nbreast or cervical cancer through the Federal Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection Program, will get the follow-up care they need.\n  We have come a long way from the days when former First Lady Betty \nFord brought breast cancer out into the national discourse, beginning \nthe long overdue dialogue and public awareness campaign to save women's \nlives. But we still have much to do to match her courage and to live-up \nto her vision of the day when all women are appropriately screened and \nwhen we defeat breast cancer once and for all.\n  During this month, I urge my colleagues in Congress and all Americans \nto reflect upon this issue, to support research and efforts, and to arm \nthemselves with the knowledge they need to respond should the \nunthinkable occur in their lives or in the lives of a loved one. \nWorking together, we can and will beat breast cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10148-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10148-S10149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHINA's CONVENTIONAL FORCE MILITARY MODERNIZATION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I call attention to a report prepared at my \nrequest by the Library of Congress' Congressional Research Service \nentitled ``China's Foreign Conventional Arms Acquisitions: Background \nand Analysis.'' As ranking member of the Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I have been keenly interested in the implications of \nChinese conventional force modernization on Asian stability.\n  I am providing copies of this excellent analysis, which was \nauthorized by Shirley Kan, Christopher Bolkcom, and Ronald O'Rourke, to \nall Senators. I believe my colleagues will find the report useful and \ninsightful as we assess American policy towards China.\n  The report examines the major foreign conventional weapon systems \nthat China has acquired or has committed to acquire since 1990, with \nparticular attention to implications for U.S. security concerns. It \npays special attention to Chinese air and naval acquisitions and \ndescribes how Chinese leaders began to pay greater attention to \nmodernizing the People's Liberation Army, PLA, in the early 1990s, \ntransforming it from a force mainly oriented towards domestic security \nto one focused on modern warfare. Since then, China has ranked among \nthe top 10 leading arms buyers among developing nations.\n  According to the analysis, the catalyst for PLA modernization, \nincluding the procurement of advanced foreign military equipment, was \nChina's view that its top security problem was preventing Taiwan's \npermanent separation and securing unification as ``one China.'' \nHowever, additional security goals may be precluding Japan's rise as \nthe strongest Asian power, ensuring Chinese influence over the Korean \nPeninsula, supporting Chinese claims to territory in the East and South \nChina Seas, subduing India's quest for power, and countering American \npower in the region.\n  As China modernizes its forces, it is clear that arms sales from \nRussia are essential, providing advance aircraft, including Su-27 \nfighters, missile systems, submarines, and surface ships. The report is \nunclear as to the strategic advantage derived by Russia in selling such \nadvanced systems to a country with which it historically has had \ndifficulty along a shared border.\n  The report concludes that the operational significance of these major \nqualitative upgrades through foreign arms acquisitions remains to be \nseen and will depend in large measure on the PLA's ability to \ndemonstrate an ability to conduct effective joint military operations.\n  The report also does an excellent job of comparing Chinese new \nconventional weapons to American capabilities, suggesting that in most \ncases--with some critical exceptions--American forces still retain a \ntactical and strategic edge. For example, the report mentions the \npotential threat from a nuclear armed SS-N-22, an anti-ship cruise \nmissile, and the superior capabilities of the Su-27 fighter aircraft. \nObviously, the United States should not be complacent. The Chinese are, \nfor the first time in modern history, developing a capability to \nproject air and naval forces beyond their coastal areas. The Untied \nStates needs to seek ways to address any threat to American interests \nas a result of that capability not only through pursuing our own \nmilitary modernization program but also through a strategic dialogue \nwith China which reassures China that we\n\n[[Page S10149]]\n\nhave a shared desire in regional stability. Indeed, in many ways, \ninitiating a productive diplomatic dialogue with China on Asian \nsecurity may be more difficult than maintaining our qualitative edge on \npower projection.\n  Again, I commend this excellent report by the Congressional Research \nService which was coordinated by Shirley Kan, a specialist in National \nSecurity Policy. It is one of the most comprehensive, unclassified \nassessments currently available on Chinese conventional arms \nacquisitions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10149-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Cherry was at home with her two small children and a friend when \nher husband forced his way into her house and shot her in the head. \nCherry was separated from her husband, who police say had a history of \ndomestic violence.\n  We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. \nThe deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to \nenact sensible gun legislation now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10149-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10149-S10150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CUBA POLICY AND SENATE PROCESSES\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish we were here on the Senate floor \ndiscussing and debating the important issues that are in the Commerce-\nJustice-State Appropriations bill. I strenuously object to the fact \nthat we are not doing just that. This bill will not be debated on the \nfloor today, or probably any day this session. In fact, we will likely \nhave no opportunity to debate this bill, to offer amendments, or to \nvote on it. The plan is to wrap it up in an omnibus bill of some sort \nas the session ends.\n  This is no way to legislate. This is no way to lead. This goes \nagainst the very basis of what our country is about. Our Government is \nbased on principles of transparency and openness. Our processes are \nsupposed to be open to public scrutiny and comment.\n  Robert Hutchins, former President of the University of Chicago and \none of the most esteemed American intellectuals of the 20th century, \nwrote:\n\n       The death of democracy is not likely to be an assassination \n     from ambush. It will be a slow extinction from apathy, \n     indifference, and undernourishment.\n\n  Senators have been disenfranchised because of a distorted legislative \nprocess. And that means the American citizens who sent us to represent \nthem have also been disenfranchised. I object to how this Congress is \nbeing run.\n  There are many important issues that should be of concern to Senators \nin the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. I will take a few \nmoments today to address one of those issues. It needs public vetting, \neven if we are being deprived of our rights to debate it and vote on \nit.\n  The issue is TV Marti. This is a television station owned and \noperated by the U.S. Government. It broadcasts daily to Cuba. For more \nthan a decade we beamed TV signals to Havana. The problem is that no \none watches TV Marti. No one. And under this appropriations bill, we \nwill spend another $9.5 million next year on a television station that \nno one watches. Let me explain.\n  The creation of TV Marti and Radio Marti was a good idea \nconceptually. With no freedom in Cuba, the United States Government \nwould beam into Cuba uncensored news about the world and about what was \nreally going on inside Cuba. The Cuban people, deprived of their \nfreedoms, would have a source of news.\n  What has TV Marti accomplished since its creation in 1989? Has it \npenetrated the Cuban television market and provided the Cuban people \nwith information that Castro wants to hide from them? The answer is a \nresounding no. Virtually nobody in Cuba has even heard of TV Marti. \nAccording to research commissioned by the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors, the agency that runs TV Marti, 9 out of 10 Cubans don't even \nknow it exists.\n  The same research by the Broadcasting Board of Governors asked over \n1,000 adults whether they had watched TV Marti in the past week. The \nanswer was no one had watched. Not a single person. How many had \nwatched TV Marti in the past year? One. One person out of a thousand.\n  Most Cubans watch television. None watches TV Marti. There are two \nmajor reasons.\n  First, TV Marti is on the air when Cubans are asleep. It broadcasts \nonly from 3:30 in the morning until 8:00 A.M. TV Marti has to respect \ninternational broadcast rules which require that it not interfere with \nCuban TV transmissions. So TV Marti can broadcast only when no Cuban \nstation wants to use the same frequency. That is, it broadcasts when \nnobody watches television.\n  Second, there is nothing to see. It is just snow on the screen. The \nCuban government has effectively jammed the video portion of TV Marti \nsince its inception.\n  So, for $9.5 million in the coming fiscal year, $139 million over the \nlast decade, another $100 million over the next decade, we ask Cubans \nto get up in the middle of the night to watch snow on a blank screen. \nThis makes no sense at all.\n  Last year, some changes were made in TV Marti, although they are not \nlikely to result in Cuban citizens watching.\n  Defenders of TV Marti contend that it is a long-term investment. They \nsay that someday Fidel Castro will be gone. When that happens, we will \nwant to get accurate information to the Cuban people. Defenders of TV \nMarti claim that we will save money by having TV Marti up and running \nat that point.\n  I don't buy this argument. So far we have spent $139 million to have \nTV Marti in place in case Castro suddenly leaves the scene. At the rate \nof spending in this appropriations bill, we will spend more than $100 \nmillion over the coming decade. That is, total spending of a quarter of \na billion dollars for a contingency when Radio Marti is already \noperating and can get information to Cuban citizens. Is this cost \neffective? Hardly.\n  TV Marti is a dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War. We should not spend \nanother $10 million to preserve a worthless skeleton. We should bury it \nonce and for all this year.\n  I am compelled by the events of last week in the Agricultural \nAppropriations conference to raise another aspect of our Cuba policy. \nEarlier this year, both the Senate and the House agreed, by \noverwhelmingly majorities, to end the ban on food and medicine sales to \nCuba. The votes clearly reflected the will of the American people. Yet \nthe Republican majority on this conference rejected the House and \nSenate votes and thwarted the will of the people. They agreed to \nmaintain restrictions on the sale of food and medicine that make any \nsignificant progress virtually impossible.\n  Then, to make matters worse, the Republican conferees converted \ncurrent administrative restrictions on travel to Cuba into legal \nrestrictions. The result is that the right of Americans to travel \nfreely, and the right of\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\nCuban Americans to visit family members in Cuba, are going to be \nabridged more than ever.\n  This is a travesty of our democracy. How can we allow a small group \nin the Republican leadership to flaunt the overwhelming will of the \nCongress, to maintain an anachronistic, Cold War policy toward Cuba \nthat harms the average Cuban and risks great danger once the transition \nfrom the Castro regime begins, and to abridge the rights and freedom of \nAmericans? I am profoundly unhappy with this result, and I protest the \nway this legislative process is being conducted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10150-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       ANNIVERSARY OF THE LITHONIA FIRST UNITED METHODIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, in my lifetime, I have witnessed \nmany changes, experienced fantastic joys, and seen countless faces. It \nis easy in today's fast-moving society to find yourself caught in a \nperpetual whirlwind. With days full of appointments and meetings, life \nsometimes seems to lose all semblance of stability. Luckily, I have \nalways had a source of peace and inspiration in my life, Lithonia First \nUnited Methodist Church.\n  With great personal pride and happiness, I come before you today to \ncommemorate an anniversary that is of particular importance to my \nfamily and me. One hundred-forty years ago, on Sunday, October 14, \n1860, a small group of Lithonians convened for the first time to \nworship under the leadership of the Reverend Newdaygate B. Ousley. From \nits humble beginnings in a one room meeting house, Lithonia Methodist \nEpiscopal Church, the forerunner to Lithonia First United Methodist \nChurch began its ministry and a tradition of service that continues \neven today.\n  It is ironic that a church that grew during the tumult of the Civil \nWar has lasted as long as Lithonia First has. In fact, it is perhaps \neven more astounding that over the years since its first meeting, \nduring a time that has seen two world wars and countless technological \ninnovations, the church has pulled even closer together and taken on a \nsignificant leadership role in its Georgia community.\n  For 140 years, Lithonia First United Methodist Church has provided \nservices and leadership for the surrounding region. Through personal \noutreach, family ministry, and organizing events like flea markets and \nbarbeques to raise money for the needy, Lithonia First has solidified \nits place of leadership in its community.\n  Since its simple beginnings, Lithonia First United Methodist Church \nhas grown and become a source of stability and inspiration for its \ncongregants. Under the ministry of its Pastor, Dr. Lawrence E. Wilson, \nthe church has proven how important faith is to our prosperity, and \nillustrated the power of a community united. It is my pleasure to honor \nLithonia First United Methodist Church for its historic anniversary. I \nam forever grateful for the church's acceptance, dedication, and \ncommitment, I am truly blessed to be a part of such a wonderful \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10150-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLONEL TERRY WILCUTT\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nKentuckian Terry Wilcutt on the occasion of his recent journey to the \nInternational Space Station as commander of the space shuttle Atlantis.\n  Congratulations to Colonel Wilcutt, on achieving the kind of academic \nand professional success it takes to receive the honor of commanding a \nflight into space. Colonel Wilcutt has flown to space not once, but \nfour times, and on two such flights he has held the title of mission \ncommander. I, along with my fellow Kentuckians, am certainly proud to \ncall him one of Kentucky's own. His accomplishments speak well for his \nhome state as well as his alma mater, Western Kentucky University.\n  Colonel Wilcutt is a Kentuckian, born and bred. He was born in \nRussellville, KY, graduated from Louisville's Southern High School in \n1967, and is a 1974 graduate of Western Kentucky University with a \nbachelor of arts degree in math. Colonel Wilcutt taught high school \nmath for 2 years and then entered the Marine Corps. While in the Marine \nCorps, he attended the notorious ``Topgun'' Naval Fighter Weapons \nSchool, achieved honors at every level of pilot training and has logged \nover 4,400 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft.\n  Colonel Wilcutt's career in aeronautics began in 1990 when he was \nselected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, to \nbecome an astronaut. Prior to his September 2000 trip to space, Colonel \nWilcutt flew on three missions to space and logged more than 724 hours \nin space.\n  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, I congratulate \nyou on your accomplishments. Only a handful of Americans reach the \nlevel of excellence required and receive the honor of being selected to \nlead missions into space. Colonel Wilcutt, I am proud of you, your \nfellow Kentuckians are proud of you, and your alma mater of Western \nKentucky University is proud of you. Thank you for your brave service \nto our country, and best wishes for further success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10150-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10150-S10151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PRAISING THE PRESIDENT FOR HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER PROMOTING FEDERAL \n          CONTRACT OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today to commend the \nPresident for issuing Executive Order 11625, designed to help \nstrengthen the Federal Government's commitment to providing contracting \nopportunities to disadvantaged businesses.\n  In 1998, I took to the floor to successfully defend the \nTransportation Department's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) \nprogram from those who sought to weaken it. Today, I am pleased to \nspeak out in favor of the President's efforts to strengthen programs \nlike the DBE, along with all minority-owned business government \ncontracting programs.\n  It should come as no surprise to anyone in this Chamber familiar with \nsmall businesses, especially minority owned firms, that government \ncontracting can help provide a strong foundation to build a prosperous \nsmall business. As any successful graduate of the Small Business \nAdministration's 8(a) program will tell you, it provides the \nopportunities, but you have to supply the entrepreneurial spirit and \nhard work.\n  And this hand-up approach is what I mean by assisting minority-owned \nfirms. These programs are not a handout. Rather, they exist to help \nlevel the playing field and to combat the inequities in our society \nthat may prevent these firms from receiving the same opportunities \navailable to other businesses.\n  These contracts are beneficial not just because they provide initial \ncontracts to small disadvantaged firms, they also help minority firms \nestablish a record of providing goods and services to the Federal \nGovernment. This is of critical importance because it assists these \nbusinesses in obtaining future contracts. In turn, these firms help \nprovide jobs and competition to larger businesses, saving the taxpayers \nmoney through reduced costs and time saving innovations. Thus, these \nprograms have direct and indirect benefits to our economy at all \nlevels.\n  The Executive Order signed by President Clinton on Friday will help \nstrengthen minority business ownership by directing Federal agencies to \ntake affirmative steps to increase contracting between the Federal \ngovernment and Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 8(a) Businesses, and \nMinority Business Enterprises. The Executive Order also holds Federal \nagencies accountable for carrying out the terms of the Order by \nrequiring them to develop a long-term strategic plan and to submit \nannual reports to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of their \nefforts to increase contracting with disadvantaged businesses; requires \nFederal agencies to ensure the participation of small and disadvantaged \nbusinesses when procuring information technology and telecommunications \nservices; and directs Federal departments and agencies to ensure that \nall creation, placement, and transmission of federal advertising are \nfully reflective of the nation's diversity.\n  I applaud President Clinton's action to help ensure the vitality of \nminority-\n\n[[Page S10151]]\n\nowned small businesses. As the Senior Democrat on the Senate Committee \non Small Business and a long time supporter of these programs, I urge \nOMB to forward the agencies' plans and their implementation reports to \nthe House and Senate Committees on Small Business for further \nreview.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10151-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HEALTHIER BABIES MONTH\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to applaud the support \nthe March of Dimes provides for the Campaign for Healthier Babies \nMonth. This month focuses attention on the March of Dimes Birth Defects \nFoundation and its many efforts to reduce the more than 150,000 birth \ndefects which occur every year.\n  Debilitating birth defects leave our kids unable to walk, hear, \nthink, or fight off disease. However, with the support of organizations \nlike March of Dimes, community health programs, and especially local \nadvocacy groups, the number of children affected by some 5,000 \ndifferent types of birth defects continues to steadily decline. Since \n1960, infant deaths related to birth defects have been cut in half due \nto increased awareness and medical advances in both surgery and \nspecialized care in neonatal intensive care units.\n  The March of Dimes Foundation has played a major role in increasing \nthe likelihood that children with birth defects will live to see their \nfirst birthday. Over the last decade, scientists have discovered that \nwomen who take a daily supplement of B vitamin folic acid in \ncombination with a healthy diet--especially before pregnancy--greatly \nreduce the chances of their child being affected by birth defects.\n  Another vital step in reducing the chances of birth defects is the \naccessibility of prenatal care. My own state of Minnesota has one of \nAmerica's finest health care systems and, as a result, ranks in the top \nten states with regard to low birth-weight and infant mortality. But \nthere are many states that are not as fortunate, and I firmly believe \nrecognition of this campaign will help drive change which can have a \nprofound impact on prenatal and perinatal care.\n  In the 105th Congress, the March of Dimes was instrumental in the \npassage of the Birth Defects Prevention Act, which established the \nfirst nationwide network of birth defects monitoring programs. I am \nconfident the law complements March of Dime's efforts in the areas of \nboth alcohol avoidance in preventing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and the \nfolic acid vitamin supplement program in preventing neural tube \ndefects, NTDs. NTDs are among the most serious and common birth defects \nin the United States affecting some 2,500 babies each year, and are a \nresult of an underdeveloped brain and spinal cord. The most common NTD \nis spina bifida, a leading cause of childhood paralysis.\n  Birth defects like these can affect any family. As we head into the \nnew millennium, filled with endless possibilities, I am proud and \nhonored to be able to pay tribute to those whose tireless efforts \nresult in dramatic reductions in the number of birth defects in the \nUnited States every year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10151-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO FORMER GOVERNOR LEROY COLLINS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, amid the violence and uncertainty \nof the Civil Rights movement, many people distinguished themselves \nwhile fighting for fairness and justice. Men and women risked great \npersonal harm and displayed unparalleled courage in a struggle none of \nus must ever forget. Although many of the names of those who fought for \nfairness have been lost to history, it is important to honor these \nselfless warriors of equality.\n  Although his name is not as familiar as those of Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. and James Farmer, Mr. LeRoy Collins, former Governor of \nFlorida, played an instrumental role in preventing violence and \nensuring the success of demonstrations one fateful Spring day in Selma, \nAL, 35 years ago. As marchers arrived at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in \nSelma, they hoped against hope that a repeat of ``Bloody Sunday'' was \nnot waiting for them.\n  President Lyndon Johnson, having witnessed the unconscionable \nviolence initiated by Alabama State troopers on March 7, 1965, sought \nto stave off another potentially bloody day, and entrusted LeRoy \nCollins with the delicate task of easing the extremely tense situation.\n  Over the course of the day, Mr. Collins crisscrossed the Pettus \nBridge, negotiating at either end with Dr. King and representatives of \nthe Alabama police. After a tireless effort, Mr. Collins eventually \nsecured an agreement that not only allowed the marchers to cross the \nbridge, but also prevented the violent clash so many people had feared. \nLater that day, with Alabama State troopers and the entire Nation \nlooking on, 2,000 people led by Dr. King peacefully marched across the \nEdmund Pettus Bridge.\n  In an era known for its heated violence, peaceful encounters were a \nwelcome surprise. The nonviolent nature of the second march across the \nPettus Bridge was in no small measure a result of LeRoy Collins \ndiligence and courage. One can imagine that had a deal not been \nbrokered, an encounter, possibly more violent than the one on ``Bloody \nSunday,'' could very easily have taken place.\n  LeRoy Collins' work illustrates why it is important to go beyond the \nstories printed in the history books. His hard work and selfless effort \nsaved lives and empowered the movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. In a world seemingly devoid of real heroes, it is important to \nhonor those who have made truly significant contributions to our \nNation. It took a great man to accomplish what Mr. Collins did. As Dr. \nKing once wrote, ``Human progress never rolls on wheels of \ninevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to \nbe co-workers with God.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10151-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10151-S10152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TAIWAN'S NATIONAL HOLIDAY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today, October 10th, is the 89th \nobservance of National Day in the Republic of China on Taiwan. From its \nearly days of struggle on the Chinese mainland to the establishment of \nthe vigorous democracy and free market economy that we know today on \nTaiwan, the Republic of China has made great strides since its founding \non October 10, 1911.\n  The vision of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of \nChina, was expressed in what he called the ``Three Principles of the \nPeople''--nationalism, democracy, and the people's well being. We all \nhope that Dr. Sun's vision, which has been realized so impressively on \nTaiwan, will some day be equally as true on the Chinese mainland.\n  Taiwan held its most recent parliamentary election in December 1998 \nand, of course, conducted its most recent presidential election just \nthis past March. The election of Chen Shui-bian as president marked \nTaiwan's first transition of power from one party to another at the \nnational level. Even more important, it marked the first time in the \n5,000-year-long history of Chinese society that one democratically-\nelected head of state was succeeded by another.\n  In the economic and social fields, Taiwan's success is well known. \nThe 22 million people of Taiwan are responsible for the 19th largest \ngross national product in the world. Japan is the only country with a \nlarger population in all of Asia that has a higher standard of living \nthan Taiwan's. Taiwan has an extraordinarily diversified economy: all \nthe way from being virtually a ``silicon island'' and the world's third \nlargest supplier of computer chips to being a major manufacturing power \nin such heavy industries as steel and shipbuilding.\n  All of this has not come about by accident. Wise leadership, dating \nback to the 1950's, laid the groundwork for the dynamic nation we see \ntoday. With strong and continued American support--and this is ever \nmore crucial to the security and stability of the entire East Asia \nregion--Taiwan will thrive and prosper far into the future. Believe me, \nthe world is watching to see how the United States treats democratic \nTaiwan, because the future of every other democracy in East Asia is \nultimately contingent on the stand we take.\n  The success of Taiwan must also continue to serve as an example--as \nwell as a challenge--to the people and government on the Chinese \nmainland. The free, prosperous, democratic society that Taiwan has \nbecome is a glimpse of what can come to be on the mainland if\n\n[[Page S10152]]\n\nthe dictatorship in Beijing would get out of the way.\n  And so I salute the Republic of China on Taiwan on the occasion of \nNational Day. And I look forward to many more celebrations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10152-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 130TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY SPARTAN MARCHING \n                                  BAND\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to give recognition \nto one of Michigan State University's oldest institutions, the Spartan \nMarching Band. The Spartan Marching Band was formed in 1870 at the then \nMichigan Agricultural College, by Civil War Veteran and student Ransom \nMc Donough. The band consisted of ten members and was all brass. The \nsmall group participated in drills and parades.\n  Throughout its 130 years, the band has evolved tremendously with the \ntimes as any successful organization must. And throughout its long \nhistory, the band has exemplified excellence and has represented the \nuniversity with great pride and honor. The Michigan State University \nMarching Band welcomed the football team and fans for over 100 years \nand has accompanied the team to numerous bowl games, including four \nRose Bowl appearances. The band has played for four presidents and \nappeared at the New York World's Fair.\n  The person who had perhaps the most significant impact on the Spartan \nMarching Band was Leonard Falcone. Mr. Falcone was appointed band \ndirector in 1927 and served Michigan State university and the Music \nprogram for 40 years. Mr. Falcone was affectionately known as ``The \nDean of Big Ten Bands.'' Aside from his unprecedented tenure, Mr. \nFalcone is credited with arranging the music to the MSU Alma Mater, \n``MSU Shadows'' and composing the music to the greatest college fight \nsong in the world, the ``MSU Fight Song.'' So revered was Mr. Falcone \nthat on the eve of his death in 1985, former and present members of the \nSpartan Marching Band visited him and serenaded him with the ``MSU \nFight Son'' and ``MSU Shadows.''\n  The Spartan Marching Band has continuously set the standard for the \nNation's marching bands. It is well known throughout our State and \nNation for its innovative and intricate marching style and excellent \nmusical arrangements. Through its long legacy, which continues today \nunder the fine leadership of band director John T. Madden, the Spartan \nMarching Band continues to set the standard for Michigan State pride.\n  Through its achievements the Spartan Marching Band has represented \nthe face of Michigan State University for the past 130 years. From its \nstreet beat cadence called ``The Series,'' to the traditional ``Kick-\nStep'' entrance into the stadium for pregame, to the singing of ``MSU \nShadows,'' to Military regimental traditions adhered to by all members, \nthe Spartan Marching Band is a true ambassador of Michigan State \nUniversity.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my \ngood friend Ellen Williams for her tremendous work as chairwoman of the \nKentucky Republican Party.\n  To say that Ellen Williams is a busy woman is quite the \nunderstatement. Besides being a wife, Mom, soccer coach, and part-time \ncareer woman, Ellen is chairwoman of the Republican Party of Kentucky. \nShe has a history of service spanning more than 15 years, which \nincludes work in President Reagan's 1984 reelection campaign, Larry \nForgy's 1995 gubernatorial campaign, and as state executive director of \nthe Kentucky Republican Party in 1992-93. Ellen has shared her time, \nknowledge, and spirit with Kentucky Republicans over the last several \nyears, and she continues to share her able leadership skills with us \nnow as chairwoman of our party.\n  Ellen is a confident, capable leader. In her position as chairwoman, \none of her many responsibilities is to be the voice of the Kentucky \nRepublican Party. Ellen makes it her business to have her finger on the \npulse of the State's Republicans. Considering the liberal leaning \nnature of the Kentucky press, I am fully aware of the challenge that \nbeing a spokesperson presents. Ellen is a true professional when it \ncomes to dealing with the media, and handles each statement she gives \nand each press conference she holds with style and grace.\n  Another part of Ellen's job is to rally Kentucky Republicans for \nlocal, State and national races. This responsibility requires her to do \na great deal of traveling--a recent Anderson News article says that \nEllen has driven nearly 30,000 miles in the last year going to meetings \nand party events across the State. The fresh enthusiasm Ellen has \nbrought to her post as chairwoman is invaluable, and I thank you, \nEllen, for all that you do.\n  I also thank your husband, Greg, whom you have referred to as your \n``co-chairman,'' and to your two young sons, Sam and Joey. I thank them \nfor sharing you with Kentucky's Republicans, and for the love and \nsupport they provide which makes it possible for you to do the \nexcellent job you do.\n  Ellen leads the party during an exciting time in Kentucky politics \nand in national politics. Our great state boasts two Republican U.S. \nSenators, five Republican Members of the U.S. Congress, a Republican \nmajority in the State senate, and a promising November election for our \nPresidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. As chairman of Bush/Cheney \n2000 in Kentucky, I want to say a special thank you, Ellen, for all of \nyour hard work thus far. Thank you in advance for all of the hours of \nwork yet to come before November 7.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10152-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WEB PORTAL ALLIANCE--ZURICH MEDNET\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a recent \nalliance which has been made between two internationally recognized \nbiomedical web-portals or web-based information exchanges. This \nalliance, I believe will have a dramatic impact on the way biomedical \ninformation is exchanged and used in developing new medical devices, \npharmaceutical products, and life-saving medical techniques.\n  Mr. President, several weeks ago, I, along with my staff, had the \npleasure of participating in an event hosted by the Swiss ambassador to \nthe United States, Alfred DeFago, introducing the newly created \nalliance between MBBNet and Zurich MedNet.\n  MBBNet, a web portal, administered by the University of Minnesota, \ntogether with over 900 medical biotech companies and programs, have \nbeen the driving forces behind the accumulation and distribution of \nmedical research and open source information for academicians, medical \nprofessionals, and corporate researchers in Minnesota and the United \nStates. Zurich MedNet shares the same history, being the largest \nmedical and biotech cluster in Europe. Together these two exchanges, \nZurich MedNet and MBBNet by electronically combining resources, are \nsetting international boundaries aside and taking meaningful strides \ntoward the development and improvement of medical education and \ninnovative medical technologies both here in the United States and \nabroad. I am convinced that alliances like this will help shape the \nresearch and development strategies across all industries in the future \nand I am pleased that Minnesota has again stepped to the fore and \nprovided that kind of leadership. We all stand to benefit.\n  I look forward to other industries following the lead that Zurich \nMedNet and MBBNet have established, and I believe it is a positive step \ntoward international cooperation others should seek to emulate. Mr. \nPresident, I would again like to thank Ambassador DeFago, and my \ncolleagues that have helped and supported this endeavor, and I look \nforward to doing all I can to ensure the future success of this \nimportant alliance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10152-4", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10152-S10153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 1999, the \nSecretary of the Senate, during the recess\n\n[[Page S10153]]\n\nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4444.

A bill to amend laws relating to the lands of the citizens \nof the Muscogee (Creek), Seminole, Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw \nNations, historically referred to as the Five Civilized Tribes, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n             five nations citizens land reform act of 2000\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill by request of the \nmembers of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole \nNations, historically referred to as the ``Five Civilized Tribes,'' who \nstill own individual Indian restricted land or ``restricted property.''\n  The proposed bill would repeal aspects of the Stigler Act of 1947--\nthe 1947 Act--and the Act of June 14, 1918--the 1918 Act--which subject \nthe transactions of restricted property to the jurisdiction of \nOklahoma's district courts and leave such lands open to adverse \npossession.\n  By way of background, the issue of individual restricted Indian lands \nhas had a long legislative history. Between 1906 and 1970, Congress \nenacted numerous laws dealing specifically with the individually \nallotted lands of the ``Five Civilized Tribes.'' Collectively, these \nlaws have created a complex system of Indian land tenure in eastern \nOklahoma. These laws are unique to eastern Oklahoma and are not \napplicable either in western Oklahoma or elsewhere in the United \nStates.\n  Due to these laws, thousands of acres of Indian lands in eastern \nOklahoma have gone unprobated for years, causing ownership of these \nlands to be increasingly fractionated and more difficult to manage for \nthe benefit of the devisees or undetermined heirs. Indian allotments \nelsewhere in the United States, on the other hand, are generally held \nin trust under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Interior. The goal \nof this legislation is to provide the remaining restricted Indian \nallotments in eastern Oklahoma, to the greatest extent feasible, with \nthe same kind of protections as are afforded trust allotments in \nwestern Oklahoma and all other reservations in the United States. The \nbill would also include these lands in the national efforts to \nalleviate the growing problem of fractionated ownership.\n  Notwithstanding these goals, great lengths have been taken to draft \nthe bill so that it would be ``tax neutral'' as to the county tax \nrolls. The bill is written to help preserve what is left of the \nindividual Indian restricted land base, reducing the rate at which the \ncurrent inventory of restricted property in eastern Oklahoma passes out \nof restricted status. The bill would not allow Indian members of the \nFive Civilized Tribes to simply acquire fee land and have it placed in \nrestricted status.\n  With time very limited in the remaining days of the 106th Congress, I \ndo not intend to rush this bill through Congress, denying adequate \nhearings and oversight, but simply to demonstrate to all interested \nparties that this legislation is a serious effort to reform the 1947 \nact. This bill has been through many drafts in recent months and much \nprogress has been made to achieve a workable bill. I am hopeful that \nCongress can enact this reform next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2528, and the \nSenate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2528) to provide funds for the purchase of \n     automatic external defibrillators and the training of \n     individuals in advanced cardiac life support.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering S. 2528, the Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act of 2000, \nwhich I introduced with my friend from Wisconsin, Senator Russ \nFeingold. Our bill is intended to improve access to automated external \ndefibrillators in small communities and rural areas to boost the \nsurvival rates of individuals in those communities who suffer cardiac \narrest. Joining us as cosponsors of the bill are Senators Jeffords, \nMurray, Abraham, Wellstone, Hutchinson, Dorgan, Grams, Bingaman, \nChafee, Enzi, Snowe, Grassley, Biden, Leahy, Robb, Kerry,and Durbin. I \nparticularly want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Jeffords, for \nall of his assistance in helping us to expedite action on this \nimportant measure.\n  Heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the state of \nMaine and in the United States. According to the American Heart \nAssociation, an estimated 250,000 Americans die each year from cardiac \narrest. Many of these deaths could be prevented if automated external \ndefibrillators--or AEDs--were more accessible. AEDs are computerized \ndevices that can shock a heart back into normal rhythm and restore life \nto a cardiac arrest victim. They must, however, be used promptly. For \nevery minute that passes before a victim's normal heart rhythm is \nrestored, his or her chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent.\n  We have a number of new and improved technologies in our arsenal of \nweapons to fight heart disease, including a new generation of small, \neasy-to-use AEDs that can strengthen the chain of survival for cardiac \narrest victims. These new devices make it possible for not only \nemergency medical personnel, but also trained lay rescuers, to deliver \ndefibrillation safely and effectively. The new AEDs are safe, \neffective, lightweight, low maintenance, and relatively inexpensive. \nMoreover, they are specifically designed so that they can be used by \nnon-medical personnel such as police, fire fighters, security guards \nand other lay rescuers, providing they have been properly trained. \nAccording to the American Heart Association, making AEDs standard \nequipment in police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and other emergency \nvehicles and getting these devices into more public places could save \nmore than 50,000 lives a year.\n  Last December, the Bangor Mall installed an AED that is one of the \nfirst of these devices in Maine to be placed in a public setting \noutside the direct control of emergency medical personnel and hospital \nstaff. Both the AED and an oxygen tank are kept inside a customer \nservice booth, which is in an area of the mall where there is a high \nconcentration of traffic and where heart emergencies might occur. Mall \npersonnel have also received special training and, during mall hours, \nthere is always at least one person who has been certified in both CPR \nand defibrillator use.\n  For at least one Bangor woman, this has been a lifesaver. On January \n12th, just weeks after the AED was installed, two shoppers at the Mall \ncollapsed in a single day. One was given oxygen and quickly revived. \nBut the other shopper was unconscious and had stopped breathing. The \ntrained mall staff--Maintenance Supervisor Larry Lee, Security Chief \nDusty Rhodes, and General Manager Roy Daigle-- were only able to detect \na faint pulse. They quickly commenced CPR and attached the AED.\n  It is important to note that defibrillation is intended to \nsupplement, not replace standard CPR. These devices, which are almost \ncompletely automated, run frequent self-diagnostics and will not allow \nthe administration of shock unless the victim's recorded heart pattern \nrequires it. When the AED is attached, it automatically analyzes the \nvictim's vital signs. One of two commands will then be voiced and \ndisplayed by the unit: ``Shock advised--charging''; or ``Shock not \nadvised--continue CPR.''\n\n  In the Bangor Mall case, the shock was not advised, so CPR was \ncontinued until the emergency medical personnel arrived. The EMT's told \nMr. Daigle, the General Manager of the mall, that the woman--who had \nhad a heart attack and subsequently required triple by-pass surgery--\nsimply would not have survived if they had not been so prepared. As Mr. \nDaigle observed, ``Twelve to fifteen minutes is just too long to wait \nfor the emergency services to arrive.''\n  Cities across America have begun to recognize the value of fast \naccess to AEDs and are making them available to emergency responders. \nIn many small and rural communities, however, limited budgets and the \nfact that so many rely on volunteer organizations for emergency \nservices can make acquisition and appropriate training in the use of \nthese life-saving devices problematic.\n  The legislation we are considering today is intended to increase \naccess to AEDs and trained local responders for smaller towns and rural \nareas in Maine and elsewhere where those first on the scene may not be \nparamedics or others who would normally have AEDs. Our bill provides \n$25 million over three years to be given as grants to community \npartnerships consisting of local emergency responders, police and fire \ndepartments, hospitals, and other community organizations. This money \ncould then be used to help purchase AEDs and train potential responders \nin their use, as well as in basic CPR and first aid.\n  The Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act has been endorsed by both \nthe American Heart Association and the American Red Cross as a means of \nexpanding access to these lifesaving devices across rural America, and \nI urge all of our colleagues to join us in supporting this important \nmeasure.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2528) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2528\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the \n     United States.\n       (2) The American Heart Association estimates that 250,000 \n     Americans die from sudden cardiac arrest each year.\n       (3) A cardiac arrest victim's chance of survival drops 10 \n     percent for every minute that passes before his or her heart \n     is returned to normal rhythm.\n       (4) Because most cardiac arrest victims are initially in \n     ventricular fibrillation, and the\n\n[[Page S10161]]\n\n     only treatment for ventricular fibrillation is \n     defibrillation, prompt access to defibrillation to return the \n     heart to normal rhythm is essential.\n       (5) Lifesaving technology, the automated external \n     defibrillator, has been developed to allow trained lay \n     rescuers to respond to cardiac arrest by using this simple \n     device to shock the heart into normal rhythm.\n       (6) Those people who are likely to be first on the scene of \n     a cardiac arrest situation in many communities, particularly \n     smaller and rural communities, lack sufficient numbers of \n     automated external defibrillators to respond to cardiac \n     arrest in a timely manner.\n       (7) The American Heart Association estimates that more than \n     50,000 deaths could be prevented each year if defibrillators \n     were more widely available to designated responders.\n       (8) Legislation should be enacted to encourage greater \n     public access to automated external defibrillators in \n     communities across the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. GRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, acting through the Rural Health Outreach Office of \n     the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall award \n     grants to community partnerships that meet the requirements \n     of subsection (b) to enable such partnerships to purchase \n     equipment and provide training as provided for in subsection \n     (c).\n       (b) Community Partnerships.--A community partnership meets \n     the requirements of this subsection if such partnership--\n       (1) is composed of local emergency response entities such \n     as community training facilities, local emergency responders, \n     fire and rescue departments, police, community hospitals, and \n     local non-profit entities and for-profit entities concerned \n     about cardiac arrest survival rates;\n       (2) evaluates the local community emergency response times \n     to assess whether they meet the standards established by \n     national public health organizations such as the American \n     Heart Association and the American Red Cross; and\n       (3) submits to the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     an application at such time, in such manner, and containing \n     such information as the Secretary may require.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--Amounts provided under a grant under \n     this section shall be used--\n       (1) to purchase automatic external defibrillators that have \n     been approved, or cleared for marketing, by the Food and Drug \n     Administration; and\n       (2) to provide defibrillator and basic life support \n     training in automated external defibrillator usage through \n     the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, or \n     other nationally recognized training courses.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 4 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall prepare and submit to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress a report containing data relating to \n     whether the increased availability of defibrillators has \n     affected survival rates in the communities in which grantees \n     under this section operated. The procedures under which the \n     Secretary obtains data and prepares the report under this \n     subsection shall not impose an undue burden on program \n     participants under this section.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2001 through \n     2003 to carry out this section.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/10/senate-section/article/S10161-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2000\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.
