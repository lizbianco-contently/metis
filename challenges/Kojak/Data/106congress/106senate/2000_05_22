I noticed in the Washington Post this morning an \neditorial I wanted to comment on briefly. Those noted experts on \nagriculture and the farm program who write editorials for the \nWashington Post have written an editorial today entitled ``A Deal Too \nSweet'' about the sugar program. I can just see them sitting out there \nin their Big Ben coveralls dumping sugar into their coffee, cogitating \nabout America's sugar program and America's farm program. I want to \nsuggest to them to look in a different direction.\n  They see a program in this country where sugar prices are kept far \ntoo high, in their judgment. They believe the market for sugar would \nproduce prices at just a fraction of what the sugar program currently \nprovides sugar producers. I fear the Washington Post just does not \nunderstand the sugar program or the market.\n  Most sugar in this world is traded contract to contract between \ncountries. Very little is traded in the open market. What is traded in \nthe open market is the surplus or the dumped sugar. This dumped sugar \nis traded at very low prices, but that does not reflect the cost of \nsugar that is traded between countries.\n  For a number of reasons, the sugar program is not working as well as \nit had in the past. For a long period of time the sugar program \nprovided both stable prices for consumers and also stable income, or \nstable support for\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\nsugar producers. Is this a worthwhile goal? I think it is.\n  We have seen times in this country when the sugar prices spiked up, \nup, way up, which was a terrible disadvantage to America's consumers. \nWe have seen circumstances as well where farm income has dipped way \ndown. That was devastating to producers. At least with respect to this \ncommodity, sugar, we developed a program that provides stability for \nboth consumers and producers. This makes sense to me.\n  The sugar program has not worked as well in recent months and years. \nThe reason, in my judgment, is because the current underlying farm \nprogram has not worked. As prices have collapsed for most other \ncommodities, and as we have pulled the rug out from under producers \nwith a farm program called Freedom to Farm, we have had more acreage \nput into sugar production in this country.\n  In addition to that, we have had molasses stuffed with sugar coming \nin from Canada, which is just another method of transporting sugar into \nthis country in excess of the amount agreed to by our trade agreements. \nWe have a significant threat from Mexico, despite what we thought was \nan agreement on sugar, so we have a whole series of threats to those \nwho produce sugar--cane and beet--in this country.\n  The Washington Post would make the case: Let's just get rid of the \nsugar program. Others will probably make the same case. It would be \ninteresting to ask the following question, and perhaps get an answer \nfrom the Washington Post and others who believe this. The question \nwould be: While sugar prices have fallen by a fourth since 1996, has \nanyone seen a reduction in the price of sugar at the grocery store? Let \nme repeat, prices to the producer have fallen by one-fourth; has anyone \nseen a reduction in the price of sugar at the store? What about candy \nbars, cereal, ice cream, cookies?\n  The answer is no. In fact, during that same period of time, while the \nprice of sugar to the producer has fallen by a fourth, those prices--\ncandy, cereal, ice cream, cookies, and cake--are up 7 to 10 percent.\n  The point is this. This program has worked and can work again if we \nhave a decent farm bill. But it will not work in the long term unless \nwe amend and change the Freedom to Farm legislation which is the \nunderlying problem with all farm commodity prices.\n  This is not the time, and we should not allow those who preach it to \ndecide the sugar program ought to be repealed. The sugar program has \nworked, and it is good for sugar producers and consumers in this \ncountry.\n  I wanted to make the case that those who editorialize about it, \nincluding this morning's editorial, in my judgment, are wrong. I \nrespect their opinion, but I think they are wrong. It is, once again, a \nquestion not just for those who produce sugar--in my part of the \ncountry, there are family farmers who raise sugar beets--it is a \nquestion of do we want to have family farmers in this country's future.\n  Some say family farmers are a little old diner that got left behind \nwhen the interstate came through. Yes, it is nostalgic, yesterday's \nnews, let's just get on with big corporate farms. I do not believe \nthat. I believe family farmers contribute to the value and culture of \nthis country in a significant way. If we decide there is no virtue \nbetween the crevices of mathematics and concentration--if we decide \nfamily farms do not matter--this country will have lost something \nsignificant, in my opinion.\n  One part of needed farm policy change, but an important part for \nthose who produce sugar beets in our country, is the retention of a \ndecent sugar program that provides some stability of income for \nproducers. I hope my colleagues will understand this in the coming \nweeks and months as we begin discussing the farm program and related \nissues such as the sugar program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4220-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4220-S4223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, what piqued my interest last Friday and \nthis morning was the announcement of the trade deficit. It is \ninteresting to me, the deafening silence that occurs in this Chamber \nand around this town especially regarding the monthly announcement of \nour trade deficit.\n  I prepared a chart that shows our growing and alarming bilateral \nmerchandise trade deficits. This is last year, 1999. As announced on \nFriday, our monthly merchandise trade deficit rose to $37 billion. We \nhave a surplus in our services trade balance, so if services are \nincluded the net effect is a $30 billion merchandise and services \ndeficit. In other words, we buy $1 billion a day more from other \ncountries than we sell to other countries--$1 billion a day.\n  What does that mean? It means that is the debt we have and the \nliability we incur.\n  Does it matter? We had people doing handstands and having apoplectic \nseizures on the floor of the Senate for years and years about the \nfiscal policy deficit. They would come and talk about the Federal \nbudget deficit, what a god-awful thing it was--and it was--$300 billion \na year and rising out of sight.\n  With respect to this merchandise and services deficit--$30 billion a \nmonth net, $37 billion with respect to merchandise or manufactured \ngoods, over $1 billion a day--one cannot find anybody who pays any \nattention to it or cares much about it. Why? Because the institutional \nthinkers in this country, once again on Friday, were genuflecting, as \nthey always do when this news comes out, about how the deficit is not \nsuch a bad deal. This trade deficit means America is growing faster \nthan other countries. If we are growing faster than other countries, \nthen naturally we will be buying more from abroad and perhaps selling \nless to them. We will therefore have this trade deficit.\n  These are the same economists, the same ``thinkers,'' who told us in \n1994: Why do we have a trade deficit? Because we have a fiscal policy \ndeficit. If we get rid of the budget deficit, we will get rid of the \ntrade deficit.\n  I can give names, but they are embarrassed when I read their quotes \nwith their names. They are the same economists who said we have a trade \ndeficit because we have a budget deficit. They said the trade deficit \nwill be gone once the budget deficit is gone. No, that is not the \nreason at all. We do not have a trade deficit because we are growing \nfaster than other countries. That is an absurd contention, just absurd.\n\n  We have a trade deficit with China because our country is growing \nfaster than China? No, China has an economy which is growing very \nrapidly. Our trade deficit with China, which is very close to $70 \nbillion a year, is because we are buying more from China than they are \nbuying from us. Is that because they do not need things? No, it is \nbecause they are buying from other countries instead of us.\n  Why do we allow that to happen? Because we are weak-kneed and do not \nhave a backbone. Our country has never had the backbone to say to other \ncountries: You must have a reciprocal trade relationship with us. If we \nare going to treat you in a certain way and we welcome you into our \nmarketplace, then we must be welcome in your marketplace. We have never \nhad the backbone to do that.\n  On Friday, the merchandise trade deficit with Japan increased from \n$6.7 billion to $6.8 billion. That means, with Japan, we have a \nmerchandise trade deficit approaching $80 billion. How many years do \nyou have to have $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion, $80 billion \ntrade deficits with the same country before someone will stand up and \nsay: There is something wrong here. They keep selling us all of their \ngoods, but they buy what they need from others.\n  I represent, for example, ranchers. I know I mentioned this before. I \nrepresent farmers and ranchers and others. Every pound of American beef \ngoing into Japan today has a 38.5-percent tariff on it. This is a \ncountry that has a nearly $80 billion trade surplus with us, or we have \na deficit with them. Send a T-bone steak from Dickinson, ND, to Tokyo, \nJapan, and there is going to be a 38.5-percent tariff on the T-bone \nsteak. What is that about? Does one think we would be considered a \nmassive failure in international trade as a country if we had 38.5-\npercent tariffs on products imported into our country? Of course we \nwould.\n  Yet we have a trade relationship with Japan that allows them to have \na 38.5-percent tariff on beef--this is after we reached an agreement \nwith them, by the way. We had a big trade agreement for beef producers \nabout 10 years ago.\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\nAt the end, one would have thought these folks just won the Olympics. \nThey celebrated and had a day of feasting and rejoicing because this \ncountry had this great trade agreement with Japan. Yes, we have gotten \nmore beef into Japan, but every pound of beef today that goes into \nJapan has a 38.5-percent tariff on it. That is outrageous.\n  I will go through a couple of other countries to close the loop.\n  Mexico. We have a trade agreement with Mexico called NAFTA, the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. I remember the two economists, Hufbauer \nand Schott. They said if we do this trade agreement with Mexico and \nCanada, this country will have 300,000 or so new jobs.\n  At the time, we had a trade surplus with Mexico. That trade surplus \nwith Mexico is now over a $20 billion trade deficit. Immediately after \nwe passed NAFTA, signed a new trade agreement with Mexico, and reduced \ntariffs on United States goods going into Mexico, Mexico devalued its \ncurrency and washed out any gains. In fact, the devaluation was much \nhigher in terms of its effect on the tariffs, so it more than washed \nout any gains. A trade surplus with Mexico was turned into a very large \ntrade deficit. The trade deficit with Mexico in March was $1.9 \nbillion--for just a month.\n  What about Canada? Canada had a modest trade surplus with us, or we \nhad a modest trade deficit with Canada, and then we passed NAFTA, the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement. The announcement Friday said the \ngoods deficit with Canada is now $3.9 billion, almost $4 billion. Our \nannual deficit with Canada is somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 \nbillion to $40 billion.\n  With respect to the European Union, Friday the announcement was that \nthe merchandise trade deficit with the European Union rose from $3.5 \nbillion in February to $5.7 billion in March, the most recent month for \nwhich data has been reported.\n  I will comment on our trade deficits with Japan and Mexico a little \nlater.\n  I taught economics briefly in college. I understand about economists. \nIt is much less a discipline than it is some psychology pumped up with \nhelium. It is just being able to say anything at any time about almost \nany subject.\n  This is what the economists say.\n  In today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Wiegand says:\n\n       This deficit will start to shrink as the Federal Reserve \n     continues to raise interest rates to slow the U.S. economy.\n\n  Oh, yes, that is probably a pretty good solution: Drive the economy \ninto the ditch. That will probably take care of it. I do not dispute \nthem. If Alan Greenspan continues to choke the neck of the American \neconomy and drives this economy into the ditch, yes, I suspect we will \nprobably be buying less from abroad. It is probably not very good \nmedicine to kill what ails us, in my judgment.\n  The person who wrote this article in today's Wall Street Journal did \nnot provide the name of the analyst. These are just anonymous analysts:\n\n       Analysts say they remain sanguine because the underlying \n     fundamentals that fuel the deficit remain unchanged. \n     America's economy is stronger than the economies of trading \n     partners, and that's why we have these trade deficits.\n\n  That is absurd, just absurd. Why do we have a big trade deficit with \nJapan? It is because we lack a backbone. For 15 years, we have allowed \nJapan to throw their goods into our marketplace and keep their \nmarketplace relatively closed to American goods. The same is true with \nChina. The same is true with many other countries.\n  This country needs to have the backbone to say to other countries: \nHere is a mirror. Look closely because what you see in that mirror is \nwhat you will get. You are welcome to come into our country with your \ngoods and services. Our consumers welcome them, and we welcome them. \nBut you should understand, the price for admission to the American \nmarketplace is that your markets be open to our producers, to the \nproducts of our workers and our production plants. If it is not, then \nyou are going to pay a price for that.\n  About 30 to 40 percent of Chinese exports are sent to the United \nStates. We are a ``cash cow'' for China's hard currency needs. There is \nno substitute on Earth for the American marketplace. China needs this \nmarketplace. The closing of this marketplace would lead China to \ncollapse immediately. Mr. President, 30 to 40 percent of their exports \nare to the U.S. economy.\n  So we say to China: That's all right. You keep shipping all your \nproducts here. Ship us your shirts and your shoes and your trousers and \nyour trinkets. You keep shipping all the merchandise you want to the \nUnited States, and that's fine if you want to prevent us from accessing \nyour marketplace.\n  We just negotiated a bilateral trade agreement with China. We had \nfolks up all night over in Beijing and here. They were working back and \nforth and trading and doing the things you do when you negotiate a \ntrade agreement. They finished a trade agreement. The vote we are going \nto have in the House this week, and subsequently, perhaps a week or two \nlater in the Senate, is not about this trade agreement. We do not get \nthe opportunity to vote on the bilateral trade agreement with China. \nThe vote is going to be: Do we accord China permanent normal trade \nrelations?\n  I have voted for normal trade relations in the past. The only \ndifference in this vote is: Shall it be permanent? But it is not a vote \non the bilateral trade agreement with China. Frankly, I do not know how \nI am going to vote on permanent NTR. At this point, I am leaning, \nperhaps, to vote in favor of it, but only if it includes a commission \nto monitor trade compliance--because China has made other agreements \nwith us and has not complied with them at all--and only if it provides \nsome responsible monitoring of human rights in China.\n\n  But having said all that, these votes are not about the bilateral \ntrade agreement. We do not need PNTR to do what we should do with \nChina. In Washington, DC, because there are so many interests here that \nare working on this PNTR issue, you can't turn on the television \nwithout seeing another ad by big interest groups that are saying: You \nmust vote for China PNTR.\n  Regrettably, they misstate it. They say: If we don't vote for PNTR, \nthe Chinese marketplace will not be open. That is absurd. It does not \nmake any sense at all.\n  The vote on China PNTR isn't about whether the Chinese marketplace is \nopen; it is a vote on whether normal trade relations with China will be \nmade permanent--just that; and only that. It is not even a vote on the \nbilateral trade agreement we reached with China last year.\n  Having said all that, as I said, I voted for normal trade relations \npreviously. I think China is going to be a significant influence in our \nlives, and I prefer it be a good influence rather than a bad one. I \nhappen to think that involvement is preferable to noninvolvement. But \nthat does not excuse the relationship that exists between China and the \nUnited States in which our trade negotiators come so far short of \nreaching an agreement that is in our interest. I will give you an \nexample.\n  China has 1.2 billion people. On the issue of automobiles in the \nrecently negotiated agreement with China, after a phase-in period, \nthere will remain in China a 25-percent tariff on any automobiles the \nU.S. would send to China. Any automobiles that China would send to the \nU.S. would have a 2.5-percent tariff. So China will retain a tariff \nthat is 10 times higher than the U.S. on vehicles moving back and \nforth. This is a country that has a nearly $70 billion surplus with us.\n  I ask the question: Why? Why would a negotiator sit across the table \nand agree to a proposition that China can have a tariff that is 10 \ntimes higher on automobiles than we can?\n  The answer? The answer is: It is so much better than it was. The old \ntariff on automobiles was so much higher. We brought it down so far.\n  I said: Why don't you sit down at the table, and hitch up your belt, \nand say, All right, let's begin negotiating reciprocal policies and the \nsame tariff. Why can't our negotiators do that?\n  Our trade negotiators would say: Oh, you can't do that because we are \nstarting from different points.\n  It is time we start from the same point. It is time we demand that \nour trade negotiators begin dealing with this trade deficit with \nrespect to what is really causing it.\n  These economists are wrong when they say the problem is that our \ncountry is growing too fast, other countries\n\n[[Page S4222]]\n\nare growing too slow, and therefore we have a big deficit. The reason \nwe have a big deficit is that when China wants to buy airplanes China \nsays: We are going to manufacture the airplanes in China. That is not \nthe way you do business. If they are going to sell us all their \ncommodities, then they have a responsibility to buy from us what we \nhave to sell. If they need airplanes, they ought to buy airplanes built \nin the United States of America. If they need wheat, they ought to buy \nwheat from the United States. In other words, trade relationships ought \nto be reciprocal. But our trade negotiators never require that.\n  Is this a criticism of the current administration? You bet--the past \nadministration, and every administration for the last 20 years. None of \nthem have had any backbone.\n  I stand here and talk about this because the trade deficit report \ncame out last Friday, and it said that the merchandise and services \ntrade deficit was $30 billion in a month. That is roughly $340 billion \na year more in manufactured goods that the United States bought than it \nsold.\n\n  I know I will have people listening to this who will say: That guy is \njust a protectionist. They are wrong. I am not a protectionist in the \ndefinition of the word used pejoratively. One who seeks protection is \nsomebody who wants to build a wall around the country and keep \neverybody out. That is not my view of it at all. We have a global \neconomy. We have an expanding reach of opportunities around the world.\n  But this country has to understand that times have changed. After the \nend of the Second World War, for the first 25 years, our trade policy \nwas almost universally foreign policy. We would engage with another \ncountry with one hand tied behind our back, and say: Do you want some \nhelp? Here is a trade policy that is concessional to you because you're \nstruggling, you're flat on your back, your economy is devastated \nbecause of the Second World War. We want to help you get back on your \nfeet. Therefore, our trade policy was largely foreign policy. That was \nfine because we could beat anybody with one hand tied behind our back.\n  But the second 25 years post-Second World War have been different. We \nhave shrewd, tough, economic competitors. We have still tied the hands \nof America's producers and America's workers, and have provided \nconcessional terms in trade negotiations to virtually every other \ncountry.\n  That is the only basis that you could excuse a recurring trade \ndeficit with Japan that is $50 and $60 and, now, $70 billion a year--\nyear after year after year after year. The only thing you can call that \nis neglect--yes, by Republican administrations and Democratic \nadministrations. That is neglect.\n  People who hear this will say: That guy just doesn't understand that \nyou can't see over the horizon. He does not understand all this. The \nproblem is, I think I do understand it.\n  In the budget deficit debates, we used to have people come to the \nfloor and say: Think of it in terms of your own family. If you're \nrunning up a deficit, you have to pay it sometime, don't you?\n  Think of the trade deficit in terms of your own family unit. If the \ncountry is your family, and you are buying much more than you are \nselling and, therefore, incurring a deficit that continues to grow, is \nthat a problem? Will it at some point come back and bite you? Will that \nbe a problem for this country? Will it inhibit America's economic \ngrowth? Will the fact that the current accounts' deficit--measured by \nrecurring trade deficits--allows foreigners to hold American dollars \nwith which they can make decisions about whether to invest in this \ncountry, and how to invest in this country, be a problem for this \ncountry?\n  I think it is. My only point is that last Friday should not pass \nwithout notice--a Friday in which we say the merchandise and services \ntrade deficit is now $30 billion this month alone. That news occurs at \nthe same time the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board says our \ncountry is growing too rapidly and we need to slow it down with another \none-half of 1 percent interest rate increase.\n  Well, I am telling you, I think the combination of those two pieces \nof economic news ought to be very sobering to all Americans. Yet, as I \nsaid when I started, there is this deafening silence in the Chamber. \nAlmost nobody will come and talk about the trade deficit because they \nwill be branded by especially the corporate world as people who don't \nunderstand, who want to build a wall around this country, people who \nare protectionists. Yes, I want to protect America's economic \ninterests. Of course, I do. I am an American and, of course, I want to \ndo that.\n  But I believe the protection of our interests involves understanding \nthat the economy has changed. This is a global economy but we must have \nfair trade rules. If we decide as a country that nothing matters that \nwe fought about for the last 100 years, and that the globalization of \nour economy somehow should pole-vault over all of those issues, then we \nwill, in my judgment, have lost substantial ground. We had people die \nin the streets in this country. They were shot and clubbed to death \nbecause they fought for the basic principle of workers being able to \norganize. People died for that right in this country.\n  Some companies will say: I know was a problem in America because you \nhave all these collective bargaining issues. The way to get rid of that \nissue is we will take our manufacturing plant and close it. We will \nmove to a country where workers can't organize, and we will not have \nthose problems. People in this country fought so long for a minimum \nwage and a livable wage. A company might say: We can solve that issue. \nWe don't have to deal with minimum wages. We will move this plant from \nthe United States to Bangladesh, and we won't have to pay minimum \nwages. People fought a long time over the issue of child labor. They \nmay say: Well, we can solve that. We will move our plant overseas and \nwe will put 12-year-olds in the plant and we will pay them 12 cents an \nhour. We will work them 14 hours a day, and we won't have to meet plant \nsafety standards. That is an easy way to pole-vault over those issues.\n  How about dumping chemicals into the streams or into the air? A \ncompany can say: We can solve those issues. You know that plant where \nwe are going to hire kids to work, and pay them 12 cents an hour, and \nwork them 14 hours a day, and not worry about safety? We can also dump \nthe raw chemicals into the water and into the air.\n  Well, that raises the question, I am afraid: Should there be an \nadmission price to the American marketplace? Should the admission price \nbe at least that there are fair rules of trade? I have asked folks, and \none honestly said to me he thought it was fine. If the marketplace \ndecided that you can amass the capital and employ kids in unsafe \nconditions and pay them pennies, if you can produce a product the \nconsumer wants, it is fine for that product to be in our marketplace. I \nrespectfully disagree with that perspective. Globalization requires the \nattendance of rules, in my judgment, that relate to the kinds of issues \nwe fought over for 100 years in this country.\n  Others would say, well, you are trying to export American values. \nThere you have it. That is exactly what is necessary in the global \neconomy--exporting the values of saying that fair competition is not \ncompetition with 12-year-old kids being paid 12 cents an hour. Fair \ncompetition is not competition between a plant in Pittsburgh that has \nto meet air pollution standards and water pollution standards, \ncompeting with a plant owned by the same company somewhere that can \ndump all of their chemicals into the streams and into the air.\n  Those are our range of issues with which we have to deal. All of \nthose issues, incidentally, relate to a very significant and unhealthy \ngrowth in this country's trade deficit.\n\n  Let me come back for a moment to the vote that will be very \ncontroversial on China's permanent normal trade relations. Last week--\nand I know I digress here--I was thinking of coming to the floor and \nsubmitting in a bill that says the Federal Reserve Board cannot go into \na room and lock the door in something called the ``Open Market \nCommittee'' and continue to call it open. I was thinking of putting in \na bill that requires them to call this a ``closed market committee.'' \nIf they are going to lock the American people out, they should not call \nit an open committee. Just as I was thinking of\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\ndoing that--and I decided against it for the moment--we ought not to \ncall it normal trade relations with China, or Japan, or, for that \nmatter, Europe; we ought not to call normal trade relations a \ncircumstance that give us a $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion, or \n$80 billion trade deficit. There is nothing normal about our trade \nrelations with Japan. There is nothing normal about having a $50 \nbillion, $60 billion, or $70 billion trade deficit every single year. \nThat is abnormal. Now, I could not get the votes, perhaps, to rename \nthat ``abnormal trade relations,'' but it is not normal, and we ought \nnot to consider it normal to have this sort of circumstance exist.\n  In the last decade, it has gotten worse, not better. The mantra of \nso-called ``thinkers'' who are quoted--incidentally, they are the same \npeople because when reporters write the stories, they call the same \npeople, ``thinkers''. These same people have put the same quotes in the \nstories every month for 10 years. Even though the times have changed \nand the thinkers were demonstrated to not be accurate, they just change \ntheir story. That is why the story has changed now from their original \nsaying that when we had a budget deficit you are therefore going to \nhave a trade deficit. They say now that wasn't it; now it is because we \nare growing too fast. There must be some familial relationship here \nwith the Chairman of the Fed because he also thinks we are growing too \nfast. It must be the same group of thinkers. There must be a genetic \ncode that exists between these folks.\n  Again, I digress. I came to the floor to simply say I don't want \nFriday's notice of this dramatic increase in the trade deficit to not \nbe discussed at least at some length in the Senate. It is important \nthat we discuss it and begin to provide remedies for it.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are a lot of issues in the Senate \nwith which we ought to be dealing. Most of the important issues we are \navoiding. Now, there exists in this Congress something called a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. It is in conference and we can't get it back. \nWhy? Because big money interests have decided they want to block it; \nthey don't want a Patients' Bill of Rights. We ought to have that on \nthe floor of the Senate and the House, out of this conference, and we \nshould pass a decent Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We ought to be able to employ the opportunities to offer amendments \non the Elementary and Secondary Education Act when it is here and \nstrengthen this country's education system. But are we able to do that? \nNo.\n  We also have a juvenile justice bill that is trying to close a \nloophole in gun shows. When you buy a gun, you have to run your name \nthrough an instant check to see whether you are a felon. If you are a \nfelon, you don't have the right to own a gun. It would close the gun \nshow loophole. Now you can go to a gun show and buy a gun and you don't \nhave to run your name against anything. A felon can buy a gun, \nregrettably. That is not anti-gun; it is a moderate, thoughtful step to \nextend the instant check. That is in the juvenile justice bill. That is \nnot on the floor of the Senate.\n  This Senate has been at parade rest for some long while. It is time \nto take action on the things the American people want us to act on. We \nought to deal with a Patients' Bill of Rights, and we ought to bring to \nthe floor of the Senate the legislation that deals with the gun show \nloophole in the juvenile justice bill. We ought to have an opportunity \nto debate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act without somebody \nhovering and saying: Before you do that, I have to approve the \namendments you offer. There are no gatekeepers here. The rules of the \nSenate don't provide for gatekeepers.\n\n  In the coming months, we have the opportunity to address health care, \neducation, juvenile justice, and things that matter in this country. \nThe only reason they are not on the floor of the Senate with extended \ndebate, or out of conference which exists now, is because the \nleadership doesn't want them on the floor of the Senate. I must say \nthat in the coming weeks and months we intend to do everything we can \npossibly do within the rules of this Senate to make sure those are the \nissues we debate in the Senate this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning I listened to my friend, the \nSenator from North Dakota, talk about what we ought to be doing in the \nSenate. I must tell you I couldn't agree more that we need to be moving \nforward. I also must tell you I have a totally different view as to why \nwe are not.\n  We have actually been seeking to move forward for some time. The \nRepublicans have had a number of critical issues out here that the \nAmerican people are interested in--marriage tax penalty relief, tax \nrelief in other areas, farming, education, and critical needs of the \nmen and women in the armed services. But, unfortunately, as each of \nthese things has come up, we found ourselves being stopped from moving \nforward either by unrelated amendments or objections to moving forward. \nI really think we should analyze where we are and what we are seeking \nto do.\n  In my view, in general terms, what is happening is that there is more \nof an interest, particularly on that side of the aisle, in simply \ntrying to create issues rather than create solutions. Each time we \nbring up a basic bill, we come back to amendments that have already \nbeen dealt with, and they insist on dealing with them again.\n  The majority leader is trying to deal with a number of issues. One of \nthem, of course, is education. We are dealing with the whole question \nof elementary and secondary education. We are blocked by that side of \nthe aisle from meaningful educational reform. We are trying to deal \nwith the idea of moving forward with the kind of funding the Federal \nGovernment can provide for elementary and secondary education.\n  There is a difference of view. Yes, indeed, we have a difference of \nview. The basic difference of view is to the extent the Federal \nGovernment is involved in the funding of local schools. Those local \nschools, their leaders, the school boards, and the counties and States \nought to have the basic right to make the decisions as to how that \nmoney is used. I think it is pretty clear that the needs are quite \ndifferent.\n  Yesterday, I spoke at the commencement of a small school in \nChugwater, WY. The sign on Main Street said ``Population 197.'' There \nwere 12 graduates at this school. They come from, of course, the \nsurrounding agricultural area. I can tell you that the educatioonal \nneeds in Chugwater, WY, are likely to be quite different from those in \nPittsburgh. The notion that in Washington you set down the rules for \nexpending the funds that are made available in Federal programs we do \nnot think is useful. I understand there are differences of view.\n  But I guess my entire point is that we are always going to have \ndifferent points of view and we should have an opportunity to discuss \nthose and opportunities to offer alternatives. But we have to find \nsolutions, and we have to move forward. That is why we vote. That is \nwhy there is a majority that has a vote on issues. But the idea that \nyou have a difference of view and, because you don't get your view in, \nit is going to stop the process is not what we are talking about.\n  Education, of course, is just one of the areas. There is the question \nof the marriage tax penalty and the question of tax relief and tax \nreform. But, quite frankly, more than anything, there is the question \nof fairness--where a man and woman can work at two jobs before\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\nthey are married, earn a certain amount of money, and continue to work \non those jobs and earn the same amount of money, but after they are \nmarried they pay more taxes. The penalty is approximately $1,500 a \nyear. We have been fighting to change this for a very long time. \nPresident Clinton pledged in his State of the Union Address in January \nto reduce those taxes. It would be a very large tax reduction for \nAmerican families. However, we still have the playing of politics on \nthe floor and that bill has not yet passed.\n\n  We will be seeking to do some things in agriculture. I agree with the \nSenator from North Dakota on some of the agricultural issues. We have \nbeen trying to deal with crop insurance. We have been trying to get \nthat done. It is certainly something that ought to be done as we move \nforward towards more of the marketplace in agriculture. It has not been \ndone because we have had objections on the floor.\n  I have to tell you we have had, and continue to have, a record of \nobstructionism that I think really needs to be reviewed and resolved. \nIt took five votes before we could break the Democrat filibuster and \npass the Ed-Flexibility bill in 1999.\n  Do you remember when the Republicans offered the lockbox idea where \nwe were seeking to ensure that money which comes in for Social Security \nwould be in the Social Security fund and not be expended on non-Social \nSecurity ideas? It was opposed six times by Senator Democrats, even \nafter it had been passed in the House the year before by a vote of 416 \n12. In Roll Call, which is the House paper, in May of 2000, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts promised to eventually work with his colleagues on \nthe education plan. But then he was quoted as saying: We will do that \nwhen Al Gore is elected President. We will all sit down next year and \nhave a consensus.\n  I don't think we are here to seek to establish those kinds of issues \nfor Presidential elections and ignore what we can do here. We are sent \nhere to resolve problems, to deal with them, and come to solutions. \nThey have been out there on the floor. But, unfortunately, the whole \nidea of obstructionist tactics seems to be where we are, and we need to \nchange that.\n  There are a number of issues, of course, that are of particular \nconcern to people from the West, including myself. We have had a great \ndeal of activity in the administration with regard to public land \nmanagement. All of it seems to be oriented towards the effort on the \npart of this administration, on the part of the President, and on the \npart of the Secretary of the Interior to develop for themselves some \nkind of a legacy--a little like Theodore Roosevelt, apparently.\n  There are a number of things that have to do with access to public \nlands. Here again, it is quite different, depending on where you live \nin this country. In Wyoming, for example, 50 percent of the land is \nowned by the Federal Government and is managed by the BLM or by the \nForest Service or by the Park Service, and it is a good operation. In \nsome States federally-owned land is as high as 86 percent.\n  It is quite different when we start to deal with the public land \nissue, of course. It is sometimes dealt with quite differently in the \nWest than the East. That is proper. We have been faced with a number of \nthings that make it very difficult to have access available for the \npeople who own these public lands. We are dealing, for instance, with \nthe operation of the Forest Service and 40 million acres of road lands. \nI have no particular objection to taking the road lands. We don't need \nroads everywhere, but we need to do it on an area-by-area basis to see \nwhat needs access. Sometimes the accusations suggest we help timber \nproducers or grazers.\n\n  The fact is, we have heard from veterans who can't walk 17 miles with \na pack on their back. If we don't have road access, they are not able \nto use the forests. We have heard from children, as well.\n  The administration puts out a block pronouncement that we will have \n40 million acres of wilderness, without knowing what the plans are, \nwithout including Congress in the process, without holding hearings or \nproviding an opportunity for people to respond. There was nothing there \nto respond to. Hopefully, that will be changed.\n  The Antiquities Act provides an opportunity for the President to \ndeclare large amounts of land for different uses and restricts uses \nexercised readily by this administration over the past year and a half. \nThe BLM has a plan not to allow off-road use of BLM lands. We have \nbills before the Congress setting aside a billion dollars a year for \nthe additional purchase of Federal lands on a mandatory basis as \nopposed to going through the appropriations. These are all designed, it \nseems to some, to reduce access to lands which are not only there for \nrecreation, not only there for the use of everyone, but certainly there \nis a large impact on the economic future of States in the west.\n  We plan to have a hearing this week after a pronouncement from the \nPark Service that all parks will no longer allow the use of snow \nmachines by winter visitors. Yellowstone Park and Grand Teton Park are \nin Wyoming. Many people in the winter enjoy these unique scenes on \nsnowmobiles. The Park Service, without hearings, without input by the \nCongress or by anyone else, has announced there will be a total \ncancellation of the opportunity of people to visit their parks in the \nwintertime.\n  Again, I have no objection to taking a look and changing some rules. \nSome of the machines have been too noisy, some machines have excessive \nexhaust. But they can be changed. Rather than finding an alternative \nfor people visiting the parks, which belong to them, this \nadministration simply says we are not going to allow their use anymore \nand ignores alternative techniques. Also, it ignores the fact it has \nbeen going on for 20 years in most parks.\n  We could separate cross-country skiers from snow machine operators \nand require through EPA that the machines be quieter and less \npolluting. Instead of seeking to manage them, we have been ignoring \nthis for 20 years, and suddenly they abolish their use. I hope we have \na hearing this week to take a look at how that might be resolved so \npeople will still have the opportunity to visit facilities that belong \nto them, facilities that are unique, facilities that should be \navailable to be used by whomever wishes to use them properly, \nhopefully, year round.\n  My friend from North Dakota mentioned the sugar program, one that \nneeds to be examined and discussed. We have had large newspapers, \nincluding editorials, that have not told the story fairly. They talk \nabout a program that has caused consumers to pay more for sugar than \nthey would otherwise. I don't believe that is factual. The fact is the \nworld price for sugar is not a world price established by the market \nbut is a dump price from countries that have subsidies for sugar. When \nthey have an excess, it goes in at a lower price. If we are going to \ntalk about the program, we ought to be discussing facts. That \ninformation ought to be mentioned.\n\n  The sugar program has not been subsidized. The costs to consumers \nhave not gone up but have gone down. The costs to producers have not \ngone up but, indeed, have gone down. We have a program that has worked.\n  My point is it is necessary to understand the purpose of the program, \nwhat it is designed to accomplish, and then do what is necessary in the \ninterim to ensure that purpose is nurtured.\n  I think there are many issues we must cover. We have 13 \nappropriations bills with which to deal. We have approximately 60 \nlegislative days remaining for the Senate to complete its work. We have \n13 bills with which to deal. The appropriations, of course, are very \nmuch the basis for what we do in the Federal Government. There are all \nkinds of issues. But the amount of money provided and the way it is \nspent has a great deal to do with what we are doing in the Congress, \nwhat kinds of programs we are involved in, how much the programs cost, \nhow much we want to invest in the programs. Right now, it has a great \ndeal to do with what we do with overall revenues that come into the \nFederal Government.\n  Indeed, as it appears, we have a surplus. We have to make some tough \ndecisions as to how much government we want. How do we divide the \ngovernment between the responsibilities accepted and taken on at the \nFederal level as opposed to those taken on at the local level. The fact \nthat there is money certainly is an encouragement to again expand the \nrole of the Federal Government. Many believe that is not\n\n[[Page S4225]]\n\nthe proper way to proceed; We ought to do the essential things.\n  Clearly, there is a difference of view about that. There is a \ndifference of philosophy. There are those who genuinely believe the \nmore money that can be spent through the Federal Government, the more \nit helps people, and that is what we ought to do--continue to always \nincrease the size and activity of the Government.\n  Others, including myself, believe there are essential finances for \nthe Federal Government to carry forth, but the best way to do it is to \nlimit that Federal Government to allow local governments to participate \nmore fully, to allow people to continue to have their own tax dollars.\n  The longer I am in Washington, the more I am persuaded the real \nstrength of this country does not lie with the Federal Government. \nObviously, it is essential. Obviously, it is important. Functions such \nas defense can only be performed by the Federal Government.\n  Communities are shaped by things people do through local government \nor voluntarily. These mean so much to the strength of communities. We \nhave a program called the Congressional Award Program in which young \npeople are urged to take on community activities. We give out medals. \nIt is wonderful to see the activities in which the young people become \ninvolved. It is wonderful to see themselves in the future as doing \nvolunteer things, as becoming leaders, taking the risk of leadership, \nand spending their personal time to strengthen that community.\n  We do have real differences of opinion. That is why we are here. We \nhave a system for resolving those differences. Not everybody wins these \ndebates. Some lose and some win. It is not a winning proposition to \nobstruct progress. I think that is where we find ourselves.\n  I hope the leaders and Members on both sides of the aisle will take a \nlong look at our position. We need to have a system where everyone with \ndifferent ideas gets to present their ideas, but we have to do it in an \norganized way, where the amendments are germane to the issue. Now we \nfind ourselves with some amendments--gun control amendments, for \nexample, as important as they may be--that come up on every issue. It \nstalls what we are doing in terms of the basic generic purpose of that \ndiscussion, invariably coming up with the same kinds of amendments over \nand over. I think we can find a way to resolve that. I think we should. \nWe have a great opportunity to move forward on a number of things, \nwhether it be education, whether it be Social Security, whether it be \ntax relief, whether it be strengthening the military. These are the \nkinds of things that are so important.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4225-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4225-S4229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CLOTURE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I was sitting in my office watching the \nfloor on C-SPAN and I heard my colleague from Wyoming speak out about \nsome of his concerns as they relate to conduct of priority business on \nthe floor of the Senate. I am pleased he would come this early \nafternoon to discuss what I think is really a very important and \nnecessary issue for all of us to understand but, more importantly, for \nthe public that pays close attention to what we do to understand.\n  During debate last week, after the vote concerning the Byrd-Warner \namendment on the President's open-ended mission in Kosovo, several \nthings were said by the minority leader that I feel need to be \ncorrected. If you were to take the minority leader at face value last \nweek, I think you would have gotten a distorted view of what we did in \nthe Senate and what was an appropriate and necessary approach.\n  The day before the vote on the Byrd-Warner amendment, the Senate \npassed a rule that said only germane amendments could be offered to \nappropriations bills. ``Germane'' is a technical term for relevant. The \nfollowing day, the minority leader stated before us:\n\n       No majority leader has ever come to the floor to say that, \n     before we take up a bill, we have to limit the entire Senate \n     to relevant amendments.\n\n  Those are the minority leader's words, straight out of the \nCongressional Record. When I heard that, I was surprised, and I began \nto think about past Senates, past Congresses. I began to do some \nresearch. I must tell you I was surprised that the minority leader \nwould, in fact, make that statement. The minority leader also said that \nhe would defy anybody to come to the floor and challenge the statement. \nI am here today, I did my research over the weekend, and I challenge \nthe statement of the minority leader. I think it is time the American \npeople understand exactly what he meant and why he meant it.\n\n  We have important and critical legislation that needs to be passed in \na timely manner to deal with all that is important for the millions and \nmillions of Americans whose lives are impacted by what we do here.\n  In the appropriations bills there is money for education, health \nservices, agriculture, for the environment, for national defense, and \nfor other essential Government services on which so many people rely. I \nwant to take a few minutes to explain what the majority leader said \nlast week and, more importantly, I want to spend more time saying why \nwhat the minority leader said last week was wrong.\n  The majority leader was clearly trying to expedite the activities of \nthe Senate when he asked those of us on each side of the aisle, \nDemocrat and Republican, to agree to unanimous consent requests that \nwould cause the Senate to move along in a timely fashion. When the \nminority leader came to the floor and suggested that irrelevant \namendments should be debated in full and this was an inappropriate \nthing and had never been done before, then what he was saying simply \nwas not an accurate statement.\n  The rules of the Senate are very easy to understand and fairly \nstraightforward. For instance, a cloture vote, as far as its dictionary \ndefinition, is a petition to limit debate. The petition must be signed \nby 16 Senators. It is then voted on by the entire Senate, and it takes \n60 votes to invoke cloture; in other words, to move on. Cloture is a \nformal way of ending a filibuster, or ending intentional debate that \nprolongs the proceedings of the Senate. A filibuster, of course, is a \ntime-delaying tactic, a strategy used to extend debate, as I just \nmentioned, and ultimately to prevent a vote from being taken by \nSenators.\n  By the way, the term ``filibuster'' comes from the early 19th century \nSpanish or Portuguese pirates' term ``filibusteros,'' meaning those who \nheld ships hostage for ransom. Therefore, in order to stop a \nfilibuster, a tactic used to hold the Senate hostage, a cloture motion \nmust be filed. It is the formal beginning of the process to end a \nfilibuster.\n  Let me go back to what the minority leader said last week. He said \nthat ``No majority leader has ever come to the floor to say that''--\nmeaning we ought to limit debate and move to the relevant issues of the \nday. He said that--``before we take up a bill, we will have to limit \nthe entire Senate to relevant amendments.'' In other words, shaping the \ndebate, moving it along in a timely fashion.\n  That statement caused me to take a short walk down memory lane. Let \nme take us all back to the 103d Congress. The Senate was controlled by \nDemocrats, not Republicans, under the watchful eye of the majority \nleader, George Mitchell. During the same Congress, almost 300 \nlegislative measures were enacted into law. Of those 300 measures, \nSenator Mitchell considered 15 of them to be the object of a \nfilibuster. In other words, Senator Mitchell feared that there would be \na filibuster on a particular piece of legislation. Senator Mitchell's \nresponse to this imaginary threat was to file 43 cloture motions on \nthese 15 measures.\n  Let me repeat: Senator Mitchell filed 43 cloture motions on 15 \nlegislative measures he thought might be filibustered. Of these 43 \ncloture motions, 21 of them--almost half--were filed on the same day \nthe Senate actually began debating a bill. In his attempt to break a \nfilibuster, he filed cloture on bills 21 times before debate had even \nbegun.\n  If there was any intent to intentionally limit debate--and once you \nhave a cloture motion in place, and once you have proceeded to the bill \npostcloture, then only relevant amendments should apply--then, of \ncourse, George Mitchell was doing exactly what he intended to do as \nmajority leader, Democrat majority leader of the Senate: Limit debate, \nshape debate to the particular bill involved.\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\n  Did Senator Mitchell say before a bill was even offered that the \nSenate would be limited to relevant amendments? He did not have to say \nit. His actions said it, and they were very clear, loud actions. He did \n21 filings of cloture the same day the Senate actually debated a bill. \nHe took a procedural step that would make the threat a reality. In \nother words, he did not come to the floor to suggest he might have to \ndo something to limit debate to relevant amendments; he just did it. \nAnd that is the prerogative of a majority leader.\n  Clearly, Senator Mitchell went much further than the rule we passed \nlast week. As the minority leader well knows, Senator Mitchell \nperfected the art of confrontational legislating. Not only would \nSenator Mitchell not allow nonrelevant amendments, he filed cloture on \nbills 43 times in the 103d Congress.\n  That is the record. That is setting the record straight. I say to \nMinority Leader Daschle, I took up your challenge. I did my research. I \nbelieve those are the facts. But Senator Mitchell's tactics of the past \npale in comparison to the strategy of the minority leader in the Senate \ntoday. Again last week, the minority leader said on the floor in \nreference to an appropriations bill that:\n\n       Constitutionally, appropriations bills must begin in the \n     House of Representatives. We are, in a sense, circumventing \n     the rules of the Congress by allowing these bills to be \n     debated and considered prior to the time the bill comes \n     before the Senate.\n\n  I did some simple research, such as picking up a copy of the U.S. \nConstitution and turning to article I, section 7, clause 1, and reading \nit, just reading it:\n\n       All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with \n     Amendments as on other Bills.\n\n  Let me also turn to another provision, ``Riddick's Senate Procedure, \nPrecedents and Practices.'' This is, of course, one of the procedural \nbooklets we follow:\n\n       Bills originate in the House:\n       In 1935, the Chair ruled that there is no Constitutional \n     limitation upon the Senate to initiate an appropriation bill.\n\n  Obviously, the intent of what I am suggesting is that we can initiate \nappropriations bills, and we have, and we have held them at the desk. \nAs the House sends its appropriations bills across, we attach a House \nnumber or we move through that process in a way that accommodates.\n  Why would the minority leader propose such an idea? I think it is \nreally quite clear. It is to obstruct the action and the movement of \nthe Senate.\n  Maybe there is another reason. Maybe there is a reason that is \nsubliminal, that is not so clear. Maybe the reason was talked about \nthis morning in the Washington Times: ``CBO now predicts a $40 billion \nsurplus''--even a greater surplus of monies than the kind that was \npredicted earlier that the Budget Committee analyzed when it proposed \nits budget resolution.\n  Maybe it is why he wants to drag the feet of the Senate through June, \nJuly, August, and into September, so at the very end, a lame duck \nPresident, with his veto, can hold a Senate hostage and gain the \nspending of billions more dollars than were proposed in this present \nbudget when he proposed total discretionary appropriations of about \n$223 billion where our budget discretionary spending is around $600 \nbillion. Maybe he really wants to make good on not giving American \ncitizens some tax relief by returning some of these surplus dollars to \nthem. Maybe he really wants to make good on the idea that expanding \nGovernment and spending more money is really the mantra, the very \nfoundation and the basics of the Democratic Party that he represents.\n\n  I am not sure, but what I am sure of is that what the minority leader \nsaid on the floor of the Senate last week does not ring true to past \nSenate actions practiced by Democrat and Republican majorities.\n  We operate on the rules of the Senate. We operate on past precedent. \nWe also operate on a consistency that assures a motion of activity here \nthat produces 13 appropriations bills in a timely fashion to fund our \nGovernment in a way that I think our American citizens and taxpayers \nexpect us to perform.\n  What the minority leader said last week was we would not perform; he \nwas going to draw a line and stop us, and he drew that line in the \nsand. He said, for example: We do not need to deal with the same bill \ntwice; let's wait until the House gets its bill here. Yet he was saying \nthat in the backdrop of a gun debate that had been dealt with numerous \ntimes on the floor of the Senate over the last year; in fact, a debate \nin which his side had won and passed legislation that moved to the \nHouse, and the House rejected it.\n  I am not quite sure I understand even that argument because it not \nonly is inconsistent with the very actions that were taking place at \nthe time, and that was, we were redebating for the fourth or fifth time \nan idea or a piece of legislation in which the Senate itself had been \ninvolved throughout the 106th Congress.\n  The reason I have come to the floor this early afternoon is to set \nthe record straight. I think it is important for the Senate and for the \nUnited States as a whole to understand how we operate and that what we \nwere doing and what we were proposing were clearly consistent within \nthe rules. No rules had been bent. There was not a rules committee of a \nsingle individual but the action of a Congress and a Senate operating \nunder unanimous consent and doing so in an appropriate and responsible \nway.\n  If there was a bad precedent set last week, it was not bad in the \nsense that it was one majority leader simply following the actions of \nanother majority leader some sessions ago, recognizing the timely need \nto move legislation along and to be able to do so by limiting certain \ntypes of amendments that were irrelevant to the fundamental debate and \nthe consideration of a given appropriations bill.\n  I hope this clears the air. I hope what we experienced last week was \nbut a thunderstorm, and now the clouds have cleared and the air is a \nbit fresher. I hope we can move on in a timely fashion, as we must, \nbecause if that does not happen, I and others will be coming to the \nfloor on a very regular basis and I will not mind pointing a finger at \nthose who object and those who obstruct.\n  We have a responsibility to cause our Senate to operate in an \nappropriate fashion, and certainly debate on one and all issues is \nimportant and can happen, but I do believe the citizens of this country \nexpect us to get our work done; they expect us to balance our budget; \nthey expect us to be fiscally responsible; and, most importantly, they \nexpect and anticipate a limited Government that does the right things \nfor its citizenry. That is what we are intent upon accomplishing. I \nhope we can move forward, and I hope we can do so in a timely fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I, like other Members of the body, read \nthis morning's paper and read the comments of the Democratic leader. I \nhave heard the comments on the floor of some of our colleagues, \nincluding the current occupant of the chair, and the Senator from \nIdaho. Since it is somewhat of a slow day, I decided to add my voice to \nthe voices that have been raised here, perhaps from a slightly \ndifferent perspective.\n  I know, in Senate terms, I am a relative newcomer. I am only in my \nsecond term. And around here, that counts for little more than being in \nyour first term, but it does not put you in the rank of Senate \nhistorians or the old Senate ``bulls,'' as they used to be called.\n  Nonetheless, if I might, I would like to go back and quote a little \npersonal history because my first exposure to the Senate, up close and \npersonal, came in the early 1950s.\n  If I may reminisce with you, I remember sitting in the family \ngallery, night after night, when the Senate would be debating, \nlistening to the oratory that went on and the clashes of opinion that \nwould occur, and falling in love with the place. I was a teenager.\n  My father had been elected in the election of 1950. I was here in the \nsummer of 1953. Dwight Eisenhower was the President--the first time a \nRepublican President had been in office since 1932. The Democrats were \napoplectic about the idea that there was a Republican President, and \ncarrying on with great frustration.\n  I remember the towering debates--and they were debates. They were not\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\nspeeches given to empty Chambers. They were debates between the two \nprotagonists on the Finance Committee.\n  Paul Douglas, the Senator from Illinois, would come down here and \nthunder against the terrors of the Eisenhower administration. I would \nlisten, in the family gallery, as a Republican, and wonder if anybody \ncould respond. Then Eugene Millikin would enter the Chamber, bad back \nand all. He sat there in that seat in front of me. It was very \ndifficult for him to move because of his back. So when he would turn, \nhe would turn his entire body, and it would be slow. I remember, \nclearly, Senator Douglas recognizing what had happened when Senator \nMillikin had come on the floor. Senator Millikin was the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Senator Douglas said: The Republicans have brought up their heavy \nartillery in bringing in Senator Millikin. He said: In fact, I would \neven say they have brought their nuclear cannon.\n  I sat in the family gallery and listened to this, and thought: What \nis going to happen now?\n  Senator Millikin, with a few well-placed barbs, proceeded to destroy \nSenator Douglas' argument. And Senator Douglas got mad. He started \ncomplaining about the fact that the Senator from Colorado--because that \nis where Millikin was from--had as much authority in this body as he \ndid, the Senator from Illinois. He pointed out how many people there \nwere in Illinois and how few people there were in Colorado, and he got \nvery indignant about it.\n  I remember Millikin's response. He said: Mr. President, the Senator \nfrom Illinois is no longer opposed to the bill before us, he is now \nopposed to the Constitution. I must say, I am not surprised.\n  With that, he turned on his heels and walked out, leaving Senator \nDouglas sputtering a bit.\n  So I go back that far with my experiences with the Senate. I served \nin the Nixon administration as a lobbyist for one of the Departments. \nWe did not call it that because under the law you are not allowed to \nlobby as a member of the executive branch; you conduct congressional \nliaison.\n  Again, because my father was still a Member of the Senate, I had \naccess to the family gallery. When my Department had a bill before the \nSenate, I would come and sit in the family gallery and watch the debate \nas the bills would pass--or not pass--and I remember very clearly the \npattern of debate in those days. This is now in the late 1960s because \nI served in the Nixon administration, and President Nixon took office \nin 1969.\n  Votes would be scheduled in advance, with a specific time. The time \nthat sticks in my memory is that 11 o'clock was a fairly normal time \nfor votes. We would get into the gallery around 10, because the debate \nwould be winding up in anticipation of the 11 o'clock vote.\n  Senators would start coming into the Chamber by 10:15. I would say, \nthere would be 30 Senators in the Chamber listening to the final \ndebate.\n  By 10:30, the Chamber would be almost full, because at 10:30, Everett \nDirksen, as the Republican leader, would stand up to give the \nRepublican position, the final speaker prior to the vote. Everyone \nwanted to hear Everett Dirksen. He would go on for 15 minutes, until a \nquarter to 11. By this time, the Chamber would be completely filled--\nevery Senator in his or her seat.\n  Then Mike Mansfield would stand up, with the tremendous respect and \ndignity that he had. If I may say so, without diminishing that respect, \nMike Mansfield, as an orator, was no match for Everett Dirksen. He was \nnot as fun to listen to, but he had an earnestness and a determination \nabout him that made him a towering giant of this body.\n  Then at 11 o'clock, when Mike Mansfield would be through, whoever was \npresiding would bang the gavel, and the Senate would proceed to vote, \nwith every Senator sitting at his desk.\n  I remember watching my father, who sat on the front row to the right, \ngo up to the table and get a copy of the names of all of the Senators, \nand keep track of how they were voting himself. He would mark it off, \nas did all of the other Senators, just the way the clerk marks it off.\n  The only time I have seen that happen since I have been in the Senate \nis when, during the impeachment trial, I went down and got one of those \nrecords, and I sat and made my own record of every Senator's vote in \nimpeachment. I thought it was a significant enough event to revive that \ncustom.\n  Why am I going through this history? For one reason. Because I read \nin this morning's paper the accusation made by the Democratic leader \nthat what the Republican majority leader has been doing these last few \ndays is leading to the erosion of the history and sanctity of the \nSenate, leading to a destruction of this institution.\n  I give you this history as my credentials, as one who wants to \ncomment on this institution, who wants to talk about what is going on \nand what has gone on. No, I will not engage in a debate with the \nDemocratic leader as to whether there was or was not precedent of what \nhe has done. My friend from Idaho has done that, and that is \nappropriate.\n  But I am not here to do that. I am here to talk about this \ninstitution and what has happened to it in the roughly 50 years since I \nsat as a teenager in the family gallery and fell in love with it.\n  It is a little startling to me I can talk about that being nearly 50 \nyears ago, but it was. As I say, I was a teenager. Now I am beginning \nto look forward to the time when I will be 70. I assure my constituents \nit is a long way away, but in fact it is in about 3 years.\n  What has happened to the institution in a half a century of my \nobservations of it? If I go back to the old institution--that is, the \ninstitution that I knew in those years--appropriations bills were the \nleast controversial of any bills. Appropriations bills passed without \ndiscussion, debate, or confusion. The institution assumed that the \nAppropriations Committee knew what it was doing. The major debates were \nover authorization bills. Once something was authorized, it was the \nduty of the appropriators to come up with a legitimate amount of money, \nand there was no attempt to saddle appropriations bills with \ncontroversial riders or amendments. It simply was not done.\n  The appropriations process was considered the most routine of any \nprocess that was carried on around here. Oh, there was partisanship in \nthose days. There were bitter speeches, as the kind I have just \ndescribed between Senator Douglas and Senator Millikin, but there was \nno attempt to use the rules of the institution to slow down the \nappropriations process for political benefit. It simply wasn't done. It \nwas simply not considered acceptable in this institution. Now we do it. \nNow it happens. I can't put my finger on the turning point at which it \nhappened, but I think I can identify one important point along the \nroad, and it happened while I was in the Senate.\n\n  In 1995, a gentleman for whom I have utmost respect as a political \ntactician and strategist, Newt Gingrich, made a serious miscalculation. \nI remember discussing it with him sitting over in what is now the \nLyndon Johnson Room, as he came over from the House to tell us in the \nSenate what they were going to do in the House.\n  They were going to deliver the coup de grace to the Clinton \nadministration by forcing the President to accept a balanced budget \nagreement, and the reason they would force the President to do that is \nthat they would use the appropriations process to put leverage on him.\n  I remember a number of us saying to him, ``Well, Newt, what happens \nif the President doesn't cave?'' He said, ``What do you mean, if the \nPresident doesn't cave? This President not caving in? Are you kidding \nme?'' He went down example after example where President Clinton had \ncaved under pressure from the Congress. He said, ``This will be the \nfinal example that we have taken control in the Congress, we have \nseized it from the executive branch, and we will make him a lame duck \nfor the last 2 years of his term. This is the crucial moment at which \nthe Congress demonstrates its power.''\n  I asked, and a number of others asked, ``Wonderful, Newt, but what if \nit doesn't work?'' He said, ``What do you mean, what if it doesn't \nwork? Of course, it will work. What do you mean, what if he doesn't \ncave? Of course, he will cave.''\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\n  Speaker Gingrich, in a massive miscalculation, set in motion a series \nof actions that ultimately ended up in a partial shutdown of the \nFederal Government. As the shutdown went on, we Republicans did our \nbest to try to explain that it was all Bill Clinton's fault. We did our \nbest to say it was all the responsibility of the administration. And \nthe press did its best to tell everybody it was all our fault.\n  Ultimately, the Republican leader on this side, Bob Dole, stood here \nand said, ``Enough is enough, we are going to put the Government back \nto work.'' Senator Dole's instincts were right, and Speaker Gingrich's \ninstincts were wrong, and the Republicans paid an enormous electoral \nprice for Newt Gingrich's mistake in the 1996 election. We frittered \naway our opportunity to win back the Presidency, and we saw our margins \nin the House of Representatives go down in that election.\n  I think that was a watershed event because I think the people in the \nWhite House discovered that if they could use the appropriations \nprocess to create a crisis that would be seen as a Government shutdown \nby the Republicans, they could get political advantage. The \nappropriations process has never been the same. The White House \nnegotiators have been much tougher since that happened. The demands \ncoming out of the White House have been much more significant, and the \nthreat is: We will veto, we will veto, we will veto; the Government \nwill shut down, and you Republicans will get blamed for it. You have to \ngive us what we want.\n  We have seen the appropriations power move from the legislative \nbranch to the executive branch, under the threat of a veto and the \nthreat of a Government shutdown. That is a sea change in constitutional \nstructure and a sea change in politics that has happened while I have \nbeen in the Senate. That is part of what is going on right now. Right \nnow, under instructions from the White House, the Democrats are saying: \nLet us do whatever we can to get ourselves in a situation where we can \nrerun the movie of 1995 in the fall of 2000. Look at how it helped us \nin the election of 1996 to keep Bill Clinton in office. Look at how it \nwill help us in 2000 to get Al Gore into office.\n  So an appropriations bill comes along: Let's do everything we can to \nslow it down. An appropriations bill comes on the floor: Let's do \neverything we can to increase the amount of debate time. We may end up \nvoting for the appropriations bill, but that is not the point. It isn't \na question of, do we vote for it or do we vote against it? It is a \nquestion of, how much can we slow it down so as to create the \nopportunity to rerun 1995 one more time? That is part of what is going \non.\n\n  Another thing that is going on that you never would find in the old \nSenate--again, by ``old Senate,'' I mean that time I saw during my \nfather's 24 years here. It used to be that when the Senate voted on an \nissue, it passed or it failed, and it was done with. If it came back to \nbe voted on again on the part of those who had lost, it came back in a \nnew Congress when there had been an election and, presumably, people \nchanged their minds. It never was the case that something was voted on \nagain, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and \nagain, and again, and again in the same Congress. They never used to do \nthat. Certainly, they never used to do it with rollcall votes.\n  I remember when Lyndon Johnson was the majority leader--this story \nhas been told many times, but it is worth recounting here--a Senator \ncame to him with an amendment, and Johnson said, ``Fine, we will accept \nit.'' The Senator said, ``I want a vote.'' Johnson said, ``No, you \ndon't want a vote. We will accept it.'' ``No, let's debate it and have \na vote.'' So they debated it, and it was defeated, with Johnson voting \nagainst it and using his power as the majority leader to kill it. The \nSenator came to him and said, ``You said you would accept this.'' \nJohnson said, ``Yes, but you didn't let me. You insisted on wasting the \ntime of the Senate to have a debate and a vote, and I am telling you, \nyou don't do that anymore. You don't do that ever again.'' The Senator \nlearned.\n  We have rollcall votes around here on everything. We will have a \nresolution to memorialize Mother's Day, and someone will ask for the \nyeas and nays, and we will spend a half hour voting, 100-0, and it \nslows everything down. Why do we do that? Well, maybe on Mother's Day \nwe all want to be on record saying we are for Mother's Day. I will tell \nyou why we do it--and, again, it is something that never would have \nbeen done 30 years ago. We do it to build a record for campaign \npurposes, not for legislative purposes.\n  The Senate has become a campaign-focused organization rather than a \nlegislative-focused organization. I will give you my own experience \nwith this. When I ran in 1998, my opponent stood up before the crowds, \non television, whatever, and said, ``Senator Bennett is pro-tobacco.'' \nPardon me? ``Absolutely. Look at his record. He voted with the tobacco \ninterests 12 different times.'' I did? I was there. I didn't remember \nvoting with the tobacco interests once. ``No, he is lying about his \nrecord. Here it is.''\n  Then we go into the web site where he has all of this listed under \nthe fetching title, ``What Senator Bennett Doesn't Want You To Know,'' \nand here is the list of all of my ``pro-tobacco'' votes. What were \nthey? They were procedural votes, votes on motions to table, votes in \nsupport of the leader moving legislation forward.\n  On the one tobacco vote that counted, which was a cloture vote on \nSenator McCain's bill, I was in the antitobacco forces; and, indeed, I \nhad and used, during the campaign, letters thanking me for my strong \nantitobacco stand from the American College of Pediatric Surgeons, et \ncetera, et cetera. All of the people who were involved in the tobacco \nfight knew I was on their side. They knew the process around here well \nenough to know these 12 votes about which my opponent was talking were \nmeaningless as far as the real issue was concerned.\n  I will tell you what I said to him. We checked his FEC report, and I \nsaid to my opponent: You paid $20,000 to a computer firm to research my \nvoting record and come up with this list. I recommend you call them and \nget your money back because you wasted it. They gave you wrong \ninformation.\n\n  He said I was pro-liquor. He had a voting record that said I was in \nfavor of alcohol. Pardon me? We got into it. We found out what the vote \nwas that I supposedly cast that made me pro-alcohol. It had to do with \nFederal highway funds and the rights of the States to set their own \nlevels of alcohol tolerance, and because I am in favor of States \ncontrolling that and voted against having the Federal Government \ndictate it, suddenly I had cast a pro-alcohol vote. He went on and on \nand on in this same vein.\n  I understand what is going on here. Amendments are not being offered \nfor legislative purposes. Bills are not being called up for legislative \npurposes. Recorded votes are not being called for because someone wants \nto improve the legislation. Records are being built on issues that can \nbe misrepresented as serious challenges to incumbents. They are being \nbrought up again and again and again so that people can stand up in a \ncampaign and say that the incumbent voted wrong 17 times. Lyndon \nJohnson would not have stood for it. Everett Dirksen would have had a \nquip about it that would make everybody laugh. But it is now the way \nthings are done in this institution.\n  I said that I am responding to the suggestion of the Democratic \nleader that somehow what is going on here is destructive of the \ninstitution. I agree that what is going on is destructive of the \ninstitution. But I do not put it at the feet of the majority leader. I \nthink it has historic roots that go back beyond this majority leader \nand that go back before the previous majority leaders. I don't know \nwhen it started happening, but we have come a long way from the day \nwhen the Senate would vote with a rollcall vote about 50 times in a \nsession--that is how often my father voted on rollcall votes--a day \nwhen the Chamber would fill up to hear the debate because it was a \nsignificant vote. We have come a long way from that.\n  The institution has become primarily a campaign platform. Let us make \nno mistake about it. What is going on right now in the Chamber is all \ngeared to November and not in any sense geared toward legislation. It \nis not geared toward solving problems. It is not geared toward moving \nthe Republic forward. It is all geared toward getting those multiple \nvotes that a computer\n\n[[Page S4229]]\n\ncan find and then put it on a web site that can be used in a campaign \nspeech on the part of the challenger.\n  I agree with the Democratic leader that this cheapens the \ninstitution. I agree with the Democratic leader that it threatens the \ninstitution. But I disagree with him as to the solution.\n  I think all Senators need to back away from the idea that the primary \npurpose of being in the Senate is to give campaign speeches, and back \naway from the idea that the primary function of coming to the floor is \nto do things that will give you an advantage in November and so you can \nmisrepresent and attack an incumbent. There is a time for partisanship, \nand there is a time to be very firm about the position that you take. \nBut there is also a time to recognize that the institution is \nthreatened if you let partisanship get out of hand.\n  It reminds me of the signature comment that comes to us out of the \nVietnam War where, I believe, a captain was quoted as saying after a \nparticular battle that it was ``necessary to destroy the village in \norder to pacify it.'' If it is necessary to destroy the institution of \nthe Senate in order to make it part of my party's control, I want no \npart of that activity. In my own campaign, I have refused to engage in \nnegative advertising. I want no part of what I call ``Carville-ism''; \nthat is, the politics of personal destruction that has become so \nprevalent in the last 8 years. I want no part of it.\n  I remember a man saying to me: If you do not go negative, you will \nnot win the nomination.\n  I said to him: The nomination is not worth it. I would rather retain \nmy self-respect than gain a seat in the Senate. Fortunately, I have \nboth.\n  I say to all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--because \nRepublicans campaign just as vigorously as Democrats--let's stop using \nthe Senate as an institution solely for campaign purposes. Let's stop \nusing the rules of the Senate that can allow votes and that can call up \namendments solely for the purpose of creating campaign records. Let's \nrecognize that the purpose of the Senate is for legislation, not \ncampaigning.\n  If we can do that, we will not get back to the days that I have \ndescribed, but we will at least get towards them in the sense that this \ninstitution will survive, as we like to call it, ``the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world'' and not ``the greatest campaign forum \nin the world.''\n  I thank the Chair for his patience. I thank my colleagues for their \nindulgence as I have taken this memory trip. But I hope that all of us \nwill recognize that we have something to learn from the past and from \nthe kind of institution this once was, and we have a responsibility to \nsee to it that it does not degenerate into what it could be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I listened to Senator Craig's remarks \nabout Senator Mitchell's use of cloture in the 103d Congress. As to the \ncloture numbers the Senator mentioned, yes Senator Mitchell filed \ncloture 23 times on the first day of an item's consideration but what \nhe failed to mention was that only one of those instances was on a \nbill. Let me repeat that--in only one instance in the entire 103d \nCongress did Senator Mitchell file cloture on the first day a bill was \nconsidered, and in that instance it was with the bill sponsor's \npermission. It was Senator Rockefeller and the bill was product \nliability. In all but four of the other instances the Senate was not in \nan amendable situation, they were on motions to proceed, conference \nreports, or attempts to go to conference.\n  There were two instances where Senator Mitchell filed on amendments \non their first day, the first was on Senator Kennedy's substitute \namendment to the national community service bill and the other was on \nthe Mitchell-Dole Brady gun amendment, in each case a true filibuster \nwas going to be waged. In other words members of the minority had \nindicated a willingness to try and kill the legislation by extended \ndebate. This has not been the case this Congress', cloture is filed in \nattempt to stifle the ability of individual Senators to offer \namendments and that is the crucial difference that I pointed out last \nweek.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before we do the closing remarks, we are \nwaiting to see if Senator Daschle has any remarks he would like to make \nat this point.\n  Just so Senators will be aware of the likely schedule this week, of \ncourse this is the week before the Memorial Day recess. We have a \nnumber of conferences that are completed or nearing completion, so we \ncould have votes on a number of conference reports this week, including \nbut not necessarily limited to bankruptcy reform, crop insurance, the \nsatellite loan conference report, and the e-commerce digital signature \nconference report. Not all of those have been wrapped up, but we are \nhopeful that one or all four of those will be available during the \nprocess of the week's schedule.\n  We also are expecting to receive from the House early in the week the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. We had hoped to go to that bill \ntomorrow and then, of course, as soon as it was received from the House \nwe would go to the House-passed bill. If the House is not able to \ncomplete action on the Agriculture appropriations bill on Tuesday, then \nwe will need to confer with the leadership on both sides of the aisle \nand decide exactly how we can go to that bill and have its \nconsideration completed before the week is out. But I want to emphasize \nbefore we go home for Memorial Day, we must complete the Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  We are still hoping that the House will be able to act on the \nlegislative appropriations bill and we will be able to complete action \non it also before we leave.\n  So we will be having votes possibly into the night on Tuesday. We \ncould very likely have a late session Thursday. Members should expect a \nsession on Friday. If we are not through with the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, then we will keep going until we complete it. We \ncould be in session Friday night or Saturday. This is work that has to \nbe done. For reasons which I need not repeat at this point, we are \nbehind schedule in getting that done. We need to complete it.\n\n  I am not going to propound a unanimous consent request at this time \non nominations, but so everybody will know, we have now been discussing \nthe possibility of an agreement to take up as many as 72 nominations. \nThere may still be some objections to one, two, or three of those. \nSomewhere between 65 and 72 nominations have been offered by the \nmajority that we could take up and consider. Most of them would be \nconfirmed, without the need for debate, in wrapup or on a unanimous \nvoice vote. In at least four or five cases, some time would be \nrequired, with regard to the FEC nominees and at least a couple judges, \nwith recorded votes necessary on somewhere between four and six at the \nmost.\n  We could complete up to as many as 72 nominations in the next 24 \nhours, including 16 new Federal judicial nominations. Again, three or \nfour of those nominations for judgeships could require recorded votes, \nbut I believe we could get them all done.\n  There has been objection from the minority. I discussed the situation \nwith Senator Daschle this morning, and he is still working on it. We \nhope we can get this resolved shortly without having to spend the whole \nweek just on nominations. This really should be done in 5 or 6 hours \nwith five or six votes and the rest of them done without any \nobjections. There are a variety of nominations: U.S. marshals, U.S. \nattorneys, IRS oversight board members; Administrator, drug \nenforcement; two National Transportation Safety Board members; one \nNuclear Regulatory Commission member; eight various Department of State \npositions, including the special negotiator for chemical and biological \narms control issues, and a number of other nominees.\n  I want it on the record that we are prepared to go to those at this \npoint.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4230-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4230]]\n              THE LATE CLARENCE HOLLAND ``ICKY'' ALBRIGHT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an old \nfriend and one of South Carolina's most public minded citizens, \nClarence Holland ``Icky'' Albright, who recently passed away at the age \nof 93.\n  To those who knew him, Icky Albright was synonymous with the town of \nRock Hill, a small and charming city in the Olde English District of \nSouth Carolina. Though a native of Laurens, Icky Albright moved to Rock \nHill in 1929, shortly after graduating from Clemson Agricultural \nCollege, and became Rock Hill's leading citizen and cheerleader. He \nessentially spent his entire adult life working tirelessly, as both a \nprivate citizen and a public official, to promote what is a \nquintessential southern and American town.\n  Icky Albright was fiercely proud of his adopted hometown and set his \nroots deep there, starting with his 1934 marriage to Rock Hill native, \nthe former Sophie Marshall. Mr. Albright was one of the Rock Hill \nbusiness community's leading citizens, for years, he was part owner of \na hardware store established by his father-in-law and he later started \nhis own business, ``Albright Reality Incorporated''. Furthermore, he \nwas active in any number of civic and service organizations. His \npassion for making Rock Hill the best place possible to live prompted \nhim to get involved in public service, running for and serving on the \nCity Council from 1940-1944, as Mayor from 1948-1954, and as South \nCarolina State Senator from 1966-1968.\n  Beyond the many votes he cast as a public servant, the funds he \nraised for charity, or enthusiastically promoting commerce, Icky \nAlbright's most enduring legacy was the creation of the ``Come-See-Me \nFestival'' held every April and timed to coincide with the blooming of \nthe azaleas in the city's Glencairn Garden. A modest man, Icky Albright \nprotested that this successful festival was the idea of many, though \neveryone knew that he was the one who was truly responsible for this \npopular event that draws more than 100,000 people each year.\n  Though it sounds a tad cliche, it is true to say that Icky Albright \nlived a long, full, and rewarding life, and that through his efforts he \ntouched the lives of many and made a significant difference in his \ncommunity and our state. All that knew him mourn his passing and our \ncondolences go out to his widow, their two sons ``Bud'' and Ned, three \ngrandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.s\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4230-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BRIGADIER GENERAL MITCHELL M. ZAIS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President. I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nrecognize the service of Brigadier General Mitchell M. Zais, who has \ndedicated the past three-decades to protecting the security and people \nof our nation as a soldier and officer in the United States Army.\n  General Zais began his career when he graduated from the United \nStates Military Academy in 1969 and accepted a commission in the \nInfantry. It was at this point in time that the American involvement in \nVietnam was at its apex, and the newly minted officer quickly had the \nopportunity to put to the test the martial skills he had learned at \nWest Point and Fort Benning. Heading to Southeast Asia, then Second \nLieutenant Zais assumed command of an infantry platoon in the 101st \nAirborne Division and began what has been a long and distinguished \ncareer.\n  After emerging from the jungles of Vietnam, this officer held a \nvariety of positions which were progressively more responsible and \nmoved him up the Army's hierarchy. He has served in Asia, Europe, \nCentral America, and the United States, has held command at the \nplatoon, company, battalion, and brigade levels, and has held vital \nstaff assignments including on the Joint Staff.\n  General Zais is currently serving as Chief of Staff, United States \nArmy Reserve Command, but this will be his last assignment as he is due \nto retire from the military shortly, ending what has been an impressive \ncareer. Commendably, General Zais has decided to seek a second career \nwhich will allow him to continue to make a difference, that of an \neducator. I am pleased to report that this man will assume the duties \nof President of Newberry College in Newberry, South Carolina. I am \nconfident that the General will enjoy his new hometown and his new job. \nAs a former educator, I can assure him that there are few things more \nrewarding than working with young people.\n  I commend General Mitchell Zais on his many years of dedicated and \nselfless service to the nation and the Army, I welcome him to South \nCarolina, and I wish him the best of health, happiness, and success in \nthe years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4230-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             RECOGNITION OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS FOUNDING\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nanniversary of the founding of the American Red Cross by Clara Barton \n119 years ago. This year's theme, ``We Touch the World,'' describes the \ncompassionate direction the Red Cross is taking locally, nationally, \nand internationally.\n  After the brutal battle of Solferino near Verona, Italy, Jean Henry \nDurant, a Swiss citizen, formed the International Red Cross in 1863 \nwith the intent to alleviate suffering and promote public health. The \nfirst Geneva Convention was signed by 16 nations a year later, adopting \nthe red cross as a symbol of neutral aid. Clara Barton recognized the \nimportance of the humanitarian efforts of the International Red Cross \nin Europe, and cultivated the fundamental principles of humanity, \nimpartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and \nuniversality into what we know today as the American Red Cross. In \naddition to alleviating suffering and promoting public health, Ms. \nBarton also envisioned a need for disaster relief and battlefield \nassistance.\n  Founded on May 21, 1881, in Washington, DC, the American Red Cross \nwas able to lobby the U.S. Congress to ratify the Geneva Convention, \nproviding an official basis to associate with the International Red \nCross. The U.S. was the 32nd nation to sign the document, agreeing to \nprotect the wounded during wartime. Ms. Barton then continued to serve \nthe Red Cross as its volunteer president until 1904. Over the last 119 \nyears, the American Red Cross has not only served Americans and our \nallies during wartime, but has brought help to anyone in need of aid.\n  Its thousands of volunteers provide the American Red Cross with the \ntools to carry out its vitally important task in times of need. Behind \nthe scenes, in preparation for disaster situations, local Red Cross \nchapters provide their communities with CPR and First Aid classes and \ninformation on health issues, and promote blood donations to provide \nthe medical field with an adequate supply should a crisis arise.\n  Just a few years ago, in my home state of Minnesota, the Red Cross \nleft its mark by touching the lives of those affected by the floods of \n1997 and the tornadoes that tore through towns in the southern part of \nthe state. And during it all, the Minneapolis chapter was without a \npermanent home to help in the disaster relief. Last month, they opened \ntheir doors, the first permanent location since 1996, to a new facility \nthat includes a blood-donor center, space to shelter and feed people in \ncase of a disaster, and an emergency operations center with its own \ncommunications and power systems.\n  Mr. President, ninety-one cents of every dollar spent by the American \nRed Cross goes directly to programs and services that help people in \nneed. All of the disaster assistance is free, thanks to the generosity \nof donors and volunteers alike. The ratio of volunteer Red Cross \nworkers to paid staff is nearly 41 to one. I am honored to have this \nopportunity to commemorate the dedicated work of the late Clara Barton \nand the contributions of all those who continue to carry out her legacy \nin the American Red Cross.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4230-4", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4230-S4231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND UNIVERSITY COLLEGE \n                       OVERSEAS MILITARY PROGRAM\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to offer my \ncongratulations and\n\n[[Page S4231]]\n\nvery best wishes to all those gathered at the 50th Anniversary \ncelebration of the University of Maryland University College (UMUC) \nserving the United States military in Europe. I am pleased to take part \nin recognizing the longstanding tradition that this institution \ncontinues to uphold in ensuring quality higher education for our \nservicemembers overseas.\n  It has always been my firm belief that a democracy cannot prosper and \ngrow without an educated populace, and therefore the education of the \nindividual is one of the most important tasks in our society. The \nsuccess and growth of UMUC is a critical testament to the importance of \neducational opportunities for our military personnel in Europe. From \nits inception, this institution has viewed higher education from a \nglobal perspective, an approach which has put UMUC at the forefront of \nthe larger higher education community.\n  Following World War II, when the United States military invited \nAmerican universities to provide higher educational programs to \nservicemembers at military installations throughout Europe, UMUC was \nthe only institution to respond. This began a historic 50 year \npartnership with the military in Europe and starting in 1956, in Asia \nas well. The noted British scholar Arnold Toynbee wrote that the UMUC \nprogram in Europe is ``an American achievement from which the rest of \nthe world has much to learn.''\n  Since the first year, UMUC has offered educational opportunities to \nhundreds of thousands of our men and women overseas. Even now, it is \nwonderful to hear that this tradition continues in many locations at \nlong established military installations in Germany, Britain, Italy, and \nSpain including temporary facilities in Kosovo and Bosnia.\n  I commend the University of Maryland University College for its 50 \nyear history of unparalleled service and success in the field of \neducation and I look forward to a continued close association with this \nexemplary institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4231-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CHARLES ORAN LITTLE\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good \nfriend and fellow Kentuckian Oran Little on the occasion of his \nretirement as dean of the University of Kentucky's College of \nAgriculture.\n  Oran taught at UK for 25 years, and served as a highly-respected and \nwell-liked leader for UK's students and faculty for 12 years as Dean of \nthe College of Agriculture. Under his tenure, new facilities were \nbuilt, old facilities were renovated, and innovative educational \nprograms were launched. An Agricultural Engineering Building, \nRegulatory Services Building, Animal Research Center, and Plant Science \nBuilding all took root during Oran's 12 years as dean. He also \nfacilitated the creation of international exchange programs, faculty \nand student councils, and numerous agricultural development programs. \nOran may be leaving UK in body, but the school will benefit from his \nenterprising spirit and the tangible improvements he made as the \nCollege of Agriculture's dean for years to come.\n  Oran's long list of awards is as impressive as his lengthy list of \naccomplishments. His knowledge and experience have not gone unnoticed \nby other Kentucky agricultural institutions. Oran has received awards \nfrom the Kentucky Seed Improvement Association, Bowling Green/Warren \nCounty Chamber of Commerce, Greater Lexington Convention & Visitors \nBureau, Soil and Water Conservation Society, UK Alumni Association, \nKentucky 4-H, Kentucky Pork Producers Association, and the Kentucky \nCattlemen's Association.\n  Oran has a long history with UK, serving as assistant professor, \nassociate professor, professor, coordinator of animal nutrition \nresearch and teaching, associate dean for research, director of the \nKentucky agricultural experiment station, coordinator of graduate \nprograms in agriculture, and finally as dean of the College of \nAgriculture. Oran earned respect the old-fashioned way, through years \nof hard-work and a sincere concern for students, teachers and faculty \nat the University of Kentucky.\n  Over the years, Oran and I have worked together on many projects at \nUK. With Oran's wealth of knowledge about the University, he has been \nan essential resource in targeting the needs of UK and communicating \nhow Congress can help meet those needs. It has always been a pleasure \nto work with Oran and I will miss him a great deal. I have no doubt, \nhowever, that he will stay involved with UK's College of Agriculture \nand that we will continue to hear from him in the future.\n  Oran, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, I wish you all the best \nas you enter retirement and I thank you for your many successful \nefforts to make UK a better place to work and learn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4231-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4231-S4232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. REED.

He was taken to \nRhode Island Hospital, but he died within minutes.\n  Though it was still springtime, Minaya was Providence's 13th homicide \nvictim of 1999, a year in which there were ultimately 26 murders in the \ncity, up from 15 in 1998 and 13 in 1997. The majority of these killings \nwere committed with firearms, and most of these were handguns.\n  The children and families who witnessed the shooting of John Minaya \nin broad daylight at a Dairy Queen in Providence will carry the \nhorrific memory of that day with them for as long as they live.

Mr. President, Saturday, May 20th was Armed Forces \nDay and I can think of no better time to honor those who serve this \ngreat county in the United States military. The millions of active duty \npersonnel who have so unselfishly dedicated their lives to protecting \nfreedom deserve the highest degree of respect and a day of honor.\n  I recently had the privilege of being invited to tour the U.S.S. \nEnterprise during a training mission off the Florida cost. My \nexperience abroad the Enterprise reminded me of the awesome power and \nstrength of the United States military. But more importantly, it \nreminded me of the hard work and sacrifice of the men and women serving \nin our armed forces.\n  The U.S.S. Enterprise was commissioned on Sept. 24, 1960 and was the \nworld's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. This incredible ship is \nthe largest carrier in the Naval fleet at 1,123 feet long and 250 feet \nhigh. While walking along the 4.47 acre flight deck with Captain James \nA. Winnefeld, Jr., Commanding Officer, it was amazing to learn that \n``The Big E'' remains the fastest combatant in the world.\n  Spending two days touring the Enterprise showed me what a hard \nworking and knowledgeable military force we have. As I moved through \nthe ship I was greeted with enthusiasm, as sailors explained the ship's \nequipment and their role as part of the Enterprise crew. At full staff, \nthe ``Big E,'' as it is affectionately known, has over 5,000 crew \nmembers from every state of the Union, most of whom are between 18 and \n24 years old. These young adults are charged with maintaining and \noperating the largest air craft carrier in the world and guiding \nmultimillion-dollar airplanes as they land on a floating runway. I was \nin awe of these men and women who work harder and have more \nresponsibility than many people do in a lifetime.\n  ``The Big E'' is a ship that never sleeps, it operates twenty four \nhours a day, seven days a week. I watched as a handful of tired pilots \nsat down for `dinner' at 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday night. Hungry and \ntired, they wanted it no other way. I had the privilege of joining \nCaptain Winnefeld in honoring the `Sailor of the Day' for spending \nthree consecutive days repairing broken machinery, taking only a few 30 \nminute breaks to sleep. I witnessed the same degree of commitment in a \nseparate part of the ship as an eager technician showed me how the \ncables on the flight deck operate and are maintained below. His task \nfor the past two days was to create the metal attachment which holds \none of the four arresting tailhook cables together and his voice was \nfilled with pride as he explained the entire 8 hour process. Between \ngiving orders to his crew, he pointed out a few tiny air bubbles that \nformed during the cooling process of the metal attachment. Although he \nstarted his shift at 4:30 a.m. and probably won't sleep for the next 24 \nhours, he smiles and tells me it will be redone, that it must be \nperfect--the lives of our pilots are at risk if it is not. The amazing \nthing is, they all do it with a smile.\n  When I think about Armed Forces Day, I think about two events I \nexperienced on the Enterprise. First, are the sailors from across \nColorado who sat down for breakfast with me in the enlisted mess hall, \nwho gleamed with pride for the job they do and the important role they \nplay in our nation's defense. Second, was the ``Town Hall meeting'' I \nheld, where I responded to questions and concerns ranging from military \nhealth care to Social Security, from members of the crew.

Never-mind that many \nof them could be paid more money for less work in a civilian job, may \nnot get eight hours sleep each night or see their families for weeks at \na time--they make those sacrifices for the country they love.\n  I hope that Coloradans will join me in using Armed Forces Day to \nthank those who are serving in the best military force in the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4232-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                S. 2581\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor \nlegislation introduced by Senator Sessions, S. 2581, the Historically \nWomen's Public Colleges or Universities Historic Building Restoration \nand Preservation Act.\n  There were seven historic women's public colleges or universities \nfounded in the United States between 1884 and 1908 to provide \nindustrial and vocational education for women who at the time, could \nnot attend other public academic institutions. These schools are now \ncoeducational but retain some of the significant historical and \nacademic features of those pioneering efforts to educate women.\n  Let me take this time to tell you about one of these schools, \nWinthrop University, located in South Carolina. Winthrop's history \ndates back to 1886 when 21 students gathered in a borrowed one-room \nbuilding in Columbia, S.C. David Bancroft Johnson, a dedicated and \ngifted superintendent of schools, headed up the fledgling institution \nwhose mission was the education of teachers. Winthrop has changed \nconsiderably since moving to its permanent Rock Hill, S.C. home in \n1895, growing from a single classroom to a comprehensive university of \ndistinction. The institution became coeducational in 1974 and assumed \nuniversity designation in 1992.\n  Like similar institutions founded as historically women's colleges \nand universities, the Winthrop University campus hosts numerous \nhistoric buildings--buildings that are expensive to adapt and/or \nmaintain for modern-day uses essential to public higher education in \nthe 21st century. Also, like similar institutions, many of Winthrop's \nalumni were women of modest means who were unable to make the kind of \nsubstantial private donations that would have enabled the University to \nbuild a strong endowment throughout its history. Nonetheless, this \ncampus is significant and is worthy of federal support to assure that \nits distinctive role in U.S. history is not lost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4232-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4232-S4233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to America's \nsmall businesses--the backbone of our Nation's vibrant economy. As my \ncolleagues may know, the week of May 21-27 is recognized as ``National \nSmall Business Week.''\n  Small businesses have always been one of the leading providers of \njobs in our country. According to the Small Business Administration, \nsmall businesses employ 52 percent of the private workforce and account \nfor 35 percent of federal contract dollars. Small businesses produce 38 \npercent of jobs in high-technology industries, and small- and medium-\nsized companies comprise 96 percent of all exporters and 30 percent of \nall exports. These statistics underscore the important role the small \nbusiness community will have toward developing a 21st century economy \nthat is global and technologically driven.\n  In particular, I am very pleased with the tremendous growth in women-\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\nowned businesses over the last several years. According to the National \nFoundation for Women Business Owners, there are more than 9.1 million \nwomen-owned businesses in the United States, employing more than 27.5 \nmillion people and generating $3.6 billion in sales. Between 1987 and \n1999, the number of women-owned firms increased dramatically, by more \nthan 103 percent.\n  During ``National Small Business Week,'' I am proud to share with my \ncolleagues the special recognition granted by the Small Business \nAdministration to two of Minnesota's small business persons: the 1999 \nMinnesota Small Business Person of the Year, Nancy L. Fogelberg, \nPresident of American Artstone in New Ulm, Minnesota; and the Financial \nServices Advocate of the Year, Iric Nathanson, Project Coordinator for \nthe Minneapolis Community Development Agency.\n  To be named a recipient of the Small Business Person of the Year \naward is not an easy task. The Small Business Administration has \nselected Nancy for this unique recognition based on her personal \nachievements and important contributions to our economy. Nancy has \ndemonstrated growth in the total number of company employees; \ninnovative products and services; growth in sales and financial \nposition; an ability to effectively address problems confronting the \ncompany; and community service.\n  In 1993, Nancy Fogelberg became President of American Artstone, an \n86-year-old manufacturer of architectural stone castings. Nancy quickly \nmodernized her plant through financing provided by the Small Business \nAdministration, and quickly made American Artstone more competitive and \nprofitable. I also congratulate Nancy on recently being named president \nof the National Cast Stone Institute.\n  I am also proud to recognize the important achievements of Iric \nNathanson, who has worked to provide financing opportunities for small \nbusinesses. Among his many achievements, Iric developed a capital-loan \nprogram that uses city-backed guarantees to help small businesses \naccess revolving credit lines and working capital loans. Iric also \ncoordinated the development of a micro-enterprise loan program in \nMinneapolis though the establishment of a partnership between the \nMinneapolis Community Development Agency and the Minneapolis Consortium \nof Community Developers. Small businesses in Minneapolis have been well \nserved by Iric's efforts on their behalf.\n  I again congratulate the National Small Business Week winners from \nMinnesota and every small business owner who helps make our communities \nbetter places to work and live. I look forward to working with them on \nsmall business public policy issues during the 106th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4233-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FRANK A. AUKOFER\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President I rise today to honor the dean of \nthe congressional print reporters here in Congress. Frank A. Aukofer \nhas worked in the Washington Bureau of the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel \nand its predecessor, the Milwaukee Journal, since 1970. Frank has also \nserved in other capacities for the paper since 1960. Sadly, for those \nof us who have read his stories through the years, Frank has decided to \nretire at the beginning of next month.\n  During his long and distinguished career, Frank has reported on the \nissues that have defined the last 40 years in America and around the \nworld. He was the civil rights reporter for the Journal at the height \nof the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Since arriving in \nWashington, Frank's coverage of State, national, and international \nissues has included stories on six Presidents, 15 Congresses, and the \nnomination hearings of 11 Supreme Court justices, including every \nmember of the current Court.\n  Coverage of these important events has not kept Frank tied to his \ndesk here in the press gallery. In the 1980s, he traveled to Mexico, \nColombia, Cuba, and Central America to cover such stories as the trial \nof Eugene Hasenfus in Nicaragua which led to a nomination for a \nPulitzer Prize. He was also one of the first journalists to report from \nSaudi Arabia in 1990 when U.S. troops were deployed after Iraq invaded \nKuwait. On top of all this he has still found time to write a weekly \nautomobile review column entitled, ``DriveWays.''\n  I thank Frank Aukofer for his years of service to the Milwaukee \nJournal-Sentinel, and the people of Wisconsin and I wish him all the \nbest in his well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4233-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO FATHER EDWARD RANDALL\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Father \nEdward Randall on the occasion of his Golden Jubilee and in recognition \nof 20 years of priesthood in Letcher County.\n  During Father Randall's 20 years in Letcher County, he has served at \nboth St. George Catholic Church in Jenkins and Holy Angels Catholic \nChurch in McRoberts. People throughout the community have come to know \nFather Randall for his dedication to parishioners and generosity to \neveryone, both inside and outside the Church walls.\n  The Letcher County community also boasts of Father Randall's artistic \ntalent, which he graciously uses to enhance church buildings and to \nteach free art classes open for all to attend. Father Randall also \nhelped establish, along with the late Mother Teresa, an order of the \nSisters of Charity in Jenkins, which will endure as an honor to his \nphilanthropic contributions.\n  Father Randall continues to display an unswerving commitment to his \nparishioners and possesses the love and respect of many in the \ncommunity. Those who know him in Letcher County describe him as a man \nwith great strength of character who demonstrates honesty and \nintegrity, and who serves as a role-model to young and old alike.\n  I am certain that the legacy of commitment to faith that Father \nRandall has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire those \nwho follow. Congratulations, Father Randall, on 50 years of priesthood \nand 20 years of service to Letcher County. Best wishes for many more \nyears of service, and know that your efforts to better the lives of \nyour parishioners and those in Letcher County will be felt for years to \ncome. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States \nSenate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many \nothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4233-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Todd Rossetti for receiving his high school diploma from Concord \nHigh School.\n  For some, a high school diploma is taken for granted. For Todd \nRossetti, it is a celebration of the trials and tribulations that he \nhas endured his entire life.\n  Although Todd was born with cerebral palsy, his illness has not \nprohibited him from accomplishing anything that he has set his mind to. \nIn the Concord School System, Todd was immersed in a new ``inclusion'' \nprogram, allowing him to participate in the mainstream curriculum.\n  Though Todd's illness hinders his ability to communicate, his peers,\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\nteachers and administrators have grown to love him and take pride in \nensuring that he is able to remain in mainstream classes. This support \nweb has enabled Todd to attend school, follow through with scholarly \nactivities, and find employment.\n  When it was believed that Todd might not be able to receive his \ndiploma with his class, it was that support network that spoke out. \nBecause of the love and efforts of his peers, Todd will be able to \ngraduate.\n  As a former teacher, I feel great compassion for his struggle. He is \na courageous and dedicated student, and it is an honor to represent him \nin the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4234-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GEORGINA LELAND\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

This award recognizes one who is dedicated to \nreaching out to his or her community. Georgina Leland is just such a \nperson. She is noted for her gregarious nature, her gritty honesty and \nher love of her community.\n  Georgina has been a pillar of Ossipee's community for fourteen years. \nOver the course of these years, Georgina has made her name made known \namong both the young and the old. She is a member of both her church \nchoir and her Bible study group, and she is a regular volunteer at \nchurch functions. Allowing elderly residents to experience life to its \nfullest, Georgina volunteers as a driver for the Clipper Home in \nWolfeboro, for R.S.V.P. and for Families Matter. When this vibrant \nwoman isn't in her car driving around the state of New Hampshire, she \nis consumed with her work at the Public Library and at the Mountain \nView Nursing Home.\n  Georgina, too, takes a special interest in her community's \ngovernmental affairs. She is a noteworthy volunteer at Ossipee's \nConcerned Citizens events where she never fails to make herself noticed \nwith her efforts or her words. Acting as the Past President of the \nOssipee Valley Women's Club for four years, Georgina was charged with \nbringing to life the scholarship program. In addition, Georgina \nvolunteers her summers to the Chamber of Commerce's information booth.\n  Her efforts as a volunteer and as a citizen have earned Georgina \nnumerous commendations. In 1998, she was named the Volunteer of the \nYear by the Clipper Home. She also received recognition from both \nR.S.V.P., Families Matter, VFW Post 8270 and Auxilary for her efforts \nas a volunteer.\n  Georgina is a role model for us all. It is certain that she has set \nan example for those of her community, for all of us and for her seven \nchildren and fourteen grandchildren. Though her family is quite large, \nGeorgina has made efforts to invite the entire community into her \nfamily fold. Her efforts and achievements are to be commended.\n  It is an honor to represent Georgina Leland in the United States \nSenate. Mary Jo and I wish you the best of luck in your future \nendeavors.

Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Lakes Region General Hospital for their designation as one of the \n``Businesses of the Decade'' by Business New Hampshire Magazine.\n  For the past ten years, under the leadership of President Thomas \nClairmont, the Lakes Region General Hospital has become known for \nencouraging area agencies and organizations to work together, combining \nresources and taking risks in order to meet not only the health care \nneeds of the Lakes Region, but of the entire state.\n  Mr. Clairmont has gone above and beyond the call of duty to give back \nto the group. In fact, he was recently honored with the American \nHospital Association's PAC Award for outstanding service in the area of \npublic policy, as well as the NH Hospital Association's Leslie A. \nSmith's President's Award. Mary Jo and I commend and congratulate him \non his hard work and dedication to the Lakes Region General Hospital.\n  A key player in the Rural Health Coalition of New Hampshire, their \nHealthLink program has received national recognition as a model program \nthat allows people to take charge of their own health, and provides \nhealth care for those individuals without health insurance.

With more than 100 acquisitions worldwide, \nthey have truly become dominant on the international market as well as \nwithin the United States.\n  For all its growth, Tyco has not forgotten its role in the \nsurrounding community. Tyco has donated money and time to United Way of \nthe Greater Seacoast and the Greater Piscataqua Community Foundation's \nJeffery Gutin Fund for Young Adults. Furthermore, Tyco's contribution \nof $500,000 was critical in the transformation of the Strawberry Banke \nMuseum into a year-round educational and community resource.\n  Their commitment to community does not end with donating money to \nworthy causes. Tyco's employees, from senior staffers to entry-level \nworkers, volunteer their time and energy to many non-profit \norganizations across the state. Perhaps more important, Tyco makes this \ncommitment to service possible by allowing its employees to incorporate \nvolunteerism into their busy schedules.\n  Tyco's success is irrefutable proof that a company can give back to \nits community while improving its ``bottom line.''

They have been \nrecognized for their Indoor Air Quality standards, and received the \n1996 United States Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental \nMerit Award in ``recognition of demonstrated commitment and significant \ncontributions to the environment'' for their design of the Boscawen \nElementary School.

Although faced with adversity \nthroughout his tenure with the company, Frain successfully pulled them \nthrough near bankruptcy, an acquisition by Northeast Utilities, and \nindustry deregulation.\n  Bill is an extraordinary leader, the type that does not always \nmanifest itself, but who motivates and encourages those around them to \ngive above and beyond one hundred percent of themselves. As a result, \nover 150 of his employees sit on boards throughout the state, and many \nmore volunteer their time to give back to communities throughout the \nstate. In addition, employees at PSNH have contributed more than 1.3 \nmillion to the United Way since 1990.\n  Bill's most notable achievements include winning the Yankee Chapter \nof the Public Relations Society of America Yankee Award for \ndemonstrating leadership during a crisis, earning the Special New \nHampshire District Advocacy Award from the United States Small Business \nAdministration, acting as a key facilitator in forming the Amoskeag \nFishways Partnership in order to bring life back into the Merrimack \nRiver, and being a co-founder of the Junior Achievement of New \nHampshire Advisory Council in 1995.

Perhaps their most notable \nachievement to date is their work to ensure that students with \nemotional and learning disabilities receive excellent schooling, \nhousing and another chance to grow and become active community members.\n  Easter Seals services an average of 125 children a day through \nprograms such as ``Support to Families in Need,'' family mediation, \nparenting workshops and 24-hour emergency support access. They \ncurrently provide ninety percent of special needs transportation for \nManchester and one hundred percent for the town of Londonderry, New \nHampshire.\n  Although their hardest workers are often volunteers, Easter Seals has \nnever wavered in the quality of the services they provide, and should \nbe commended for their continued quality and caring in the state.\n  The accomplishments of this organization are simply too numerous to \nlist. They founded Camp Sno-Mo, a program for children with physical \nand cognitive disabilities which has grown to include day camps as well \nas adult vacation programs.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake enhancements to the critical access hospital program under the \nMedicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCritical Access Hospital Enhancement Act of 2000. This bill provides \nsome much-needed program flexibility and refinements to the Medicare \nCritical Access Hospital Program.\n  Congress created the Critical Access Hospital Program three years ago \nwhen we passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33). Under \ncurrent law, a Critical Access Hospital must be located at a distance \nof over 35 miles from the nearest hospital; have emergency room and \ninpatient services provided by physicians, physician assistants and \nnurse practitioners; have fifteen or fewer inpatient beds; and \ninpatient stays must be limited to an average of 96 hours (four days).\n  The Critical Access Hospital program enables eligible rural hospitals \nto receive higher reimbursement rates for acute medical care. Through \nspecial allowances for staffing and reimbursements, designation as a \nCritical Access Hospital means that a community may be able to maintain \nlocal health care access which would otherwise be lost.\n  Many rural patients are Medicare and Medicaid participants and \nreduced reimbursements hit hospitals and medical centers hard: for \nexample, two-thirds of the patients at Blue Hill Memorial Hospital in \nmy home state of Maine are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. \nDesignation as a Critical Access Hospital is especially important to \nthese small, rural hospitals because it provides higher reimbursement \nrates\n  To date, there are 165 hospitals across the country that have been \ndesignated as Critical Access Hospitals, and three in Maine: Blue Hill \nMemorial in Blue Hill, St. Andrews Hospital in Boothbay Harbor, and \nC.A. Dean Memorial Hospital in Greenville. Without the Critical Access \nHospital program many small, rural hospitals--many of which are often \nthe only point of care for miles--will be lost. My bill seeks to \nstrengthen this program; it is my hope that with passage of the \nlegislation I introduce today, more of our nation's small, rural \nhospitals will be able to participate in this valuable program.\n  This bill will bring increased flexibility and programmatic \nrefinements to the Critical Access Hospital Program through the \nrestoration of bad debt payments, extending cost-based reimbursement to \nambulance and home health services associated with Critical Access \nHospitals, and modifying the provisions related to swing bed and \nlaboratory services. In addition, I propose including a seasonality \nadjustment for hospitals that are based in communities that experience \nlarge seasonal population fluctuations.\n  Rural residents are often poorer and more likely to lack private \nhealth insurance when compared with their urban neighbors. As a result, \nrural hospitals disproportionately incur bad debt expenses. The BBA \nreduced bad debt payments for hospitals and the Health Care Financing \nAdministration has interpreted this provision to apply to Critical \nAccess Hospitals. My bill restores bad debt payments as a way to \nimprove participation rates in the Critical Access Hospital program.\n\n  Emergency medical care is a crucial component in the Critical Access \nHospital health care delivery system. Congress clearly stated that all \noutpatient departmental services furnished by Critical Access Hospitals \nshould be reimbursed on the basis of reasonable costs, but HCFA has \ncarved out ambulance services. My bill extends cost-based reimbursement \nto ambulance services associated with Critical Access Hospitals as it \nfollows Congress's original legislative intent.\n  Critical Access Hospitals are often the sole sponsor of home health \nservices in remote areas. If a Critical Access Hospital is the only \nhome health provider in a rural community, then it would be useful to \nreimburse those services on the basis of reasonable costs. This bill \nwill extend cost-based reimbursement to home health services associated \nwith Critical Access Hospitals and will help maintain access to post-\nacute medical care for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Critical Access Hospitals are currently required to comply with \nextensive minimum data set standards under the skilled nursing facility \n(SNF) prospective payment system (PPS). This bill will provide cost \nbased reimbursement to swing bed services furnished by Critical Access \nHospitals to help alleviate some of the administrative expenses \nassociated with SNF PPS.\n  Laboratory services furnished by Critical Access Hospitals have \nhistorically been reimbursed on the basis of reasonable costs. In an \nattempt to clarify the statute and eliminate the collection of \nbeneficiary coinsurance, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (P.L. 106-\n113) that we passed last November inadvertently referenced the fee \nschedule. Consequently, HCFA has interpreted the provision to mean \nlaboratory services now will be reimbursed at the fee schedule rate. \nCorrecting this provision is critical to ensuring that Medicare \nbeneficiaries have access to important laboratory tests, and my bill \ndoes just that.\n  Seasonal fluctuations can occur in places likes coastal Maine where \ntourism swells the population in an area or in a small town near a ski \nresort. This seasonal population increase makes many otherwise tiny \nhospitals ineligible for the Critical Access Hospital Program. We must \nensure that hospitals are available year round for a community's \npermanent population. It seems to me that if a hospital generally \nserves a community with a population of 2,000 but is seasonally faced \nwith substantially much larger population, it should not de facto be \nmade\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\nineligible for the benefits of the Critical Access Hospital Program.\n  The final provision in The Critical Access Hospital Enhancement Act \nwill allow a state flexibility in designating a hospital with more than \n15 beds as a Critical Access Hospital if those additional beds are used \nonly for seasonal fluctuations in admissions, and if the average annual \noccupancy is not more than 15.\n  Mr. President, small hospitals across the country are facing an \nincreasingly uncertain future, and we must lend additional support to \nour rural health care providers. Refining the Critical Access Hospital \nprogram will ensure that the Critical Access Hospital designation is \nflexible enough for most rural areas. Expanding the Critical Access \nHospital Program is critical to these small hospitals and the \ncommunities they serve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2601. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom the gross income of an employee any employer provided home \ncomputer and Internet access; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                bridging the digital divide act of 2000\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nBridging the Digital Divide Act of 2000, a bill to make it easier for \nworking Americans to obtain computers and computer equipment so that no \none is left behind in the new Internet economy. This legislation makes \nit possible for employees to accept computers offered by their \nemployers without having to pay the IRS taxes on the value of the \ncomputer.\n  Mr. President, the high-tech sector is an increasingly important part \nof our economy, creating new synergies and opportunities for Americans \nof all ages. The more we can do to encourage every American to \nparticipate in the Internet revolution, the more productive we as a \nnation will be.\n  But the benefits of the high-tech revolution, while lucrative, must \nnot be limited to only some of our citizens. The great promise of the \nInternet revolution is that the benefits and rewards are accessed at \nthe individual level; not just reserved for big businesses or \nmultinational corporations. Our government should facilitate, not \nhinder, bringing that promise to each American.\n  In the long term, I believe that being hooked up to the Internet will \nbe as universal as television. It is important to remember that the \nInternet is a new technology, one that few people had heard of ten \nyears ago. We have gone from 5.8 million U.S. households online in 1994 \nto almost 40 million in 1999. By 2003, it is projected that 60 million \nhouseholds will be hooked up to the Internet.\n  In the short term, however, it is important to facilitate the \navailability of the Internet to all Americans. While many citizens have \nbeen taking advantage of the opportunities the Internet has to offer, \ntoo many Americans and Missourians have been left behind. Too many \npeople are opting out or being left behind by the Internet economy.\n  According to Forrester Research, income is the main driver of \nInternet adoption. Americans who earn more, participate more, and \nthereby develop the ability to earn even more. According to a 1998 \nstudy by the Department of Commerce, households with income of $75,000 \nand more are over 20 times more likely to have Internet access than \nthose at the lowest income levels.\n  This divide among income levels also indicates a divide along racial \nlines as well. According to the same Department of Commerce report, \nblack and Hispanic households are roughly two-fifths as likely to have \nInternet access as white households. Overall, according to Forrester \nResearch, only 33 percent of African American households are on-line, \nten percent fewer than the national average.\n  In my home state of Missouri, great progress has been made toward the \ngoal of bringing the state on-line. Since 1989, during my tenure as \nGovernor, Missouri has managed a statewide network that connects state \ngovernment departments and transmits voice, data, and video between \nthem. The state Department of Administration runs the network, which \nconnects government offices statewide over 14 nodes. In addition, \naccording to the Department of Commerce, 42 percent of Missouri \nhouseholds have computers.\n  Despite this progress, there is still more to do. In terms of \nInternet usage, Missouri ranks 32nd out of the 50 states, with only \n24.3 percent of households connected to the Internet in 1998. Clearly, \nit is in Missouri's interest to promote increased connectedness.\n  Across the nation, those who appreciate the power and opportunities \ninherent in the Internet continue to increase their involvement in the \nhigh-tech world. 60 percent of computer sales are being made to \nhouseholds that have already purchased a computer, demonstrating that \nthese households recognize the importance of remaining current and up \nto date with their computer equipment. At the same time, only 40 \npercent of computer sales are being made to households purchasing a \ncomputer for the first time. If we want more Americans to experience \nthe high-tech economy, we should encourage first time computer \npurchases and find ways to make computer ownership easier for families \nwho are currently without.\n  According to Dr. Mark Dean, a specialist in advanced technology \ndevelopment for IBM, the solution to the digital divide is to put \ncomputers in as many homes as possible. Unfortunately, when employers \nhave tried to help bridge this gap by providing their employees with \ncomputers and Internet access, the Internet Revenue Service has widened \nthe digital divide by treating the new equipment as a ``taxable \nevent,'' or in other words, requiring the employee to pay income tax on \nthe value of the computer.\n  Recently, the Ford Motor Company began a laudale effort to increase \ninvolvement of its employees in the high-tech economy. In February, \nFord announced that it would give all of its 350,000 employees free \ncomputers for their homes. Ford is doing this because they recognize \nthe value of having a workforce that is computer literate and internet \nsavvy. Ford understands that in the digital economy, on-line workers \nare more productive workers--whatever their responsibilities are with \nthe company.\n  Unfortunately, the IRS does not see things the same way. The IRS \napproach is to tax everything it can get its hands on, including the \ncomputers Ford is providing to employees to help bridge the digital \ndivide. According to the IRS, the employees who receive these computers \nfrom their employer are liable for tax on the value of the computers.\n  Mr. President, this is wrong. When companies make the move to bring \nall of their employees into the 21st century, the government should not \nmake it harder on the workers to accept the technology by increasing \ntheir taxes. Ford's employees should not be penalized for having an \nemployer that understands the importance of a computer-literate \nworkforce. The fact is that computers are a vital business tool, for \nall employees, and Ford has demonstrated its understanding of this fact \nby providing these computers for every employee, from the newest worker \nto the CEO.\n  Ford's employees should not have to suffer as a result of the IRS's \n19th century approach to tax policy. It is for this reason that my \nbill, the Bridging the Digital Divide Act of 2000, instructs the IRS \nnot to treat computers provided to all employees by an employer as \ntaxable income to the employee. This measure is in the interest of \nemployees and employers alike. And because computers in the home will \nhelp increase our economic productivity and hence our output, we can \nexpect that the long term impact of this provision will prove \nbeneficial not just to workers and their families but to the nation's \neconomy as well.\n  Mr. President, many politicians stand up and complain about the \nproblem of the ``digital divide.'' The Ford Motor Company has actually \nfound a solution--a private sector solution--for its employees. The \nresponse of the government should be to thank Ford and encourage other \ncompanies to do what Ford has done--to take action that is in the best \ninterest of its workers, not just for today, but for the future as \nwell. But instead, the government response is to tax the recipients. I \nhope that other companies will follow Ford's example. By enacting this \nlegislation, we may be making it possible for the private sector to \nhelp solve the digital divide, and will at least be ensuring\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\nthat the government will not put the taxman in the way of the bridge-\nbuilders of the new economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/22/senate-section/article/S4239-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 534\n\n  At the request of Mr. Torricelli, the name of the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Durbin) was added as a cosponsor of S. 534, a bill to \nexpand the powers of the Secretary of the Treasury to regulate the \nmanufacture, distribution, and sale of firearms and ammunition, and to \nexpand the jurisdiction of the Secretary to include firearm products \nand nonpowder firearms.\n\n\n                                 S. 569\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin) was added as a cosponsor of S. 569, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude certain farm rental income \nfrom net earnings from self-employment if the taxpayer enters into a \nlease agreement relating to such income.\n\n\n                                S. 1495\n\n  At the request of Mr. Mack, the name of the Senator from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Santorum) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1495, a bill to \nestablish, wherever feasible, guidelines, recommendations, and \nregulations that promote the regulatory acceptance of new and revised \ntoxicological tests that protect human and animal health and the \nenvironment while reducing, refining, or replacing animal tests and \nensuring human safety and product effectiveness.\n\n\n                                S. 1909\n\n  At the request of Mr. Torricelli, the name of the Senator from New \nYork (Mr. Moynihan) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1909, a bill to \nprovide for the preparation of a Governmental report detailing \ninjustices suffered by Italian Americans during World War II, and a \nformal acknowledgement of such injustices by the President.\n\n\n                                S. 2084\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the name of the Senator from Iowa (Mr. \nHarkin) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2084, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the amount of the charitable \ndeduction allowable for contributions of food inventory, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2099\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reed, the names of the Senator from New Jersey \n(Mr. Lautenberg) and the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) were added \nas cosponsors of S. 2099, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to require the registration of handguns, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2274\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle), \nand the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 2274, a bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security \nAct to provide families and disabled children with the opportunity to \npurchase coverage under the medicaid program for such children.\n\n\n                                S. 2297\n\n  At the request of Mr. Crapo, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n(Ms. Landrieu) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2297, a bill to \nreauthorize the Water Resources Research Act of 1984.\n\n\n                                S. 2330\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roth, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2330, a bill \nto amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on \ntelephone and other communication services.\n\n\n                                S. 2419\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnson, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Reid) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2419, a bill to amend title \n38, United States Code, to provide for the annual determination of the \nrate of the basic benefit of active duty educational assistance under \nthe Montgomery GI Bill, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                            S.
