The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say to the acting majority leader, we do hope to \nfinish the bankruptcy bill this morning. As I have indicated, we have \nSenators Feingold and Levin coming over shortly after 11 o'clock. It \nwill take until 11 o'clock with what Senator Schumer has to work on.\n  I would also say that we want to make sure the record is clear; the \nleader was wondering about the vote that was originally scheduled on \nthe nuclear waste motion to proceed, whether or not that needed to go \nforward. I want the record to reflect that the Senators from Nevada \nwithdraw their objection and that the vote need not go forth.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have been informed by staff that we will work on that \nagreement, and it seems that can be accomplished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Schumer, is recognized to call up his amendments.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  First, I ask that the amendment be considered as read. It is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To which amendment is the Senator referring?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Amendment No. 2763. On the other amendment, I just \ninform my good friend from Iowa, we are trying to work out a compromise \nand we may not have to debate it--the one on the safe harbor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We think we can.\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So we now call up amendment No. 2763, and if we cannot \nwork out a compromise on the other, then I would reserve the right to \nbring it up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2763\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that debts incurred as a result of clinic violence \n                         are nondischargeable)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2763 is currently pending before \nthe Senate.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \n     Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 2763.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 124, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 322. NONDISCHARGEABILITY OF DEBTS INCURRED THROUGH THE \n                   COMMISSION OF VIOLENCE AT CLINICS.\n\n       Section 523(a) of title 11, United States Code, as amended \n     by section 224 of this Act, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (18), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (19)(B), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(20) that results from any judgment, order, consent \n     order, or decree entered in any Federal or State court, or \n     contained in any settlement agreement entered into by the \n     debtor, including any damages, fine, penalty, citation, or \n     attorney fee or cost owed by the debtor, arising from--\n       ``(A) an actual or potential action under section 248 of \n     title 18;\n       ``(B) an actual or potential action under any Federal, \n     State, or local law, the purpose of which is to protect--\n       ``(i) access to a health care facility, including a \n     facility providing reproductive health services, as defined \n     in section 248(e) of title 18 (referred to in this paragraph \n     as a `health care facility'); or\n       ``(ii) the provision of health services, including \n     reproductive health services (referred to in this paragraph \n     as `health services');\n       ``(C) an actual or potential action alleging the violation \n     of any Federal, State, or local statutory or common law, \n     including chapter 96 of title 18 and the Federal civil rights \n     laws (including sections 1977 through 1980 of the Revised \n     Statutes) that results from the debtor's actual, attempted, \n     or alleged--\n       ``(i) harassment of, intimidation of, interference with, \n     obstruction of, injury to, threat to, or violence against any \n     person--\n\n       ``(I) because that person provides or has provided health \n     services;\n       ``(II) because that person is or has been obtaining health \n     services; or\n       ``(III) to deter that person, any other person, or a class \n     of persons from obtaining or providing health services; or\n\n       ``(ii) damage or destruction of property of a health care \n     facility; or\n       ``(D) an actual or alleged violation of a court order or \n     injunction that protects access to a health care facility or \n     the provision of health services.''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nSnowe, Reid, Jeffords, and Kennedy be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment along with \nSenators Snowe and Reid, Jeffords, Feinstein, Leahy, Murray, Kennedy, \nLautenberg, and Durbin to ensure justice is served for those who \nwillfully and gleefully thumb their noses at clinic protection laws by \nfeigning bankruptcy. This amendment makes debts incurred as a result of \nacts of clinic violence nondischargeable under the bankruptcy code, and \nit does this clearly and unequivocally. In other words, this amendment \nwill hold the perpetrators of clinic violence responsible for the \ndamage they incur when they imperil, through either violence or \nintimidation, a woman's legal right to choose.\n  The history of this amendment goes back several years. Before 1994, a \nwoman's right to choose, guarded carefully by the Supreme Court, was \nimperiled. That is because a small and radical minority sought to \nintimidate, to harass, and ultimately commit violence against clinics \nthat offered women their right, their constitutional right for an \nabortion.\n  The chart tells the story. Acts of violence were way up, to 437. It \nreached its peak in 1993. Acts of disruption went to 3,379 and \nblockades, including arrests, went to 3,885. In many parts of this \ncountry a constitutional right--whether one agrees with it or not--was \nbeing prohibited by a very small minority who believed their view was \nmore important than our democratically chosen, American people chosen \nview.\n  As a result, this body, in a fine moment, gathered together and said \nthe rule of law must prevail whatever our views, pro-choice or pro-\nlife. I was sponsor of the FACE Act in the House. Senator Kennedy was \nthe sponsor of the FACE Act in the Senate. Very simply, it said this \nkind of violence and intimidation had to stop. The major tool it used \nwas to give these beleaguered clinics the right to sue those who \ncommitted violence.\n  It was a proud moment on the floor of this body when, with strong \nbipartisan support and strong support across pro-choice and pro-life \nlines, this amendment was agreed to, 69-30, in 1994. It was a proud \nmoment for me in the House when I joined with my friend, Congressman \nHenry Hyde--perhaps the leading voice of true conviction on the pro-\nlife side--to support this amendment. Congressman Hyde knew that \nAmerica depended on the rule of law.\n  The act had dramatic effects. If you look at the statistics, acts of \nviolence went down, from 437 in 1993 to 113 in 1998. Similarly, acts of \ndisruption went down, from 3,379 down to 2,600. The law was working. \nBut, unfortunately, that extreme few has found a new way to avoid the \nlaw and threaten the kind of stasis, the kind of peace, the kind of \ncoming together we had found in this body. What they have done is, when \nthey get a judgment against the type of violence depicted here, they \ndeclare bankruptcy and the law cannot be enforced against them.\n  Randal Terry has $1.6 million in judgments against him. So far not a \nnickel has been collected. Flip Benham brags he will never pay a cent.\n  Perhaps the most extreme is the case of the Nuremberg Files, which \nhas, today, its 1-year anniversary of a jury verdict of $109 million \nagainst those who put it together. The Nuremberg Files was a group of \nextremists. They published the names of doctors and accused them of \nmurder. They published the addresses where their children went to \nschool. Their graphic on the computer had blood dripping from the \npictures of the doctors. They published the name of Dr. Slepian, who \nwas murdered, and after a doctor was injured they put the name in gray. \nAfter a doctor was killed, as in Dr. Slepian's case, from my State of \nNew York, up in Buffalo, they put an X through the name.\n\n  Because of their activities, because of the ``wanted'' posters, where \nthree doctors were killed once they put out ``wanted'' posters, a \nFederal court in Oregon urged the judgment against them. That judgment, \nthe jury verdict, was 1 year ago today.\n  What did the defendants in that case do? The judge knew they would \ntry to clean themselves of their assets and divest them. So the judge \nordered them not to divest themselves of their assets. In each case, 2 \nor 3 days before they were to come to the court for a disposition of \nhow they were going to pay their fine, they went back to their home \nStates and declared bankruptcy. This horrible, horrible situation was \ncompounded by the use of a bankruptcy law that no one in this body or \nanywhere else intended to be for that purpose.\n  This is what the attorney for the defendants in the Nuremberg Files \ncase said:\n\n       The jury charge in this case created a negligence standard \n     for threats. The charge on punitive damages embraces reckless \n     or malicious conduct and my understanding is that reckless \n     conduct does not preclude a discharge in bankruptcy.\n\n  Anyone who says our present laws cover this horrible situation and \nthe many others like it ought to listen to the very lawyer in the \nNuremberg Files case.\n  So no money has been collected, not only from the Nuremberg Files \ndefendants but from all the others who are laughing at our law. They \nhave gone back to their States and now the whole issue will be \nlitigated again. Because we do not have a law, they will debate again \nwhether the conduct was reckless--which is what the lawyers claim the \njury verdict called for--or whether it was violent, in which case it \nwould be covered by present law.\n  So the reason we are here today, the reason this vote has been so \ncontested, is because a major tenet of our democracy is at stake--the \nrule of law. We talked about the rule of law last year at this time in \nthis Chamber. If there was ever a case that cried out for\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nDemocrats and Republicans coming together, for pro-choice and pro-life \npeople coming together, it is this very case.\n  Let me answer a few questions that have been brought up about this \namendment. First, is this a move by the pro-choice movement to move the \ngoalposts? Absolutely not. My lead cosponsor on the Democratic side, \nSenator Reid, is probably the foremost advocate on the pro-life side on \nour side. I respect his view. Henry Hyde supported the FACE law. Others \nwho disagree with my view on choice have also come to support FACE and \nthe amendment. It is not pro-life or pro-choice, it is pro rule of law. \nIt is pro-American.\n  Second, some say it is already covered by the willful and malicious \nexception in the bankruptcy law. It is true that if there is a willful, \nintentional, malicious tort, it might be covered by the bankruptcy law. \nBut it would have to go to each bankruptcy court, as in the Nuremberg \nFiles case, after the judgment. Without our statute, it would have to \ngo back to each bankruptcy court in the State and be litigated. Then \nthere would be one determination or another.\n  But what about these types of cases? What about situations where \nthere is reckless conduct but not malicious conduct? The lawyer in the \nNuremberg Files matter--clearly conduct we wish to prohibit--said it \nwas reckless, not malicious, and would not be covered by the exception \nin the bankruptcy law.\n  What about the case where there is no intent? Thousands come and \nblockade a clinic but they say: My intent was not to create any \nviolence. Then you would have to prove, for each one of those \ndefendants, their own intent, a next to impossible job.\n  What about contempt orders? Everyone agrees that contempt orders are \nnot covered by the exception.\n  So for anyone to argue the present law covers this, I say two things \nto you: No, it does not. And if you believe it does, there is no reason \nnot to make sure that it does by passing our amendment.\n  How about some from the other side who argue bankruptcy should not be \nused to promote public policy? We are not promoting public policy. In \nfact, it is those who have declared bankruptcy after committing \nterrible acts who are seeking to use the bankruptcy code for public \npolicy goals. The bankruptcy code was never intended that way. What we \nare doing by this amendment is protecting the bankruptcy code from \nthose who seek to twist it and turn it and use it for their goals in \npublic policy. In fact, we have done it before in this Chamber. We did \nit, with almost unanimous support, for drunken drivers. There is an \nexception in the code for that. It is a horrible thing--so is this.\n  I argue one more thing to my colleagues. This is the first time we \nhave had an organized movement in America that seeks to use the \nbankruptcy code for these purposes. They tell people how to declare \nbankruptcy. One of the major organizations says you have to be judgment \nproof before you can join it. I have never seen that before in this \ncountry--I don't think anyone has--where an organized group seeks to \nsubvert the law and then tells its members you can avoid its \nconsequences by declaring bankruptcy.\n  One final question. I do not know if my colleagues from the other \nside will have an amendment similar to this. The Senator from Iowa is \nshaking his head no. But we have not seen one so far, and the amendment \ncan only argue one of two things.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I just don't know.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. He doesn't know. I appreciate my friend's candor, \nalthough we have been debating this. This amendment came up in the \nJudiciary Committee in October or November and we do not know. But I \nargue to my colleagues, whatever you think of the other amendment, if \nit covers this it cannot hurt to have this one. If it does not cover \nit, we need it.\n  I do not have any predisposition, having not seen the amendment, \nwhether you vote for or against an alternative. But voting for or \nagainst that alternative will not solve the problem. Voting yes or no \non this amendment will.\n  In conclusion, this amendment and this debate--on its surface about \nsomewhat arcane provisions in the bankruptcy law--is what America is \nall about. We have always had people with deeply felt views. The bishop \nin my community every month says the Rosary in front of an abortion \nclinic.\n  I disagree with his views. Bishop Daily is a fine man. I would defend \nhis right to do that. I would vote for legislation that would allow him \nto do that.\n  We have always had people in America of strongly held views, but \nevery so often we have people whose views not only are strongly held \nbut who believe because they believe it, they should subvert the will \nof the American people, they should take the law into their own hands.\n  This happened shortly after the founding of the Republic. It happened \nthroughout the 19th century. It happened throughout the 20th century. \nEvery time that has happened, the Members of this distinguished body \nhave risen and said we must defend the rule of law because nothing is \nmore sacred to America.\n  People have uttered courageous speeches on the floor of this Chamber \nabout that, even if they did not agree with the specific view. This is \none such moment.\n  The vote is close. It is neck and neck. The Vice President has \ngraciously agreed to interrupt his schedule to be here because the vote \nis so close and because this bill and this amendment is so important.\n  I urge my colleagues to look into your hearts and souls. You walk \nwith America. We do it every day in this Chamber. Do not turn your back \non what you know is right. Do not turn your back on the rule of law. Do \nnot turn your back on what our Founding Fathers shed blood for, which \nis the right of a democracy to make its own decisions and not have a \nsmall band of people, for whatever reason, take decisions into their \nown hands.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume. I hope my friend, Senator Hatch, will debate the fine points \nof the law with the Senator from New York because I am not a lawyer. I \nhave strong feelings on the issue of abortion which do not have to be \nexpressed today. My friend, the Senator from New York, has opposite \nviews on that issue and he has not expressed them and does not have to \nexpress them as far as this amendment is concerned. I oppose this \namendment simply because it is not needed.\n  First, I will comment on the possibility of the Vice President of the \nUnited States having to vote today to break a tie. I predict that if \nthe Vice President is in town and this vote is that close, the Vice \nPresident will be here and will have an opportunity to cast that vote. \nIf the Vice President is in town to break a tie, there is going to be \nat least one person who supports that amendment who is going to vote \nagainst it just so we can have a tie vote, just so the President can \ncast his vote because the Vice President running for President of the \nUnited States is not going to break into his schedule with the tight \nvote he had in New Hampshire last night and avoid campaigning in the \nother States and waste his time here if he does not actually have to \ncast that vote.\n  We are in for not only political moments on this issue, but we are in \nfor some very constitutional moments on this issue as well.\n  I like the theater that is going on this morning. We have seen it at \nleast once before, and we may see it several times between now and \nNovember. I do not blame the people on the other side for creating this \ntheater because I think the Vice  President is going to need it between \nnow and the November election if he intends to be elected President of \nthe United States.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from Iowa yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Of course, I will yield. I know what you are going to \nsay--that everything I have said is not true. I have seen it happen \nbefore.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me explain to the Senator from Iowa what happened, \nand I realize he has not intended to cast stones.\n  I have been lobbying Members on this vote for the last several weeks. \nAs the Senator knows, this amendment held up the bankruptcy bill from \nbeing voted on last year because many of us felt so strongly about it.\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\n  As of yesterday, it looked as if the vote was dead even. That is the \ncount we have. Last night, I called the Vice President and said: It \nlooks dead even. You make a decision, but it is an important issue to \nus. And he determined to come back. It has nothing to do with theater. \nIt has nothing to do with, frankly, the politics of this campaign. It \nhas to do with the fact that so many of us consider the FACE law--both \npro-life and pro-choice--so important that we could not bear to see it \nundermined, particularly if it lost by a very narrow margin.\n  I do not know what the vote will be. I do not know what kind of arm \ntwisting will go on between now and then. I do know there has been \ndramatic resistance to this amendment which held up a bill that large \nnumbers of people on both sides of the aisle wanted very much to have \ncome to the floor last year, and I think the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Iowa do not fit the facts in this situation regarding the Vice \nPresident.\n  I thank him for the graciousness of yielding.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I proceed, I presume the Senator \nfrom New York is willing to have the time for his remarks come out of \nhis time and not out of my time. I hope he will agree to that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that each side be given an \nadditional 10 minutes because this is an important amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent we each be given an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I still want the time to come out of his side.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will accept that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And it will be charged.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I give the Senator from New York and all the other \npeople on the other side of the aisle the benefit of the doubt, but as \na matter of constitutional fact, there is always some theater when the \nVice President has to cast a tie-breaking vote. Also, there is some \njustification for what I said, not based upon what I know is going to \nhappen this time but what I have seen happen in the past.\n  The other thing I want to tell the Senator from New York, regardless \nof what I said about the theater, I want to base my remarks upon what I \nthink is unneeded legislation. This gets to some of the finer points of \nlaw that I am not going to argue and debate with the Senator from New \nYork because he would say under certain circumstances, because of \nintent or because of court orders, the necessity to go back to State \ncourts, his amendment  will enhance the protection of people about whom \nhe is concerned. Those are not serious considerations. His amendment is \nnot needed.\n\n  First of all, it is very necessary to say, and I hope the Senator \nfrom New York will not take offense with this, that we would not even \nbe debating this amendment or anything with bankruptcy if he had his \nway because he was one of those who voted against the bankruptcy \nlegislation. I do not fault the Senator from New York for doing that. \nThat is, obviously, his right.\n  He can say he wants bankruptcy legislation and he voted against it \nbecause this amendment was not included or maybe he is against \nbankruptcy generally, but the fact is that he voted against the \nbankruptcy reform bill we have before us.\n  People who generally do not want a bankruptcy reform bill have \nproposed some pretty politically sensitive amendments--and this is one \nof them--that are basically a distraction from the real issue of why we \nneed bankruptcy reform. I do not need to repeat what I said yesterday, \nsuch as we have had a 100-percent increase in personal bankruptcies \nover the last 7 or 8 years. From that standpoint, we have a very \nserious social and economic problem with which we have to deal, and \nparticularly the way the present bankruptcy code is written, the \namendment is not needed. I want to state why it is not needed because \nmy colleagues are entitled to know.\n  I hope a lot of the people in this Chamber who want a bankruptcy \nreform bill will view this amendment in its proper context of being \nproposed as a distraction from the real issues of bankruptcy reform, \nparticularly since I am going to convince them that this amendment is \nnot needed based upon the way the present law is written.\n  But putting aside the obvious political nature of the amendment, this \namendment should fail on its merits. The amendment would make judgments \nresulting from violent as well as nonviolent activities engaged in by \npro-life activists nondischargeable in chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n  The amendment does not provide for the same treatment for violent or \nnonviolent activities engaged in by pro-choice activists. In other \nwords, this amendment does not even pretend to be fair and balanced. It \nis an effort aimed only at one side of this very hot political debate \nthat is known as the abortion debate. I do not think the Senate should \nchange bankruptcy policy in such a one-sided way.\n  But the amendment does not even accomplish its one-sided goal. The \namendment only affects chapter 7 bankruptcy. So I want to give you a \nsecond reason for being against it, based upon the fact that it fails \non its own merits. Since it only affects chapter 7 bankruptcy, there is \nanother way that people who are affected by this amendment, who want to \ngo into bankruptcy to protect themselves, can do it. They can do that \nthrough chapter 13 because the amendment does not make any new debts \nnondischargeable in chapter 13. So any of the people to whom the \nSenator from New York refers to that his amendment is necessary for \ncould file under chapter 13, pay pennies on the dollar, and walk away \nfrom debt.\n  As I said when I voted on this amendment in the Judiciary Committee, \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has concluded that court \njudgments resulting from violations of the FACE Act are already \nnondischargeable in chapter 7 under politically neutral provisions of \nsection 523 of the code. This amendment, the Congressional Research \nService says, isn't needed.\n  Finally, it is worth noting that some Senators on the Democratic side \nhave been very critical of making new categories of nondischargeable \ndebts. If you listen to the White House--and we have listened to the \nWhite House quite a bit on this bill and have tried to satisfy people \nby making changes in it that have not hurt our general approach--if you \nlisten to these same people, who have been listened to by me and other \npeople in this body who want bankruptcy reform, you hear that anytime \nyou create nondischargeable debts, the collection of child support \nsuffers. I will bet the Senator from New York has made this same point \non other nondischargeable debts concerning child support.\n  Some of those concerns have been very legitimate. We have responded \nto them. I guess I would have to say, from where I started 2 years ago \non this legislation, I have been educated on some of the writing of our \noriginal bill to make those changes so that we make child support No. 1 \nin our considerations in bankruptcy courts.\n  But the White House, regardless, is saying nondischargeable debts \nmake collection of child support much more difficult. But here we have \nan amendment from the minority to create a nondischargeable debt. So \nbased on the arguments of the White House, this amendment should be \nrejected because it hurts child support claimants.\n  This is a very serious inconsistency on the part of people, \nparticularly on the other side of the aisle, in proposing this \namendment. The fact is, bankruptcy reform is so popular with the \nAmerican people, so popular with Members of the Senate, that those who \noppose real bankruptcy reform look for distractions, distractions based \non the merits of their amendment, based on their opposition to the \nlegislation, but also a needless distraction.\n\n  If, in their good conscience, they believe their amendment is needed, \nit in fact isn't needed because our bankruptcy code already deals, in a \nnonpolitical way, with these political questions that people believe \ncan only be responded to by making one more thing nondischargeable.\n  This amendment is, on balance, a distraction and should fail for the \nreason it was offered. But, most importantly, it should fail on its \nmerits. The merits just do not call for its adoption. I have expressed \nmy views on that.\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\n  I yield the floor and ask our people to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from the \nState of Washington, a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me assure my colleagues, this issue \nis not about theater. It is about the very real issue of violence \nagainst women. I join with my colleague, the Senator from New York, and \nthank him for his work on this amendment and urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  This amendment is not about abortion. This amendment is about \nviolence against women. We cannot allow violent extremists to use the \nbankruptcy code to carry out their agenda of violence.\n  If anyone thinks this is simply another abortion or choice issue, let \nme point out to all of you, there are groups and individuals who teach \nviolent protesters how to protect their financial assets in the event \nof a civil or criminal penalty. There are classes one can take or \npamphlets one can read spelling out how violent protesters can get \naround any punitive financial damage by simply running to bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  It is simply beyond comprehension how we can allow those convicted of \nviolence and intimidation to be excused from punitive financial \npenalties. If we are serious about reducing violence and sending the \nright message to our children, we must support the Schumer amendment.\n  In 1998, there were two murders and one attempted murder of clinic \nworkers. Since 1990, abortion clinic arson and bombings have resulted \nin over $8.5 million in damages. Two bombs were recently discovered at \nclinics in Kentucky and Ohio. Every day, women are harassed and \nintimidated as they seek proper health care services. This violence \nmust stop, and those responsible must be held accountable.\n  Passage of the Schumer amendment will send the message that violence \nwill not be tolerated. Peaceful protests will continue. Each individual \nhas a right to freely express their views and their opinions. But no \none has a right to carry out a campaign of fear and violence.\n  For too many women, these clinics are their only access to health \ncare, including cancer screening and prenatal care. Constant and \nviolent threats diminish access to health care for hundreds of women \nand subject them to unreasonable abuse and intimidation. Do not reward \nthose who seek to deny women access to legal, affordable health care \nservices.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and support \nthe Schumer amendment.\n  I yield back my time to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, bankruptcy law already covers willful, \nmalicious, intentional conduct about which the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington has been talking.\n  I rise to speak in opposition to this amendment offered by the \nSenator from New York. Nobody in this body condones violence of any \nkind. There is no excuse for it; that is, whether it is committed at an \nabortion clinic, whether it is committed by labor unions, or whether it \nis committed against churches, or for any other reason. But this \namendment has nothing legitimate to do with bankruptcy reform. In my \nview, we should focus on our task of providing real bankruptcy relief \nfor the American people.\n  This amendment is unnecessary. It provides that debts and liabilities \narising from abortion clinic violence would not be dischargeable in \nbankruptcy. There simply is no need to place damages regarding access \nto abortions in a special class with special protections above other \ndamages for other actions, including, for example, actions under civil \nrights laws. Not only is it poor policy to segregate certain classes of \nviolence for special status in bankruptcy, but the bankruptcy code \nalready allows for the nondischargeability of debts for ``willful and \nmalicious injury by the debtor.'' This is already taken care of, if \nthat is what the Senator is really concerned about, willful and \nmalicious injury caused by the debtor. Indeed, I asked to include a \nsummary of a recent case in the Record.\n  In that case, the Behn case, it is said, in a newspaper report of \nthat case:\n\n       A veteran anti-abortion protester cannot use bankruptcy to \n     erase a debt of more than $50,000 in court-imposed fines, \n     legal fees and interest she owes a Buffalo clinic that \n     performs abortions, a federal judge has ruled.\n       ``If anyone thought they might escape penalties for \n     violating a judge's order through bankruptcy,'' said Glenn E. \n     Murray, a lawyer who represented the clinic, ``they should \n     read this decision.''\n\n  Already the law takes care of what the distinguished Senator from New \nYork would like to have taken care of.\n  Notwithstanding that this amendment is entitled ``Nondischargeability \nof Debts Incurred Through the Commission of Violence at Clinics,'' its \nreach extends much more broadly. That is where the danger comes in.\n  For example, the amendment, by its own terms, is not limited to acts \nof violence, as the title would lead us to believe, but covers acts of \n``interference with'' a person seeking an abortion, whatever that \nmeans. In addition, the amendment refers to ``an actual or potential \naction under any Federal, State, or local law'' having to do with \nproviding abortions.\n  As I read this language, it goes far beyond the discrete issue of \nviolence at abortion clinics. In fact, if you read this language in the \nactual amendment, it has some very strange language in it. It says, in \nparagraph (3)(C):\n\n     an actual or potential action alleging the violation of any \n     Federal, State, or local statutory or common law, including \n     chapter 96 of title 18 and the Federal civil rights laws \n     (including sections 1977 through 1980 of the Revised \n     Statutes) that results from the debtor's actual, attempted, \n     or alleged--(i) harassment of, intimidation of, interference \n     with, obstruction of . . .\n\n  Then it gets into injury to, threat to, or violence against any \nperson. Look at that language: harassment, intimidation, interference. \nMy goodness.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to read the actual text of the amendment before \nthey vote. If they believe they are voting on an amendment that \nstrictly covers acts of violence at abortion clinics, they are \nmistaken. Who knows how this amendment is going to be applied \notherwise. The bankruptcy law already takes care of violence, abortion \nclinic violence, if you will. It does not discharge that in bankruptcy. \nThe cases so state. I do not think we should fail to recognize that the \nbankruptcy code already provides or allows for the nondischargeability \nof debts ``for willful and malicious injury by the debtor.''\n  This goes far beyond real injury. This actually could be used to \noppress people who legitimately feel otherwise than the abortion clinic \ndoes. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. At the appropriate \ntime, I am sure the distinguished Senator from Iowa or myself will move \nto table the amendment. I hope we can reject this amendment. I hope it \nis not necessary for the Vice President to come and break a tie vote on \nthis matter. I think this would be catastrophic language in the \nbankruptcy code, which already does take care of violence at abortion \nclinics. Case law so states.\n  This is just another overreach by those who want to make a political \nissue out of something that does not deserve to be in the bankruptcy \ncode, although I believe it is a sincere overreach that perhaps is not \nconsidered such by my dear friend from New York, for whom I have a lot \nof esteem in the law. I am concerned about this kind of language. It is \nvery broad, very undefined. No question that it goes far beyond actual \ninjury, far beyond malicious conduct, far beyond willful and malicious \ninjury that the bankruptcy code already covers. We have enough in the \ncode to take care of problems at abortion clinics without putting in \nharassment, intimidation, interference, and obstruction into the \nbankruptcy code.\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, cosponsor of this amendment and one of its \nleaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the statement of the \nSenator from Iowa where he tried to indicate that the Vice President \nwas coming here because of some problem in the campaign. I direct the \nattention of the Senator from Iowa to what really took place in New \nHampshire last night. As every political pundit in America has stated, \nDemocrat and Republican, those who are neutral, Bush was bushwhacked in \nNew Hampshire. That is the real problem. I appreciate the Senator's \nattempt to divert attention from the fact that there really was a \nproblem in New Hampshire for Governor Bush.\n  In the year 1215, in a meadow in England, a group of barons were with \nKing John. King John couldn't sign his name, but he did affix his \ncross, his X, to a document that we now call the Magna Carta. The \nreason that was so important in our history is because it was the \nbeginning of common law. It was the beginning of the rule of law that \nwe adopted when we became a nation. We followed the English common law \nwhich started with Runnymeade and the Magna Carta. It established the \nrule of law, not a rule of kings, not a rule of demagogues, not a rule \nof zealots but a rule where we follow the law.\n  That is what this debate is about today. There are a group of people \nin America today who recognize there is a law, but they are above it. \nThey don't have to follow it. They can go and use butyric acid, fire, \nbullets, guns, causing murder, disruption of businesses. They can, of \ncourse, cause all these blockades, and people who disagree have said \nwhat you are doing is wrong. You are avoiding the law, and we are going \nto take you to court and have a court of law determine that you are \nwrong, and you are going to have to respond in money damages for the \nviolence and the disruption in business and the damage that you have \ncaused. They have gone to court and they have won those lawsuits. They \nhave had money judgments rendered against them. These people who caused \nthis disruption of business, who threw this acid in people's faces in \nclinics, who set fires, who murdered people, they say we are above the \nlaw; we don't have to follow it because we disagree with the law.\n\n  We are a country that has a rule of law. These people should not be \nable to discharge these debts in bankruptcy. That is what this \namendment is all about.\n  We recognize that violence and terror are worsening every day in this \nworld, and we have to stop it. This is one method of stopping it. One \nof the reasons these people flout the law is they say don't have to \nfollow the law.\n  Mr. President, these people intimidate. They recognize that they do \nnot have to be held accountable. Today, what we are saying is we must \nact to ensure that we live in a law-abiding society. This amendment \ndoes that by saying that those who have a judgment rendered against \nthem in a court of law, where the court has determined that they \nengaged in unlawful acts of intimidation and violence, can't escape \nresponsibility for their actions in bankruptcy court.\n  I believe in our system of justice, where courts and juries make \ndecisions that we as the American public must follow. Some people don't \nbelieve in our system of justice; they don't believe in our system of \ntrial by jury and court determinations. They believe money damages \nawarded against them mean nothing because they are going to discharge \nthem in bankruptcy. In effect, they believe the law is for everybody \nelse but them. We think that is wrong and that is why we should have an \noverwhelming vote in the Senate. The Vice President, even though he is \ngoing to be here, should not have to break a tie. People of good \nconscience on both sides of the aisle should vote in favor of this \namendment. It is the right thing to do because it upholds the rule of \nlaw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, look, let's not get this amendment mixed \nup. The current law takes care of actual injury. It takes care of \nmalicious injury and willful injury by the debtor. That is not \ndischarged in bankruptcy. So it has nothing to do with violence. The \ncurrent law takes care of that.\n  None of us condone violence. That is not what this amendment is \nabout. Look at the doggone language of this amendment. It is \nunbelievable. What it says here is, ``an actual or potential action \nalleging the violation of any Federal, State, or local statutory or \ncommon law'' and ``that results from the debtor's actual, attempted, or \nalleged harassment. . .''\n  What does that mean? ``Intimidation of. . .'' What does that mean? If \nsomebody says ``boo,'' are they intimidating and they could not be \ndischarged in bankruptcy, in an unjust case in bankruptcy where they \nhaven't caused any harm or willful malicious injury? Interference with? \nObstruction of? This is an overreach if there ever was one, since we \nalready have bankruptcy law that provides nondischargeability of debts \nof a debtor who has caused willful or malicious injury to another \nperson, or even to the clinic, I suppose. We should not get into a type \nof social engineering in the bankruptcy code since we already take care \nof willful and malicious activities. When you start talking about \nharassment, intimidation, obstruction, interference--these are words \nthat can be used in a criminal code, but they should not be used in the \nbankruptcy code which already provides for willful, malicious injury by \nthe debtor as nondischargeable in bankruptcy. I think when we get into \nthat stuff we are getting into areas that basically disrupt the code \nand should not be part of the code.\n\n  None of us tolerate or approve of violence at the abortion clinics. \nSome of these anti-abortion people who have committed violence should \nbe punished to the full extent of the law. They should not be allowed \nto get away with it. Whichever side you are on in this issue ought to \nbe a side of debate and a side of honest debate, not a side of \nviolence. But we take care of willful and malicious injury, which may \nnot even be violence. It may be something that even involves \nnegligence, I suppose. We take care of it in the current code.\n  Why should we amend the code just because some would like to do so \nwith this strange and very undefined language. Plus, it is something \nthat everybody ought to think about--improper and illegal, or should I \nsay nonlegal, to argue that this amendment is all about violence. It is \nnot at all. It is about extending what is already covered to areas that \nliterally do not involve violence or malicious injury or willful and \nviolent and malicious conduct. That is not what the bankruptcy code \nshould be all about. I hope our colleagues will vote this amendment \ndown.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I greatly respect my friend from Utah, who is a fine \nlegislator and a fine human being. He is just dead wrong on this. Let \nme just answer this. He said we don't need this law, first, because the \npresent code covers it. CRS, which is hardly known as either a pro-life \nor a pro-choice organization, is respected for their analysis and they \nsay in a memorandum of June 8:\n\n       We conclude, for the reasons discussed below, that the \n     Schumer proposal, which would add a new subsection 19 to \n     523(a), is far broader in scope and would encompass a far \n     wider range of potential debtor liability than is currently \n     covered by 523(a)(6).\n\n  Don't rely on Senator Hatch, don't rely on Senator Schumer, but on \n523. One other point. The Senator from Utah says everything is covered. \nLet's hear what the attorney said in that Nuremberg Files case, that \nhorrible and devastating case--so bad that a jury in Oregon awarded \n$109 million in damages, realizing what has happened in America in \nterms of the death of doctors. Here is what the lawyer said:\n\n       Your clients are nothing more than nonpriority, unsecured \n     judgment creditors, with other judgment creditors ahead of \n     them . . . even a car loan has priority over your judgment.\n\n  Let me repeat that so maybe my friend from Utah can hear me in the\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\nCloakroom: ``. . . even a car loan has priority over your judgment.''\n  Is that what we wanted in the present law? No, absolutely not. The \nrecord is clear. There are certain instances where the present law \nwould cover it--narrow instances, and even in those cases, you would \nhave to go all the way back to bankruptcy court and relitigate. But in \nmany of these cases, the law is not clear, and in every one of these \ncases, you make them litigate two, three, four times. We know what the \npolicy of these violent extremists is. It is to delay and delay and \ndelay. They should not be allowed to use the bankruptcy code to do \nthat.\n  One other point. I think my good friend from Iowa said, well, it \ndoesn't stop violence. That might be done by pro-choice groups. Not so. \nIf a pro-choice group were to decide to blockade a clinic, or threaten \na doctor, or use violence because they did not like what that clinic \nwas doing, they would be equally subject to the law.\n\n  The reason that statement is so absurd is because we don't have a \ngrand movement on the pro-choice side seeking to use violence. Read the \nworks of Randal Terry and Flip Benham and everybody else. They believe \nbecause they are morally superior to the rest of us that they have the \nright to take the law into their own hands and use violence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 3 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Iowa has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have a speaker on his way. Senator \nSessions wants to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering. Senator Leahy, the ranking \nmember of the committee, could speak. Until everyone is ready, why \ndon't we suggest the absence of a quorum so the time is reserved. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time \nnot be charged to the respective sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, given we don't \nhave any other business scheduled until 11 o'clock--we have other \nMembers coming from both sides who wish to speak--that each side be \ngiven an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object to that. Let's wait until we use our time and \nmake that decision at that particular time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is observed. The absence of a quorum \nhas been suggested, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from New York yield 2 \nminutes?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, who has been a guiding \ninspiration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I very proudly cosponsored the amendment of \nthe Senator from New York. Senator Schumer's amendment on debts \nincurred through the commission of violence to health service clinics \nis a good one. It closes a real-life loophole in our bankruptcy code \nbecause some people are using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying debts \narising from clinic violence.\n  That is a dangerous precedent that Congress should stop. It would be \nthe same if somebody was doing this using the bankruptcy laws to escape \npaying bills for violence against anybody, whether groups with which I \nagree or groups with which I disagree.\n  We should not use the bankruptcy laws for this. It is wrong to allow \ncourt judgments under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act to \nbe discharged under our bankruptcy laws. In fact, 12 individuals who \ncreated the Nuremberg Files web site filed bankruptcy to avoid their \ndebts under the law.\n  If I could make a personal note on this, at a time when a doctor was \nmurdered in New York because his name was on the Nuremberg Files, \nwithin days they determined that the chief suspect was a man from \nVermont. I went to the Nuremberg Files. My name was listed among those \nto be shot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Vermont has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for another 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This was a very chilling thing for both me and my family. \nTo think somebody could use laws to escape any penalties they might \nreceive under their use of our bankruptcy laws is wrong.\n  I agree with the Senator from New York.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, it will be charged equally between the two \nsides.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, might I renew the request of Senator Reid \nthat we have a quorum call not to be counted against either side until \nSenator Sessions can get here? Is there a way?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have done it that way already.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. I sure wasn't in on the request.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I might answer the question--Mr. President, may I \nrespond to Senator Reid's question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from New York suggesting the \nabsence of a quorum without the time being charged to either side?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I discussed this with the Senator from \nIowa, and he has graciously agreed to 1\\1/2\\ additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Then all time will have expired. Is that right? OK.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We will take care of ours. We will yield it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I say in conclusion to my colleagues that \nthis is an extremely important amendment to keep a bipartisan law, the \nFACE law, alive and well. If we don't pass this amendment, there will \nbe hundreds and hundreds of instances where people perpetrate violence, \nand violate the FACE law, and they will not be held accountable.\n  Let me repeat again what the Nuremberg Files people, who list Members \nof this body as people who ought to be looked at, say:\n\n       The judgment in this case, in my view, is not only . . . \n     non-priority unsecured debt but fully dischargeable debt.\n       Even a car loan has priority over your judgment.\n\n  That makes a mockery of the rule of law in this country. This is not \na pro-choice or a pro-life law. This is the law that says those who \nseek violence, threat, and intimidation against legal clinics in \nAmerica because they somehow feel they have a moral superiority to \nevery one of us will be punished for their actions.\n  It is a desperately needed proposal. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, clinics that provide family planning \nservices and counseling as well as abortions are engaged in an honest, \nlaw-abiding activity. These services enable women to exercise their \nright to make reasoned and informed decisions about their reproductive \nfutures. Yet, given the escalating culture of violence surrounding \nthese clinics, abortion providers and clinic workers risk their lives \ncoming to work each day.\n  In my own state of Rhode Island, I have heard troubling reports of \nclinic violence from people such as Pablo Rodriguez M.D., medical \ndirector of Planned Parenthood Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\n  Although Congress has made strides to stem clinic violence by passing \nthe Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE), this statute has \nnot been a panacea. While FACE empowered those victimized by clinic \nviolence to sue, many plaintiffs found liable in civil court for clinic \nviolence seek refuge under our nation's bankruptcy law to avoid paying \nthe financial penalties levied against them.\n  Providing women's health services is legal; clinic violence is not. I \nbelieve we must do anything we can to discourage these horrible acts of \nviolence. Senator Schumer's amendment closes a loophole that allows \nperpetrators of clinic violence to escape the consequences of their \nactions.\n  The bankruptcy code was intended to provide a fresh start for honest \ndebtors, not those who have violated the law and endangered innocent \nlives. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Senator \nSchumer's amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the 10 minutes set \naside for the Harkin amendment be given to Senator Kennedy to speak on \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Following the statement by Senator Kennedy, the amendment \nwill be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Harkin amendment is not pending.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the amendment that is now pending \nbe set aside and the Harkin amendment be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For 10 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, and following the statement by Senator Kennedy, the \namendment be withdrawn. And, of course it goes without saying, the time \nof the majority would be reserved, not be taken as a result of this \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2770\n\n (Purpose: Invalidating hidden security interests on nearly valueless \n                            household liens)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2770.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leaders.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be recognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Senate completes its work on the \nbankruptcy bill, we are more aware than ever of the potential impact of \nthis legislation on American citizens and businesses.\n  This legislation purports to reform the bankruptcy system and \neliminate debtor abuses, and the banking and credit card industries \nhave been urging action on it for the past two years. They argue that \nduring this time of economic expansion, Congress should deal with the \nincrease in bankruptcy filings by curtailing pervasive debtor fraud. If \nCongress doesn't act, they say, the economy will suffer.\n  But the industry's cure is worse than the disease. First, they fail \nto acknowledge a key fact--the steady decline in bankruptcy filings. \nWithout any action by Congress, the number of bankruptcy filings is \ngoing down. Filings have dropped in 42 states. Overall, there were \n112,000 fewer personal bankruptcies in 1999 than in 1998--the largest \none-year drop on record.\n  Leading economists believe that the bankruptcy crisis is self-\ncorrecting. The significant drop in filing is ample indication that a \nharsh bankruptcy bill is not needed.\n  It is abundantly clear that the bill before us is unnecessarily \nharsh. As House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde acknowledged, \nit contains dozens of provisions that favor creditors, and it fails to \naddress the serious problems that often force citizens into bankruptcy.\n  The bill will make it more difficult for thousands of debtors who \nfile for bankruptcy because of the layoffs and corporate downsizing \nthat take place after mergers, and that are ordered by businesses to \nimprove profits.\n  This bill also makes it more difficult for families already torn \napart by divorce--particularly divorced women, who are four times more \nlikely to file for bankruptcy than married women or single men.\n  The bill would also have a devastating effect on the millions of \nAmericans who have no health insurance or substandard coverage. For \nalmost 20 percent of those filing for bankruptcy protection, a health-\nrelated problem led to their economic problems.\n  Earlier in the debate we took the time of the Senate to go through \neach of those categories, the numbers of people who went into \nbankruptcy as a result of the mergers and downsizing of major companies \nand corporations. These are American men and women who have worked hard \nall of their lives and through no fault of their own were put in very \ndifficult economic straits and run into bankruptcy.\n  Because of the escalation of divorce, large numbers of single women \nare particularly vulnerable, because of their credit situation, to run \ninto problems with bankruptcy. We have seen with the decline of health \ncare coverage, particularly among older workers in their fifties, \nbefore they are eligible for Medicare, they have been the increasing \ntargets of bankruptcy. These are groups of Americans who have been \nhard-working all of their lives and now are going to be caught up in \nthis particular legislation which I think is particularly harsh on \nthese individuals, and needlessly so.\n  In addition, this bill fails to significantly address the serious \nproblems created by the credit card industry. In an average month, 7 \npercent of all households in the country receive a credit card \nsolicitation. In recent years, the credit card industry has also begun \nto offer new lines of credit targeted at people with low incomes--\npeople they know cannot afford to pile up credit card debt.\n  Facts such as these have reduced the economic stability of millions \nof families, and have led many of them to file for bankruptcy. Two out \nof every three bankruptcy filers have an employment problem. One out of \nevery five has a health-care problem. Divorced or separated people are \nthree times more likely than married couples to file for bankruptcy. \nWorking men and women in economic free fall often have no choice except \nbankruptcy.\n  Although the Senate spent two weeks debating and amending the \nbankruptcy\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\nbill last year and several additional days this year, this bill still \ndoes not acknowledge the problems that force so many Americans into \nbankruptcy. It remains heavily tilted toward the financial services \nindustry, and many needed amendments were defeated.\n  Simultaneously, amendments were adopted that should be an \nembarrassment to the Senate. By a one-vote margin, the Senate adopted \nan amendment that provides for school vouchers, as well as harmful \nchanges in the nation's anti-drug policy.\n  The Republican leadership offered a watered-down minimum wage \nincrease, tied to a poison pill that cuts overtime pay, and an enormous \n$71 billion in tax breaks that disproportionately benefit the \nwealthiest Americans. Those provisions are now part of this bankruptcy \nbill--making a bad bill even worse.\n  By failing to increase the minimum wage last year, Congress failed \nthe American people. It is time--long past time--to raise the minimum \nwage.\n  Our proposal is modest--a one dollar increase in two installments--50 \ncents now, and 50 cents a year from now. Over 10 million American \nworkers will benefit. Our position is clear, it's ``50-50 or fight!''\n  Our Democratic proposal to increase the minimum wage by a dollar over \nthe next year will make a significant difference in the lives of all \nworkers who earn the minimum wage and their families.\n  Unlike the Republican proposal, our Democratic proposal will give \nminimum wage workers the pay raise they need and deserve, so that they \ncan care more effectively for their families and pay for the food and \nclothing and housing they need.\n  We shouldn't delay an increase. We shouldn't stretch it out. We \nshouldn't use it to slash overtime pay. We shouldn't use it as an \nexcuse to give tax breaks to the wealthy.\n  Raising the minimum wage is an issue of fairness and dignity. No one \nwho works for a living should have to live in poverty.\n  Before casting our final votes on this legislation, we have the \nopportunity to adopt several very important amendments that deserve our \nsupport. Yesterday, we started debate on the Levin-Durbin gun \namendment, which would prevent gun manufacturers from abusing the \nbankruptcy system.\n  Today, Senator Schumer offered an amendment that eliminates a loop-\nhole currently being exploited by perpetrators of clinic violence.\n  Senator Schumer's proposed amendment is neither a prochoice amendment \nnor an anti-choice amendment. At its heart, it is not about abortion at \nall. Rather, it is about accountability for violent, illegal acts. It \nis about preventing those who use tactics of violence and intimidation \nagainst reproductive health clinics from using the bankruptcy laws as a \nshield from financial liability for their unlawful acts.\n  In response to a wave of violence which included murder, arson, \nbombing and harassment, Congress enacted the Freedom of Access to \nClinic Entrances Act in 1994. That Act established criminal penalties \nand financial penalties for violence and intimidation directed against \nreproductive health service patients and providers.\n  I'm proud to be the Senate author of that legislation because since \nits passage, incidents of clinic violence have declined significantly. \nIn addition, under the act and other federal and state laws, victims of \nclinic violence have been able to obtain remedies, and perpetrators of \nunlawful clinic violence have paid substantial fines and civil \npenalties.\n  Unfortunately, some of these offenders are attempting to evade their \nliability by exploiting the bankruptcy system.\n  For example, last year a federal judge ordered two anti-abortion \ngroups and twelve individuals to pay in excess of $107 million for \nanti-choice activities and threats. However, within the last few \nmonths, five of those defendants, who collectively owe more than $45.5 \nmillion in clinic-violence debts, filed for bankruptcy to avoid the \njudgments.\n  For over 100 years, our bankruptcy system has enabled honest debtors \nto receive a fresh start--but, the bankruptcy laws were never intended \nto be a safe haven for the deliberate disregard of Federal or State \nlaws.\n  The Schumer amendment preserves the integrity of the bankruptcy laws, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The Schumer amendment, the Levin amendment, and others are critical \nin the needed effort to salvage this bill. Our goal is to enact \nresponsible bankruptcy reform, not a sweetheart deal for the credit \ncard industry.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I intend to offer a motion to \ninstruct the conferees on the bankruptcy bill to fix the deeply flawed \nminimum wage proposal contained in the bill. The watered-down wage \nproposal in this bill is an insult to the hard-working men and women \nearning the minimum wage. In this time of plenty, we must not \nshortchange these workers. We should provide a 50-cent raise now and 50 \ncents a year from now.\n  Finally, it is fair to ask when we look at any piece of legislation \nwe do who is going to benefit and who is going to lose. As has been \ndemonstrated during the hearings and during the debate, just about \nevery thoughtful person who has studied the bankruptcy bills remarks \nabout how Congress, over the history of our Nation, has proposed \nbankruptcy bills which have been balanced between the debtor and the \ncreditor, with the understanding that there are so many millions of \nAmericans who may fall onto hard times briefly but are hard-working, \ndecent people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 2 minutes of \nthe time that has been set aside for Senator Feingold be allotted to \nSenator Kennedy. I have cleared this with Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been remarkably balanced, with the \nexception of this legislation.\n  Finally, when you come down to it, one has to ask who benefits and \nwho loses. It is very clear the winners in this are the credit card \ncompanies and the losers are the hard-working men and women who have \nfallen on difficult times, in most instances due to no fault of their \nown. They are men and women who have been downsized as a result of \nmergers. They are men and women who have fallen into serious economic \ntimes because of the failure of their health insurance to cover those \nindividuals. They are primarily women who, as a result of their \npersonal relationships, have been divorced and find it difficult to \nmaintain a system of credit.\n  One can look back over all of these and find they are the victims of \nthis legislation and they are the ones who are going to suffer the \nharsh penalties of it. It is fundamentally wrong. We have not had the \nopportunity in this debate to see protections for children and mothers. \nThe reason for the Dodd amendment is to give special protections which \nhistorically have been a part of our bankruptcy laws. That has been \ndefeated, as well as the amendments to remedy some of the harsh \nprovisions of the means test.\n  This legislation is not the legislation that passed the Congress a \nlittle over a year ago in which I joined others in supporting. This is \nnot balanced legislation.\n  For those reasons, plus the fact we have $73 billion of tax breaks \nfor wealthy individuals in here and a denial to the hardest working \nAmericans for fairness in treating them with a minimum wage, it ought \nto be voted down.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes, or whatever he \nconsumes of the time I have remaining on the Schumer amendment, to the \nSenator from Alabama. What he does not use I will yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Schumer amendment is now pending. The \nSenator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n    Amendment No. 2650, As Further Modified, As Previously Agreed To\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, my good friend Senator Reed and I have \nworked together for quite some time now to adopt a provision involving \nreaffirmations, amendment No. 2650. We have a few technical corrections \nto which we have agreed, and we have reached an agreement to make these \ntechnical corrections.\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\n  I send to the desk a modified amendment which includes the technical \ncorrections. I ask unanimous consent that the original amendment No. \n2650 be vitiated and that the modified amendment be accepted, \nsubstituted, and adopted in its place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the agreement, the Senator has that \nright. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have checked with the staff of Senator Reed and the floor \nstaff on this side, and there is no objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on a technical \namendment offered by myself and Senator Sessions. Senator Sessions and \nI are offering this technical amendment merely to correct some \nprovisions which we felt were needed in order to avoid an unintended \nreading of the amendment. Reaffirmations are essentially agreements \nbetween creditors and consumers whereby the consumer agrees to continue \nto repay the debt owed the creditor, even after all other debts may be \ndischarged in bankruptcy. Unfortunately, there have been many instances \nin the past in which consumers have not been well-informed going into \nthese agreements, and in some cases have been coerced into signing \nthem. As some of my colleagues may recall, in offering our original \namendment on reaffirmations, Senator Sessions and I had two major \ngoals: the first was to improve consumer's understanding of what they \nare doing when they agree to reaffirm a debt that they were entitled \nto, under the law, have discharged. The second goal was to promote \nefficient handling of reaffirmations in the bankruptcy process. Our \nNovember amendment developed a uniform disclosure form that is to be \nfiled with the court along with the reaffirmation agreement into which \nthe consumer is entering. The amendment also expands the authority of \nthe bankruptcy court to review those reaffirmations that are most \nlikely to fail, such as debtors whose income and other expenses clearly \nindicate that they do not have the ability to repay the debt which they \nare reaffirming. In that respect, the Reed-Sessions amendment seeks to \nprovide courts with the information they need to determine quickly and \nefficiently whether these reaffirmations are appropriate or not. The \nspecific changes that we are making today to our original amendment \nsimply clarify certain points we felt may be open to misinterpretation. \nFor example, we want to make it clear that the debt a consumer is \nreaffirming includes two totals: First is the total amount of the debt \nthe consumer owes, and second is the total amount of any other costs \naccrued by the consumer since the date they were given the disclosure \nstatement. At another point, we wanted to make clear to the consumer \nthat the payments they would be making on the reaffirmed debt are \nsubject to change, based on their reaffirmation or original credit \nagreement.\n  In the part of the amendment detailing certain steps the consumer \nneeds to undertake, we wanted to make clear that consumers would not be \npenalized if their attorney decides not to sign the reaffirmation \nagreement and the disclosure statement.\n  We also want to make clear to consumers that in certain \ncircumstances, they can also redeem the item, rather than reaffirming \nthe debt they have on it. to redeem it, they can simply make one \npayment equal to the actual value of the item.\n  All of these mostly minor changes will make the original amendment \nthat much more clear and easier for the consumer to understand when \nthey are going through the unpleasant process of bankruptcy. With all \nthat said, it was my hope to have another point included in the final \nversion of this amendment, but I have agreed not to push for its \ninclusion at this time. This last piece that I was seeking deals with \nthe amount of time one has to file reaffirmations. I would first like \nto make it clear that it is not my intention to suggest that the \noriginal Reed-Sessions amendment was unclear about the need for timely \nfiling of reaffirmations and the new disclosure form with the court. \nHowever, in the course of discussions with consumer advocacy groups, \nthere were strong arguments that it could be interpreted that way. \nTherefore, I sought what I thought was a judicious approach, which was \nto create a 50-day window--between the first meeting a debtor has with \ncreditors until the time of discharge--to enter into a reaffirmation \nagreement. The original Reed-Sessions amendment goes to some length to \ncarefully define the information that must be presented to the debtor, \nthe instructions that the debtor must receive, and the conditions under \nwhich this information must be presented to the courts. However, I \nthink we will all recognize that this information is most useful to the \ncourts if it can be provided in a timely manner.\n  The underlying bill already contains a number of provisions that \noutline certain deadlines for actions that the consumer must undertake \nwithin the course of bankruptcy. Therefore, this new deadline would be \nentirely consistent with those others already present in the bill. I \nbelieve a deadline of some kind is necessary in this case as we have \nseen certain abuses in the past, most notable in the case of Sears, \nwhere there appeared to be no effort to file these reaffirmation \nagreements with the court, yet all the while consumers continue to pay \nas if they had been. I would also like to point out that several \nadvocates and bankruptcy judges were consulted on the timing issue, \nnotably Judge Eugene Weedoff of Chicago and Judge Thomas Carlson of \nCalifornia, as well as Professor Elizabeth Warren of Harvard \nUniversity. However, I'm pleased to say that I have come to an \nagreement with Senator Sessions on the technical amendment and on \naddressing the timing issue with regard to filing reaffirmations. \nTherefore, I would urge the support of this amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2650), as further modified, as previously agreed \nto, reads as follows:\n\n     SEC. 1. REAFFIRMATION.\n\n       In S. 625, strike section 203 and section 204(a) and (c), \n     and insert in lieu of 204 (a) the following--\n       ``(a) In general.--Section 524 of title 11, United States \n     Code, as amended by section 202 of this Act, is amended--\n       (1) In subsection (c) by striking paragraph (2) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(2) the debtor received the disclosures described in \n     subsection (i) at or before the time the debtor signed the \n     agreement.\n       (2) By inserting at the end of the section the following--\n       ``(i)(1) the disclosures required under subsection (c) \n     paragraph (2) of this section shall consist of the disclosure \n     statement described in paragraph (3), completed as required \n     in that paragraph, together with the agreement, statement, \n     declaration, motion and order described, respectively, in \n     paragraphs (4) through (8) of this subsection, and shall be \n     the only disclosures required in connection with the \n     reaffirmation.\n       ``(2) Disclosures made under this paragraph shall be made \n     clearly and conspicuously and in writing.

Otherwise, your obligations will be determined by the \n     reaffirmation agreement which may have changed the terms of \n     the original agreement.

The Senator from Alabama still has the floor.\n\n\n                             REAFFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to address an issue that \nSenator Reed and I have been working on for many months. We have sought \nto reform the process of reaffirmations, to fully inform debtors of the \ndetails and consequences of reaffirming debts, to prevent abuse of this \nprocess by dishonest debtors and creditors, and protect honest \nindividuals who wish to enter a reaffirmation agreement. Senator Reed \nand I have worked for months to reach this point, and we have tried to \ncraft a balanced amendment that protects the interests of everyone \ninvolved. That amendment passed the Senate last year. At this point, \nSenator Reed and I have agreed on a few technical changes, and \nidentified one substantive issue that remains outstanding. The \nsubstantive issue concerns the time limit for reaffirmation agreements \nto be approved by the court. Current law provides 90 days, and Senator \nReed would prefer 50 days. Given the support for the underlying \namendment, Senator Reed and I were most concerned with making the \ntechnical changes to ensure that the agreement that was reached \naccurately represented the common intent and to reserve the timing \nissue for conference.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my friend from Alabama is correct. I believe \nthat we have an honest, fair reform to the reaffirmation process and \nprocedure. I know there has been a great deal of work dedicated to this \nend, and I am pleased we have arrived at this common ground. I have \nsome concerns about the time limits for approval of these reaffirmation \nagreements. I had hoped this timing issue would be resolved, but I \nshare Senator Sessions' desire to see this amendment passed with the \ntechnical corrections. I would ask my friend if he shares my interest \nin addressing this timing issue in conference?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe your concern is reasonable, and I will work \nwith you to see that this issue is addressed in conference. I am \nconfident that we can reach a consensus on the timing issue, and that \nall sides will be able to accept the change.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will briefly say in response to the \ncomments made by the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts \nthat this is a fair and balanced bill. It does a number of good things \nto help those who have financial difficulties. It closes loopholes and \nends unfairness in provisions that are being abused and making a \nmockery out of legitimate bankruptcy law.\n  For example, children or those who are eligible to receive child \nsupport and alimony are raised to the highest possible level, even \nabove attorney fees and trustee fees in bankruptcy. They are the \nhighest possible level. If an individual owes a number of debts and one \nof those is for child support, the child support is to be paid first.\n  There is nothing in this bill that is harsh. Any American making \nbelow the median income level will fundamentally find their bankruptcy \nfiling procedure under the needs-based rule has not changed. It is only \nfor those who make above the median income that a question will be \nraised as to whether or not they can pay back some of their debts.\n  There are literally thousands of individuals in America today who owe \nlimited debts, who may have incomes of $80,000, $90,000, or $200,000, \nand choose to file for bankruptcy. Under the current law, they can wipe \nout all their debts, even those owed to people much less wealthy than \nthey, and not pay any debts.\n  Under this provision of law, if you have an income above the median \nincome level, the bankruptcy court may conclude you can pay some of \nyour debts, and if you can, you are given 5 years to pay some of those \ndebts to somebody from whom you have received a benefit or else you \nwould not have a debt.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for his work on this bill. I am troubled \nthat anyone would say it is unfair and does not help make this system \nbetter. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have now yielded back all time on the Schumer \namendment. It is my understanding this side has 10 minutes reserved \nunder the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is correct.\n  All time has expired on the Schumer amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2770\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume on the \nHarkin amendment. I will not use all of the time because I want to \nencourage Senator Feingold or Senator Levin to go ahead with their \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Iowa, as soon as the Senator \ncompletes his statement the Senator from Michigan is ready to proceed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wish to respond to what the Senator from \nMassachusetts spoke about so passionately. I probably do not speak with \nthe same passion he does, but I do want to say that he has it \ncompletely wrong. You cannot ignore the fact that since 1980 \nbankruptcies have increased from around 330,000 in that year to just \nunder 1.4 million in 1999. That is a fact that cannot be ignored.\n  Consequently, it seems to me to be completely wrong for some other \nSenator to say we do not have a bankruptcy problem in the United \nStates. Congress ought to deal with it, and changing the law will help. \nI do not pretend changing the law is going to entirely respond to that \nproblem, but the extent to which it does, we should do it because this \nincrease in bankruptcies is a huge increase. The small dip in the \nfilings that Senator Kennedy has referred to will not erase this very \nbasic, fundamental problem we have in our economy with the bankruptcy \nlaws. We have a real bankruptcy crisis on our hands. We cannot ignore \nthat.\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\n  Perhaps the Senator from Massachusetts does not remember what his own \nPresident said in the State of the Union Address. The President of the \nUnited States said, just a few days ago, these are prosperous times. \nPeople are not in bankruptcy then because of hard times. If this is a \nproblem when we have very prosperous times, what sort of a bankruptcy \nproblem are we going to have when we have a recession or a depression?\n  One other point that the Senator from Massachusetts spent a great \ndeal of time on is how he sees the problems of minimum wage in this \nbill. There is a minimum wage increase in this bill. It isn't there \nbecause we Republicans sought to join minimum wage with the bankruptcy \nbill. We were going to debate minimum wage at another time. We were \ngoing to increase minimum wage at another time, but it was the \nDemocratic Party that made a decision to put minimum wage on the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  I do not even like nongermane things being included on other pieces \nof legislation, but it is a pattern too often adopted and too readily \naccepted in the Senate. So it is done. But on this side of the aisle, I \nargued that we should not mix minimum wage with bankruptcy. I do not \nwant the weight of that issue, as important as increasing the minimum \nwage is, with the issue of reforming the bankruptcy code. But on the \nother side of the aisle they chose to do it. So what do we hear?\n  Now we are hearing complaints about the minimum wage bill on the \nbankruptcy bill. We are hearing threats about instructing conferees to \ndo something about it. If it is a problem, it is a problem because the \nother side of the aisle made it a problem by including it. I remind \nthem that they ought to be very careful what they wish for because \nsometimes they get it.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has asked who will win and who will \nlose. Under this bill, the honest American people, who have to pay the \nhigher prices because other people go into bankruptcy and do not pay \ntheir bills--because we have deadbeats out there--are the ones who will \nwin by this legislation.\n  We still preserve the historic principle of our bankruptcy laws that \nsome people who are in debt, through no fault of their own, are \nentitled to a fresh start. But when it comes to this basic principle of \neconomics that there is no free lunch, there is no free lunch in \nbankruptcy, either. Somebody pays.\n  In this particular instance, the honest American consumer is paying \n$400, for a family of four, to cover debts of somewhere between $30 \nbillion and $50 billion a year that go unpaid because of people who \nought to be paying their bills. Worse yet, we have a situation where \nsome people who do have the ability to pay their bills are not paying \ntheir bills, either. We are sending a clear signal that those who have \nthe ability to pay are not going to get off scot-free.\n  I relinquish the remainder of our time. Hopefully, we can proceed, \nthen, to the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired on the Harkin amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2770, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, how much time am I allotted on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 13 minutes on \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is what we have referred \nto in this debate on the bankruptcy bill as the ``landlord-tenant \namendment.'' We had extensive debate on this amendment in November \nbefore we recessed for the year. We did make some progress in \nidentifying the areas of dispute and, I think, in narrowing our \ndifferences as well.\n  To remind my colleagues, this amendment is designed to reduce the \nharsh consequences of section 311 of the bill on tenants, while at the \nsame time protecting legitimate financial interests of landlords.\n  To review, current law provides for an automatic stay of eviction \nproceedings upon the filing of a bankruptcy case. Landlords can apply \nfor relief from that stay so the eviction can proceed, but it is a \nprocess that often takes a few months.\n  What section 311 of the bill does is eliminate the stay in all \nlandlord-tenant cases so an eviction can proceed immediately, \ncompletely, regardless of the circumstances.\n  What my amendment would do is allow tenants to remain in their \napartments as they try to sort out the difficult consequences of \nbankruptcy, if--and only if--they are willing to pay the rent that \ncomes due after they file for bankruptcy or that comes due within the \n10 days before bankruptcy. If the tenant fails to pay rent, the stay \ncan be lifted without further proceedings 15 days after the landlord \nprovides notice to the court that the rent has not been paid. If the \nreason for the eviction is\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\ndrug use or property damage, the stay can also be lifted after 15 days. \nFinally, if the lease has actually expired by its terms--in other \nwords, if there is no more time on the lease--and if the landlord or a \nmember of his or her family plans to move in to the property, then \nagain, after 15 days notice, the eviction can proceed.\n\n  There is no 15-day notice period, with a chance for the tenant to go \ninto court and challenge the allegations of the landlord, if the tenant \nhas filed for bankruptcy previously. In other words in cases of repeat \nfilings, the stay never takes effect, just as under section 311 in this \nbill. That is the main abuse that has been alleged in Los Angeles \nCounty, where unscrupulous bankruptcy petition preparers advertise \nfiling bankruptcy as a way to live ``rent free.'' So under my \namendment, a debtor can never live ``rent free.'' The debtor has to pay \nrent after filing for bankruptcy. If a debtor misses a rent payment, \nthe stay will be lifted 15 days later. And the automatic stay does not \ntake effect at all if the tenant is a repeat filer.\n  So my amendment gets at the abuse, and it protects the rights and \neconomic interests of the landlord. What it eliminates is the punitive \naspect of Section 311, and the possibility that tenants who are willing \nand able to pay rent once they get a little breathing room from their \nother creditors will instead be put out on the street. I am frankly \ndisappointed that my colleague from Alabama, with whom I have had a \ngood debate on this issue, and the property owners organizations are \ninsisting on the harsh aspects of section 311 when my amendment would \nget at the problems they have identified just as well.\n  It is also important to note that even in cases where a tenant pays \nthe rent that is due after filing for bankruptcy, my amendment leaves \nintact the current law that allows landlords to get relief from the \nautomatic stay. Let me be very clear about that. My amendment does not \neliminate the ability of landlords to apply for relief from the stay \nunder current law. The law now gives debtors some breathing room in \nlegal proceedings, including eviction proceedings. But landlords can \napply for relief from the stay. It is not an abuse of the law to take \nadvantage of the automatic stay to get your affairs in order. Many \ntenants use that time to work out a payment schedule for their back \nrent so they can avoid eviction altogether.\n  Most landlords don't want to throw people out on the street--they \njust want to be paid. My amendment requires that they be paid once \nbankruptcy is filed, or the eviction can proceed immediately. But even \nif the rent is paid while the bankruptcy case is pending, a landlord \ncan still seek relief from stay under the normal procedures and press \nforward with the eviction.\n  I have a letter from the National Association of Realtors, a powerful \nlobbying association, that is unalterably opposed to my amendment. This \nletter is dated January 24, 2000, several days ago. It urges opposition \nto my amendment, which it says will ``seriously weaken'' the bill. But \nlisten to what it says about the bill. The letter says that current law \nallows for ``serious fraud and abuse.'' But my amendment deals with the \ncases of fraud and abuse by disallowing the automatic stay in the case \nof repeat filings. And the Realtor's letter says that current law \nallows tenant to ``live rent free at the expense of the property \nowner.'' But my amendment does not allow tenants to live rent free. \nThey have to pay rent once the bankruptcy is filed. And it says that \nprospective tenants often ``have to wait 6 months or longer, as they do \nnow, to get into rental property units occupied by residents \noverstaying their lease.'' Well that is simply not true under my \namendment. This amendment allows for expedited relief from stay in any \ncase where the lease has expired according to its terms and the \nlandlord has entered into a valid rental agreement with another tenant \nprior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\n  Every single one of the arguments made by the National Association of \nRealtors against the amendment is refuted by the amendment itself, \nevery one. Yet this group persists in urging the Senate to reject the \namendment. It says, speaking about the provisions of the bill that the \namendment will modify: ``we believe these common sense provisions will \ncurb abusive use of the Bankruptcy Code.'' If the Realtors were honest, \nthey would admit that my amendment will do exactly the same thing. It \nwill curb abusive use of the Bankruptcy Code. But it will also continue \nto allow the code to provide protection to people who are not abusing \nthe system, but simply using it to get back on their feet, and keep a \nroof over their heads. Those people would be treated too harshly by the \ncurrent bill, and it is unfortunate that the Realtors, in their zeal to \nget as many advantages for landlords as they can, refuse to see that.\n  I have modified this amendment in the spirit of compromise to address \nall of the concerns that the Senator from Alabama raised in debate last \nyear. This amendment addresses the abuse, it is fair to landlords and \nmakes sure they are not economically harmed when a tenant files for \nbankruptcy, and it is fair to debtors who file for bankruptcy in good \nfaith and simply need a little breathing space to get their lives in \norder.\n  I urge my colleagues to look carefully at this amendment, and I hope \nthey will support it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama wants to speak \nagainst the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin and also against \nthe amendment of the Senator from Michigan very shortly. The manager of \nthe bill has asked permission that we go immediately to the Levin \namendment and reserve the remainder of the time of the Senator from \nWisconsin, and that the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, be allowed \nto speak at the same time against both amendments. Does the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin have objection to that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wisconsin has 6 minutes remaining on his amendment.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2658\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the nondischargeability of debts arising from \n             firearm-related debts, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what is the pending matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the Levin amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2658.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 124, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CHAPTER 11 NONDISCHARGEABILITY OF DEBTS ARISING FROM \n                   FIREARM-RELATED DEBTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1141(d) of title 11, United States \n     Code, as amended by section 708 of this Act, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the confirmation of a \n     plan does not discharge a debtor that is a corporation from \n     any debt that is--\n       ``(A) related to the use or transfer of a firearm (as \n     defined in section 921(3) of title 18 or section 5845(a) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986); and\n       ``(B) based in whole or in part on fraud, recklessness, \n     misrepresentation, nuisance, negligence, or product \n     liability.''.\n       (b) Automatic Stay.--Section 362(b) of title 11, United \n     States Code, as amended by section 901(d) of this Act, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (27), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (28), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (28) the following:\n       ``(29) under subsection (a) of this section, of--\n       ``(A) the commencement or continuation, and conclusion to \n     the entry of final judgment or order, of a judicial, \n     administrative, or other action or proceeding for debts that \n     are nondischargeable under section 1141(d)(6); or\n       ``(B) the perfection or enforcement of a judgment or order \n     referred to in subparagraph (A) against property of the \n     estate or property of the debtor.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  This amendment, which is cosponsored by a number of our colleagues, \nprovides that gun manufacturers and\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\ndistributors cannot evade responsibility for damages that are caused by \ntheir reckless or negligent conduct or their fraudulent conduct by \nseeking reorganization in bankruptcy court. It is that straightforward. \nWe already have about 18 provisions in the bankruptcy law based on \npublic policy which provide that certain kinds of debts are not \ndischargeable.\n  For instance, we have in the law a provision that says if you drive \nwhile drunk and you injure somebody, you cannot discharge that \nobligation by going bankrupt. Senator Danforth made an eloquent \nstatement on this floor arguing for justification for that particular \nexception, that nondischargeability, when he said:\n\n       Today there exists an unconscionable loophole in the \n     bankruptcy statute which makes it possible for drunk drivers \n     who have injured, killed or caused property damage to others \n     to escape civil liability for their actions by having their \n     judgment debt discharged in Federal bankruptcy court. This \n     loophole affords opportunities for scandalous abuse of the \n     judicial process.\n\n  Following Senator Danforth's and others' pleas that we make liability \nresulting from drunken driving nondischargeable in bankruptcy, this \nCongress added another nondischargeable obligation in our bankruptcy \nlaw. We have about 18 of those provisions. We have a provision that \nsays if you have an obligation to the Government for a student loan, \nyou are not going to be able to get rid of that by going bankrupt. We \nhave a provision in the bankruptcy law which says if you have an \nobligation to a co-op or to a condo for a fee you owe to them, under \ncertain circumstances that is not going to be dischargeable in \nbankruptcy.\n  And what we are saying now in this amendment is that where a gun \nmanufacturer or a distributor, through his own reckless, negligent, or \nfraudulent conduct causes damages to individuals or our communities, \nthey should not be able to reorganize in bankruptcy court and get rid \nof that debt.\n  This is the public policy purpose beyond this particular provision. \nIt has the support of many organizations such as Handgun Control, which \nis Sarah Brady's group, has written in support of this amendment, \nsaying:\n\n       Gun manufacturers, distributors, and dealers should not be \n     able to evade these legitimate claims for damages.\n\n  In 1996, Lorcin Engineering Company, one of the chief manufacturers \nof Saturday night specials, or junk guns, filed for chapter 11 \nbankruptcy. Other gun manufacturers such as Davis Industries and \nSundance Industries have followed Lorcin's lead and have filed for \nbankruptcy to avoid liability. We must not allow other companies to \ntake advantage of this bankruptcy system.\n  We have an unusual provision in the law that exempts the gun industry \nfrom safety and health regulation. It is the only industry that is \nexplicitly exempt from health and safety regulations and from the \njurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. No agency has \nsafety oversight over manufacturers who have produced unsafe firearms, \nand so litigation serves as the only mechanism that can hold the \nindustry responsible.\n  What this amendment says is that where there is damage caused by \nfraud or reckless or negligent conduct of a manufacturer or \ndistributor, that manufacturer or distributor should not be able to \nreorganize itself out of accountability, away from responsibility by \ngoing to bankruptcy court. The public policy purpose behind this \namendment is a powerful one, indeed.\n  In addition to Sarah Brady's organization, which I have mentioned, \nthe National League of Cities supports this amendment. They have \nwritten a letter dated November 16:\n\n       Like debts incurred by drunk driving, Congress must send a \n     clear and convincing message that it will not permit debtors \n     to escape debts incurred by improper conduct. It is crucial \n     that the Federal Government do all that it can to help local \n     law enforcement effectively address gun violence with \n     commonsense legislation that curtails access to firearms, \n     including altering the bankruptcy code.\n\n  Too many of these companies have already said they are going to try \nto reorganize to escape liability. It is a tactic they are using. That \nis not what the bankruptcy law is all about. The bankruptcy law is not \nintended to provide that kind of a haven for companies that have \nengaged in reckless conduct or negligent conduct, to evade \nresponsibility for their obligations.\n  Now, the reasons the National League of Cities has taken this \nposition are many, but one of them is that 30 cities and counties have \nfiled lawsuits against gun manufacturers or distributors alleging \nreckless, negligent, or fraudulent conduct on the part of those \nmanufacturers or distributors. New Orleans, LA; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; \nAtlanta, GA; Cleveland and Cincinnati, OH; Detroit, MI; San Francisco, \nCA; St. Louis, MO; and other cities and communities have filed lawsuits \nalleging reckless conduct, negligent conduct, or fraudulent conduct on \nthe part of a gun manufacturer or distributor. They very strongly \nsupport this amendment, as does the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the \nViolence Policy Center.\n  The Violence Policy Center issued a statement saying that this \namendment is necessary to ensure that firearm manufacturers, which are \nexempt from Federal health and safety regulation--and I emphasize the \nonly group that is exempt from Federal health and safety regulation \nexplicitly is the firearms manufacturers. They have gotten that \nexemption. Yet when it comes to trying to close a loophole in the \nbankruptcy law, which they are using tactically to evade \nresponsibility, they claim they are being singled out. Indeed, they \nhave singled themselves out in gaining exemption from Federal health \nand safety regulation, and the only way in which they can be held \naccountable is through the civil justice system. That is why the \nViolence Policy Center has written a letter of support, indicating that \nlack of health and safety regulation means the civil justice system is \nthe only mechanism available to regulate the conduct of gun \nmanufacturers.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is in response to a tactic that has now \nbeen declared by a number of gun manufacturers, that when faced with \nallegations or judgments based on damages caused by reckless or \nnegligent misconduct, they will seek protection through reorganization \nin the bankruptcy courts. We are trying to reduce the level of gun \nviolence in this country, and one way to do it, a way to support the \ncities and the mayors and the individuals who have been victimized by \nreckless or negligent manufacture or distribution, is to close a \nloophole in the bankruptcy system which a number of gun manufacturers \nhave explicitly said they will use tactically to try to evade \nresponsibility for their misconduct.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator has 11 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield such time as he consumes to the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2748, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Feingold has again presented an \namendment involving landlords and eviction cases. It is one of the \nbiggest problems we have in the bankruptcy code. He has made some \nprogress from his original amendment, but it still basically makes a \nFederal case out of eviction proceedings. Under Senator Feingold's \namendment, when a lease has expired, tenants can go to bankruptcy court \nto delay and file motions and have hearings that can draw out the case \neven longer than the time that the Senator has suggested would normally \noccur. That ought to be done in State systems where eviction cases are \ntraditionally litigated--not in Federal Bankruptcy court.\n  Every State has a procedure and remedies and rights for tenants being \nevicted. That is where those cases ought to be handled, not in \nbankruptcy court. We know that 3,886 people filed bankruptcy in Los \nAngeles County in 1996 simply for the purpose of defeating eviction. We \nhave seen advertisements in newspapers saying, ``hire us as your \nbankruptcy lawyer and we can delay your eviction for 7 months.'' This \nis the kind of thing that is not healthy, the kind of thing that has \ndisrupted and distorted bankruptcy law. I believe bankruptcy law upsets \nlegitimate landlords, many of whom are retirees and people who have \nonly a few apartments or a duplex that they manage, when they can't get \na tenant out.\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\n  So this amendment that he proposes, in effect, continues the process \nof allowing the tenant to take his eviction case to bankruptcy court. \nThis is what has been happening and what will continue to happen if the \nSenator's amendment is adopted. A tenant contests an eviction in State \ncourt, and as he moves toward the conclusion of that case, he then has \nhis bankruptcy lawyer file bankruptcy. An automatic stay would occur \neven with this notice Senator Feingold proposes, at least for 2 weeks. \nThen they would be eligible for a hearing in bankruptcy court on the \ncertification that had been submitted, and then that would delay \nthings.\n  After the landlord eventually wins, for example, in a case in which \nthe lease has expired, the case still then has to go back to State \ncourt and has to be revived because it is at the bottom of the judge's \ndocket. The landlord has to go back to the State court lawyer to \nproceed with it. I think that is a completely unworkable proposal. I do \nunderstand the Senator's concern. We ought to do all we can to help \nthose who are homeless. We have many provisions for dealing with \nhomeless people, but mandating private landlords to provide housing for \npeople who do not have a valid lease is not the right approach, in my \nview.\n  Mr. President, with regard to the gun issue, I think we need to think \nclearly about what we are doing. We are talking about removing \nbankruptcy protection from two kinds of judgments: Judgments incurred \nby people who ``potentially'' violate the law near an abortion clinic \nand judgments incurred by firearms manufacturers or dealers when some \nthird party breaks the law by using a firearm to injure another person.\n  Each of us has a special responsibility, I believe, to this Senate \nand our constitutional responsibilities to create a coherent, fair \njustice system for allowing citizens' debts to be discharged. That is \nwhat bankruptcy is. Every time someone declares bankruptcy, someone \nwhom he or she justly owes is not paid--a store owner, a doctor, a \nbank, or whoever.\n  So most of us are here to achieve honest bankruptcy reform. These \namendments, however, involving the abortion clinic exception and the \ngun manufacturers exception have all the earmarks of partisan injection \nof politics into the bankruptcy code and an attack on people who are \nunpopular, particularly groups or institutions that are unpopular with \nthe political left. These political attacks come at the expense of the \nintegrity and consistency of our bankruptcy system. We should not allow \nthese kinds of attacks to happen. It is our duty to create a legal \nsystem for all Americans and not just to pursue special interest \npolitics.\n  One Senator who proposed this amendment said, well, if it is \npolitical, it is popular. I do not believe it would be popular if we \nhad a group of citizens and we explained exactly with regard to the \nabortion clinic or with regard to the gun manufacturers how they were \nbeing targeted specifically in ways that similar businesses and \ninstitutions were not being targeted and were not being given an \nexemption from bankruptcy.\n  I suggest that this is not a targeting of violence. These amendments \nare basically targeting political enemies. The amendments create an \nexception to the generally applicable bankruptcy protections for two \nspecific classes: Pro-life activists who are overzealous and may \nviolate Federal law, and firearms manufacturers that in general adhere \nto the law with great attention and, as a matter of fact, do what they \nare supposed to do and sell firearms according to Federal regulations.\n  Remember that by the established rule of law, any debt that arises \nfrom ``wilful or malicious'' conduct by any institution today is not \ndischargeable in bankruptcy. In other words, if you commit an action \nthat is malicious or willful and you go into bankruptcy court, you \ncan't wipe out that debt; you still have to pay it.\n  If we remove the general bankruptcy protection for court judgment \nagainst these targeted groups, why aren't we eliminating these \nprotections for other types of debtors whose acts other people may not \nlike in this country? If the goal were to stop violence and protect \nchildren from exposure to bad products, you might expect my colleagues \nwho support this amendment to offer amendments that remove generally \napplicable bankruptcy protections from other entities.\n  For example, I don't see them proposing to remove protections for \nunion leaders who may acquiesce in strike violence around a plant, or \nenvironmental terrorists or their organization who may damage the \nequipment of logging companies. They are not proposing we provide \nspecial protections for Hollywood production companies that inundate \nour children with smut and violence.\n  Take, for example, the Hollywood entertainment industry. Through \npornographic, violent movies and other activities, this industry pumps \nviolent images into the minds of our people, especially children.\n  Michael Carneal, the high school student in Paducah, KY, who killed \nseveral of his classmates, stated that the violent Hollywood movie, \n``The Basketball Diaries,'' which featured a disaffected high school \nstudent who shoots a gun into a classroom of students, influenced him \nto commit his horrible crime.\n  Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold--the killers in the Littleton, CO, \nColumbine High School--were avid players of the video game ``Doom'' in \nwhich they hunted down and shot their victims. As the New York Times \nstated, ``the search for the cause in the Littleton shootings \ncontinues, and much of it has come to focus on violent video games.''\n  Will there be lawsuits against those companies?\n  Who can forget Ted Bundy, a serial killer who preyed on young co-eds, \nwho was convicted and sentenced to death in the electric chair? He \nconfessed that he became addicted to pornography and that pornography \nplayed a major role in developing his homicidal fantasies that led to \nhis violent and horrific crimes.\n  As Senator Hatch's recent Report entitled, ``Children, Violence, and \nthe Media'' noted: ``The debate is over,'' begins a position paper on \nmedia violence by the American Psychiatric Association, ``[f]or the \nlast three decades, the one predominant finding in research on the mass \nmedia is that exposure to media portrayals of violence increases \naggressive behavior in children.'' In the words of Jeffrey McIntyre, \nlegislative and federal affairs officer for the American Psychological \nAssociation, ``To argue against it is like arguing against gravity.''\n  But Hollywood and other activist groups are not targets of these \nbankruptcy penalties. Why? Because they are friends of some of the \npeople proposing these amendments.\n  After criticizing Hollywood in public for violent movies and video \ngames that could be responsible for tragedies such as the one at \nColumbine High School, President Clinton that same day went to a \nfundraiser in which Hollywood contributors gave $2 million to the \nDemocratic Party.\n  Supporters of this amendment say they want to stop those who peddle \nviolence to children; that is, punish gun manufacturers, they say. But \nwhat about these others who could be sued and have judgments against \nthem? I could say let's provide an exception to them. But, really, that \nis not the right approach for us to take. We ought not to be carving \nout exceptions and protections and targeting groups we don't like. We \nneed to create a basic bankruptcy law that treats all lawful businesses \nthe same.\n  It certainly strikes me as odd that we would want to target people \nwho feel deeply about an issue such as abortion and who, through \nperhaps excess zeal, may potentially violate the law when protesting \nagainst abortion. But what about other groups? Union leaders are also \npicketing. Civil rights groups, ACLU groups--why aren't they being \nsingled out by this amendment?\n  These amendments do not represent a high-minded, moral stance against \nthe marketing of violence or against violence itself. Instead, the real \nreason behind these proposals, it appears to me, is to attack political \nenemies of certain people.\n  I could consider offering amendments to include groups such as \npornographers, but I don't think that is the right approach. I believe \nwe ought to stay with the historic general principles of law that say \nthose who are willful and those who are malicious cannot discharge \ntheir debt.\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\n  I would like to say a couple of things about the gun manufacturer \nlawsuits.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will.\n  Mr. REID. We had a number of Senators calling to find out when the \nvotes are going to occur. I think we are in a position now where we \ncould, with the courtesy of the Senator from Alabama, ask unanimous \nconsent to set a time for the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendments be \nvoted in the order in which they were debated today, with 4 minutes \nprior to each vote for explanation, divided equally.\n  I ask unanimous consent the remaining parameters of the consent \nagreement then be in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Therefore, a series of votes will shortly occur in the \nfollowing order, with passage the last in this series: Schumer \namendment No. 2763, Feingold amendment No. 2748, Levin amendment No. \n2658, and the Schumer amendment No. 2762.\n  I might mention that on the last amendment there is a possibility we \nmay be able to resolve that amendment. If we do, then there will only \nbe three votes and final passage. If we cannot resolve it, we will have \nfour votes and final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Was that a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. We already had that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I beg the indulgence of the Senator from Alabama. I am \nhoping we can resolve the last amendment of the Senator from New York. \nI think it is one that makes sense and one that has broad agreement on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Pardon me, that is not the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is not the Senator \nfrom Georgia, and the acting Presiding Officer apologizes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer from----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Kansas.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I trust we will remember next time.\n  The argument was made previously that we target and provide an \nexception in the bill for drunk drivers and drunk boaters. Yes, the \ncurrent law does do that. But drunk drivers and drunk boaters are the \npeople who conduct themselves in a reckless and endangering way. They \nought to be punished. It is legitimate for us to give them a different \ntreatment. But the proposed amendment dealing with gun manufacturers \ndoes not target the illegal or irresponsible gun user. It targets a \nresponsible, federally licensed, law-abiding gun manufacturer. That is \na big difference.\n  I have not heard any of my colleagues across the aisle argue that \nautomobile and boat manufacturers should have their product liability \ndebt classified as ``nondischargeable.'' And they should not be. \nBecause those manufacturers, as firearm manufacturers, are not at \nfault. It is the irresponsible driver or the irresponsible shooter.\n  Briefly, I will say this. With regard to the suits against gun \nmanufacturers, I think it is very instructive to note the Department of \nJustice, the Presidentially appointed Attorney General, has not agreed \nto file these lawsuits. The reason is there is no legal basis for them. \nTwo of them have already been dismissed. They have conjured up a \npolitical appointee in HUD, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, to come up with this idea that if you sell a gun precisely \naccording to Federal law, with all the regulations and do everything \nyou can possible, and then the buyer goes out and uses it illegally, \nthe seller or manufacturer is liable. That is not going to hold up in a \ncourt of law. If they want to make that law, let's pass a law, let's \nput it on the floor and vote for it. We have to stop utilizing the \nlitigation process to set public policy in this country. And that is \nwhat this is. It is a dangerous trend.\n\n  Indeed, a number of institutions which you would not expect, and \nindividuals, have commented on this. The Washington Post, which is \nabsolutely committed to gun control in America, as much as any \ninstitution I know of, wrote this recently, on the threats of HUD to \nfile a lawsuit. The Post said:\n\n       It seems wrong for an agency of the Federal Government to \n     organize other plaintiffs to put pressure on an industry--\n     even a distasteful industry--to achieve policy results the \n     administration has not been able to achieve through normal \n     legislation and regulation.\n\n  They went on:\n\n       It is an abuse of a valuable system, [the legal system] one \n     that could make it less valuable [the legal system could be \n     less valuable] as people come to view the legal system as \n     nothing more than an arm of policymakers.\n\n  I remember a number of years ago, Hodding Carter, who used to serve \nPresident Jimmy Carter, said on a national TV program, we liberals have \ngotten to the point where we want to use the legal system to carry out \nour agenda we can no longer win at the ballot box.\n  Robert Reich, President Clinton's former Secretary of Labor, has \ncharacterized these tactics as:\n\n       . . . blatant end-runs around the democratic process . . . \n     and nothing short of a faux legislation, which sacrifices \n     democracy to the discretion of administrative officials \n     operating under utter secrecy. . . .\n\n  Mr. Reich goes on to say:\n\n       The way to fix everything isn't to turn our backs on the \n     democratic process and pursue litigation as the \n     administration [his former administration] is doing.\n\n  That is precisely what we are doing. A lawsuit by lawyers who file \nthese actions to set public policy is dangerous because they were not \nelected to set that policy. They are not accountable to the people, as \nwe are. If we want to pass a law to burden gun manufacturers further, \nso be it. We are accountable to the American people and we are \nresponsible for the law. But who are these people who, through lawsuits \nand secret negotiations, are going do that? That is how we got into \nthis. I don't think these lawsuits are going to be successful, but I \ncertainly do not believe we ought to provide a particular exception, \nthat if somehow they are successful and judgments are rendered so the \ncompanies have to go into bankruptcy, somehow they cannot even go into \nbankruptcy and discharge their debts. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  With regard to both of these amendments, they are targeted. They have \nthe earmarks of having a political agenda behind them. They interfere \nwith the objectivity and fairness of the bankruptcy code. We ought not \npass them. We ought to reject them both, and we ought to reject the \nFeingold amendment on rent because we do not need to continue to \nprovide a Federal court trial of matters involving eviction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the distinguished Senator from the great \nand sovereign State of Alabama, where he served as attorney general, \nthe great State of Alabama, wish to be recognized any further?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from Alabama yields the floor and thanks \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose the Levin-Durbin \namendment, which would make certain judgments against gun manufacturers \nnondischargeable in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. I appreciate the \nsincere views of my friends from Michigan and Illinois who have \nproposed this amendment as a way to highlight the serious issues of gun \nviolence in this country. I do not believe, however, that this \namendment is necessary, and I think it has the potential to set a \ndangerous precedent in our business bankruptcy system.\n  First, there is a real question of whether this amendment is \nnecessary. Chapter 11 business bankruptcy is not like Chapter 7 \npersonal bankruptcy where debts are simply wiped out by the bankruptcy \ndecree. In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a business's reorganization plan \nmust receive the approval of the court and of the other creditors. It \nis far from clear that the kind of judgments that are at issue in the \nLevin amendment will automatically be discharged in a bankruptcy \nreorganization.\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\n  In addition, Chapter 11 bankruptcy often provides a useful forum for \nmaking sure that all claimants against a company are treated fairly. We \nhave seen that happen with respect to suits against asbestos and IUD \nmanufacturers. Without it, plaintiffs may end up in a race to the \ncourthouse to try to claim the limited assets of a company.\n  Because I have some doubt that the amendment is necessary, and \nwhether it is advisable even from the point of view of potential \nplaintiffs against gun manufacturers, I am reluctant to set the \nprecedent of using the business bankruptcy system in this way. I \nbelieve this amendment is different from some of the non-\ndischargeability provisions already applicable to personal bankruptcies \nor that will be voted on here before we complete this bill. Whereas we \ncan say to someone who is contemplating personal bankruptcy that it is \nour judgment that certain debts simply should not be discharged because \nof the circumstances or culpability that led to the bankruptcy in the \nfirst place, it is hard to see how delivering that message in this \nparticular narrow business bankruptcy context accomplishes the same \ngoal. I will therefore vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment offered to the \nbankruptcy reform bill by Senator Levin that would prohibit gun \nmanufacturers from discharging debt associated with firearm sales.\n  Currently, the families of victims who have been harmed by a firearm \ncan sue the gun manufacturer for financial damages in civil court. The \nbankruptcy code allows for the gun manufacturer to file for bankruptcy \nprotection and discharge the debt that the manufacturer may owe to the \nvictim's family. This amendment would prohibit a gun manufacturer from \ndischarging that debt.\n  I am voting against this amendment because, at this time, I have not \nreceived significant evidence to suggest that gun manufacturers are \nabusing loopholes in the bankruptcy code to avoid paying their \nliabilities. Additionally, this amendment is not narrowly tailored to \ngun manufacturers who are illegally selling firearms. It targets the \nindustry as a whole, and would set an unfortunate precedent by legally \nseparating this industry from other industries in the bankruptcy code.\n  While I understand the concerns of people who would argue that gun \nmanufacturers are abusing the bankruptcy code, I cannot support the \nseparate treatment of certain industries under our nation's bankruptcy \nlaws absent more significant evidence of actual abuse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The distinguished Senator \nfrom New York.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey seeks \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his recognition.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment being \noffered by my friends and colleagues, Senators Levin and Durbin. It \nwould prevent gun manufacturers from using the bankruptcy system to \nevade responsibility for the damage caused by their deadly products.\n  It is time for this Congress to catch up with the American people. \nThe public is demanding an end to the epidemic of gun violence that has \nturned parts of this country into shooting galleries. Criminals are \namassing arsenals of deadly weapons and using them to gun down whole \ngroups of people, from Hawaii to Seattle, from Texas to Kentucky, yet \nCongress has failed to see the lesson in these tragedies.\n  As a result, the American people in cities across the country are \nturning to the legal system, desperate for help. Thirty cities and \ncounties are suing gun manufacturers for death and injuries caused by \nfirearms. Individual families are suing to hold gunmakers accountable \nfor the loss or harm brought to loved ones.\n  These lawsuits are already making significant headway against the \nformidable power of the gun industry. In the case of Hamilton v. \nAccutek, a jury in Brooklyn, NY, found several gun manufacturers \nresponsible for the damage caused by that product.\n  In Georgia, a judge allowed a suit filed by Atlanta against the gun \nindustry to move forward.\n  In California, a Federal judge barred gun manufacturers from using \nbankruptcy as a shield when their products caused death or injury.\n  It was not long ago that gunmakers would laugh when you suggested \nthey take some responsibility for the devastation firearms have caused. \nBut the tears of our citizens have finally wiped away the smile now \nthat 30 cities and counties across the country are taking them to \ncourt.\n  Today, gun manufacturers are talking about making safer firearms and \nworking to keep guns away from criminals, things they never would have \nconsidered discussing just a year ago.\n  They are making these changes because gun victims are holding them \naccountable in court. Families, friends, and neighbors of gun victims \nare using the legal system to seek some measure of solace. Congress \nought not to get in the way. The Levin-Durbin amendment sends a clear \nmessage that the gun industry must face up to its responsibilities, \nthat it will not find an easy escape in the bankruptcy court when \nfamilies bring valid lawsuits.\n  And this Congress has to do more to stop gun violence. It is \ndisgraceful that the Congress has not passed reasonable gun safety \nmeasures, including my amendment that requires criminal background \nchecks at gun shows. It is especially troublesome when one stops to \nconsider that the Nation's largest gun manufacturer, Sturm, Ruger and \nCo., has expressed concern about the sale of its guns at gun shows.\n  The gunmakers themselves are seeing the light, but Congress is still \nfumbling for the switch. Most Americans assumed the horrific shootings \nin Columbine would be enough. Most Americans thought the vision of two \nhigh school students systematically killing 12 classmates and a teacher \nand wounding 23 others would finally spur this Congress to action.\n  April 20 will mark one year since that terrible tragedy at Columbine, \nand it would be outrageous for Congress to let that day pass without \nhaving passed a single piece of gun safety legislation. The Senate did \npass sensible gun safety measures as a part of the juvenile justice \nbill, including the amendment I offered that would prevent criminals \nfrom getting guns at gun shows, but we simply need to finalize a good, \ntough bill and send it to the President.\n\n  While this legislation is technically stuck in conference, I am \nafraid it is being held hostage by the extremists at the National Rifle \nAssociation, and we should not allow that to continue. I am going to \ncontinue to speak on the Senate floor. I will take whatever other steps \nare necessary to engage Congress in that action.\n  When the Congress wants to act quickly, it does. We often push \nlegislation through the process in a matter of days, but not \nlegislation aimed at reducing gun violence. Those measures run into one \ndelay after another, even though the vast majority of the American \npeople are pleading for action. Failing to act by that horrible \nanniversary date, April 20, will be a travesty. How will we be able to \nanswer the families who ask what we have done to stop the killing?\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and others in bringing this \nnationwide epidemic under control. The forces on the other side are \npowerful, but we have to help keep our families and communities safe \nand make the gun industry accountable. Support the Levin-Durbin \namendment, and then we ought to complete the work on the gun safety \nmeasures in the juvenile justice bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time is left for this side on \nthe Levin amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield such time as he might consume to the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer from Kansas \nfor recognizing the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, I said yesterday--and I meant it most sincerely--that \nI am very respectful of the Senator from\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\nIowa and the Senator from Utah who have tried to reshape bankruptcy law \nin this country to be fair and equitable and representative of those \nwho find themselves in desperate straits as a result of debt and the \nneed to reorganize and reshape that and, in some instances, to \ndischarge it altogether. We have said historically that those who \nwillfully, maliciously, or recklessly cause endangerment cannot do \nthat. That has been the standard, and that ought to remain the \nstandard.\n  Today, there is an attempt by the Senator from Michigan to use the \nbankruptcy code to be politically correct, to be more political than \nsubstantive as it relates to the law; that is, to single out an \nindustry and that industry's legal distributors as somehow being \nseparate, special, and unique and, therefore, not being allowed to use \nthe bankruptcy law.\n  It is a great mistake for the Senate to begin to play that kind of \ngame. That is raw politics, and we have not done that in the past. I am \nnot sure we should ever do it for any reason other than the ones we \nhave already said: a willful, malicious kind of action.\n  They say this is for gun manufacturers, those folks whom they attempt \nto paint as a very evil group who produce a legal and legitimate \nproduct and sell it through federally licensed dealers. Somehow they \nare all wrong now because the Senator from Michigan and the Senator \nfrom New Jersey say the American people sweepingly demand that we \nchange. The American people do not sweepingly demand this change; they \ndemand that the Justice Department enforce the laws, which we know they \nhave not, and, as a result, some misuse of firearms has certainly gone \non in our country.\n\n  The issue is not with the Kmarts, it is not with the Wal-Marts, it is \nnot with the local hardware dealer, and it should not be with the \nmanufacturer. But for some reason today, for political correctness in \nthis Chamber, that is exactly what they are attempting to do. I hope my \ncolleagues understand and recognize that we are not shielding somebody \nwho acts willfully and maliciously but who acts knowing their action \nendangers others. They are not going to be exempt because they are not \nnow and they will not be later.\n  The Senator from Alabama is right; judges are already dismissing \nthese kinds of frivolous, politically motivated lawsuits, and they will \nkeep filing them hoping someday they can find a judge on whom they can \nhang it and he will say OK.\n  If that happens, then what happens? If a company that finds itself in \nthis situation is not allowed to use chapter 11 to reorganize, then \nthey will use chapter 7. What does that mean? It means they will go \nbankrupt, they will liquidate, they will go overseas, if they need to, \nto manufacture their product, and jobs on Main Street in a lot of our \ncommunities can and will be lost.\n  Is this a jobs issue? It can be when you straitjacket the law, when \nyou pick winners and losers, when you want to play the politically \ncorrect game against someone who, by their judgment, has fallen out of \nfavor with the American people. I hope we do not use bankruptcy law or \nany other part of the Federal code of this country for that kind of \npolitical gamesmanship.\n  Last year, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle worked \novertime trying to make guns an issue, and they failed. The reason they \nfailed is that the American people said: Wait a moment; there are \ntragedies being perpetrated out there and guns being used in those \ntragedies, and there are 60,000 gun laws in America and the Justice \nDepartment is not enforcing them.\n  Somehow we just stack more laws up and the world becomes safer? No. \nThe American people are way ahead of us by last year's polling and this \nyear's current polling. They say: Don't do that. More laws do not a \nsafer world make unless the laws are effectively enforced and \nadministered against the criminal element of our society or those who \nwould misuse their rights.\n  Here the Senator from Michigan is deciding who is going to be \ncriminal and who is going to be malicious by standing in this Chamber \nand saying: I think I will find these people less than popular in my \njudgment because back home it might be politically correct with my base \nof support.\n  That is not good policy. It may be good politics. We have already \nfound even that politics is not working very well.\n  I ask my colleagues to join in a motion to table. We should not mess \nup the bankruptcy law. It ought to be used for the purposes it is being \nused, and those who find themselves misusing the laws of our land or \nacting in a reckless, willful, malicious way are going to be treated \nappropriately within the law; that is, to not discharge their debt or \ntheir liability if they find themselves in this kind of an environment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2762, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have an opportunity to avoid one vote \nby sending to the desk a modified amendment. It is amendment No. 2762. \nSo I send it to the desk and ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe modified and that the modified amendment be agreed to, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table. If necessary, I ask \nunanimous consent to lay the pending amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2762), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 14, strike lines 8 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(5)(A) Only the judge, United States trustee, bankruptcy \n     administrator, or panel trustee may bring a motion under \n     section 707(b), if the current monthly income of the debtor, \n     or in a joint case, the debtor and the debtor's spouse, as of \n     the data of the order for relief, when multiplied by 12, is \n     equal to or less than--\n       ``(i) the national or applicable state median family income \n     reported for a family of equal or lesser size, whichever is \n     greater; or\n       ``(ii) in the case of a household of 1 person, the national \n     or applicable State median household income last reported by \n     the Bureau of the Census for 1 earner, whichever is greater.\n       ``(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the national or \n     applicable State median family income for a family of more \n     than 4 individuals shall be the national or applicable State \n     median family income last reported by the Bureau of the \n     Census for a family of 4 individuals, whichever is greater, \n     plus $583 for each additional member of that family.''.\n       Nothing in this title shall limit the ability of a creditor \n     to provide information to a judge, U.S. trustee, Bankruptcy \n     administrator or panel trustee.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Does the other side of the aisle have speakers?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think we are ready to yield back whatever \ntime we have, if the other side is ready to yield back whatever time \nthey have.\n  I withdraw that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2748, As Modified\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I believe I have 6 minutes remaining, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining on his \namendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask if I can use a portion of that time at this point \nto respond on the landlord-tenant amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I wish to respond briefly to the short remarks the \nSenator from Alabama made with regard to the landlord-tenant amendment.\n  I want to reiterate, as the Senator from Alabama acknowledged, that \nhe raised a whole series of concerns out here on the floor in the \ncourse of our debate on the amendment a few months ago. And he does not \ndispute that we addressed every single one of those concerns, as we \nmodified the amendment. We have been very attentive to the fact there \nwere aspects of the amendment that made the Senator, and others, \nuncomfortable. We made changes in the spirit of compromise in order to \ntry to get something done.\n  By eliminating the automatic stay, section 311 of this bill is an \nenormous change in the law in favor of landlords. What the Senator does \nnot make clear is that we are not undoing that change with this \namendment. What our amendment does is streamline the process for \nlifting the automatic stay, rather than eliminating the stay \naltogether. So instead of a 6- or 8-week period, or longer, to get the \nstay lifted,\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\nour amendment provides a 15-day period, and the State eviction \nproceedings go forward. But those proceedings cannot go forward when \nthe tenant is paying rent.\n  All we are saying is that if a person is truly trying to get his or \nher act together, and is willing, from the time of the bankruptcy \nfiling forward, to pay rent every month, on time, then in those cases \nthe stay should be in place. I think that is enormously reasonable.\n  For the Senator to suggest this is somehow federalizing this area is \nthe opposite of what is going on. In fact, this bill, as it will \nundoubtedly pass, will remove Federal court, in effect, in an awful lot \nof cases that currently are protected by Federal bankruptcy proceedings \nbecause of the automatic stay. And so will our amendment. If a tenant \nmisses a rent payment, or is damaging the apartment, all the landlord \nhas to do is file a simple one page certification to that effect with \nthe bankruptcy court and the stay is lifted.\n  All we are saying is, in some cases there still needs to be that stay \nin place where someone is honestly trying to stay in that apartment, \nsomeone is truly trying to get their life together, and is willing to \nmake the rent payments.\n  So it is simply incorrect to say this is going to gut the provision \nin the bill. Our amendment still is a dramatic change from current law. \nIt is a change that is very pro-landlord. All we are saying is, let's \nbe fair.\n  It is not accurate when the Senator from Alabama says there is \nautomatically going to be a hearing at the end of the 15 days. That is \nnot the case. Yes, it is conceivable that tenants could come and seek a \nhearing if they claimed that the landlord's certification was \ninadequate or mistaken, but there is no automatic right to a hearing. \nIf those 15 days lapse, that is it. The State eviction proceeding goes \nahead, the automatic stay is lifted.\n  In summary, I think this is a classic case of where, instead of there \nbeing a fundamental disagreement that we cannot bridge, we tried very \nhard to add a few elements of fairness to the bill. I think the Senator \nfrom Alabama would have to concede we did do that. It would be \nappropriate for Members to take a good look at this modified amendment \nand adopt it to make sure we do not have an unduly harsh change in the \nlaw. I cannot believe even the harshest landlord would want to have \nsome of the consequences that could result if we do not adopt the \nreasonable modifications contained in this amendment.\n  Mr. President, with that, I ask, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, with the understanding the other side \nwill yield their time, I will yield my time, as well. But if, instead, \nthey wish to speak again, I will keep the 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, after much deliberation, I am voting \nin favor of tabling the Feingold amendment on the use of the automatic \nstay in eviction proceedings.\n  In California, we have had very serious problems with bankruptcy \nmills, fly-by-night firms that have advised tenants to avoid eviction \nby filing for bankruptcy. These firms have even gone so far as to place \nads in newspapers which encourage renters to ``stop evictions from one \nto six months by filing for bankruptcy,'' or promise to ``legally stop \nyour eviction for up to 120 days at rock bottom prices.''\n  In 1996 alone, the Los Angles County Sheriff's Department reported \n3,800 cases in which the tenant filed for bankruptcy after all state \neviction proceedings were exhausted--causing an extra $ 6 million in \ncosts.\n  While the Feingold amendment is well-intentioned, it does not \nadequately address the misuse of the ``automatic stay'' in eviction \nproceedings.\n  Let me explain why:\n  First, once an individual files for bankruptcy, the Feingold \namendment only permits an eviction to go forward if the tenant \nsubsequently fails to pay rent again. Thus, a debtor could refuse to \npay debts for many months, and when the landlord begins the eviction \nproceeding, the landlord's hands would be tied if the debtor then \nstarts paying the rent.\n  This in effect gives a renter the ability not to pay rent, go through \nbankruptcy, and, by agreeing to pay future rent, get to keep the \napartment even if no back rent is paid. In the meantime, he could have \nhad eight or ten or twelve months of free rent.\n  Second, the amendment gives landlords the incentive to evict tenants \nimmediately upon non-payment. If, according to the Feingold amendment, \nthe landlord begins eviction proceedings more than 10 days after non-\npayment of rent and then the tenant files bankruptcy, the eviction \nwould be subject to the automatic stay. This quirk in the amendment \ncould deter landlords from entering into negotiations with tenants and \nlead to quicker evictions.\n  Finally, I have concerns about the impact of this amendment on small \nlandlords. I have received letters from small, private landlords about \nthe burden of current bankruptcy law. These landlords, who may own just \none or two apartments, report that the non-payment of rent by tenants \nthreatens their own ability to meet mortgage payments.\n  I believe strongly in protecting the rights of tenants. However, the \nFeingold amendment tips the scales too far. A more balanced approach is \nneeded.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time do we have on the \namendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to take this particular time to \nnot speak on either one of the amendments before us but to speak about \nthe necessity of passing this bill. Because we have votes on two or \nthree amendments and then final passage, I will not take the time of \nthe Senate at the time of final passage.\n  As we prepare for final passage on this bankruptcy bill, I remind all \nmy colleagues what we are voting for and on. The most fundamental \nquestion we face with this bill is whether or not people should repay \ntheir debts.\n  This bill says that when someone can repay their debts, they are not \ngoing to be able to take the easy way out. This bill will end the free \nride for wealthy freeloaders and deadbeats who walk away from their \ndebts and pass the bill on to the rest of us, to the consumers, who are \nhonest and who should not pick up the tab for those who are not.\n  We have a real bankruptcy crisis in need of action. This bill does it \nwithout violating the principle that people who are entitled to a fresh \nstart have that fresh start.\n  As a result of an amendment offered by Senator Torricelli and myself, \nthis bill contains the most sweeping, wide-ranging set of consumer \nprotections the Senate has enacted in a long time.\n  Those of us from farm country have an extra reason to vote for this \nbill since it contains crucial protections for family farmers who may \nface bankruptcy due to low commodity prices. Chapter 12 will expire in \nJune unless we pass this bill. Under this bill, farmers in chapter 12 \nwill get significant tax relief when they sell off assets.\n  Mr. President, this bill is fair and balanced and deserves to be \npassed by an overwhelming vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two newspaper articles on \nthe subject of bankruptcy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Des Moines Register, May 20, 1999]\n\n                         The Bankruptcy Paradox\n\n       If you are a single parent in Iowa whose spouse takes the \n     family can, takes the family bank account and takes a powder, \n     society will provide you with something over $300 per month, \n     plus health care and food stamps while you hunt a job. If you \n     don't get on your feet in the alloted time, society may take \n     action to take your kids away.\n       If you have some assets but have managed to go thousands of \n     dollars in debt by losing big at the casino, society will \n     forgive your debt immediately and let you keep the house and \n     car and continue to gamble. If you're back in the red in a \n     few years, society will bail you out again. And again.\n       That's the paradox posed by bankruptcy laws. The average \n     American declaring bankruptcy is forgiven $11,000 in debt \n     with no obligation to pay it back. Instead, society pays it. \n     The deadbeat's debts show up in the higher prices you pay and \n     the higher interest on borrowed money.\n       Don't look for help from the consumer groups or the civil-\n     rights groups or the bankruptcy attorneys. They're fighting \n     against\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\n     efforts to hold debtors more responsible, and blaming the \n     credit-card industry for luring the reckless into bankruptcy. \n     No question but that the industry is guilty of inviting \n     deadbeats to go into debt by its indiscriminate pushing of \n     credit cards. For the industry to now complain because some \n     are defaulting is the height of chutzpah.\n       Their critics argue that the lenders simply want the \n     government, by tightening bankruptcy laws, to become a \n     collection agency for them.\n       There's plenty of blame for everyone. Too many Americans \n     are flat-out irresponsible in handling money; too many \n     lenders are equally irresponsible in taking advantage of that \n     irresponsibility, and our bankruptcy laws are too eager to \n     make responsible society pay for the mess. As usual.\n       It's impossible to legislate responsibility. But steps \n     could be taken. We could discourage the credit-card industry \n     from offering credit without checking creditworthiness. We \n     could require that lenders describe credit terms exactly, and \n     explain why paying only the ``minimum balance'' is like owing \n     your soul to the company store. We could eliminate ``Chapter \n     7'' bankruptcies, which free debtors of any responsibility.\n       Legislation tightening up the bankruptcy law has cleared \n     the House, with ``yea'' votes from the entire Iowa \n     delegation. Unfortunately, it lets state bankruptcy laws \n     continue to allow the bankrupt to keep their homes, no matter \n     how expensive. Millionaires can still sell their homes, buy \n     mansions in certain states like Florida and Texas, and become \n     ``bankrupt'' millionaires, paying their creditors nothing.\n       The saddest aspect of the credit mess is in its indictment \n     of the integrity of modern culture. Today's society no longer \n     sees bankruptcy as carrying any stigma, seems no longer to \n     attach any guilt to financial irresponsibility, and teaches \n     that when anything goes wrong in one's personal affairs, it \n     is someone else's fault, and the bailout is someone else's \n     duty.\n       The price we will eventually pay for this collective soft-\n     headedness could be staggering.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Omaha World-Herald, May 10, 1999]\n\n                      Bankruptcy Is for the Needy\n\n       The ability to declare bankruptcy and dump one's debts \n     should not become regarded as merely another financial \n     management tool to facilitate irresponsible spending. Such a \n     remedy should be limited to people who truly cannot repay \n     their creditors. That is one of the principles underlying \n     legislation passed by the House despite a veto threat by the \n     White House.\n       The proposal is an attempt to slow a flood of bankruptcies \n     in the United States. Nearly 1.4 million people filed for \n     personal bankruptcy protection last year, an increase of 95 \n     percent since 1990.\n       Bankruptcy is a substantial problem. While no official \n     figures exist, creditors have said that the amount of debt \n     that gets wiped out by bankruptcy proceedings each year \n     totals between $30 billion and $50 billion. Some people might \n     say that's good. But such a view would be uninformed. Debts \n     that the law forces creditors to forgive are ultimately paid \n     by others in the form of higher prices.\n       All sides in the debate agree that current law allows debts \n     to be written off even though the debtor is capable of \n     partial repayment. Studies by the Justice Department and the \n     American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in \n     Alexandria. Va., indicate the figure is between $800 million \n     and $1 billion. A study paid for by major credit-card \n     companies came up with $3 billion.\n       The legislation, pushed by credit card companies, would \n     make it nearly impossible for people earning more than the \n     national median income ($50,000 for a family of four) to wipe \n     out their debts entirely. Rather, the higher income family \n     would have to gradually repay its debts on a schedule set by \n     the court.\n       Blame for the surge in bankruptcies can be spread widely. \n     Lenders suggest that the number has risen because the laws \n     making it easier to take cover under the bankruptcy laws. \n     Consumer organizations have asserted that lenders, \n     particularly credit-card issuers, are largely at fault \n     because they aggressively push credit--even households with \n     marginal financial resources are targeted by many companies \n     these days.\n       Clinton administration officials object to the legislation, \n     arguing that it would hurt people who are not capable of \n     repaying their debts.\n       Debtor attorneys and some bankruptcy experts have said that \n     the new law would bring increased paperwork, raising the cost \n     of filing bankruptcy and making it more difficult for low-\n     income families to take advantage of it.\n       The problems seem small, however, in relation to the worthy \n     principle that would be strengthened. Anyone who can repay \n     his debts should do so. Period, Bankruptcy should not be an \n     easy out for people who live it up beyond their means. The \n     proposed legislation would redirect the law to cut off their \n     escape route.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before we have a quorum call, I have a \nmessage from Senator Sessions, that Senator Sessions is willing to have \nme yield back our time on our side if Senator Feingold is willing to \nyield back the time on his side.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. With that understanding, I yield back my remaining \ntime.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We yield back the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Would the Chair \ninform the Senators how much time remains? It is my understanding \nSenator Levin has approximately 4 minutes on his amendment. Is that \ntrue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 4 minutes for the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan and 2 minutes for the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. REID. What other time is remaining on the amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All of the other time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time running \nagainst both the majority and minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at the end of this matter we are going to \nvote on these amendments. Then we will have a managers' amendment and \nfinish the bill.\n  I want to personally express my respect for and appreciation of both \nSenators Grassley, Torricelli, and others for the hard work they have \ndone in bringing this bill through the subcommittee and through the \nJudiciary Committee and on to the floor. Senator Sessions has been a \nvery solid supporter of good bankruptcy legislation, as well as others \non the Judiciary Committee--I hate to leave anybody out--but especially \nSenators Grassley and Torricelli. They deserve a lot of respect for \nwhat was a very difficult bill to bring through even a subcommittee, \nlet alone the full committee and the floor.\n  I am hopeful we will get this bill all the way through and signed by \nthe President. It is a bill that will make a great deal of difference \nin everybody's lives and, I think, will set the bankruptcy code in the \ndirection it should go and stop some of the fraud and some of the \nmisuses of bankruptcy that are going on currently in our bankruptcy \nsystem.\n  There are some things we will have to work on in conference; there is \nno question about that. We will try to perfect this bill as best we \ncan, hopefully, so that both sides are pleased with it. There are some \nproblems that naturally do exist, but we will work with our friends on \nthe other side and see what we can do to resolve any conflicts we have.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished ranking member on the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy. He and his staff have played an excellent \nrole, along with the staffs of Senators Grassley and Torricelli, in \nhelping to bring this about.\n  I thank my own staff for the work they have done. All of these staff \nmembers have worked diligently to do what is a very good job on \nbankruptcy.\n  Having said that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are 4 minutes remaining for the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I yield those to the Senator from Vermont, ranking member \nof the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I intend to vote for the Bankruptcy Reform \nAct to send it to conference in the hope that we can continue to \nimprove the bill so that a balanced bankruptcy reform bill can be \nsigned into law by President Clinton this year.\n  We have adopted 45 amendments during the floor debate on this bill--\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\namendments offered by Republicans and Democrats.\n  During the course of our floor debate, Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle have come forward to made bipartisan progress to improve this \nbill from that reported by the Judiciary Committee. I want to thank \nChairman Hatch and Senator Grassley for working with us, with me and \nSenator Reid and Senator Torricelli, and with the proponents of many \namendments. This debate has not been easy with more than 300 amendments \nfiled to the bill back in November. We have worked through those \namendments.\n  Let there be no confusion: This is certainly not the bill that I \nwould have drafted, even now after the amendment process. This is not \nas good or as balanced a bill as that which the Senate passed by a 97 \nto one vote in 1998. Still, it has been significantly improved in its \nbankruptcy provisions through a bipartisan amendment process.\n  We have worked in good faith with the Republican managers to have an \nopen debate. This is how the Senate works and how it should work. From \na total of 320 amendments, we have now worked through them all. That is \na bipartisan accomplishment of which we can all be proud.\n  I have tried during the course of this consideration to protect the \nrights of Democratic Senators to offer and debate their amendments. \nWhile we have not always prevailed after a vote, we have at least been \nfaithful to our Senate tradition and preserved the opportunity to \noffer, debate and vote in relation to those amendments.\n  In some significant regard, we have been successful in improving this \nbill. Over the course of the last three years we have been able to help \nreshape the bill to protect child support payments as a priority in \nbankruptcy.\n  We added modest but essential credit industry reforms to the bill. \nThe millions of credit card solicitations made to American consumers \nthe past few years have caused, in part, the rise in consumer \nbankruptcies. The credit card industry should bear some responsibility \nfor these problems. The improvements to the Truth In Lending Act that \nwe have been able to add to this measure provide for more disclosure of \ninformation so that consumers may better manage their debts and avoid \nbankruptcy altogether.\n  We adopted other important amendments to improve the bill, as well. \nIndeed, we adopted amendments during Senate debate on this bill. I want \nto list just a few of these important amendments for the record.\n  The Senate overwhelmingly voted to close the homestead exemption \nloophole in the Bankruptcy Code. By a vote of 76 to 22, the Senate \nadopted the Kohl-Sessions amendment to cap any homestead exemption at \n$100,000. In States such as Florida and Texas, debtors have been \npermitted to take an unlimited exemption from their creditors for the \nvalue of their home. This has lead wealthy debtors to abuse their State \nlaws to protect million dollar mansions from creditors. This has been a \nreal abuse of bankruptcy's fresh start protection.\n  We adopted the Leahy-Murray-Feinstein amendment to clarify that \nexpenses to protect victims of domestic abuse are necessary expenses in \na bankruptcy proceeding. We adopted a Feingold amendment to clarify the \nlong-term expenses of a debtor caring for a nondependent parent or \nrelative are necessary expenses in a bankruptcy proceeding. We adopted \nthe Kennedy amendment to protect a debtor's Social Security benefits in \na bankruptcy proceeding. These are good amendments that improve the \nbill.\n  We adopted the Grassley-Torricelli-Specter-Feingold-Biden amendment \nto provide bankruptcy judges with the discretion to waive filing fees \nfor low-come debtors. Bankruptcy is the only civil proceeding without \nin forma pauperis filing status and this amendment corrects that \nanomaly. And we adopted the Feingold-Specter amendment that struck the \nbill's requirement that a debtor's attorney must pay a trustee's \nattorney fees if the debtor is not ``substantially justified'' in \nfiling for chapter 7. That requirement could have discouraged honest \ndebtors from filing for chapter 7 for fear of paying future attorney \nfees. Together these amendments improve the fairness of bankruptcy \nproceedings.\n  We adopted the Leahy amendment that struck the bill's mandate for all \ndebtors to file past tax returns and instead permits parties in \ninterest to request tax information if needed. The wasteful provision \nstricken by my amendment should save taxpayers an estimated $24 million \nover the next five years by cutting down on unnecessary storage costs \nand paperwork burdens.\n  We adopted the Reed-Sessions amendment to protect debtors by giving \nthem adequate information for decisions about reaffirmations of \nunsecured and low-value secured debt. We adopted the Sarbanes-Durbin \namendment on disclosure of consumer credit information.\n  Forty-three amendments were adopted to the Committee bill, many made \nimportant improvements, many on a bipartisan basis.\n  Unfortunately, while we made progress on the underlying bill in many \nregards, it still lacks the balance that it needs to become good law \nand remains tilted too far toward making taxpayers and the bankruptcy \ncourts pay for the excesses of the credit industry. It is my hope that \nwith the help of the Administration and the continuing cooperation of \nChairman Hatch and Senator Grassley and our House counterparts that we \ncan continue to improve this measure during the course of a House-\nSenate conference and report a consensus bill that we can all proudly \nsupport.\n  Most threatening to the prospects of this bill becoming law are the \nnonrelevant, nongermane amendments adopted last November to this bill. \nLast year, Senate adoption of those nonrelevant, nongermane amendments \nquite properly led to a presidential veto threat. I will work in the \nHouse-Senate conference to have those amendments removed from the \nconference report and final bill. If they are not, I have grave doubt \nwhether any bankruptcy reform bill can become law this year.\n  Regrettably the Senate rejected the Kennedy amendment to provide a \nreal minimum wage increase and, on a virtual party line vote, chose to \nadopt an amendment that includes unpaid tax breaks and a watered down \nincrement in the minimum wage for working people. The President noted \nthat the Republican majority used its amendment ``as a cynical tool to \nadvance special interest tax breaks.''\n  Last year, the Senate also adopted by a one-vote margin, a poison \npill amendment regarding sentencing policy. I opposed this amendment \nbecause it attempted to solve the unfair discrepancy between sentences \nfor powder and crack cocaine in precisely the wrong way--by increasing \nthe use of mandatory minimums for those who possess, import, \nmanufacture, or distribute powder cocaine, without taking any steps to \nreduce the use of disproportionate mandatory minimums for those who \ncommit crack cocaine offenses.\n  I have repeatedly stated my objections to the shortsighted use of \nmandatory minimums in the battle against illegal drugs, and my \nobjections are all the more grave when an attempt is made to increase \nthe use of mandatory minimums through provisions placed in the middle \nof a unrelated bill offered at the end of a session. Returning to the \nfailed drug policies of the recent past is not the way to enact a fair \nand balanced bankruptcy reform bill.\n  The bipartisan methamphetamine legislation included in that amendment \nwas passed separately at the end of the last session. Accordingly, the \nonly portion of that amendment worth voting for has already been passed \nseparately. That nonrelevant, nongermane amendment should also be \njettisoned in conference.\n  The Senate's actions last year in adopting the two Republican \nnonrelevant and nongermane amendments were both unfortunate and unwise. \nI hope the House-Senate conference committee will discard these two \npoison pill amendments as we craft a final bankruptcy reform bill that \ncan become law.\n  I look forward to working with the Senate and House conferees to \nimprove the Bankruptcy Reform Act in conference. I hope the majority \nhas learned from the mistakes made during the bankruptcy reform \nconference in the last Congress two years ago. This year, we should \nwork together to make further improvements and add balance to the \nBankruptcy Reform Act.\n  Finally, I want to commend Chairman Hatch and Senator Grassley for\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\ntheir management of this bill and thank Senator Reid, our Assistant \nDemocratic Leader, for all his effort and assistance in connection with \nthis matter.\n  Senator Grassley has persevered in this effort when lesser men would \nhave given up and he continues to work with us in good faith to craft \nreform legislation.\n  Chairman Hatch has returned to his important leadership \nresponsibilities in the Senate without missing a step. He is a \nlegislator of the first order with whom I am glad to work on many \nmatters. Today we culminate our work together on initial Senate passage \nof the Bankruptcy Reform Act so that we can continue our efforts in a \nHouse-Senate conference.\n  Senator Reid has worked with me to protect the rights of Democratic \nSenators and to improve the bill. I have thanked him many times in the \ndays and weeks that we have been on the Senate floor together working \nto improve this bill and do so, again, today.\n  I look forward to working together with Chairman Hatch, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Torricelli, the House conferees, and the Clinton \nAdministration on a conference report that leads to enactment of a fair \nand balanced Bankruptcy Reform Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we yield back the remainder of the time \non our side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We will on this side, too.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2763\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By previous agreement, the amendment pending \nis on the Schumer amendment No. 2763, with 4 minutes equally divided \nfor final argument and explanation. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New York is \ncoming to the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum until we start \nthe 2 minutes of debate on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator \nfrom New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I reiterate to my colleagues how \nimportant this amendment is. Six years ago, the rule of law was \nchallenged in this country because some who believed that they had more \nmoral authority than the rest of us could take the law into their own \nhands and commit acts of violence against clinics, against doctors, \nagainst health care workers. They could harass; they could threaten; \nthey could blockade, because they thought they had more moral authority \nthan the rest of us.\n  The FACE law, a bipartisan law even supported by Henry Hyde, caused \nthat violence to decline significantly. Now they have found a new way \nagainst these clinics; that is, once a judgment is made against them \nbecause they have violated the law, to hide behind the false shield of \nbankruptcy.\n  We will see violence increase. We will see a woman's right to choose \nimpinged upon if we don't pass the Schumer-Reid-Snowe-Jeffords \namendment. This is not an issue of simply pro-choice or pro-life. This \nis an issue about violence against women. This is an issue about the \nrule of law in America. I urge my colleagues to support the Schumer \namendment and preserve a woman's right to make her own decision on the \nissue of choice.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, many Members have come to different \nconclusions as to the need for this amendment concerning the \ndischargeability of debts related to abortion clinic violence. It is \nclear from today's debate, nobody in the Congress supports violence at \nabortion clinics, or at any other venue. Those of us who support \nbankruptcy reform do not believe that the bankruptcy laws should be \nused to shield any acts of violence.\n  Many of us believe that current law already precludes those found \nguilty of violent activities at abortion clinics from discharging debts \narising from such activity in bankruptcy. But apparently the sponsors \nof the amendment believe there is more than can be done in this area.\n  Although I believe this amendment to be tremendously flawed, the \nmajority leader, Senator Grassley, and I recommend that members on both \nsides vote for this amendment. We will, in good faith, in conference \ncorrect the amendment and resolve these problems at that time. With \nthis amendment accepted, nobody will be able to politically demagogue \nthis issue in the context of true bankruptcy reform.\n  We pledge to work with our friends on both sides of the aisle who are \ninterested in this issue during conference to make sure that the law is \nclear, that with due respect for the first amendment, debts arising \nfrom violent acts cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. They have not.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (when his name was called).

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I did want to thank the Presiding Officer. I know he has \nhad a busy day and evening and night. I thank him for coming back and \njoining those of us who supported this amendment.\n  I will not object.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered. There \nremains 4 minutes equally divided on the Feingold amendment.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment is designed to lessen the \nharsh effects of section 311 of the bill on tenants, while at the same \ntime protecting the legitimate financial interests of landlords.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, could we have order in the Chamber, \nplease?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Senators will cease audible conversation. Even on \nthe dais.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, current law provides for an automatic \nstay of eviction proceedings upon the filing of a bankruptcy case. \nLandlords can apply for relief from that stay so eviction can proceed, \nbut under current law the process often takes several months. Section \n311 of the bill eliminates the stay in all landlord-tenant cases so \neviction can proceed immediately.\n  My amendment would allow tenants to remain in their apartments as \nthey try to sort out the difficult consequences of bankruptcy, if and \nonly if they are willing to pay the rent that comes due after they file \nfor bankruptcy. If the tenant fails to pay the rent, the stay can be \nlifted 15 days after the landlord provides notice to the court that the \nrent has not been paid. So no hearing and no delay. If the reason for \nthe eviction is drug use or property damage, the stay can also be \nlifted after 15 days. Under the amendment, this 15-day notice period \ndoes not apply if the tenant has filed for bankruptcy previously. In \nother words, in the case of repeat filings, the automatic stay would \nnever take effect, just as under section 311 in the bill.\n  Under my amendment, therefore, you could never live rent free as some \nof the opponents suggest. The debtor has to pay rent after filing for \nbankruptcy. If a debtor misses a rent payment, the stay will be lifted \nafter 15 days. So the amendment gets at the abuse and it protects the \nrights and economic interests of the landlord. What it does eliminate \nis the punitive aspect of the bill. We have modified this so it is \nfair. The major reform in favor of landlords still holds, but there has \nto be some fairness and balance with regard to the effect of the bill \non evictions. That is what I am trying to protect through this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The time allotted to the \ndistinguished Senator has expired. The Senator from Iowa is recognized \nfor 2 minutes. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield my time to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. You got it right.\n  Mr. President, I must register my strongest opposition to this \namendment. It continues the one thing that causes so much grief. It \nmakes a Federal case out of eviction proceedings. We know that in Los \nAngeles 3,886 bankruptcy cases were filed in 1996 simply to delay the \neviction cases that were pending in the State court. In other words, if \nyou file for eviction, under the current law when a person files \nbankruptcy, that eviction case is stayed. It then goes to bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  The landlord, many of whom are individual people without great \nwealth, have already hired a lawyer to handle the eviction and now has \nto hire a Federal court bankruptcy lawyer to go into Federal court. \nAfter they win, as they always do because an expired lease is not an \nasset of the estate and cannot be subject to the control of the \nbankruptcy judge, they have to then go back to State court, ask the \nState judge to pick up the litigation, and proceed.\n  The 15-days that the Senator suggests is better than his first \namendment, but it does in no way deny the person from going to Federal \ncourt. They can then have a hearing after the 15 days. They can contest \nwhether the tenant used drugs or not in Federal court. They are \nevicting them from the apartment because of drug use or other reasons.\n  We simply should not do this. The true fact is that eventually all \nthese contests in bankruptcy court are eventually lost. Why go through \nthe process? Let the State court eviction proceedings hold sway and \nmake the decisions where they have always been made.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The yeas and nays have been \nrequested. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2748, as modified. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Under a previous order, there are 4 minutes \ndivided on the Levin amendment. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my amendment very simply provides that gun \nmanufacturers or distributors cannot evade responsibility for damages \nwhich are caused by their reckless or negligent conduct or their \nfraudulent conduct by reorganizing in bankruptcy.\n  The question has been raised, why single out one industry? The answer \nis, there are 18 exemptions in the bankruptcy law. We have singled out \n18 different instances where public policy is such that we have decided \npeople should not be able to discharge their debts. For instance, \nstudents who take out student loans cannot discharge their obligations \nin bankruptcy. So where public policy indicates we should say something \nis not dischargeable, we have done that on 18 different occasions.\n  This amendment is strongly supported by the League of Cities and by \nthe Conference of Mayors. About 30 cities have initiated lawsuits, \ncities from all parts of the country: New Orleans, Chicago, Atlanta, \nCleveland, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and San Francisco being among them.\n  This is a response to a tactic which is being used by a number of gun \nmanufacturers that are being sued for reckless or negligent or \nfraudulent conduct, saying: No, we are going to hold you accountable. \nYou cannot reorganize\n\n[[Page S249]]\n\nyourself in bankruptcy out of accountability and responsibility for the \ndamages that have been caused by your own reckless or negligent \nconduct.\n  I hope this amendment will pass. It has the support of the Violence \nPolicy Center which points out that the gun industry is the only \nindustry that is exempt from Federal health and safety regulations. \nThere is no other industry explicitly exempt except for firearms \nmanufacturers. Insisting they not be able to escape liability for their \nown reckless or negligent conduct is certainly in keeping with the \nexemption they sought from Federal health and safety regulations since \njudicial liability is the only way in which they can be held \naccountable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have said before, this amendment bars \nfirearm manufacturers and sellers, including retailers, from business \nreorganization under the bankruptcy code by not allowing the discharge \nof debts that might result from one of these recently filed tort suits. \nThat means a major retailer could go bankrupt and would not be able to \nreorganize to be able to pay off their debts. It would just gradually \nbe sold off to meet the needs of this particular amendment. \nManufacturers that could pay off injured parties substantially in full \nover time would simply not be able to do so under this amendment. \nInstead, they would be forced into liquidation.\n  It is both poor policy and a dangerous precedent to single out an \nunpopular industry for unfavorable treatment under the bankruptcy code. \nThis is political correctness gone awry. As I recall, there are 18 \nexemptions on the personal side but none on the corporate side in this \nbill so far. Let us keep the bankruptcy laws nondiscriminatory in the \nsense of attacking and loading it up on an unpopular business just for \npolitical purposes. That is the wrong political correctness to be used. \nIn this particular case, it just doesn't make sense. We ought to want \nthem to go into reorganization so the debts could be paid and the \nbusiness might be able to survive. That is why this amendment needs to \nbe voted down.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH.

The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill (S. 625) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and \nwas read the third time.\n\n\n                         bankruptcy judgeships\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Judicial Conference recommends that \nCongress authorize 24 new bankruptcy judgeship positions in districts \nwhere bankruptcy filings and judicial caseloads are particularly \nburdensome. S. 625 authorizes 18 of these judgeships; these same \npositions were included in the conference report to the bankruptcy \nlegislation in the 105th Congress. S. 625 does not, however, include \nsix positions that the Judicial Conference submitted to Congress on \nMarch 24, 1999.\n  I thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight \nand the Courts for working so closely with me in my efforts to include \nthese judges in the pending legislation. The chairman conducted a joint \nhearing with the House Judiciary Committee on November 2, 1999 to \nconsider these six additional judgeships and has given them appropriate \nscrutiny. I have consulted with the Chairman both before and after this \nhearing regarding these judgeships, and I believe I have his commitment \nto address these positions when S. 625 is conferenced with the House.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Senator from Georgia will yield. I can assure \nhim that during the conference with the House on S. 625, I will in good \nfaith address the Judicial Conference's recommendation for the \nadditional judgeships. The hearing in November was indeed useful in \nhelping us assess the merits of authorizing these additional \njudgeships. Subsequent to that hearing, my staff and I have engaged in \ndiscussions with the Administrative Office to clarify some remaining \nquestions and concerns. I can report that most of my requests have been \nsatisfactorily addressed. However, I am still awaiting some additional \ninformation, and so I am reluctant to add these positions to S. 625 at \nthis time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chairman for his efforts and assurances. \nAs a fiscal conservative myself, I understand and appreciate his \ndedication to ensuring that these positions are truly warranted.\n  One of these new judgeships would help address a judicial caseload \nproblem in Georgia. This new position would actually provide relief to \ntwo Georgia districts where caseloads far exceed the national average. \nBy authorizing a new judgeship for the Southern District, an existing \njudgeship that is currently split between the Southern and Middle \ndistricts would move full-time to the Middle District.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator for his statement and for his \nefforts in moving this issue forward.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my concern over \nthe bankruptcy bill that is before the Senate. I do this not because I \nam an expert on bankruptcy law, but because I have been involved with \nsocial policy for almost a half-century and can tell you that this is \nno way to reform the bankruptcy system.\n  A May 9, 1999, New York Times editorial said that the House bill is \n``bankruptcy reform that spares the wealthy . . . and makes life harder \nfor poor and middle-class people who file for bankruptcy.'' \nRepresentative Henry Hyde (R-IL) said the bill is ``truly tilted toward \nthe creditors.'' The Senate bill is not much better. The effect of the \nbill is not complicated--the wealthy benefit, the poor suffer. After \nthe President signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nAct of 1996--the so-called welfare reform bill--I stated that ``this \nact terminates the basic Federal commitment of support for dependent \nchildren in hopes of altering the behavior of their mothers.'' That \nbill broke the Social Contract of the 1930s. We would care for the \nelderly, the unemployed, the dependent children. Drop the latter;\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\nwatch the others fall. We broke the social contract then, and will \nagain if this bill passes.\n  We were born a nation of debtors. A large number of early European \nsettlers came here indentured. The British rejection of debtor relief \nlaws in Massachusetts and Virginia was one of the precipitating factors \nof the Revolutionary War. In justifying its actions, the British Board \nof Trade noted that 9 out of every 10 creditors resided in Great \nBritain--the Americans were the debtors. Shays' Rebellion, which \nfollowed the War of Independence, was a direct response by farmers to \nthe courts' attempt to imprison fellow farmers for their debts.\n  Daniel Webster understood the tension and possible dangers that could \narise between debtor and creditor. Speaking in Congress on the \nBankruptcy Act of 1841, the Massachusetts statesman remarked on the \npost-Revolutionary crisis:\n\n       The relation between debtor and creditors, always delicate, \n     and always dangerous, whenever it divides society, and draws \n     out the respective parties into different ranks and classes, \n     was in such condition in the years 1787, 1788, and 1789 as to \n     threaten the overthrow of all government; and a revolution \n     was menaced, much more critical and alarming than that \n     through which the country had recently passed.\n\n  In an attempt to address the relationship between debtor and \ncreditor, the U.S. Constitution was adopted with explicit bankruptcy \nauthority granted to Congress. Congress came up with the Bankruptcy Act \nof 1800, which was similar to the English law in effect at the time of \nindependence. The 1800 Act was repealed in 1803. One of the unfortunate \nstories from this period was that of Robert Morris, who had the honor \nto sign the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederacy, \nand the U.S. Constitution. After creating the budget for the early \nAmerican government and heading the Yorktown campaign, he experienced \nconsiderable misfortune speculating on land out West, incurring debts \nthat landed him in Philadelphia's Prune Street Jail from 1798 to 1801. \nMorris was eventually relieved by the Bankruptcy Act of 1800.\n  Following the devastating Panic of 1837, the controversial Bankruptcy \nAct of 1841 became law. It was repealed 18 months later. The 1841 Act \nfor the first time in British or American law allowed the debtor to \nfile for bankruptcy. Until this time, only creditors could put a debtor \ninto bankruptcy, which made it easier to collect their debts. Although \nthe Supreme Court did not address the 1841 Act before it was repealed \nin 1843 because of political resistance, its constitutionality was \nupheld at the circuit level, bringing voluntary bankruptcy by non-\nmerchants within the scope of Congress' bankruptcy power.\n  Under the 1841 Act, 33,739 debtors were adjudicated bankrupt, of whom \nonly 765 were denied a discharge. (If you were to declare bankruptcy in \nIllinois, your attorney very likely would have been Abraham Lincoln.)\n  The panic of 1857 and the devastation of the Civil War brought \nenactment of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, repealed in 1878. The 1867 Act \nallowed the debtor to retain increased exempt property under state or \nFederal exemptions and required a 50 percent distribution to creditors \nand creditor consent as preconditions to a discharge. But, the 1867 Act \ncontained so many grounds for denying discharge that fewer than one-\nthird of the debtors filing under the Act ever received one discharge.\n\n  These three laws were born and died amid controversy. But taken \ntogether, they contained grand innovations that greatly helped ordinary \nAmerican debtors: Individual debtors were given voluntary access to \nbankruptcy relief, to broader state exemptions, and to the discharge of \ntheir debts with less creditor approval.\n  The Bankruptcy Act of 1898, largely with us today in concept although \nsupplanted by the 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act and subsequent amendments, \nconsolidated and improved many of these innovations for the benefit of \ndebtors.\n  In 1934 the United States Supreme Court encapsulated the American \nview toward the discharge of individual debtors through bankruptcy as \nfollows:\n\n       One of the primary purposes of the Bankruptcy Act is to \n     relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive \n     indebtedness and permit him to start afresh free from the \n     obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business \n     misfortunes. This purpose of the act has been again and again \n     emphasized by the courts as being of public as well as \n     private interest, in that it gives to the honest but \n     unfortunate debtor who surrenders for distribution the \n     property which he owns at the time of bankruptcy, a new \n     opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, \n     unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing \n     debt.\n\n  America is truly the land of the second chance. To repeat the Supreme \nCourt, our nation believes in a bankruptcy system that ``gives the \nhonest but unfortunate debtor who surrenders for distribution the \nproperty which he owns at the time of bankruptcy, a new opportunity in \nlife and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure \nand discouragement of pre-existing debt.'' This nation has been blessed \nwith a hard-working, independent, creative, and risk-taking citizenry. \nWe also have embraced a free-market economy that has brought us great \nwealth and prosperity. But with this economic system comes great risks \n(and opportunities) for our citizens, and relatively meager safety nets \nare provided. The fresh start that bankruptcy provides is one of those \nsafety nets. Let's not shred that safety net with this bill.\n  The bill before us contains an arbitrary means test that makes it \nharder for low to moderate income people to wipe out their debts and \nstart clean, includes provisions favoring the credit card industry, \nprovides inadequate consumer protections, incorporates insufficient \nprivacy safeguards, and will have a disproportionately negative impact \non individuals with lower incomes, minorities, and older Americans.\n  This bill punishes the wrong people. We seem hell-bent to punish \nelderly people who incur unexpected health bills or individuals who \nunexpectedly lose their jobs. Instead, why don't we address the credit \ncard industry's predatory practices? Credit card issuers mailed out \n3.45 billion--not million but billion--solicitation letters last year. \nProfessor Elizabeth Warner of Harvard Law School said that banks make \nso much money on unpaid credit card balances--thanks to interest rates \nmuch higher than those of home mortgages, car loans or other forms of \n``secured'' debt--that they deliberately lure people into borrowing \nbeyond their means. Now, they are trying to get Congress to rig rules \nso their own loan losses will be reduced. This is special interest \nlegislation at its worst.\n  Locke wrote that government has a fiduciary responsibility to act in \nthe best interest of the people. If we pass this bill, we will be \nbreaching that duty and undermining the fundamental sense that our \ngovernment is founded on the twin principles of decency and fairness, a \nunique system that believes in extending a helping hand rather than a \nboot across the throat.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate has been debating, S. 625, the \nbankruptcy reform bill for weeks. I am happy to say that many \nDemocratic amendments have been accepted which have brought much needed \nbalance to the bill.\n  The issue of bankruptcy is a highly technical and convoluted area of \nour law replete with terms like cram downs, reaffirmations, panel \ntrustees, automatic stays, nondischargeable debt, priority debt, \nsecured debt, and even something known as a ``superdischarge.''\n  And the bankruptcy code is not only complex and arcane. It is the \nfulcrum point of a delicate balance. When you push one thing, almost \ninvariably something else will give. That's because no matter how hard \nyou try there is a limited resource pie. All we do many times is \nincrease the fighting over the small pie--and usually no one really \nwins that fight.\n  The Senate made several improvements to ease the burdens on low \nincome debtors while making sure that wealthy debtors pay their fair \nshare. The Senate adopted my amendment to allow debtors to attend \nmandatory credit counseling by telephone or over the Internet, which \nwill make it easier for debtors with transportation difficulties. By \nadopting a cap on the homestead exemption of $100,000, Congress will \ncontinue the longstanding policy of giving a debtor a fresh start--not \na windfall.\n  Improvements were also made to make the bill more cost effective and \nless expensive for taxpayers. My\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\namendment to streamline the means test for debtors between 100 and 150% \nof the median income was adopted and will save the taxpayers $8 million \na year in administrative costs. In addition, Senator Leahy's amendment \nto exempt certain debtors from the requirement of filing 3 years of tax \nreturns will reduce both costs and undue burdens on low income debtors.\n  Finally, tremendous progress was made on the bill in the area of \ncredit card disclosure. If we are going to make it harder for people to \nfile for bankruptcy, then we need to provide them enough information to \nensure they are making informed decisions about their credit.\n  I was happy to join Senator Sarbanes in an effort to require \ncreditors to warn consumers about interest costs and provide toll free \nnumbers where debtors can learn how long it will take to eliminate a \ncredit card balance by making only the minimum monthly payment.\n  I will be watching the bankruptcy conference closely to ensure that \nall of the hard fought amendments adopted on the Senate floor remain in \nthe bill through conference. If these provisions are stripped out in \nconference, then this bill will likely face the same fate as last \nyear's bill--it will never become law.\n\n  Because of improvements in areas of concern to me, I will vote for \nthe underlying bankruptcy legislation, but I want to make clear my \nopposition to the Republican minimum wage measure. It was clear from \nlast year's debate and it's clear today that the Republican minimum \nwage does little to help America's lowest wage earners. In fact, it's a \nslap in the face for all of our hardworking citizens who strive every \nday to lift themselves out of poverty and into a better way of life.\n  Over the next three years, a minimum wage worker would receive over \n$1,200 less under the GOP version than the Democratic proposal. Let's \nbreak that down, Mr. President, into real terms. For America's lowest \nwage earners: $1,200 a year translates into over four months worth of \ngroceries, over three months of rent, almost half a year worth of \nutilities. For the lucky ones, that's one full year of tuition and fees \nat a two-year college. Yet, the Republicans want to deny their \nconstituents this opportunity and I can't understand why.\n  Mr. President, this Republican minimum wage proposal sounds vaguely \nfamiliar to us. You may recall how the other side of the aisle tried to \nstretch out tax refunds for our lowest income workers under the Earned \nIncome Tax Credit. We grant tax relief to those that need it most and \nthen the Republicans turn around and try to delay their refunds. These \ntypes of delaying tactics didn't work for the EITC and they certainly \nwon't work for an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Something I've heard very little about, and maybe it's because the \nRepublicans don't want you to know about it, is Section Two of their \namendment that effectively repeals overtime pay provisions of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act that have been the law for over 60 years. This \nprovision would eliminate the requirement that bonuses, commissions, \nand other compensations based on productivity, quality, and efficiency \nbe considered part of a worker's ``regular rate'' of pay for purposes \nof calculating overtime pay. Because overtime pay is based on one and a \nhalf times regular pay, overtime pay is lower if a worker's regular pay \nis lower. Today, almost 73 million Americans are entitled to overtime \npay and the GOP provision jeopardizes their overtime benefits. Think \nabout it. If employers can pay less for overtime, they have a financial \nincentive to require workers to work overtime without getting the pay \nthey deserve. That's another slap in the face on top of the one they \nget from this half-hearted attempt to raise their wages from $5.15 an \nhour.\n  Mr. President, it's clear that the Democratic bill would do a better \njob at getting a pay increase to those who need it most. On our side of \nthe aisle, we believe it's not only our obligation, but our duty to \nhelp those who need it the most. It is my hope that the conference \ncommittee will wake up and remedy this malady that will be imposed on \nthe American people by the Republicans should this bill become law.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking my \ncolleagues, Senators Torricelli and Grassley, for their leadership in \nputting together the bankruptcy legislation that is before us today. I \nwas one of the co-sponsors of the initial bankruptcy bill and continue \nto support the legislation that is before us today. I'm concerned, \nhowever, that we are including a tax provision which runs counter to \nthe entire essence of the bill.\n  As we finish debate on this measure, we ought to focus on one \noverriding theme: responsibility. In the context of bankruptcy, this \nincludes both financial and social responsibility. Debtors need to be \nmore responsible when making decisions about purchasing goods or \nservices. And just as we expect those who purchase goods and services \nto pay for these benefits, we expect lenders and sellers to be \nresponsible in their business practices. This is going to be a \ndifficult balancing act--both sides are going to have to give a little \nbit. Right now, I hope that we are closer to fixing many of the \nproblems that needed to be addressed.\n  Financial responsibility, however, is not just relevant for our \ndebate today--it needs to become a theme for this Congress. This \nbankruptcy bill is based on a simple premise: if you are able to pay \nyour debts, you should. I believe this premise should also be applied \nto the federal government. For decades, the government spent more than \nit took in. It ran up a $5 trillion debt. We are now in a position to \npay our debts. Before we go on a massive tax-cutting or spending binge, \nwe should focus on reducing our debt. It rings hollow for us to insist \nupon financial responsibility from individuals and then fail to \nexercise financial responsibility ourselves.\n  We should start this session exercising fiscal restraint, and we \nshould begin with this bill. It is ironic that this bill contains a tax \ncut that costs more than it should and fails to hit its target. \nAlthough the tax package contained in this bill is being described as \nhelping small businesses, it is poorly targeted and will provide little \nhelp to the businesses that will be most affected by the minimum wage \nbill.\n  If minimum wage legislation continues to move forward, I urge my \ncolleagues to look once again at S. 1867, The Small Business Tax \nReduction Act of 1999, the bill that Senator Baucus and I introduced \nlast November. This tax package offers real relief to those employers \nwho will be most affected by the minimum wage increase. That was the \npurpose of the minimum wage tax bill, and our bill accomplishes that \ngoal.\n  For instance, our bill would accelerate the full deduction for self-\nemployed health insurance so that it takes effect immediately instead \nof delaying it for several more years. Our bill would increase the \nexpensing limit for small businesses so they can purchase new and \nbetter equipment. We would also raise the business meals deduction from \n50% to 60% to help restaurants accommodate increased labor costs.\n  At the same time, we would provide estate tax relief for small \nfamily-owned farms and businesses. Death is an inappropriate catalyst \nfor the forced sale of a family-held business or farm. Farmers would \nbenefit as our bill would be sure that income averaging does not \nincrease a farmer's potential Alternative Minimum Tax liability. We \nalso provide farmers with a longer period to use their net operating \nlosses if they have them. These are real tax provisions that help real \npeople.\n  The Small Business Tax Reduction Act of 1999 also contains provisions \ntargeted to geographic areas with the greatest need of economic \nassistance. The New Markets proposal, for example, would reward \nemployers who operate in economically distressed areas, where the \nminimum wage is the most prevalent. It also includes a credit that \nencourages employers to give their lower income employees information \ntechnology training. We also expand current empowerment zones credits \nso that more communities and more people are able to take advantage of \nthese credits. These are all provisions that will provide assistance to \nareas that are most in need of help.\n  Moreover, the pension provisions in our bill are designed to address \nthe needs of small employers struggling to\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\ndevelop effective retirement plans for their employees. For example, we \nwould allow small businesses to take plan loans as large businesses \ncan, and we have included Senator Baucus' proposal to provide a credit \nfor new small business pension plans. Everyone benefits when small \nbusinesses are better able to offer their employees retirement plans.\n  In short, the tax package I offered accomplishes the purpose of \nproviding relief to those employers who will have higher costs when the \nminimum wage increases. And it is responsible. It does not squander the \nsurplus that we have fought so hard to achieve, but rather maintains it \nfor debt reduction. At the same time, it protects Social Security Trust \nFunds from being misallocated to other programs and expenditures. The \ntax package that is currently contained in the bill is not responsible \nand must be substantially improved in conference. We are going to face \nseveral tough issues this year. I hope that our colleagues agree that \nthis is the time to start.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my guarded support \nfor the Bankruptcy Reform Act currently before the Senate. The \ntroubling and dramatic rise in the number of bankruptcy filings demands \nour careful attention, and this legislation--if balanced and fair--will \nshore up the most significant cracks in our current system, but still \ngrant a ``fresh start'' to those debtors who truly deserve it.\n  One of the ways this bill works to eliminate the most egregious \nabuses of the bankruptcy code is by finally placing a federal cap on \nthe unlimited homestead exemption. This provision, which I introduced \nwith Senators Sessions and Grassley, would close an inexcusable \nloophole which currently allows millionaire deadbeats to keep their \nluxury homes while their legitimate creditors get left out in the cold. \nA cap is not only the best policy, it sends the best message: that \nbankruptcy is a tool of last resort, not a tool for financial planning.\n  And don't just take my word for it: ask my colleagues in the Senate. \nAt the end of last session, we passed our $100,000 homestead cap by an \noverwhelming margin of 76-22.\n  However Mr. President, if this legislation comes out of Conference \nunbalanced, rest assured that I will be happy to vote against final \npassage of the bill, as I did last Congress. A major factor in my \ndetermination of what constitutes ``balance'' will be the status of the \nhomestead cap.\n  That said, I support this bill today because I believe it will repair \nand improve our bankruptcy system, and help restore the stigma to \nbankruptcy. But without the homestead cap, this bill will likely fall \nshort of its goal.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in the 105th Congress, the Senate passed a \nmeaningful bankruptcy reform bill by an almost unanimous vote. I voted \nfor that bill because I thought it was a well-balanced reform bill that \nwould discourage abuse of the system and provide enhanced protections \nand reasonable information to consumers. The final version of that bill \nwas not approved in the 105th Congress, and so, once again, we engaged \nin debate over how to restructure the nation's bankruptcy laws. When we \nstarted debate on this bill, it was substantially different from the \nmoderate, bi-partisan bill of last Congress. I was particularly \nconcerned with the provisions relative to the means-test and consumer \ncredit card disclosures. However, over the course of this debate, the \nSenate has adopted more than 40 amendments, making this a more \nreasonable approach to bankruptcy reform.\n  As reported out of the Judiciary Committee, the bankruptcy reform \nbill did not include consumer protections providing reasonable \ndisclosures of unsecured credit such as credit cards. Studies show that \nbankruptcy filings increase as household debt increases. High debt-to-\nincome ratios makes working Americans more vulnerable to financial \nemergencies. I am pleased that the Senate accepted an amendment to \nprovide enhanced access to consumer credit information. Creditors will \nbe responsible for warning debtors about potential dangers of paying \nonly minimum monthly payments and will make a toll free number \navailable to the debtor for more specific information. Although this is \nnot as helpful as the Senate's 1998 bill, it is a step in the right \ndirection. The previous bankruptcy bill gave specific information to \nconsumers about the months and years it would take for consumers to pay \noff their debts by paying the minimum payment and provided them with \ntheir total costs in interest and principle. A more detailed disclosure \nregarding minimum monthly payments will help families exercise personal \nresponsibility and limit financial vulnerability.\n  In addition, the Senate has made modest steps relative to the \nbankruptcy bill's means-test. The purpose of a means-test is to prevent \nconsumers, who can afford to repay some of their debts, from abusing \nthe system by filing for Chapter 7. Directing so-called abusive debtors \naway from Chapter 7, where debts are forgiven, and into Chapter 13, \nwhere the debtor must enter into a debt repayment plan, makes sense. \nBut an inflexible means test, with virtually no exceptions, will, in \nthe words of Henry Hyde, ``deprive debtors and their families of the \nmeans to pay for their basic needs.'' I hope that in conference, the \nSenate-House conferees will work toward establishing a more flexible \nmeans-test, one that makes allowances for basic expenses such as \ntransportation, food and rent.\n  I am pleased that two amendments I sponsored, a credit card redlining \nstudy and the prohibition of retroactive interest charges, were \naccepted by the Senate. The redlining amendment requires the Federal \nReserve to conduct a study and report to the Banking committee about \nwhether financial institutions use place of residence as a factor in \ndetermining credit worthiness. It is an important study that will bring \nto light the problem of unequal credit opportunity.\n  My other amendment seeks to clarify what credit card companies refer \nto as a ``grace period.'' Credit card lenders use complicated \ndefinitions to explain that ``grace periods'' only apply if the balance \nis paid in full. For example, assume that a consumer charges an average \nof $1000 each month and always repays in full on time. If one month, \ndue to an error he writes a check that is $10 less than the full amount \nhe owes, but which is paid on time and is within the ``grace period,'' \nhe probably would expect to pay the $10 charge and the interest on the \n$10 unpaid balance. However, he is really charged retroactively on the \nfull $1,000 balance to the date the charges were made, even though he \nhad paid 99% of the balance. This consumer's $10 error ends up costing \nhim up to four times that in interest charges.\n\n  Current practice by these companies undermines reasonable consumer \nexpectations about what how a grace period for their payment works and \nresults in monetary penalties from the application of interest charges. \nThis amendment makes clear that the definition of a grace period is one \nwhere a consumer is extended credit. No finance charge can be imposed \non the amount paid before the end of the ``grace period.''\n  I have decided to support this bill. However, I am very concerned by \nthe inclusion of non-germane tax provisions which spend $76 billion of \nthe projected non-Social Security surplus over the next ten years. \nWhile some of the provisions included in this package make sense, it is \npremature and unwise for the Congress to begin spending a surplus which \nis uncertain before we have begun to pay down the national debt and \nassured that our priorities in protecting Social Security and Medicare, \ninvesting in education, and considering other types of tax cuts have \nbeen met. For that reason, should this legislation come back from \nconference with some of these tax provisions or without the modest \namendments we adopted in the Senate, I will consider opposing the bill \nat that time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall vote in favor of S. 625, the \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, in order to restore fiscal \nresponsibility to the nation's bankruptcy code. Last year, a record 1.4 \nmillion people declared bankruptcy, which was almost triple the number \nin 1988 (549,612) and five times the number in 1980 (287,057). That the \nnumber of households in severe financial difficulty has risen so \ndramatically is perplexing, given the prosperous economy, and suggests \nthat some filers are abusing the bankruptcy code to erase debts they \nare able to pay. The dramatic rise in bankruptcy filings may also \nsuggest\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\nthat there is no longer a stigma attached to bankruptcy filers, and \nthat the bankruptcy laws are seen more as a financial planning tool \nrather than a system of last resort. This bill would curb potential \nabuses of the bankruptcy code by channeling debtors away from chapter 7 \nliquidation, where a debtor's liabilities are erased, and towards \nchapter 13 repayment, where debts are reorganized under a repayment \nplan. While I am not satisfied that this bill will decrease the \nbankruptcy rate as dramatically as advocates claim, I am convinced that \nS. 625 is a worthwhile effort in restoring fiscal responsibility.\n  However, during the bankruptcy debate, the Republican-controlled \nSenate passed an amendment that would attach $75 billion in tax cuts \nover ten years to the bankruptcy bill. These tax cuts were adopted in \nlieu of targeted cuts that would have benefitted low-income and rural \nfamilies, which I supported, and that would have been fully paid-for by \nclosing down tax loopholes that would force businesses to pay their \nfair share of taxes. Instead, the Senate adopted a tax package that \nwould not have been paid-for, and would largely benefit high-income \ntaxpayers. This means that Congress may have to borrow needed money or \ncut spending to vital programs that benefit hundred of thousands of \nWest Virginians in order to pay for these tax cuts. It is almost ironic \nthat Congress attached these unpaid-for tax cuts to the bankruptcy \nbill. Here we are today voting on a bill that would demand financial \nprudence of debtors at the same time that Congress is providing for $75 \nbillion in unpaid-for tax cuts.\n  In addition to these tax cuts, the Senate rejected a minimum wage \nproposal by Senator Kennedy, which I supported, that would have raised \nthe minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 over two years. Instead, the \nSenate adopted a one dollar rise in the minimum wage over three years \nthat was proposed by Senator Domenici. This would effectively delay a \npay raise to minimum wage workers, and cost year-round, full-time \nminimum wage workers approximately $1,200 over three years. I have \nalways supported the minimum wage because of the 11.4 million workers \nwho rely on it to support their families. The two-year minimum wage \nproposal would have provided an additional $2,000 a year for 11.4 \nmillion minimum wage workers. That $2,000 translates into an additional \nseven months of groceries, five months of rent, almost ten months of \nutilities, and eighteen months of tuition and fees at a two year \ncollege.\n  My hope and expectation is that the three year minimum wage hike and \n$75 billion tax cut provisions will be replaced with a two year minimum \nwage rise and more targeted tax package when the conferees from the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate meet in the coming months to \nwork out the differences between the House- and Senate-passed versions \nof this legislation. Consequently, I have joined with forty-four other \nsenators in sending a letter to the bankruptcy conferees urging that \nthey remove the Domenici provisions and accept the Kennedy proposal.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I voted for final passage of the \nBankruptcy Reform Act today because bankruptcy reform has been \ndesperately needed in this country and I have worked throughout my \npublic career to bring it about. This bill, however, is not without its \nproblems. It is my sincere hope that the Bankruptcy bill that emerges \nfrom the Conference Committee will be just that, a Bankruptcy Bill. I \nbelieve that the non-bankruptcy and poison pill riders that were added \nto the bill on the floor should be stripped, or at least reformed in \nConference, so that we can move forward on bankruptcy. Our country \nneeds, and we owe to our constituents, a bankruptcy bill that the \nPresident will sign.\n  Mr. President, we made various amendments to this bill which should \nbe readdressed in Conference and changed. For instance, I am pleased \nthat this body passed an increase in the minimum wage for working \nfamilies in Arkansas. However, I urge my Colleagues in Congress to \nstrengthen this provision in Conference implementing the $1.00 increase \nover two years instead of three.\n  I also support tax cuts, however, the tax cuts in this bill are not \npaid for and will do nothing to help small business and working people. \nI am especially disappointed that this body failed to pass the needed \nestate tax relief for family farms and small businesses that was \nincluded in the tax amendment offered by the Minority.\n  The Senate also agreed to an amendment during consideration of this \nbill designed to combat the spread of methamphetamine use in rural and \nurban areas. While I agree we must do something to stop the terrible \nspread of meth use in our country, I voted against that amendment \nbecause, as the language stands, it will allow federal education \nfunding to be spent for tuition at private and religious schools. \nEveryone wants to fight the scourge of drugs. Let's have a clean \namendment so we can move forward as a nation and fight against \nmethamphetamine with a concerted effort.\n  These are just a few examples of what needs to be fixed in this bill. \nIf we really want bankruptcy reform to become a reality we have to \ncraft a bill that the President will sign. Without a hard working \nconference and bipartisan efforts, this can't possibly happen. I urge \nmy colleagues to work together to bring a clean bill back from the \nconference, and to bring needed bankruptcy reform home to the American \npeople.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the underlying goal \nof the bankruptcy bill, which is to promote personal financial \nresponsibility. Bankruptcy filings have increased at an astonishing \npace since the last overhaul of the Bankruptcy Code in 1978. In 1978, \nthere were 182,000 consumer bankruptcy filings. Twenty years later in \n1998, 1,444,812 people filed for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy has become so \ncommonplace that more than one in a hundred households will file for \nbankruptcy this year.\n  The rise in bankruptcy filings is particularly disconcerting given \nthe record expansion of our economy, which this week became the longest \nexpansion in our Nation's history.\n  Bankruptcy should be a last-resort legal option, and not a vehicle \nfor avoiding personal responsibility. People should not be able to file \nbankruptcy if they can easily pay back their debts.\n  Another key aspect of bankruptcy reform is the need to address the \ngrowth of consumer credit. It's a simple matter of arithmetic. The \ntypical family filing for bankruptcy in 1998 owed more than one-and-a-\nhalf times its annual income in short-term, high-interest debt. This \nmeans the average family in bankruptcy with a median income of just \nover $17,500, and $28,955 in credit card and other short-term high \ninterest debt.\n  There are over a billion credit cards in circulation--a dozen credit \ncards for every household in the country. Three-quarters of all \nhouseholds have at least one credit card. Credit debt has doubled \nbetween 1993 and 1997 to $422 billion from just over $200 billion.\n  A constituent from Lakewood, California describes the situation \naptly: ``What really bugs me about this is that credit card companies \nsend out these solicitations for their plastic cards and then when they \nget burned, they start crying foul. They want all kinds of laws passed \nto protect them from taking hits when it's their own practices that \ncaused the problem.''\n  This legislation has taken some steps to address the problem of \nconsumer credit, but more needs to be done.\n  One of the major reasons that I am supporting the bill is that it \nincludes my amendment to require the Federal Reserve Board to \ninvestigate the practice of issuing credit cards indiscriminately, \nwithout taking steps to ensure that consumers are capable of repaying \ntheir debt, or in a manner that encourages consumers to accumulate \nadditional debt.\n  The amendment allows the Federal Reserve Board to issue regulations \nthat would require additional disclosures to consumers, and to take any \nother actions, consistent with its statutory authority, that the Board \nfinds necessary to ensure responsible industry-wide practices and to \nprevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the bill requires credit card \ncompanies to warn consumers about interest costs, and provide a toll-\nfree phone where they can find out how long it would take to\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\neliminate a balance when just paying the minimum balance each month. \nCredit card companies also are required to better explain teaser rates \nand late fees in their solicitations.\n  The Senate also has made important improvements to this bill, both in \nthe Judiciary Committee and on the floor. In my home state of \nCalifornia, for example, we have suffered from the abusive practices of \nbankruptcy mills including price gouging of debtors, incompetent \nservice, and fraud. The bill includes an amendment to curb this abusive \npractice.\n  However, I remain very concerned about the minimum wage and tax \namendments attached to this bill. Let me first say that I am strong \nsupporter of raising the minimum wager. In the four years since \nCongress last past a minimum wage increase, the U.S. economy has \ncontinued to surge at an unprecedented rate.\n  Nine million new jobs have been added to the economy. More than a \nmillion of those are in the retail sector. Unemployment is down and the \nnumber of jobs for women, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and \nteenagers has grown. Clearly the increase in the minimum wage has \nhelped working families and it is time to do so again.\n  The problem with the minimum wage increase in this bill is that it is \nspread out over too long a period of time. The amendment would raise \nthe minimum wage by $1 in three steps of 35 cents, 35 cents, and 30 \ncents.\n  California's minimum wage is $5.75. Under this proposal, working \nfamilies there would not benefit at all in the first year, receive only \na 10 cent wage increase in the second year, and would not feel the full \nincrease until 2003. That is simply unacceptable.\n  The time to raise the minimum wage is not when the economy is ailing. \nIt's when the economy is flush and that time is now.\n  Congress should raise the minimum by $1 over two years as proposed by \nDemocrats and we should do it now.\n  The bill also contains a $77 billion tax package whose benefits are \nskewed toward upper-income taxpayers. Specifically, the package has \nhealth insurance and long-term care provisions which would \ndisproportionately benefit higher income taxpayers. I am also concerned \nabout the fairness of the package's pension provision which would \nprincipally benefit highly-compensated employees.\n  In summary, I think there is a lot of good in the bankruptcy bill, \nand I intend to vote for it because it can still yield a worthwhile \nfinal product. However, extensive improvements are still needed in \nconference. The Conference negotiations must resolve the minimum wage \nand tax problems, and other deficiencies is the bill.\n  I need to work with my Senate colleagues to implement these needed \nchanges.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we will vote overwhelmingly in \nsupport of a measure to dramatically reform the bankruptcy system. I \njoin my colleagues in support of this bill, because I believe it is \ntime we repair the bankruptcy system and I believe that this bill \nshould progress to conference. However, the bill we support today is \nseriously flawed. It is my hope that some of the bill's more serious \nproblems will be addressed in conference.\n  The Bankruptcy Reform Act fails to provide disclosures which would \ntell consumers how long it would take to pay off their balance at the \nminimum rate and what their total costs in interest and principle would \nbe. Without this simple provision, American consumers will not receive \nthe kind of specific information that will encourage them to pay their \nbalance off more quickly, and avoid falling into debt in the first \nplace.\n  I am also concerned that this bill fails to protect women and \nchildren who are entitled to child support and alimony. The bill \nincreases the amount of debt for which debtors will remain liable \nthrough the creation of new types of nondischargeable debts to credit \ncard companies and by permitting coercive ``reaffirmation'' agreements. \nWith more competition for limited debtor resources, the bill fails to \ninsure that parents and children will prevail over credit card \ncompanies and banks.\n  This bill includes an arbitrary and inflexible means test to \ndetermine which debtors must file Chapter 7 bankruptcy instead of \nChapter 13. It is based on IRS standards not drafted for bankruptcy \npurposes that do not take into account individual family needs for \nexpenses like transportation, food and rent. If we are going to shift \nindividuals from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13 bankruptcies, we must ensure \nthat we are taking into account individual needs and do not \ninadvertently harm those who need bankruptcy protections the most.\n  The bill also contains a number of nongermane provisions that concern \nme. The methamphetamine amendment increases the sentences for powder \ncocaine, thereby causing further overcrowding in prisons and increasing \nthe representation of young minority males in prisons. I am also \nopposed to another provision that authorizes the use of public funds to \npay for private school tuition for students who were injured by violent \ncriminal offenses on public school grounds.\n  Despite its flaws, which I sincerely hope will be addressed in \nconference, the bill has a number of provisions I support, I take this \nopportunity to thank the managers of this bill, Senators Grassley, \nTorricelli, and Ranking Member Leahy for their consideration and \nassistance in accepting three amendments that I believe are important \nto fishermen in Massachusetts and small businesses across America.\n  First, I believe that the small business provisions originally in \nthis bill establish too short a time for small businesses that must \nresort to bankruptcy. These provisions are counter to this country's \nlong held policy of fostering small business creation and expansion. \nThe amendment to the bill which was accepted will increase the time for \nsmall businesses to develop a reorganization plan to 300 days. This \nwill allow small businesses to continue to have adequate time to \ndevelop a reorganization plan during bankruptcy proceedings. The \namendment will also allow bankruptcy judges more discretion to develop \nan appropriate time frame for small business reorganization.\n  I thank Senator Collins and her staff for their fine work in \ndeveloping an amendment which was accepted to make Chapter 12 of the \nBankruptcy Code, which now applies to family farmers, applicable for \nfishermen. I was proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of this \namendment that will make bankruptcy a more effective tool to help \nfishermen reorganize effectively and allow them to keep fishing while \nthey do so.\n  The final amendment which was accepted allows the expansion of the \ncredit committee membership under Chapter 11 bankruptcies to include a \nsmall business when it is determined that the small business' claims \nare disproportionally large to its gross revenues. This will ensure \nbetter access to information for those small businesses not included in \nthe committee by allowing the committee to be open for comment and \nsubject to additional reports or disclosures.\n  It is my hope that each of these amendments will be included in the \nConference Report for the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. I look forward \nto working with the Managers of the bill during Conference on these and \nother issues.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, S. 625, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, \nis one of the most important legislative efforts to reform the \nbankruptcy laws in decades.\n  I want to thank a few of the people who have worked on this bill. Let \nme first acknowledge the Majority Leader, who has worked very hard to \nkeep this bill moving forward. Given the demanding Senate schedule, it \nwould have been easier for him to have refused to take up the bill, but \nbecause of his dedication to the important reforms in this bill, we now \nhave legislation that makes enormous strides in eliminating abuse in \nthe bankruptcy system. I am also grateful to the assistant majority \nleader, Senator Nickles, along with Senators Daschle and Reid for their \nefforts in working with us to move the legislation forward.\n  Let me also acknowledge the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, who has worked tirelessly to reach agreement \non many of the bill's provisions, and who ably managed the bill for his \nside of the aisle. I also want to commend\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\nmy colleagues, Senators Grassley and Torricelli, the Chairman and \nranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight \nand the Courts, respectively, for their tremendous efforts in crafting \nthis much needed legislation. I particularly appreciate the dedication \nthey have shown in making the passage of this bill an inclusive and \nbipartisan process.\n  Also, let me express my thanks to Senator Sessions who has shown \nunwavering dedication to accomplishing the important reforms in this \nbill, to Senator Biden for his efforts over the past two years in \nhelping see sensible reform through the Senate, and to the many other \nmembers of the Senate for their hard work and cooperation.\n  At the Committee staff level, let me acknowledge a few people who \nhave worked very hard on this bill. Kolan Davis and John McMickle of \nthe Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee staff, along \nwith Ed Haden, Kristi Lee and Sean Costello of the Youth Violence \nSubcommittee staff deserve praise for their impressive efforts on this \nlegislation. In addition, Judiciary Committee Counsels Makan Delrahim, \nwho was the lead counsel on this bill, Rene Augustine, and Kyle \nSampson, as well as staff assistant Karen Wright, are to be commended \nfor their hard work on this important bill. Thanks as well should be \ngiven to the Judiciary Committee's Chief Counsel and Staff Director, \nManus Cooney, one of the most able and hard-working Chief Counsels the \nCommittee has had.\n  On Senator Leahy's Committee staff, I want to acknowledge Minority \nChief Counsel Bruce Cohen, along with counsel Ed Pagano for their \nefforts. In addition, I want to recognize the tireless efforts of Eric \nShuffler and Jennifer Leach of Senator Torricelli's staff, as well as \nthe hard work of Jim Greene of Senator Biden's staff, the Youth \nViolence Subcommittee's Minority Chief Counsel Sheryl Walter, as well \nas Ben Lawsky of Senator Schumer's staff.\n  I also want to commend Jim Hecht of the majority leader's staff, \nStewart Verdery, Eric Ueland, and Matt Kirk of the assistant majority \nleader's staff, Jonathan Adelstein of Senator Daschle's staff, and \nEddie Ayoob and Peter Arapis of the Minority Whip's staff for their \nefforts on this legislation.\n  The compelling need for this reform is underscored by the dramatic \nrise we have seen over the past several years in bankruptcy filings. \nThe Bankruptcy Code was liberalized back in 1978, and since that time, \nconsumer bankruptcy filings have risen at an unprecedented rate.\n  Mr. President, the bankruptcy system was intended to provide a \n``fresh start'' for those who truly need it. We need to preserve the \nbankruptcy system within limits to allow individuals to emerge from \nsevere financial hardship. What we do not need is to preserve the \nelements of the system that allow it to be abused--that allow some \ndebtors to use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool rather than as a \nlast resort. I firmly believe that by allowing people who can repay \ntheir debts to avoid their financial obligations, we are doing a \ndisservice to the honest and hardworking people in this country who end \nup paying for it.\n  Mr. President, again I would like to applaud the bipartisan efforts \nof my colleagues who have made S. 625 a broadly-supported bill. The \nimpact of this important legislation not only will be to curb the \nrampant number of frivolous bankruptcy filings, but also will be to \ngive a boost to our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the House bill.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 833) to amend title 11 of the U.S. Code, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all after the enacting \nclause of H.R. 833 is stricken and the text of S. 625, as amended, is \ninserted in lieu thereof.\n  The question is on the third reading of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 833), as amended, was ordered to a third reading and \nwas read the third time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall it \npass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (when his name was called).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment and requests a conference with the House. S. 625 is \nreturned to the calendar.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate has taken an important step \ntoward real bankruptcy reform on a bipartisan basis. None of this would \nhave been possible without the hard work and cooperation of the ranking \nmember on the subcommittee, Senator Torricelli. We introduced the bill \ntogether.\n  We have a good bill that will restore personal responsibility and \ncrack down on abuses of debt collectors and provide key information to \ncredit card customers about the problems of minimum payment.\n  I believe we go into conference in a strong position. I think our \nbill in the Senate is better than the House companion. We will have a \nspirited conference, I believe, but this year will be easier than last \nyear since the bills are much closer.\n  In any event, the Senate has done a good job. I thank Senators Hatch, \nSessions, Reid, Torricelli, Biden, and Leahy for the strong support \nthey showed for reform.\n  I also thank Rene Augustine and Makan Delrahim of Senator Hatch's \nstaff; Jennifer Leach and Eric Shuffler of Senator Torricelli's staff; \nJim Greene of Senator Biden's staff; Eddie Ayoob of Senator Reid's \nstaff; and Kolan Davis and John McMickle of my own staff for their hard \nwork on this bill.\n  I also thank Ed Haden and Sean Costello of Senator Sessions' staff.\n  Of course, this bill would not be here if not for Senator Reid \nworking with us on the floor and Senators Hatch and Leahy helping steer \nthis very difficult bill through the Senate as they helped get it out \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee. Of course, in this regard, I also \nthank the people who supported our legislation.\n  Most important, if anybody had asked me when we adjourned last year \nif we could have passed the bill this early this year, if at all, I \nwould have\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\nbeen very pessimistic about it. But because of the cooperation we have \nhad on the other side of the aisle, it was possible. Once again, in a \nvery generic sense, I thank all who made this a bipartisan effort and \nmade it possible to accomplish this goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his kind \nremarks. He has persevered in this effort. He and I talked about this \nlast fall when we were about ready to recess. We both committed \nourselves to the fact that if this came back up this year, we would try \nto make it work. We told our respective leaders, Senator Lott and \nSenator Daschle, that we would continue to work whittling down \namendments. We were able to dispose of, I believe, well over 300 \namendments.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, worked so hard on this. \nLesser people might have given up. They did not. They continued on.\n  The chairman, Senator Hatch, returned to his important leadership \nresponsibilities without missing a step. I have been glad to work with \nhim on this. We culminated our work on initial Senate passage of this \nbankruptcy act. Now we can go to conference.\n  Senators Torricelli and Grassley will have their work cut out for \nthem, as well as the rest of us, in trying to work that out. We will \nnot have the help of the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, \nin removing a lot of amendments for us as he did on the floor. He has \nbeen tremendous in working that out.\n  On this side of the aisle, he worked to protect the rights of \nDemocratic Senators and to improve the bill, and he has worked with his \ncounterparts on the other side of the aisle in our joint effort to get \namendments off this bill.\n  As the Senator from Iowa and I discussed earlier, we both have been \nhere long enough to know we did have an enormous number of amendments \nto a bill, but we also know many are called but few are chosen.\n  So we will work together with Chairman Hatch, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Torricelli, the House conferees, and the Clinton administration \non a conference report that I think will be well worthwhile.\n  I hope we will not make the mistake of the past Congress where we \ncame out of conference with something that never went anywhere. We have \ndemonstrated in the Senate now twice, in lopsided votes, that we can \npass a bankruptcy reform act. I hope we will come out of the conference \nwith something that we can pass.\n  Lastly, I know a number of staff members, all of whom deserve praise, \nhave been mentioned on this floor, but it is often said Senators are \nusually only constitutional necessities to the staff who really do the \nwork around here. In that regard, Bruce Cohen and Ed Pagano of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee staff have worked long hours, many weekends, \nand late nights to get us this far, and they deserve a great deal of \ncredit.\n  I see my good friend from New Jersey, the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, who told us it would be possible to get a bill through \nhere back when many thought it would not be possible. He was right. He \nworked very hard. He deserves a great deal of credit.\n  I yield the floor to him.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank Senator Leahy for his very kind comments and \nleadership in bringing this legislation to the floor, as well as, \ncertainly, Senator Grassley, who began this effort so long ago and \nworked so very hard. So many Senators have played an important role \nthat I think it bears some analysis of how we came to this point. And \nthere are some provisions of the bill that should be mentioned before \nwe go to conference in order to set our clear agenda.\n  I know there are those from the outset who doubted whether, indeed, \nreal reform of bankruptcy law could be achieved in this Congress. There \nwas some reason to be skeptical because there were some conflicting \nprovisions. Some of us had some very real needs that had to be met \nbefore the beginning legislation could ever be enacted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). If the Senator would suspend, \nthere is a previous order. It will take unanimous consent for the \nSenator to continue.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I ask unanimous consent that the order be postponed \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Most important of these objectives, in my mind, was \ndealing with the need for some consumer credit protection because, \nindeed, while there may be abuses in bankruptcy by debtors, to be \ncertain, there are clearly problems in the credit industry.\n  I believe several important amendments have achieved this goal. Most \nimportantly, in my mind, was the adoption of the Grassley-Torricelli \ndisclosure amendment. Other important amendments were additions by \nSenators Schumer and Sarbanes that will together provide real consumer \nprotection.\n  All three amendments are based on the belief that if consumers have \nknowledge, they will make rational choices. Simply providing \ninformation will avoid many credit problems from which the American \npeople are currently suffering. These include--if you look at the \nTorricelli-Grassley, Schumer, and Sarbanes amendments--a combination of \ndisclosing prominently on credit documents: The effects of only making \nminimum payments on your account every month; second, when late fees \nwill be imposed; and, third, the date on which introductory or teaser \nrates will expire and what the permanent rate will be upon that \nexpiration.\n  Additionally, the Grassley-Torricelli amendment includes a provision \nauthored by Senator Jack Reed prohibiting the canceling of an account \nbecause the consumer pays the balance in full every month. That was a \ngrowing problem where people with good credit and good bill-paying \nhabits were being penalized unnecessarily. That provision is now in the \nbill.\n  For all of these good additions that have made this better \nlegislation, there are some problems which I hope and trust can be \nresolved in conference so that this can genuinely be bipartisan \nlegislation, broadly accepted, and signed by the President.\n  The principal obstacle between what we want to achieve and that \nreality is obviously the minimum wage provisions in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, 12 million Americans continue to earn the minimum \nwage. Although they work all day, every day, throughout the year, they \nare in a daily struggle simply to survive. A  mother of two working at \nthe minimum wage earns only $10,712 per year, 22 percent below the \npoverty line, a wage at which it is impossible to provide housing and \nfood and clothing for a child, no less two children--or even a person, \nno less a family. It is not a minimum wage; it is a poverty wage.\n\n  In the last 15 years, inflation rose by 86 percent, but the minimum \nwage rose by only 37 percent. The fact remains that the United States \nis allowing a standard of living by working people below what those who \nstood in this institution only 15, 20, and 25 years ago were permitting \nby law.\n  We in America are allowing the establishment of a near-permanent \nunderclass of working people doomed to poverty and children who do not \nhave a chance of breaking out of these circumstances, who are likely to \nenter life malnourished, poorly clothed, inadequately housed, knowing \nonly poverty.\n  We need to reach the same judgment that our grandparents and our \nparents have reached for 70 years: A working, fair minimum wage.\n  With the proposed new minimum wage, a full-time worker will have an \nannual income of $12,700, an increase of $2,000 a year. The problem \nwith our bill is that this change is brought over the course of 3 years \nrather than 2 years, as many of us have proposed.\n  If it is the right thing to do, upon which most Senators seem to \nagree, it is the right thing to do now. Leaving millions of American \nchildren in poverty for this extra time makes no sense, and it is \nindefensible.\n  Indeed, during that extra time it denies $1,200 to families who are \nstruggling trying to work their way out of poverty.\n  I can think of no better addition to legislation dealing with debts \nand the struggling realities of American economic life in this reform \nof bankruptcy\n\n[[Page S257]]\n\nlegislation than including a real minimum wage.\n  It is obviously my hope that when the bill returns from conference we \nwill return to a 2-year increase in the minimum wage rather than the 3-\nyear provisions in this legislation.\n  The second area of concern--for all that we have achieved in this \nlegislation--is the creation of a new school voucher program which was \ncontained in a Republican antidrug amendment.\n  I want to make clear that I voted against this amendment last fall. I \ndid so not because of objections to the underlying amphetamine \nprevention legislation, which I voted for in the Judiciary Committee, \nbut to the voucher program.\n  When we considered this provision in the Judiciary Committee, it did \nnot have this voucher provision. It actually was dealing with narcotics \nproblems in schools with younger people. It was a good provision. It \nhas now been changed on the floor to include this voucher program. It \nis a simple diversion of desperately needed public moneys in the public \nschools, which can only make the problem worse. Money that would go to \nchildren at risk to deal with many problems, including narcotics \nproblems, would now be removed from the schools. This provision does \nnot make sense. It should be removed.\n  I believe if these objections are dealt with, we can return to this \nfloor with a conference committee report of which we can all be proud.\n  For all the divisions we might have faced when this legislation \nbegan, I think we all now understand there is a problem with bankruptcy \nabuse in the United States. In 1998, 1.4 million Americans sought \nbankruptcy protection. Something is wrong. There either are not \nadequate credit protections to ensure people under the circumstances \nwhen they borrow money, or the law does not properly deal with their \nfilings for bankruptcy, or both and other factors. In my judgment, it \nis all of these things.\n  Currently, 70 percent of bankruptcy petitions are filed in chapter 7, \nwhich provides relief from most unsecured debt. Just 30 percent of \npetitions were filed under chapter 13, which requires a repayment of \ndebt.\n  More than anything else, in addition to consumer protection, we will \nassure that people who can pay back part of these debts will do so. \nThat is not simply a benefit to the financial industry; it is also a \nbenefit to every mom-and-pop store, every small business in America \nthat is being abused by these unnecessary filings for bankruptcy. \nIndeed, it is estimated by the Department of Justice that 182,000 \npeople every year can afford to pay back some of the debts they are now \nescaping by inappropriate filings. This means $4 billion to creditors, \nfinancial institutions, to be sure, but also many small businesses that \ncannot afford losing these funds.\n  I conclude, once again, by thanking Senator Grassley for his \nextraordinary leadership, Senator Leahy for his patience through this \nprocess, Senator Hatch in chairing our committee and bringing us to \nthis point, and the very great contributions made by Senators Biden, \nReid, Schumer, and Senator Durbin who worked on this legislation so \ntirelessly in the last Congress.\n  This is good legislation. We can be proud of it. With modest \nadjustments, we can, indeed, make it something that both parties in \nboth Chambers can bring to the President for his signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand we are about to go into \nexecutive session for the consideration of the nomination of Alan \nGreenspan. I wish to speak on another subject, so I ask unanimous \nconsent that the order be set aside and I be permitted to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S257-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S257-S258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COSTS OF WTO MINISTERIAL\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, welcomed to the chair in which the \nActing President now sits the Vice President of the United States in \nhis capacity as President of the Senate. It was out of order for me to \nspeak at that point, and I regret the fact that I was unable to do so \nbecause my message is to the Vice President of the United States.\n  Leaving this place, he is now on his way to Seattle, my home State, \nin pursuance of the Democratic nomination for the Presidency. On a \nnumber of occasions during the course of the last year when the Vice \nPresident has graced us with his presence, I have asked on this floor \nand elsewhere that he address some of the controversial and burning \nissues in the Pacific Northwest, usually without getting a particularly \nsignificant response.\n  I don't intend to do that today. I welcome the Vice President to \nSeattle, and I am going to ask him for his help and for a favor to the \npeople of that city and the region.\n  Early last year, the Clinton administration picked Seattle out of 40 \ncity applicants to host a conference by the World Trade Organization \nfor an extended period of time. Careful preparations for that meeting \nwere made by the administration, by State officials, by officials in \nthe city of Seattle and in the surrounding area, and by private \norganizations that desired to take part in the WTO meetings.\n  We, as is customary when a major international conference goes to an \nAmerican city, recognized the extra costs that would accrue to Seattle \nand the region by directing the State Department to reimburse Seattle \nand surrounding communities by upwards of $5 million for the extra \ncosts of law enforcement that were inevitably to be a part of that WTO \nconference. Senator Murray, my colleague, and I joined in strongly \nsupporting that proposal, and it was accepted, not only by the Senate \nbut by the Congress, memorialized in the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill.\n  As we all know now, to our regret, the preparations for that WTO \nmeeting were inadequate to meet the deluge of demonstrators who \ndescended on Seattle, some of them quite violent in nature. While in my \nview our law enforcement officers performed in exemplary fashion under \nextremely difficult circumstances, neither the political preparation \nfor that meeting on the part of their superiors, the disposition of the \nlaw enforcement officers, nor their leadership was up to the task. We \nended up with a very regrettable and probably disastrous experience in \nthe city with security for the organization, added to, very \nsignificantly, for the future of our trade relations by what I consider \nto be the utterly inappropriate performance of the President of the \nUnited States in undercutting his own negotiators.\n  Nevertheless, the net result was approximately a cost of $12 million \nto law enforcement over and above what would normally have been the \ncircumstances. Not only does that exceed by a margin of more than 2 to \n1 the $5 million that we directed be added as assistance for those \nefforts, but the State Department of the United States of America has \nflatly refused to reimburse Seattle or any of the other communities in \nthe area by so much as $1.\n  I may say, the State Department seems quite happy to reimburse the \ncosts of all of the Members of both Houses of Congress who went to \nSeattle for that conference, but a direction from this Congress, a \ndirection from this Senate, that the Seattle area deserved a $5 million \ncontribution to these law enforcement problems has, to this point, been \nutterly ignored by the State Department. Seattle and other local \nofficials have been spurned in all of their efforts to get that \nassistance by what I consider to be weak and inadequate grounds.\n\n  Mr. President, I have come to the point. Yesterday I wrote a letter \nto the Vice President of the United States that I ask unanimous consent \nbe printed in the Record in full at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GORTON. I asked in the letter that the Vice President, in his \nexalted position in this administration, do his very best to see to it \nthat the State Department ends this arbitrary action and promptly \nreimburses the region with that entire $5 million figure, to be \ndistributed as is most just among the various agencies that incurred \nthose\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\ncosts. This is a simple request. It is a request to the Vice President \nof the United States to see to it that the United States keeps its \nobligations, obligations which to this point have been disgracefully \nignored.\n  I am certain the Vice President has sufficient authority and \nimportance in the administration that his views on this case, if they \nare made known forcibly and well, will be acted upon. I hope very much \nhe will do exactly that and help us, at least for a modest degree of \ncompensation for what was an extremely unhappy experience in the \ncommunity as a whole and among our law enforcement officials.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 2000.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: Last spring, the administration \n     selected the City of Seattle from a list of 40 entries to be \n     the honorary host site for the largest trade meeting ever \n     held on U.S. soil, the World trade Organization Ministerial. \n     While the outcome of the event was not what we might have \n     liked, hosting the Ministerial imposed a severe financial \n     burden on the City of Seattle and surrounding communities.\n       Recognizing that the city and other involved jurisdictions \n     would need assistance and support for security, members of \n     the Washington State Delegation in the House and Senate \n     supported language in the Fiscal Year 2000 Commerce, Justice, \n     State and Judiciary Appropriations bill to provide $5 million \n     to be used for costs related to the WTO Ministerial in \n     Seattle. Just as the trade event was set to convene and the \n     first foreign dignitaries were arriving in Seattle, this \n     language and allocation became law.\n       Unfortunately, at the same time that foreign and U.S. Trade \n     representatives were convening in Seattle for the initiation \n     of a new round of trade agreements, so too did tens of \n     thousands of protestors, including many who had every intent \n     of disrupting the Ministerial. While I have expressed \n     reservations about how the City of Seattle chose to deal with \n     the onslaught of protesters, I believe that the enacted \n     financial assistance is not only required, but overdue.\n       To make matters worse, as Seattle continues the task of \n     mending its wounds, the U.S. State Department has refused to \n     release one nickel of the aforementioned allocation. Seattle, \n     its residents and law enforcement still feel the sting of the \n     black eye endured during the week of the WTO.\n       Preliminary estimates suggest that local taxpayers spent \n     more than $12 million for security expenses related to the \n     WTO, and the Washington State Patrol suggests that at least \n     $2.3 million was absorbed for overtime security expenses. To \n     expect local communities to absorb such security costs for a \n     major international event is unjustified.\n       As you visit Seattle this week to curry favor with our \n     voters, I will not chastise you, as I have done in the past, \n     for not speaking out on key issues facing the Northwest. \n     Instead, I ask you to assist our community by placing a call \n     to your colleague, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and \n     demand that the funds prescribed in the FY2000 CJSJ \n     Appropriations bill be released to Seattle.\n       Thank you in advance for your assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S258-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S258-S278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF ALAN GREENSPAN, OF NEW YORK, TO BE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD \n               OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and proceed to the nomination of Alan \nGreenspan, of New York, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Alan Greenspan, of New \nYork, to be Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem for a term of 4 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have an unusual time agreement where we \nhave 4 hours 50 minutes. I have asked, as chairman of the committee, to \nhave 45 minutes under my control to make the case for Chairman \nGreenspan, the President's nominee.\n  I have a very small number of people who wish to speak. Senator \nSarbanes, as ranking member, has made a similar request for 45 minutes. \nI think the normal procedure would be to run off time proportionately \namong those who have asked for time. But since Senator Sarbanes and I \nhave such a small amount of time, and many other Members who aren't \nmembers of the committee have more time reserved than we do, I would \nlike to begin, so that there will be no dispute, no misunderstanding, \nby asking unanimous consent that the time be charged proportionately to \nthe two sides. The minority side has 4 hours 5 minutes. The majority \nside has 45 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged \nproportionately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Secondly, let me say that when we do have the minority \nside represented on the floor, I am going to seek to amend that to \nprotect the time of the distinguished ranking member of the committee, \nSenator Sarbanes, and to protect my time. I urge those who have \nreserved up to an hour each in some cases to come to the floor and \nspeak.\n  With that, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \npending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the nomination of Alan \nGreenspan.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Alan Greenspan \nto be Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. As I mentioned in the \nBanking Committee when we held the hearing on the nomination of Alan \nGreenspan to a fourth term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \none of the distinctive aspects of the Federal Reserve Board as an \ninstitution has been its remarkable stability of leadership.\n  Since 1934, when President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Marriner \nEccles to be Federal Reserve Board Chairman until today--a period of \nover 65 years--there have been only seven Federal Reserve Board \nChairmen; only seven. Among them are some of the outstanding economic \nleaders of our country. Marriner Eccles himself served 14 years as \nChairman of the Federal Reserve. William McChesney Martin served 19 \nyears. Arthur Burns and Paul Volcker each served 8 years.\n  If Chairman Greenspan is confirmed--I am assuming, I think reasonably \nso, that would be the case--and serves the full length of his fourth \nterm, as I expect he will, he will be the second longest serving \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board. I think it is fair to say, in \nlooking at his tenure as Chairman, that he will take his place among \nthose other outstanding public servants who have provided exceptional \neconomic leadership to our country.\n  Earlier this week, the U.S. economy achieved the longest expansion in \nits history with 107 months of continuous growth. We have achieved high \nlevels of growth that have brought us the lowest levels of unemployment \nin 30 years, and all of this has been accomplished with the lowest \nlevels of inflation in 30 years.\n  We have had a very virtuous economy in terms of low unemployment and \nlow inflation. The expansion has now gone on long enough that its \nbenefits have begun to be felt by the hardest to employ workers in our \neconomy. Many companies now have instituted training programs which, of \ncourse, is all to the good. It enables us to improve the skills and the \nabilities of our workforce. It enables us to draw people into the \nworkforce who heretofore have not been a part of it. A strongly vibrant \neconomy is important to the success of any Welfare-to-Work initiative. \nOne of the reasons that Welfare to Work has shown some of the results \nwhich it has shown is because it has taken place in the context of an \neconomy moving towards or at full employment.\n  The performance of the economy has defied the conventional wisdom \nonce held by some in the economic profession that there was some \narbitrary rate of unemployment below which the economy could not go \nwithout triggering inflation.\n  Credit for this achievement should be shared. President Clinton and \nformer Treasury Secretaries Bentsen and Rubin deserve credit for their \ndisciplined leadership on fiscal policy which has eliminated our budget \ndeficit and moved us into budget surpluses. The Congress also should \nshare in that credit for maintaining fiscal discipline which has \nenabled us to come out of a deficit budget situation\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\ninto a surplus budget situation, although I would add as a word of \ncaution that I think we need to be extremely careful and prudent now in \nthe steps we take.\n  These surpluses about which so many people are talking in terms of \nwhat are they going to do with them are projected surpluses. They are \nnot surpluses in hand and they depend very much on the continued \nhealthy performance of the economy. I think it is imperative that we \nnot go to excesses, whether on the spending side or the tax-cutting \nside, which would knock this economic engine off the track.\n  In addition--obviously highly relevant to the subject before us--\nChairman Greenspan deserves credit for complementing the tight fiscal \npolicy of the administration and the Congress with a monetary policy \nthat has allowed our economy to grow. In doing so, he focused on the \nevidence before him and  was not bound by arbitrary assumptions about \nthe limits of our economy's ability to grow without triggering \ninflation.\n\n  I think the Chairman has been very pragmatic as he has made his \njudgments. I think he has been very much driven by the facts of the \nsituation and has not come at it with these ideological presuppositions \ninto which he then tries to bend the facts but has taken the facts, \nevaluated them, and made his judgments.\n  I am reminded of the fact that some years back within the Federal \nReserve System there was a regional bank president who asserted that if \nthe economy started growing and drove the unemployment rate down or \nlooked as though it was going to be below 6.7 percent unemployment, \nthen inflation would virtually automatically start to rise and, \ntherefore, the Fed had the responsibility--the Open Market Committee--\nas the economy was growing in this direction to start curtailing the \neconomy, of slowing it down by raising the interest rates because \nunless they did that, a strongly growing economy would bring the \nunemployment rate down below 6.7 percent. And that was the magic point \nat which the inflation rate would start going up.\n  Fortunately, the Chairman, Chairman Greenspan, and a majority of his \ncolleagues, never bought into this theory. Now we see the fact we have \nbrought unemployment down to just over 4 percent, and we have no \nsignificant inflation problem before us.\n  There is a lot of credit that can go around. I mean, when you have \nsuccess, everyone has fostered it. But I am quite happy certainly to \nallocate a portion of that to the Chairman and the policies of the \nFederal Reserve Board.\n  I have disagreed with Chairman Greenspan in the past about monetary \npolicy, and may well disagree with him again in the future. I have been \nvery much oriented to growth and jobs. I have always been deeply \nconcerned about these so-called preemptive strikes against inflation \nwhere you slow growth and job production without any visible sign of \ninflation--simply some sort of anticipation of it. I have always argued \nthat we ought to let the economy run for a while and see what it \nproduces. The recent experience, of course, has been very encouraging \nbecause we brought unemployment down very significantly and have not \ntriggered an inflation problem.\n  All in all, though, I think it is more than fair to say that Alan \nGreenspan has been a skillful and dedicated Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board and merits confirmation for another term.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join in supporting this \nnomination of Alan Greenspan to another 4-year term as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the able Senator from New York, \nand not only a member but a very strongly contributing member of our \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland, not \nonly for the generous yielding of time but for his thoughtful remarks--\nas always. I think the name ``Sarbanes'' and the word ``thoughtful'' \nare almost attached in this body, and with good reason.\n  I rise today in full support of the nomination of Alan Greenspan. I \ndo it for a whole variety of reasons. Before I get into those reasons, \nI am holding something in my hand. Senator Gramm's staff gave us the \napplication of a man of such gravity and success and magnitude, it is \nkind of funny to hold an application where he lists his schooling. Even \non the last page, there is a section that says ``qualifications,'' why \nhe would be a good Chairman of the Federal Reserve. But he begins by \nsaying, ``I have been an economist for almost half a century.'' One \ndoes not have to read this application, fortunately, to know of \nChairman Greenspan's merit to be renominated as Chairman of the Federal \nReserve.\n  First, I am proud personally, and I know the other representatives of \nmy State are proud, because Alan Greenspan is one of New York's \ncontributions to the national economy. He is a true New Yorker, born in \nthe Bronx, attended George Washington High School, got his B.S., M.A., \nand Ph.D. from NYU. When you think about it, the two men who have had \ntheir hand on the economic tiller for a large part of the past decade, \nBob Rubin and Alan Greenspan, are both New Yorkers. We are proud of our \ncontribution. We have always been proud, in New York, that we send men \nand women around the country in so many different fields who make real \ncontributions to America. Sometimes America does not recognize it as \nmuch as we would want, but it is true. I think there can be no one we \ncan be more proud of, at least in the last decade, than Alan Greenspan.\n  Alan Greenspan is the perfect man for the job. He is thoughtful. I \nregularly eat breakfast with him at the Fed. I will never forget the \nfirst time we had breakfast together. I really didn't know him that \nwell. He had been Chairman of the Fed for maybe 3 or 4 months.\n  I said, ``Mr. Chairman, how do you like the job?''\n  He said, ``I love it.''\n  ``What do you like best about it?''\n  His eyes lit up. He rubbed his hands together, and he said, ``The \ndata.''\n  That, I think, is at the root of Alan Greenspan's great success as \nChairman of the Fed--his knowledge. He knows the economy. He is a \ncareful man. Those of us who have sat in the Banking Committee, both in \nthe Senate and the House, as I did before I was lucky enough to become \na Senator, know he is a careful thinker--almost too careful sometimes, \nwhen we ask questions. But that is his job, not to reveal too much. At \nthe root of his merit for the position is the fact that he believes \nknowledge should guide his decisions, the data should guide his \ndecisions.\n  He has also been a very careful Chairman of the Fed, and that is a \njob where care is important. I was always opposed to some of the people \nin my party who wanted to tie the hands of the Fed or subject the Fed \nto more popular whim because, frankly, monetary policy is one of those \nareas of policy that should have some distance from the popular whim. \nThat is because monetary policy takes a while; it takes a while to \nformulate, and then it takes a while to have its effect once it is \nimplemented. To have it subject to the political vicissitudes and whims \nto too great an extent would be a tragedy and would make no sense for \nthis country.\n\n  In fact, I always marvel at the genius of our Founding Fathers in \nsetting up the structure of merit. But one of the great additions that \nwas made was made in 1912 or 1913 when the Federal Reserve System was \nfinally established. Over the years, we have seen the merit to that \nsystem. Yes, there is some popular control, but there is also some \ndistance. I think Chairman Greenspan understands that very well.\n  There is a third reason I think he makes such a fine Chairman.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be given 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Not only his thought and care but his solid and sound \njudgment. The Chairman told me, and he said it repeatedly, he always \nhad a slight lean towards combating inflation. It was not an \nideological lean, as opposed to stimulating the economy or combating \ninflation. But he always said, once you let the genie out of the \nbottle, it is very hard to get it back. So he erred on the side of \ncaution in terms of letting the economy overheat. My goodness, has that \nserved us well during his 12 years as Chairman.\n  His steadiness, his intelligence, his judgment, his thoughtful care, \nhis\n\n[[Page S260]]\n\nknowledge, all add up to the fact that this is a wonderful day, not \nonly for him--and I hope he will be approved unanimously by this body. \nThis should not be a nomination where ideology--I think he is a \nRepublican, actually. I think he served in the Council of Economic \nAdvisers under, I guess it was President Ford. It is not one where \nideology or party should play but, rather, the good of America.\n  So it is my honor to cast my vote for a great New Yorker, a great \nAmerican, a great Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and someone who is \ntruly a national treasure. I will be proud to vote for Alan Greenspan.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 19 and one-half \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the economy is now entering its 107th month of \nexpansion. That is almost 9 years out of the 25 years I have had the \npleasure to serve in this Chamber. Not since the 1960s has the economy \nexperienced such an extended period of growth.\n  A number of Senators have spoken on the floor today to commend Alan \nGreenspan for his foresight and his quick hand in raising interest \nrates to keep inflation in check. The actions of Alan Greenspan and the \nFed have certainly contributed to our unprecedented growth--growth that \nhas also been sustained by the sound fiscal policies of President \nClinton and Congress. I would remind the Congress, that we can also do \nour part to help the economy by continuing to pay down our national \ndebt.\n  Today the Fed is meeting again to consider another possible rate \nhike. The American economy was certainly on fire during the fourth \nquarter of 1999. Mr. Greenspan and the Fed have hesitated little in \nhiking rates to nip inflation in the bud. Last year, the Fed raised \ninterest rates three times by a quarter point each--three times over \nthe short span of 6 months. Such vigilance has been one important part \nof maintaining the unprecedented growth of our economy.\n  While it might be blasphemy among macroeconomic economists, I would \nlike to take a moment to urge members of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee to consider the disproportionate effect that these hikes have \non low and middle income families. As the Fed mulls rate policy as we \nspeak, I would urge Mr. Greenspan to be doubly sure about raising rates \nwhen such hikes, while keeping the economy strong to the benefit of \nwealthy Americans, may also be tying the hands of low and middle income \nAmericans.\n  Each time the Fed raises interest rates, average Americans are hit by \nan immediate increase in mortgage costs, car payments, and credit card \nrates. These payments are a disproportionate burden on lower and middle \nincome Americans.\n  For the past week we have been debating a reform of our country's \nbankruptcy laws. During the course of debate, we have talked at length \nabout the rise in credit card debt. By December of 1999, Americans \nracked up nearly $589 billion in revolving credit debt. This burden is \ncarried primarily by low and middle income families. An increase in \ninterest rates is likely to pinch these individuals and make it more \ndifficult to pay off their debt and save for the future.\n  I have been contacted by Vermonters who say they are struggling to \npay off their debt and save money to buy homes. These Vermonters face a \nmajor setback each time the Fed makes the decision to increase interest \nrates. In its meeting today and in the future, I urge the Federal \nReserve to consider the effect of raising rates on these individuals.\n  With all the praising being done of Chairman Greenspan today, I wish \nto note there are a number of Vermonters who contacted me who feel \nquite a bit differently. Nobody doubts a strong economy, an expansive \neconomy. I think much of the credit, frankly, goes to those who, in \n1993, were willing to face down the naysayers and take the first step \nto have a real balanced budget in the Congress. It sent a signal to the \nfinancial markets that for the first time, certainly in my lifetime, \nthe Congress was serious about balancing the budget.\n  During the 1980s we had seen all the lip service paid and the \nsloganeering about balancing the budget, while during the 1980s we \ntripled the national debt and ran the biggest deficits of any nation in \nthe history of the world.\n  In 1993 I heard many voices, actually on the other side of the aisle, \nsaying if we cast these votes to bring about balancing the budget, it \nwould bring about economic collapse. It would bring about staggering \nunemployment. It would bring about runaway inflation. And it would \nbring about huge deficits. It did just the opposite. The unemployment \nrate has dropped, inflation came to a standstill, the economy boomed, \nthe deficits disappeared, and now we have a budget surplus. Many \nMembers of Congress were courageous enough to cast the real votes that \nmight do that--as compared to simply the sloganeering and doing \nnothing--and many of them lost their place in the House and Senate for \ndoing it, even though they made a better country for all of us and for \nour children.\n  I note that because I believe that vote was as significant a part of \nbringing about the credibility necessary for a strong economy as \nanything we have done. The expansion of the information technology \nindustries, high tech, and so forth, also were part of it and a \nsteadying influence by Chairman Greenspan and the Fed.\n  But this idea that one person controls this economy by himself is \nsomething that even some who sit here in the Senate cannot say with a \nstraight face. As many Vermonters have told me, when they see interest \nrates being raised over and over and over again at a time when there is \nno inflation, when the economy has more and more people coming into the \nworkforce--because every time you have a merger, thousands of people \nare laid off. They go and seek jobs in other parts of the labor market. \nWe see all these things and question why interest rates go up. The \ninterest rates going up apparently have given a great benefit to the \nwealthiest of Americans but has done very little for the average man \nand woman, certainly in my State.\n  In my State, we have seen oil prices and heating oil costs go up \nsubstantially this winter, and now the Fed is about to tell everybody: \nWe are going to raise your interest rates again; we are going to raise \nyour mortgages rates again; we are going to raise the interest rates on \nyour credit cards again. If you are a small business, we are going to \nraise your costs of doing business again.\n  I am not sure what is gained by these interest rate hikes. It puts a \nvery heavy burden on those families where the husband and wife are both \nworking and trying to pay the kids' tuition, pay the bills, and pay the \nmortgage. It certainly puts a heavy burden on small businesses in my \nState.\n  It will help some bankers, absolutely. It will help credit card \ncompanies, absolutely. It will help some of the wealthiest, absolutely. \nAnd maybe there is a plan in here that by helping all of them, some day \nit may help the people who keep the country going and pay the bills. \nPossibly.\n  I share the skepticism of those Vermonters, and I hope when this vote \nis cast, which I assume will be overwhelming for the reconfirmation of \nChairman Greenspan, that he will not take this as some kind of an \naccolade that nobody disagrees with what he has done; that he will \nunderstand there are those who actually have to pay their mortgages, \nthose who do not have millions of dollars, those who do not have six-\nfigure incomes and are hurt by these interest rate hikes; that they are \nthe ones who see no inflation and probably have been laid off from jobs \nbecause of mergers and are out seeking another job and are now hit with \nan extra whammy of paying more for their mortgages, their credit cards, \nfor the things they need.\n  Some of the thoughts of the Fed that the boom will not continue, that \ninflation was around the corner has not been proven, and I do not think \nthe steps they are taking are right. That is one person's opinion. \nObviously, it is very much a minority opinion but certainly an opinion \nthat is felt strongly by the average man and woman who are earning a \nweekly salary and paying the bills.\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\n  I hope the Fed will look at some of the data they have available to \nthem and understand there are other ways of combating inflation than \nsimply raising interest rates and that the country will realize there \nare a lot of very courageous people who voted for a balanced budget in \n1993. Rather than simply talking about it, all those courageous people \nwho lost their places in Congress for doing that are also the ones who \ndeserve an enormous amount of credit today for the huge economy we have \nunderway.\n  Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Vermont have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time I \nhave remaining be turned over to the Senator from Maryland for such use \nas he may wish to make of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time situation is as follows: The Senator \nfrom Maryland controls 38\\1/2\\ minutes; the Senator from Texas controls \n42 minutes; the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, controls 58 \nminutes; the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, controls 58 minutes; the \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, controls 29 minutes; and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, controls 29 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I simply make the observation for those Members of the \nSenate who wish to be heard on this nomination that this is an \nopportune time, and that includes members of the committee and others \nwho will seek either Senator Gramm or myself to yield time to them in \norder to speak. There are other Members who have been actually \nallocated time specifically. Of course, we presume they will be coming \nto the floor in order to use that time.\n  I put an inquiry to the Chair: I understand that if no one speaks, \nthe time will be charged proportionately to all those to whom time has \nbeen allocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I cease and allow that circumstance to \nprevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time will be charged proportionately to those \nwho have time reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are experiencing the longest economic \nexpansion in the history of this country. As of the end of January, we \nunderwent 107 consecutive months of economic growth. Much of this can \nbe attributed to the economic policies of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan.\n  In the midst of this unprecedented prosperity, it's easy to say, \nlet's not change anything. Let's not rock the boat. Things are great, \nwhy rain on the parade? Why even ask tough questions that might upset \nthe delicate and fine-tuned mechanism of the economy?\n  But I think that we have to ask those questions.\n  Today the Senate is considering the President's nomination of Mr. \nGreenspan to his fourth consecutive four-year term as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors. In my opinion, if we are to confirm \nhim to serve in that post again, we should not do so simply to reward \nhim for the good that he has accomplished over the last few years--we \nshould only do so because we think that he is the best person for the \njob for the next four years.\n  In making that decision, we have to take a hard look at everything \nthat has happened under Chairman Greenspan's watch--the bad as well as \nthe good.\n  We are considering him not only for his views on the economy, but for \nhis ability as a manager, as the head of the largest, most powerful \ninstitutions in the world.\n  Viewing his record as a whole, Mr. President, I am not convinced that \nChairman Greenspan is the best man to guide the Fed for the next four \nyears. I intend to vote against his confirmation.\n  Let me make this clear: I rise today not to criticize Alan Greenspan \nas a person, or to criticize his economic policies. Chairman Greenspan \nis a fine man, who has worked hard for this Nation. The results of \nChairman Greenspan's monetary policies over the last 10 years speak for \nthemselves, in rather eloquent terms.\n  The Federal Reserve is one of the most powerful institutions in the \nworld. It makes decisions that fundamentally change our economy, and \nthe world economy.\n  It is also, as columnist Jack Anderson wrote, a secret government of \nunaccountable, unelected bankers and bureaucrats that has long resisted \nCongressional oversight, and that is completely exempt from the \nCongressional budgeting process.\n  For the past six years, Senator Dorgan and I have worked to try to \nachieve greater accountability over the Federal Reserve. Last year, we \nadded an amendment to the Financial Services Modernization Bill that \nwould have required a consolidated yearly audit covering the operations \nof each Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors \nand the Federal Reserve System.\n  Our amendment was all about accountability in the day-to-day \noperations of the Fed. It did not seek to interfere with monetary \npolicy. That is an area that should be kept separate, for good reason. \nOur amendment sought to open the doors of a taxpayer-financed \ninstitution which has been closed to Congressional oversight or review \nfor more than 80 years.\n  Unfortunately, our amendment was stripped down in conference. That \nhappened in part because the Federal Reserve strongly opposed any kind \nof audit or oversight.\n  In 1993, Senator Dorgan and I asked the GAO conduct a review of the \nFed's operation and practices. The review found a number of disturbing \nrevelations about the way the Federal Reserve does its business, \nincluding evidence of serious mismanagement at the highest levels.\n  Significantly, many of the incidents of waste and mismanagement have \nincreased since 1988, the year Mr. Greenspan first became Chairman.\n  (1) The Report found numerous and significant weaknesses in the Fed's \nplanning, budgeting, oversight, and audit processes that have resulted \nin unnecessary waste in the Fed's operating costs.\n  (A) The Fed's operating policies and practices do not include cost-\nminimizing that are commonplace in private-sector entities and even \nother government agencies.\n  (B) Overall Federal Reserve operating expenses increased from $1.36 \nbillion in 1988, to $1 billion in 1994:\n  A 50 percent increase that was more than twice the rate of inflation \nduring that same time period;\n  The increase in operating expenses also exceeded the rate of increase \nin the Fed's revenues; and\n  It also far exceed the 17-percent increase in overall federal \ndiscretionary spending.\n  (C) The report concluded that, among other things, the Federal \nReserve could reduce its personnel benefits and travel-related \nreimbursements without affecting its operation:\n  The employee benefits paid by the Fed for even low-level employees \nwere called ``generous'' compared to other government agencies and \ncomparable financial institutions; and\n\n  Travel reimbursement policies among the various Reserve banks varied \nwidely\n  (D) The report found that the Fed's Interdistrict Transportation \nService has been engaging in questionable practices such as the \nimplementation of non-competitive contracts, gifts of payments for \nmissing backup and grounded aircraft to non-performing contractors, and \na disturbing pattern of indifference to fraud, waste and abuse.\n  (2) The Board's internal oversight mechanisms were called \n``fragmented, inefficient, and lacking in independence.''\n  (A) Operating costs vary among Reserve banks because the Federal \nReserve has not established consistent policies.\n  (B) Several Reserve banks used contracting and procurement policies \nthat violated written government policies, and which resulted in \nfavoring some sources over others--raising questions of conflicts of \ninterest, favoritism, and whether the Federal Reserve is receiving the \nbest services and most favorable prices.\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\n  (C) The Los Angeles branch alone documented over $121 million in \nbookkeeping errors in a single month.\n  (3) The Fed maintains a reserve account of $5.2 billion dollars which \ncould be re-directed into the Federal Treasury. That fund is intended \nto protect the Fed against unexpected losses.\n  But the Fed has recorded substantial net profits for 84 straight \nyears, and the fund has never been used since it was created in 1913. \nNonetheless, the size of that fund has increased nearly 150 percent in \nonly the last ten years, rising from $2.1 billion in 1988 to $5.2 \nbillion in 1998.\n  Most important, the report raised serious questions about Mr. \nGreenspan's ability to manage the Fed in a time of rapid economic \nchange.\n  The Report concluded that numerous technological, political, and \nmarketplace developments could profoundly affect the Fed's mission and \noperation in the years to come, and which require the Fed's careful \nattention and leadership.\n  (A) Increased competition from private institutions and a shift to \nelectronic banking could significantly reduce the Fed's revenues, \nparticularly in areas such as check-clearing. The Fed has not taken \nsufficient steps to compensate for these shrinking revenue sources.\n  (B) A major consolidation in the banking industry is going on that \ncould significantly affect the Fed's oversight and review activities.\n  Changes in the number and location of bank-holding companies the Fed \noversees could require adjustments in Fed staffing at the various \nReserve banks.\n  To pay for these changes, the Fed's oversight staff could charge \nlocal banks a fee for their oversight activities, but choose not to, \nresulting in taxpayers paying the bill for those activities to the tune \nof $388 million a year.\n  The Fed's Reserve banks have not changed their geographic location \nsince 1913, despite major shifts in population demographics and \neconomics, raising question of whether the Fed's oversight functions \nare being performed effectively and equally around the country.\n  (C) Overall, increasing competition from private-sector suppliers of \nfinancial services, coupled with changes in technology and commerce, \nand increasing globalization of economic policy,'' present significant \nchallenges to the Federal Reserve to rethink many aspects of its \noperations and raise important questions regarding the future role of \nthe Reserve banks, their management structures, their locations''--and \n``call for a careful re-examination of the Federal Reserve's mission, \nstructure, and work processes.'' But it appears that no such re-\nexamination has taken place in the five years since the report was \nissued.\n  The report concluded that if the Federal Reserve Board is to plan \nstrategically for the future, so that it can continue to deliver \nservices efficiently in a world that is changing rapidly and \nsubstantially, it will need the Board's ``sustained leadership.'' That \nsustained leadership appears to have been absent.\n  If this report had been made about a Cabinet Secretary, the Congress \nand the public would demand answers. If it were about the CEO of a \nprivate corporation his board would probably send him packing.\n  We live in a world of change.\n  Only a few years ago, nobody had heard of the Internet, and \nelectronic commerce didn't exist.\n  Nobody bought stock on-line.\n  Only a few years ago, the European Economic Union was a pipe dream.\n  GATT and NAFTA didn't exist.\n  Japan's economy was the envy of the world, and the United States was \nthought to be in decline.\n  Nobody can predict what the world will be like years from now. But \none thing we do know, is that if the Fed is to continue its ability to \nsuccessfully manage our economy, change will be necessary. Not \nsuperficial tinkering, but fundamental, structural changes.\n  I do not believe that Mr. Greenspan is the right kind of manager to \ndrive that change.\n  Let me read to you from the GAO report:\n\n       The Federal Reserve must create the necessary self-\n     discipline for the institution to adequately control its \n     costs and respond effectively to future challenges. However, \n     GAO found weaknesses in the planning and budgeting processes \n     that are key mechanisms for accomplishing those goals . . . \n     the Federal Reserve did not have an integrated, systemwide \n     strategic plan that identified the emerging issues and \n     challenges affecting the entire system and how to effectively \n     address them.\n\n  In a climate of rapid change, that is a recipe for disaster.\n  For these reasons, I do not believe that Alan Greenspan is the right \nman for the job, and I intend to vote against his confirmation, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, does the unanimous consent agreement \ninclude a time for me to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does. The Senator has 24 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand we are here on the floor of \nthe Senate to talk about the renomination of Alan Greenspan as Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board. I want to start my presentation by saying \nit is not my intention to come to the floor of the Senate to persuade \npeople Mr. Greenspan is not a good person or has not been a good public \nservant--I do not believe that. He is someone with great skill and \ngreat devotion to public service.\n  But I do come to say that I have profound differences with Mr. \nGreenspan over monetary policy issues and I believe his stewardship \nwith the Federal Reserve Board, while widely hailed by many, falls \nshort of what I think should have been done at the Fed during the same \nperiod. I would like to spend some time describing that.\n  As I begin this discussion, let me point out that just this afternoon \nthe Federal Reserve Board has announced yet another interest rate hike. \nThey have announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee is \nhiking short-term interest rates another one quarter of 1 percent.\n  What does that mean? A lot of people will not think much about the \none quarter of 1 percent in terms of what it means to them. It means \nthe Federal Reserve Board is imposing a tax on every single American \nwith these interest rate hikes because they are worried about some new \nwave of inflation that does not exist in our country. I had some work \ndone at the North Dakota State University by Dr. Won Koo in the \nDepartment of Agricultural Economics. I asked him to tell me what it \nmeans, just in terms of North Dakota, when the Federal Reserve Board \nhas now on four occasions in a matter of 8 months raised interest rates \nby 1 percent. What does it mean when we have a 1-percent interest rate \nincrease?\n  The additional average interest payments for North Dakota farmers \nwill be nearly $23 million a year as a result of the actions of the \nFederal Reserve Board, or about $719 per farm annually.\n  A typical North Dakota household will see their interest charges go \nup by an additional $356 a year because of the four Fed interest rate \nhikes. The Federal Reserve Board is imposing a tax on every single \nAmerican with these four rate hikes.\n  I will explain more later why I think the rate hikes are \nunjustifiable. But these rate hikes are unjustifiable because the \nFederal Reserve Board is searching for inflation that does not exist. \nInflation has gone down, down, way down, all the while the Federal \nReserve Board has insisted the fires of inflation are just around the \ncorner. The Fed has been consistently wrong on that. And there seems to \nbe almost no debate about it. It is OK if the Fed decides it wants to \nincrease interest rates and effectively tax all the American people \nwith higher interest rates.\n  Some of those who come to the floor of the Senate who are the most \naggressive people in opposition to any kind of a tax increase, sit \nsilently while the Federal Reserve Board says: We want to impose new \ncosts on the American people in the form of mandated higher interest \ncharges. That is rather curious to me. Why so silent when the Federal \nReserve Board does this without justification, I might add.\n  Here is the Federal Reserve Board. And I do this to give the American \npeople a sense of who makes monetary policy. We have a Board of \nGovernors. There are two seats that are currently vacant. We are hoping \nmaybe we can get someone appointed to the Federal Reserve Board who \ncares something about consumers and family farmers and others who will \nhave to pay the higher interest charges. It is not likely\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\nto happen, but we are trying. None of the current Board members is from \nour part of the country. There have only been three Board members from \nthe Upper Midwest appointed to the Board of Governors since it was \ncreated. We are hoping maybe somebody who might take one of these \nvacant seats will be somebody who knows how to make something, to \nproduce something, who does something every day and will come here not \nrepresenting the money center bankers' interests but representing the \ninterests of consumers, family farmers, or Main Street businesses.\n  The Board of Governors and, the presidents of the regional Fed banks \non a rotating basis, go in a room, shut the door, and in secret decide \nwhat kind of monetary policy they want to employ and whether they want \nto increase interest rates. The American people were not present in the \nroom and I was not present in the room because we are excluded from \nthese deliberations by the Federal Reserve Board.\n  These are the folks who went into that room: Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., \nAlan Greenspan, Edward Gramlich, Edward W. Kelley, Jr., Laurence Meyer; \nand then these folks from the Fed regional banks, the ones with the \ngold stars: Robert Perry, Jack Guynn, Mr. Broaddus, Mr. Jordan, and Mr. \nMcDonough. They apparently think the American people's interest charges \nare not high and decided to raise it one-quarter of 1 percent, a total \nof 1 percent over the last four rate hikes. The question is why.\n  It is interesting, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board says he \ndoes this because there is a threat of new inflation in this country. \nOver the past 12 months, however, inflation has been well under \ncontrol. The CPI has risen 2.7 percent in the last 12 months. In the \nlast 3 months, the CPI has risen at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, and \nthe core CPI--if you take out volatile food and energy prices, has \nrisen 1.9 percent in the last 12 months, the lowest it's been since \n1965.\n  In addition, Mr. Greenspan has come to the Capitol and said: We think \nthe CPI overstates inflation by 1.5 percent. I do not think he is right \nabout that, but if he is right, we have effectively no inflation in \nthis country. If we have no inflation in this country, what on Earth \nare these folks doing in a secret meeting downtown, wearing suits and \nglasses and talking in bankerspeak, deciding to increase taxes in the \nform of a higher interest rate on every American? What are they doing? \nHow do they justify that? Why do those in this Congress who wail so \nmuch about taxes sit silently while the Federal Reserve Board does this \nwithout justification? You tell me where the new fires of inflation \nexist.\n\n  Alan Greenspan for years came to counsel us on Capitol Hill. He said: \nWe cannot countenance economic growth in this country more than 2.2 or \n2.5 percent without risking substantial new waves of inflation--just \ncan't do it. He was wrong. Again and again he was wrong. Economic \ngrowth has been well above 2.5 percent, and inflation has been way \ndown, not up. Mr. Greenspan came to Congress and gave us the sage \nadvice that if we saw unemployment fall below 6 percent, we risked new \nfires of inflation. He was wrong again and again. He was wrong.\n  Yet we hear people come to the floor to say he is the greatest \nAmerican ever. He is a nice enough fellow. I have nothing against him \npersonally. His policies, in my judgment, have imposed an added \nfinancial burden on the American people in the form of higher interest \ncharges than is justifiable. I ask all of you who know these numbers, \nevaluate what have been the interest rates relative to inflation--that \nis, the real rate of interest--in the Greenspan years versus pre-\nGreenspan years. What is the real economic rent for money? What kinds \nof policies imposed by the Greenspan years at the Fed have resulted in \nwhat kinds of charges to the American people relative to what had been \ndone before Mr. Greenspan came to the Fed?\n  I will tell you the answer. The answer is, interest rates on a real \nbasis have been higher in the Greenspan years by about one-half of 1 \npercent than the pre-Greenspan years. Can you justify that? I do not \nthink so. And Mr. Greenspan, leading this Fed--and make no mistake, he \nis in charge, it is his policy, no one would contest that--has said \nover the years: We must grow more slowly; we cannot support higher \ngrowth; we must shade on the area of having more people unemployed \nrather than fewer people unemployed, and because of the risks of having \ntoo few people out of work and too much economic growth, we must retain \ninterest rates at a level that is higher than historically justified \nrelative to the rate of inflation.\n  Some might come to the floor and be able to justify that in their own \nminds. I certainly cannot. I do not think the American people believe \neither that Mr. Greenspan's higher interest rates relate to this new \neconomy that can grow faster with lower unemployment numbers than most \neconomists ever thought available or doable.\n  Let's talk just about the numbers for a few minutes. I mentioned that \nthe core rate of inflation is now 1.9 percent over the last 12 months, \nthe lowest its been since 1965. I mentioned Mr. Greenspan thinks the \nCPI overstates the rate of inflation by a percent and a half. That \nmeans we have virtually no inflation. But today the Fed said we are \nworried about inflation, therefore we must increase interest rates once \nagain. The Fed is wrong once again.\n  In 1999, the GDP grew at 4 percent; in 1998, 4.3 percent; in 1997, \n4.5 percent. In other words, in the two previous years to 1999, we had \nhigher rates of growth than in the last year, and yet the Fed today, by \nits interest rate increase, says our economy is growing too fast. \nAgain, in my judgment, it is implausible. This Fed Chairman steers the \nFed on monetary policy on the side of money center banks. I think \nmonetary policy ought to be steered in a direction and on a course that \nrelates to all of the needs and all of the interests of this economy \nand of the American people.\n  I talked a little about unemployment. In the past, the Fed has \npreached that the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment was 6 \npercent. In short, if the unemployment rate goes below 6 percent, \nconsumer prices will go up. The Fed's reliance on this and other buggy-\nwhip approaches to economic analysis have been terribly misdirected \ngiven the globalization and the galloping globalization of the \nworkforce.\n\n  The unemployment rate has been below 6 percent for 64 consecutive \nmonths, over 5 years, without a peek at a new wave of inflation. Today, \nunemployment rates are at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent, and our economy \nis growing at a healthy rate without a shred of evidence that there is \na new threat of inflation.\n  Some say Mr. Greenspan is increasing interest rates not so much \nbecause he is worried about inflation, although that is what he says, \nbut because he wants to curb speculation in the stock market. He thinks \nthere is something in the stock market; he said once ``irrational \nexuberance''--whatever that means to economists. I used to teach \neconomics ever so briefly. Irrational exuberance, he says--it is \ninteresting--irrational exuberance on the part of those who are \nengaging in transactions on Wall Street that are presumably market \ntransactions, and presumably in a circumstance where the market works. \nIt is interesting that Mr. Greenspan decides, because of this \nirrational exuberance, he wants to impose a penalty on all the American \npeople through higher interest rates rather than deal with what I think \nmay be the cause of this so-called irrational exuberance.\n  If Mr. Greenspan really wants to try to bust some of the bubble on \nWall Street, maybe he ought not raise interest rates that cause direct \nand immediate harm to families and to producers, but maybe he ought to \nconsider taking real steps to put limits on the use of ``margins'' by \ninvestors to buy stocks.\n  It is interesting, the amount borrowed by investors to buy equity \nsecurities is growing to levels of significant concern.\n  Last November, the margin amount increased by 13.2 percent in 1 month \nalone--the largest monthly increase since 1971. Perhaps Mr. Greenspan \nmight want to put some limits on the use of margins; but, no, not Mr. \nGreenspan. He would sooner impose an added interest charge on all \nAmericans.\n  Let me talk for a moment about what I think is the low watermark of \nthe Fed in recent times. That is the\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nissue of Long-Term Capital Management, the ill-fated hedge fund, \nbecause it relates not only to the management of the Fed, but it \nrelates to what the Fed is interested in and relates to the Fed's, in \nmy judgment, insensitivity of or, perhaps in a stronger sense, \nblindness to solve the risks that exist that they ought to be concerned \nabout but are not.\n  Long-Term Capital Management.\n  Mr. President, how much of my time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some while ago the Federal Reserve Board \norchestrated a $3.6 billion bailout of something called Long-Term \nCapital Management, the highflying hedge fund, which I think calls into \nquestion the leadership at the Federal Reserve Board and calls into \nquestion what they think is important and what they are willing to \nignore.\n  The federally insured banks were lenders and investors in this Long-\nTerm Capital Management fund. The GAO, in its 1999 report, requested by \nmyself and Congressman Markey, Senators Harkin and Reid, found that \nfederal regulators failed to detect lapses in risk management by \nlenders, and others, that allowed Long-Term Capital Management to \nbecome large and excessively leveraged until after the crisis.\n  Mr. Greenspan testified that the intervention in the Long-Term \nCapital Management debacle was needed to prevent a crisis in the global \nfinancial markets. But then he appears just as quickly to dismiss the \nFed role in the bailout as little more than a spectator providing \noffice space.\n  What makes this more troublesome, to me, is that just days before the \nFederal officials visited Long-Term Capital Management in Connecticut \nto discuss its financial problems, Chairman Greenspan was testifying \nbefore the House Banking Committee that: ``Hedge funds were strongly \nregulated by those who lend the money.'' Of course, nothing could have \nbeen further from the truth, as was uncovered by the GAO's 1999 \ninvestigation of the Long-Term Capital Management's near collapse.\n  The independent report reveals that our Federal regulators, including \nthe Fed, allowed this speculative hedge fund to load up with $1.4 \ntrillion notional value in derivatives, which threatened to bring chaos \nin financial markets here and around the world.\n  While I am on this subject of unregulated hedge funds, which the Fed \non a Sunday had to bail out by arranging bank loans, shortly after they \nsaid: Gee, there is no problem here with hedge funds.\n  Let me add that the subject of derivatives ought to have some \nattention by not only our committees but by the Fed and other banking \nregulators, as well. There is something around $33 trillion notional \nvalue derivatives by banks in this country, and we have banks whose \ndeposits are insured by the Federal Government, doing proprietary \ntrading on derivatives on their own accounts.\n  They could just as well put a craps table in the lobby of a bank. \nThey could just as well put a roulette wheel in the lobby of a bank. A \nbank, with federally insured deposits, trading on its proprietary \naccounts in derivatives, and nobody seems to care. But someday, some \nway, someone will care because this is going to go the way of Long-Term \nCapital Management, unless there is adequate supervision. When those \ncards collapse, that collapse is going to be significant.\n  We need, in my judgment, strong management. We need assertive \noversight by our committees. We need strong, aggressive oversight in \nthe regulatory approaches by the Federal Reserve Board. Regrettably, \nthat is not the case these days with respect to the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n  Since the chairman of the Banking Committee is here, I will say that \nI urge the committee to pay some attention. You probably already have. \nI am not suggesting you have not. I don't know what your agenda is. I \nhope very much the issue of derivatives and the issue of the regulation \nof hedge funds, or at least the concern about what hedge funds are \ndoing in light of Long-Term Capital Management scandal, is something \nthat is part of the agenda of the Banking Committee in this Congress.\n  I have described, at the start of my presentation, it is not my \nintention, nor would I expect it to be the intention of the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Harkin, or others, to come to the floor to say that the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board is a bad person. I do not believe \nthat. I met him. I like him. I think he is a good public servant. I \nthink he has given a great deal to this country.\n  He and I simply have fundamental differences on monetary policy. He \nhas run monetary policy with a tight fist, believing a certain way, and \nthose beliefs include that we could not allow more growth. We had to \nhave slower growth in order to avoid inflation. We had to have more \npeople unemployed in order to avoid inflation. He was wrong on both \ncounts, wrong consistently.\n  My point is, I think it is time--and I have told this to the \nPresident--I think it is time for new blood at the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa, who has come to the floor, look at \nthis Board. I, from time to time, as a public service--because the Fed \nis so closed and so secretive; it is the last dinosaur on the American \nlandscape in public policy--I bring pictures to the floor to show \npeople what the Fed looks like. Here is who they are. Here is where \nthey graduated from. Here is what their degrees are. Put a gray suit on \nall these folks, and they all look the same, talk the same, and think \nthe same. That is why this policy is a homogenized policy that does not \nprovoke any debate in this country about monetary policy.\n  A century ago they used to debate monetary policy in bars and \nbarbershops. I thought that was healthy. Fifty years ago and 40 years \nago, when McChesney Martin was running the Federal Reserve Board up \nhere, he was going to raise interest rates by one quarter of 1 percent, \nand Lyndon Johnson got him down to the ranch in the Perdinales in Texas \nand darn near broke his shoulders he was squeezing him so tight.\n  The point is, it was front page headlines around the country because \nMcChesney Martin was going to have the Fed raise interest rates by a \nquarter of 1 percent. The President got so upset he even called \nMcChesney Martin down to the ranch. The Fed did not have to respond to \nLyndon Johnson, but my point is, back then interest rate policy was a \nmatter of public concern, of public debate. These days, these folks go \nin that well-paneled room and shut the door, and it is all done in \nsecret. Then they open the door and say: Guess what we have done for \nyou. There are too many people working. We are growing too fast, so \ntherefore we have increased a tax on all the American people by \nincreasing interest rates once again.\n  Four successive interest rate increases--1 full percent. Again, let \nme say that the average North Dakota household, which pays $356 a year \nmore in interest rate charges--that is a new tax on the American \nconsumer in my State and around the country.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It was not a tax debated on the floor of the Senate. If \nwe had that debate, my friend from Texas, Senator Gramm, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, would be on the floor, \nI guarantee you, because when we debate taxes he is on the floor. He is \na passionate combatant in those debates. But we cannot have that debate \non the floor of the Senate because the Federal Reserve Board does not \nhave a debate in public. It does it in secret.\n  What I am saying is, I think the Federal Reserve Board process needs \nto be more open. I know the response and the rejoinder to that will be: \nWell, the Senator wants to make the Federal Reserve Board process \npolitics on the floor of the Senate. That is not my point. My point is, \nI think there ought to be, leading into this process somehow, some \ninterests of the American people. It does not exist at the moment.\n  It is my intention to not support this renomination. I expect this \nrenomination will carry with a very large vote in the Senate, but it \nwill not carry with my vote because I believe monetary policy ought to \nchange in this country. I do not believe our country is growing too \nfast. I do not believe too few people are unemployed. I do not\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\nshare that view, that is too often shared in the bowels of the Federal \nReserve Board. I would like someday for us to have a monetary policy \nthat represents the entire interests of our country, not just the \ninterests of money center banks.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his statement on the floor, \npointing out that what this interest rate increase is is a tax on hard-\nworking Americans, a very insidious kind of tax, too. It is going to \nhave other repercussions.\n  The question I have to ask of the Senator is this: The Senator talked \nabout the Federal Reserve Board meeting in secret and not knowing what \nis going on. I don't want to make it political either. No one wants to \nmake it political. But I think we do have a right to know why they make \nthe decisions they make.\n  It is my understanding that the transcripts of the meetings of the \nFed are kept secret for 5 years, if I am not mistaken. It may be a \nshorter period. I stand to be corrected. We don't know for years why \nthey made the decisions they made. What is so secretive about this?\n  Even if they do meet in secret, it seems to me that within 1 month or \n3 months or 6 months we ought to at least have the transcript so we \nwould know what was the discussion that went into why the Board raised \ninterest rates a quarter of a point today; what the discussions were \nlast year that caused them to raise interest rates three times. Keep in \nmind, the Fed has raised interest rates four times in a 1 year period. \nA little nick here, a little nick there, pretty soon you are bleeding \npretty badly. Four times in a 1 year period. What were the reasons for \nit? We don't know because they meet in secret. Again, it is my \nunderstanding--I stand to be corrected--that the transcripts are kept \nsecret for 5 years.\n  Again, the Senator from North Dakota has pointed this out many times, \nthe Federal Reserve was not created by the Constitution of the United \nStates. The Federal Reserve was created by legislation. It is a \ncreature of Congress created by legislation. It seems to me we have a \nright and a responsibility to have a better understanding not only of \nhow the Fed operates but why they make the decisions they do. I ask the \nSenator that question, about opening up the transcripts so we know why \nthey make those decisions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't know what length of time they keep the transcript \nprivate. However, the Federal Reserve Board is enormously private. I \nhave said it is the last dinosaur. A little sunlight would be a great \ndisinfectant for monetary policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is so little known about the Federal Reserve Board \nthat when Senator Reid and I had a GAO report done recently, they said \nthat the Federal Reserve Board has stashed away now close to $6.4 \nbillion--then I believe it was $3.7 billion--in a kind of a rainy day \nfund. The rainy day fund was described by the Fed as a surplus fund \nthat was to be used in the event they needed it if they suffered a \nloss.\n  This is an institution that makes money. This is an institution that \nhas never had a loss, will never have a loss, and stashes away a cash \nreserve in the event that it has a rainy day. The GAO report, of \ncourse, was very critical of the management of the Fed on a wide range \nof things. But I will not put it in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional minute has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin. It is my \nunderstanding that since the distinguished Senator from Missouri wanted \nto speak only 3 or so minutes, that he had agreed that after I speak--\nand I should speak only 5 or 10 minutes--the Senator from Missouri \ncould speak 3 or 4 minutes before Senator Harkin takes the floor. I \nthink he has an hour. I thank him for that.\n\n  I hope people are watching this debate. Our dear colleague from North \nDakota does an excellent job of presenting his point of view. It is not \na point of view I agree with, but it is a point of view that obviously \nhe believes and he presents very effectively, as does Senator Harkin.\n  For people who believe that there are no differences among Members, \nthat parties don't make any difference, that Democrats and Republicans \nare identical, I hope they are listening to this debate because we are \ngetting to the very heart of the fundamental differences that separate \nus and, in separating us, serve the country. In the process, we have an \nopportunity to present competing visions. Then every 2 years, on the \nfirst Tuesday after the first Monday of November, people decide whose \nvision they want to follow.\n  I think this debate is very informative and very important. I have \nasked for a fairly short amount of time. I think the minority side has \n4 hours 5 minutes. I have asked that our side have 45 minutes because I \nthink our case is a very strong one, and we don't think we have to be \nrepetitive to make it.\n  As I look down the list of Americans who have served as Chairmen of \nthe Board of the Federal Reserve Board, it reads like a Who's Who in \neconomics and banking: Paul Volcker, Arthur Burns, William McChesney \nMartin. These are Americans who have provided distinguished service to \nour country. But as I look at the record of Alan Greenspan, I can stand \non the floor of the Senate and say, without any fear of contradiction, \nthat Alan Greenspan's record is the finest record that has ever been \nestablished by a Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve Board since we created the Federal Reserve and it began \noperating in 1913.\n  I go further in saying that whether we are talking about Nicholas \nBiddle at the Second Bank of the United States or about monetary policy \nconducted by the Treasury or about any central banker in any monetary \ncenter anywhere on the planet, I believe a strong case can be made that \nAlan Greenspan is the greatest central banker in the history of the \nworld.\n  Why do I say these things? Let the record speak for itself in terms \nof what has happened under Alan Greenspan's leadership. First, how many \npeople have been appointed to the highest appointed position in the \nland by Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton? Is there any \nother person who has been appointed to a high position of public trust \nby those three men? The answer is no. And why have three successive \nAdministrations appointed Alan Greenspan to be Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve Board? Because he is the best central \nbanker we have ever had.\n  As we all debate this issue and have our opportunity to second-guess \nAlan Greenspan, let me talk about the record. The day Alan Greenspan \nbecame Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board \nin 1987, long-term interest rates were 8.98 percent. Today they are \n6.42 percent. As a result, millions of Americans who did not have the \nopportunity to build and buy their own homes the day Alan Greenspan \nbecame Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, now have that \nopportunity, and they are seizing it in record numbers.\n  The day Alan Greenspan became Chairman of the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve Board, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at \n1,938.83. Today the Dow stands at over 11,000. In other words, the \nequity value of the broad cross-section measure of the fundamental \nindustry in America has risen during the period that Alan Greenspan has \nbeen Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board by \nnearly 500 percent.\n  Today, schoolteachers, firemen, insurance salesmen, and coaches find \nthat the value of their 401(k)s and their IRAs have skyrocketed, and as \na result, their financial security has grown. They approach retirement \nin a better position than anyone could have ever expected. And that \nwealth is widely distributed. More Americans own part of the equity \nvalue of America than ever before in history. Indeed, we have come the \nclosest of any society in history of fulfilling the Marxist dream of \nworkers owning the means of production--only we have done it the real\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\nway, not with the government stealing it and claiming that workers own \nit; workers really do own it.\n  The unemployment rate the day Alan Greenspan became Chairman of the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board stood at 5.7 percent. \nToday, it is 4.1 percent--the lowest level in 30 years. In fact, when \nyou look at the array of social programs in the economy and their \nimpact on the incentive of people to take jobs, when you look at the \nenvironment in which that 4.1 percent exists, I doubt if there has ever \nbeen a day in American history where the unemployment rate was \neffectively lower than it is today. The wonderful thing about this \ngrowth in employment is that it is not just the same people who are \nalways getting jobs. A Congressman's daughter and the son of the bank \npresident get jobs--good times and bad times.\n  What is wonderful about the golden economic age in which we are \nliving is that employment among minorities is growing faster than \nemployment in the economy as a whole. We have had an explosion in the \nnumber of women who have gone into business and succeeded, and the \nbenefits of this economic growth are being more widely shared today \nthan any economic growth that we have ever achieved.\n  The rate of inflation on the day Alan Greenspan became Chairman of \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board was 4.5 percent, \nand we were grateful. Today, the inflation rate is just 2.7 percent. As \none of our colleagues already noted, if we could account for quality \ndifferences, if we could take into account the quality differences in a \nnew Suburban versus a Suburban 10 years ago, or the quality difference \nin a Sony television as compared to 10 years ago, that inflation rate \nwould be virtually zero.\n  Just as Alan Greenspan was beginning his service as chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board in 1987, we had a stock market drop of 500 \npoints. That was a time when 500 points were real and represented a \ndramatic drop in equity values. Some argued that the Government had to \nintervene; too many people are investing in the equity market; we have \nto have dramatic reforms. But under the stable leadership of Alan \nGreenspan, and several other members of the Working Group that was put \ntogether at that time, we basically set about to strengthen the system \nin terms of liquidity and transparency, and Government kept its cold, \ndead hand off the equity market, and we have seen in the 1990s what the \nresult has been.\n  At the end of the 1980s, we experienced the S collapse, the \ngreatest financial crisis during my period of service in Congress. It \ncost $100 billion to fix. It could have been avoided had we put up \nmoney earlier and acted earlier, as President Reagan urged. But under \nthe leadership of Alan Greenspan, while nobody knew it at the time, we \ninstituted a procedure of closing troubled thrifts and selling off \nassets, which the whole world looks at as the standard of how you deal \nwith a financial crisis.\n  Have we forgotten the Mexican peso crisis? Have we forgotten the \nAsian economic crisis? Can you remember when it was conventional wisdom \nthat the collapse in Asia was going to mean an economic downturn in \nAmerica? I missed that downturn, and so did America. Under Alan \nGreenspan's leadership, we have set a course that helped Asia regain \nits footing. Korea, through reforms, has done it. Other countries will \nachieve greater stability when they reform. Have we forgotten the \nRussian economic collapse? Have we forgotten the Brazilian currency \ncollapse?\n\n  In other words, Alan Greenspan's stewardship as chairman has not been \nuneventful. But the net result is that the American economy has stayed \non track. It is easy for us to second-guess the policies of the Federal \nReserve Board, but who thought Alan Greenspan would raise interest \nrates on the very day that we are considering his confirmation? If that \nis not a statement of confidence in him, I don't know what is, and I \ndon't see any reason to be second-guessing Alan Greenspan's record.\n  If I have a concern today as we move toward this vote, it is what are \nwe going to do when Alan Greenspan is gone. I hope there is someone out \nthere who will be capable of matching this record. But I am not sure \nthere is such a person, and it worries me. My grandmother used to say, \n``The graveyard is full of indispensable men.'' Alan Greenspan is not \ngoing to have this job forever. But as long as he wants it, and I have \na vote about whether he is going to get it, based on this record, I am \ngoing to vote to give him the opportunity to continue to serve.\n  Let me conclude with a final remark, and then I will turn it over to \nmy colleague. Our founders were afraid of men on white horses. They \ntried to write a system so that it didn't make any difference how \nelections turned out. They tried to make it so that it didn't matter \nwho was appointed to various positions because they knew that people \nwere fallible. They tried to write a system that was relatively \ninfallible. And so when someone achieves a record like this, while you \ncan't give Alan Greenspan all the credit--I think a lot of the credit \ngoes back to Ronald Reagan and the reforms that we undertook then, and \nI am willing to give some credit to Bill Clinton and some to Congress. \nBut if you were going to pick anybody who is currently holding a \nposition of public trust and ask who has had more to do with the \nsuccess we have had in this last decade--the last 12 years, really--of \nunparalleled economic achievement, I think you would have to give the \nprize to Alan Greenspan.\n  So there are two sides to the story. I hope people will listen to \nthese arguments. This is serious business when you are talking about \nthe Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. I \nhope they will listen to these arguments and that they will see that \nthere are differences among Members, differences between the two \nparties. As long as there are people like Alan Greenspan who are \nwilling to serve, I think America is in good shape. I am eager to see \nhim have the opportunity to serve for another 4 years. I hope he is \nblessed with health that will allow him to continue in this job for a \nvery long period of time.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nBanking Committee for giving me the opportunity to make these remarks. \nI hope our colleagues are listening to his remarks. As a former \neconomics professor, he has been able to bring to common terms, in \nunderstandable language, the message that is so important in economics.\n  I have stayed awake longer listening to his treatises on economics \nthan I have on most of the ones I had in school. While the record is \nnot perfect, at least it is better. We appreciate his kind words.\n  I also thank my colleague from Iowa for permitting me to make these \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the nomination \nof Alan Greenspan for his fourth term as Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.\n  As has just been said, since Chairman Greenspan was originally \nappointed in 1987, his wise stewardship of the monetary policy of this \ncountry has in no small part contributed to the best economic times in \nour country's history.\n  Yesterday we reached a milestone of economic expansion. Our country \nhas a record 107 consecutive months of economic growth. At no other \ntime in our history have we experienced uninterrupted economic growth \nthat has lasted this long. Moreover, it does not appear that this \ngrowth is slowing. Unemployment is at record lows. Consumer confidence \nis at record highs. Inflation, the unfortunate byproduct of expansion \nin the past, has been kept under control.\n  Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have raised \nquestions about the way Chairman Greenspan and the Federal Reserve have \nconducted their business. Make no mistake--it is an arcane science. \nMaybe it is an art. I am never sure whether it is an art or a science. \nMake no mistake about the fact that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nand the Board itself have tremendous power in this economy. It can \ncause inflation or it can foster low inflation. It can promote sound \neconomic growth or it can cause a depression. As tough as that job is--\nand probably none of us here in this body would fully understand it--\nfortunately, we have a means of judging the\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\nsuccess of the work that is done by the Chairman and by the Federal \nReserve. In no place can I think of a better application for the \nadmonition that you shall be judged by your works or, as we say at home \nin Missouri and in the country: Show me. Don't tell me what you are \ngoing to do; show me what you have done. Under that test, Alan \nGreenspan has received the highest marks.\n  When you look at what has happened, more people are working. More \npeople can buy homes. More people can keep their jobs. And they can see \nthat their savings are not eroded by inflation.\n  It was only about 20 years ago we saw inflation destroying savings \nand driving the price of homes out of reach of almost every American--a \ntremendous crisis--because monetary policy had gotten out of control. \nToday we see monetary policy under control; we see growth; we see \nopportunity. All American citizens stand to benefit from this growth, \nand I think they owe a debt of gratitude to the dedicated public \nservice of Chairman Greenspan.\n  Many economists did not believe low unemployment and low inflation \ncould exist for a significant period of time. Indeed, our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have cited the fact that even Chairman \nGreenspan has learned as he has gone along. As he stated in his \nremarks, he has seen that there is a new paradigm. There is a new \noperation in effect. Times have changed, and we are learning more about \neconomics.\n  But as we learn more about them and how monetary policy affects our \ncountry, the Chairman's firm hand on the rudder of economic policy has \nbeen responsible for keeping us on the straight and steady course. He \nwisely steered America clear of the potential harm that may have \nresulted from the Asian financial crisis and, as the chairman of the \nBanking Committee said, the other crises back through the savings and \nloan debacle.\n\n  In addition, he has provided unwavering support for fiscally \nconservative budgetary policy and has been of enormous assistance to \nthis body. He explained to us even recently, as he probably well needed \nto, the necessity of continuing to link sound monetary and sound fiscal \npolicy. I believe if you translate what he said in his speech, it was: \nDon't blow the surplus on big spending programs. That is an important \nmessage for us.\n  As we look to the future, we see that the near-term economic future \nof this country looks promising. There are clearly--and we all \nrecognize it--dangers to our prosperity that will likely arise, \nincluding inflation fears, increasing labor costs, dampening market \nproblems, and structural problems in the economy. But Chairman \nGreenspan's thoughtful leadership over the last 12 years will serve us \nwell in the coming years.\n  I am very proud to add my name in support of Alan Greenspan for \nanother term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. I congratulate and I \nthank President Clinton for nominating him because I think not only we \nas a country are grateful that he has agreed to accept a fourth term \nbut we will all benefit from his service in that term.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Forty nine and one half \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to let my fellow Senators know I don't \nintend to take that much time.\n  Mr. President, I noted with some interest that the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Gramm from Texas, when he started speaking a few \nmoments ago said this debate we were having--and he mentioned the \nSenator from North Dakota, he mentioned this Senator--indicated the \nfundamental difference between the parties. I waited to see just \nexactly what he meant by that. I never heard an explanation.\n  But maybe this debate does show some fundamental differences. For \nexample, we are for openness. We believe the Federal Reserve ought to \nmeet in the open, that it shouldn't meet in private. We believe \ntranscripts ought to be made available to the public sooner than they \nare. Of course, we believe in lower interest rates. We want open \nmeetings and lower interest rates, and the other side wants private \nmeetings and higher interest rates. Perhaps that is really the \nfundamental difference we are talking about. I say it only tongue in \ncheek. But it does, I think, really say what this is all about.\n  That is whether or not we are going to have some more accountability \nand openness in the Federal Reserve rather than what we have had in the \npast. Its decisions affect every American's life. It affects all of us. \nThis recent interest rate increase today, as the Senator from North \nDakota said, is a tax on all Americans. We are all going to pay for it. \nSome of us can afford to pay it a lot more easily than others. If you \nare a creditor, if you are part of the creditor class in America where \nyour income exceeds your outgo, where you are able to save, where you \nhave a lot of assets, and you are into investing and lending, higher \ninterest rates may not be such a bad idea.\n  However, if you are in the lower income sector of our economy, you \nneed to buy a new car to get to work and the old one has run out, you \ndo not have enough money, you have to put some money down, pay for it \non time, or roll your interest on your credit cards month to month, \nmaybe you need to make your house payment, maybe your kids are in \ncollege, you need to make some college payments, and you are an \nindividual making less than $30,000 a year as a family, this is a real \ntax. It is going to cost you more money. Yet we don't know what the \ndebate was. We don't know the details of why they did this. We will not \nknow for years.\n  I believe there is an important difference. The Open Market Committee \njust announced another quarter-point interest rate from 5.5 to 5.75 and \nan increase in the discount rate as well.\n  This makes four times in 1 year that we have had interest rate \nincreases--four times, three times last year, and then once this month.\n  These increases hurt prospective homeowners. It is going to hurt the \nhousing market. I want to say at the outset, we all want Americans to \nsave more money. For modest-income Americans, the best savings program \nthey have is owning their own homes. For modest-income Americans, when \nthey are through with their working lives and they retire and they are \non Social Security, the biggest asset they have, and in many cases the \nonly asset they have, is the equity they have in their homes. So we \nwant Americans to become homeowners.\n  This interest rate increase will hurt Americans hoping to own their \nown homes. It will decrease the number of Americans who can own their \nown homes and have that as their savings vehicle. It will hurt small \nbusinesses and manufacturing. My farmers, who are already hurting \nenough and who have to borrow every year to get their crops in, they \nare going to get hit again. Everyone will be hurt one way or another. \nSome will feel it more profoundly than others. The prime rate is moving \nup today from 8.5 percent to 8.75 percent. That means the real interest \nrate, not the nominal but the real interest rate, adjusted to \ninflation, is close to 6.55 percent.\n  Again, it is the real interest rate that you feel, not the nominal. \nFor example, if interest rates were at, say, 10 percent, and inflation \nwere at 8 percent, the real rate of interest would be 2 percent. If, \nhowever, interest rates are 8.75 percent, and inflation is only 2.2 \npercent, your real rate of interest is 6.55 percent. That hurts you \nmore.\n  When our economy was flourishing in the 1960s with the highest growth \nrates we ever had, our real prime rates ran around 2 percent to 3 \npercent. In other words, the real interest rates were 2 to 3 percent. \nToday it is about 6.55 percent. Think about that.\n  Hopefully, the Fed will not be continuing this process because this \nhurts people, and there is no reason for it. That is really the essence \nof my remarks today. Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board seemed \nto think they needed to make a preemptive strike on inflation before we \nsee clear signs of inflation out there. This view, if aggressively \nacted upon, would place an absolute cap on our economy's ability to \ngrow. It would destroy much of our potential for growth. That is a \ntragedy.\n  Back in 1996, I opposed the renomination of Mr. Greenspan along with \na number of my colleagues--a small\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\nnumber. I said at the time, and I say again today, I have no personal \nanimus toward Mr. Greenspan. I agree with those who said he has had a \ndistinguished career in public service. I think he is a bright \nindividual. Like I say, I have only met him, as I can remember, once in \nmy entire lifetime, so I have no personal animosity toward him. I think \nhe is an honorable individual, exceptionally smart--bright.\n  I did have one thing someone brought to my attention at one time. \nThey said back in his youth he was a follower of Ayn Rand, and was with \nsome little group with Ayn Rand in New York City. I said: Don't hold \nthat against him. I said: If you can't test way-out theories, far-out \nkinds of philosophies when you are young, when are you ever going to \ntest them? I assume Mr. Greenspan has moved on from his youthful days \nof following that way-out philosophy of Ayn Rand's and is now more \nmainstream and more centrist than that. But like I say, that is fine. I \ndon't mind what people do in their youth. That is the time to test \ntheories and philosophies, when you are young.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota said, I have no personal animosity \ntoward Mr. Greenspan. I just have a problem with what I believe the \nphilosophy is at the Fed. I don't think it just applies to Mr. \nGreenspan, It applies to a lot of people at the Federal Reserve Board.\n  In 1996, I opposed the renomination because I feared that he, along \nwith others, had a history of jumping to raise interest rates and to \nchoke off economic growth too soon, blocking the economy from growing \nat its potential and keeping millions of modest-income, middle-income \nAmericans from benefiting from their hard work.\n  A former Chairman of the Fed, William McChesney Martin, once said it \nwas the Fed's job to remove the punch bowl at the party. At some point \nthat should be done. But doing it too early kills our chance for \ngrowth, for jobs. It effectively kills any chance for the maximum \nnumber of Americans to climb the ladder of opportunity.\n  Prior to 1996, Mr. Greenspan showed very little concern in that \nregard. He was focused on the possibility of accelerating inflation. He \nhad, in the past, I believe--and again I say he and the others on the \nFed--had damaged the economy by moving too quickly to raise rates and \nchoking off our growth potential.\n  For some time, a lot of economists, not all but a lot of economists \ntook the view that NAIRU, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of \nunemployment, was 5\\1/2\\ or 6 percent; in other words, that if \nunemployment went below 5\\1/2\\ or 6 percent for a period of time, then \ninflation would take off. Once it started to accelerate, it would be \nvery hard to stop. So that view was once unemployment got down to that \nlevel for a period of time, one had to raise interest rates and stop \nunemployment from being too low.\n  At the same time, the orthodox view among a lot of economists about \nhow fast could the economy grow over the long term was about 2.3 \npercent; somewhere between 2 and 2.5 percent.\n  I must again be very frank. That was the administration's estimate of \nthe economy's potential for sustainable growth. That was in President \nClinton's budget's economic assumptions for FY 97 and I opposed that. I \nsaid to the President and his economic advisers at the time: That is \nnonsense. You are following some of these economists who do not \nunderstand the new economy that is out there. They do not understand \nthe new rate of productivity growth and what is causing it. They are \nstill looking back. They are back in the eighties and not in the 1990s.\n  So it was not just the Fed at that time, it was also the \nadministration of President Clinton and the CBO.\n  They saw it as a simple calculation. You take the increased expected \nproductivity of the economy, estimated at 1.2 percent--again, very \nlow--add the increase to the labor pool--about 1.1 percent--and you get \na 2.3-percent rate of growth.\n  Again, they said if economic growth exceeded 2.3 percent over time, \nor if unemployment fell below 6 percent, the alarm bells would have to \ngo off. It was prudent to raise interest rates or we would be on the \nperilous path of accelerating inflation.\n  So in 1996, viewing that, I feared we would never get a chance to see \nwhat our economy was really capable of doing. That is why I opposed the \nrenomination of Mr. Greenspan in 1996. I suggested in 1996, that the \nsupporters of NAIRU were wrong, that it was an outdated concept. I said \nat the time we could have unemployment at 4.5 percent or less, and I \nsaid it was possible because of increased productivity due to the new \ntechnologies, because of the greater integration of the world economy, \nthe new marketing techniques that are taking place in America and that \nNAIRU was wrong and ought to be thrown out the window.\n  I suggested in 1996 that we ought to give our economy a chance to do \nbetter or we would limit our economic growth and limit the ability of \naverage Americans to see their incomes rise.\n  Mr. Greenspan indicated that he would not raise rates simply because \nof the NAIRU. That was a good statement, but again we had a history of \nthese preemptive strikes, and I feared we would not let the economy \nreach its potential.\n  I believed Mr. Greenspan would be quick to see the specter of \ninflation behind some little statistic. I am here to say fortunately I \nwas wrong about that. Mr. Greenspan and the Fed have allowed the \neconomy to grow. Part of the reason was particular situations, such as \nthe crash of the Asian economies, but I believe there was a willingness \nto let the economy grow and a new attitude that there were some new \nthings happening in the economy.\n  I read a speech Mr. Greenspan gave in which he mused about the \nincrease in productivity and how it did not seem to have any end, the \nuse of computers and how they helped to control inventories. Quite \nfrankly, there seemed to be a shift then at the Fed at that time.\n  The results have been very impressive. Gross domestic product has \nbeen increasing at an average rate of about 4.3 percent since Greenspan \nwas last confirmed. Unemployment has gone down by over a percentage \npoint. The portion of our population over 16 in the workforce is at or \nnear a record high. Unemployment for minorities, teenagers, \ntraditionally hard-to-employ groups are at record lows. Incomes for \nthose at the middle are rising--not as much as I would like--and, to \nsome extent, those at the bottom are rising.\n  What has happened is unemployment fell below 6 percent and inflation \ndid not take off; economic growth was near 3 percent and inflation did \nnot take off. And then unemployment came down to 5.5 percent and \nnothing happened. Then unemployment went below 4.5 percent. It has been \nunder 4.5 percent for almost 2 years now. No inflation. We are seeing \nour GDP increase at over 4 percent on average per year, almost twice \nwhat people were saying a feasible sustainable rate of growth of 2.3 \npercent and there is no inflation and productivity continues to \nincrease.\n  That was in the initial years. Then starting last year Mr. Greenspan \nseems to have shifted his view. The concern was not NAIRU. It was \nirrational exuberance in the stock market. Therefore, we had to put \ninterest rates back up. Last year, there were three ticks up. Today \nthere was another tick up; bringing us to a 1-percent increase in 1 \nyear. It almost seems as Fed are looking for something out there. If it \nis not NAIRU, which has been discarded, then it is something else out \nthere as to why we have to raise interest rates. There is something \nelse out there lurking that is going to cause inflation to happen.\n  Is it irrational exuberance in the stock market. What this is going \nto mean is that, quite frankly, we are going to have more ticks up in \nthe interest rate, enough till we see the rate of unemployment start to \nrise again.\n  I believe that would be a tragic mistake. People need to be employed. \nWe still have people out there who need job training and skill \nupgrading. Can unemployment stay this low without causing accelerating \ninflation? Absolutely. The common wisdom is that we have a pool of low-\nskill workers still to be tapped. All they need is job training and \nskill upgrading, but they are there.\n  Robert Lerman, in an October 26, 1998, Washington Post article said:\n\n       Differences between the groups entering and leaving the \n     workforce explains the surprisingly high qualifications of \n     newly employed adults. Older workers without a high school \n     degree are retiring, replaced by younger, better educated \n     workers. In the past 6 years, the population of college \n     graduates aged 25 and over increased by about 20\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\n     percent, well above the 7 percent growth in total adult \n     population. Meanwhile, the population of high school dropouts \n     declined by nearly 3 million.\n\n  We are getting that higher skilled workforce, and they are more \nproductive. The economy is also attracting people who were not \nconsidering work to come back into the work force.\n  The job market has been tight in most places. In Iowa, we have a low \nrate of unemployment, about 2.2 percent, and that is good. Are wages \nskyrocketing in Iowa because we have low unemployment? No. Are they \nrising modestly? Yes, and they should. With this booming economy and 4-\npercent growth in our GDP, wages ought to be going up.\n\n  As an aside, I find it more than passing strange that here we are in \nthe second week back this year and we could move through the Banking \nCommittee at almost light speed the renomination of a central banker, \nMr. Greenspan, to be head of the Fed, but we cannot do it to raise the \nminimum wage. We cannot do anything to help low-income people get a \nbetter share of the economic growth of this country. Gosh, we could \nsure move fast to help the banking system out, but not to help modest-\nincome Americans.\n  Many economists now come to conclude that NAIRU should not be used to \npredict a new wave of inflation. Quite frankly, I am happy it is dead. \nWe had this irrational exuberance in the stock market. Now we have a \nnew concept. As I said, if it is not NAIRU, then it is this irrational \nexuberance. The new concern is the wealth effect. Mr. President, have \nyou heard about the wealth effect? Mr. Greenspan is talking about the \nwealth effect as a reason we should fear inflation and that we should \nhave some preemptive strike. You have to have something, there has to \nbe something out there. Chairman Volcker had the money supply. Now we \nhave the wealth effect.\n  In a speech at the Economic Club in New York earlier this month, \nChairman Greenspan noted the possible negative impacts of the wealth \neffect. He said that estimates of the wealth effect on the GDP has \nhovered around 1 percent of the GDP since late 1996. He then said, in \npart:\n\n       . . . the impetus to spending by the wealth effect by its \n     very nature clearly cannot persist indefinitely. In part, it \n     adds to the demand for goods and services before the \n     corresponding increase in output fully materializes. It is, \n     in effect, increased purchasing from future income, financed \n     currently by greater borrowing or reduced accumulation of \n     assets.\n\n  There are always limits, aren't there? Economists were right not to \nclamp down on the economy until we see real signs of inflation. The Fed \nshould stick with that view. Today's increase makes me believe the Fed \nwill endanger the economy by not waiting for real signs of inflation, \nand now the wealth effect has become the latest reason, despite the \nfact inflation is nowhere in sight, except for the runup in oil prices \ncaused, in large part, by OPEC's setting of limits on oil production. \nThe Fed raising interest rates will have no effect on that. I think \neveryone agrees with that.\n  This wealth effect is estimated by some to add about 4 cents in extra \nspending per dollar of increased wealth. A prominent study by senior \nvice president Charles Steindel and economist Sydney Ludvigson, both \nwith the New York Fed, concluded the wealth effect was likely to be \nbetween 3 and 4 cents per dollar in annual consumption. They also said \nit is impossible to predict how quickly the wealth effect will kick in. \nIt can take years for consumer spending to reach a permanently higher \nlevel. They said:\n\n       Forecasts of future consumption growth are not typically \n     improved by taking changes in existing wealth into account.\n\n  So I guess what I am saying is the wealth effect--just like NAIRU, \nshould not be the reason for raising interest rates, simply because of \nthe fear that it will cause an inevitable cascade of economic effects \nleading to accelerating inflation.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota said earlier, I believe if the Fed \nwants a more targeted instrument to more carefully check some of the \nexcesses in the stock market, they should look at margin requirements \nfor buying stock on credit. But raising the interest rates is not going \nto do it without great harm to the economy as a whole.\n  So quite frankly, again, we see no signs of higher inflation. We have \nhad inflation down from 3.3 percent in 1996 to 1.7 percent in 1997, and \n1.6 percent in 1998, and in 1999 it jumped to 2.7 percent.\n  Is that a problem? It sounds like a problem until we take out food \nand energy. Without food and energy, the core inflation rate continues \nto improve on a December-to-December basis. In 1996 it was 2.6 percent, \nin 1997 it was 2.2 percent, in 1998 it was 2.4 percent, and in 1999 it \ndropped to 1.9 percent--when you take out food and energy.\n  So inflation is going down. Inflation is dropping. And the Fed is \nraising interest rates. Please, will some economist tell us what is \ngoing on here?\n  Again, inflation took a jump in December two-tenths of a percent. \nBut, again, without food and energy. And energy--that was the culprit, \nnot food--energy prices shot up 1.4 percent that month. Raising the \ninterest rate is not going to cure that. I do not know of anyone who \nsays it will.\n  Petroleum prices move with the OPEC cartel's production, not by the \neffects of interest rate increases. I will repeat that. We all \nunderstand petroleum prices move with the OPEC cartel's production and \nnot by the effects of interest rate increases.\n  So again, I repeat, last year inflation actually went down on a \nDecember-to-December basis. Yet we had three increases in interest \nrates last year and another increase just today.\n  Why? What is happening out there? This is hitting our farmers. It is \nhitting our working families. It may not be hitting Senators and \nCongressmen making 130-some thousand dollars a year. It is not hitting \npeople making money in the stock market. We have our share of \nmegamillionaires in this body. It is not hurting us, not hurting them.\n  But you go out and talk to that husband and wife who are both working \njobs, and they have a couple of kids at home, and they are making \n$40,000 a year, and they are trying to pay a mortgage on a house, \ntrying to keep a car--maybe two cars; they need two for both of them \nwith their jobs--and keeping their kids in clothes. This is a tax on \nthem.\n  We have no signs of accelerating inflation. I believe we are going \ndown the wrong path in raising interest rates.\n  I basically believe we ought to have the lowest possible reasonable \ninterest rates at all times, and only when we see clear signs of \ninflation should we then begin the process of ratcheting up interest \nrates. We have had a period of quality growth and we should be doing \nall that we can to sustain it.\n  Again, I have a lot more I could say about this and what we ought to \nbe doing. What we should be doing is keeping interest rates low. We \nought to be taking the surpluses we have, not using them for a tax cut, \nwhich, again, would be the wrong thing to do at this time. That would \ndo more to stimulate inflation than anything, having some tax cut that \nis going to stimulate and fuel even more demand out there.\n  What we ought to be doing is using the surplus we have now to buy \ndown the national debt. This is where I do agree with Mr. Greenspan: \nBuy down the national debt. He is right in that regard. I do agree with \nhim on that.\n  But we also need to use some of the surplus to invest in \nour children's education so they can partake of the new economies as \nthey grow older. Every child in grade school today ought to have access \nto computers and to the Internet. Every teacher who teaches in grade \nschool today ought to be fully trained in teaching the new kinds of \nskills using the new technologies.\n\n  We need to reeducate those already in our workforce with job \ntraining. We need to upgrade our infrastructure. There are $100 billion \nin needed repairs in our schools in America. I understand the \nPresident's budget was going to have $1.3 billion for that.\n  We need to improve our infrastructure. We need to improve our \ntransportation infrastructure in this country. These are the things we \nought to be doing. This would help to keep our GDP high, keep our \nworkforce employed, keep unemployment low, and keep inflation down. It \nwould not be a tax on working Americans like raising the interest rates \nthat the Fed is doing right now.\n  Productivity is good. Productivity is increasing. We hope it will get \nback to\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nwhere it was in the 1960s. Long term high productivity. A lot of people \nthink we are more productive today than in the 1960s. From 1960 to \n1970, our productivity increased by 31.8 percent. From 1990 to the year \n2000, it increased 21 percent, although we are doing a lot better in \nthe last half of the 90s. So we have a ways to go before we are as \nproductive as in the 1960s. But I believe that will happen in the next \ndecade if we have reasonable policies. In the next decade, I believe \nour productivity will continue at a high level and further increase and \nwill closely approximate what we had in the 1960s.\n  I was chastised back in 1996 when I opposed the Greenspan nomination. \nI was on a couple talk shows, and people asked: What do you think the \ngrowth rate could be, the sustained growth rate? I said: At least 3.5 \npercent, 3 to 3.5 percent without any problem. I got hit by a few \neconomists who said: Oh, Harkin is way out on that one.\n  Since 1996 we have had--what?--4 percent and no inflation. So even \nI--as optimistic as I am about the American economy and the ability of \nour workforce--was a little underestimating the real rate of growth we \ncould have.\n  I am just saying, in the next 10 years we can still maintain a 3- to \n4-percent growth rate. I believe we can maintain an honest average of \nover a 3-percent growth in the next decade. It is not going to happen \nif this Federal Reserve continues to raise these interest rates. They \nare going to choke it off. And they are going to choke it off for no \ngood reason whatsoever.\n  We can improve the quality of the lives of Americans, and we can \ninvest in our future, and we can buy down the national debt. We can do \nall those wonderful things. But if the Fed persists in raising interest \nrates, it is going to choke off our rate of growth. All of the good we \ndo here--in terms of keeping a surplus, in getting rid of the national \ndebt, of investing in young people and in education--all that will be \nfor naught because our rate of growth will be choked off. When that \nrate of growth is choked off, unemployment is going to go up.\n\n  The Fed talks about a soft landing. If you are flying well and the \nairplane is working and you have a lot of fuel and the sky is clear, \nwhy are you worried about a landing? Why are they talking about a \nlanding? This economy, I believe, can grow at a 3-percent plus rate for \nthe next decade. We will have a landing all right. If they keep raising \ninterest rates, we will have a landing.\n  Let me close by saying I think there is a reverse side to the wealth \neffect. I coin the term the ``poor effect.'' Some economists believe \nthat shrinking wealth has an even bigger effect on spending than \ngrowing wealth. If we push the economy into a dive, we will experience \nthe poor effect again. Economist Mark Zandi suggests that declining \nwealth reduces spending by about 7 cents per dollar of wealth lost. So \nif the wealth effect is 3 to 4 cents a dollar, declining wealth reduces \nspending by 7 cents per dollar, almost twice as much. So any danger \nthat is out there of accelerating inflation must be weighed against the \npossible result of slowing the economy and what I call the poor effect, \nnot the wealth effect but the poor effect.\n  Rural Iowa, my State, experienced the poor effect in a deep \nagricultural recession in the mid-1980s. The value of land fell by more \nthan 50 percent as our rural economy crumbled. I saw grown friends of \nmine cry in public, farmers lose their lands, and some of them took \ntheir own lives. Families fell apart; couples divorced. The economy of \nrural Iowa shrunk. Let's not jump too quickly to use the club of higher \ninterest rates.\n  The Federal Reserve has two mandates in law. The Federal Reserve is \nnot a creature of the Constitution of the United States. You won't find \nit in the Constitution anywhere. It is a creature of Congress. We \nlegislatively created it. We gave it two mandates: to balance concerns \nabout inflation on the one hand and to stimulate full employment on the \nother. Those goals were placed in the law in 1978.\n  Prior to 1978, there was no specific mention of inflation at all in \nthe law. It was not in any of the laws about the Fed going all the way \nback to its founding in 1913. By the Full Employment and Balanced \nGrowth Act of 1978, the Congress, in the exercise of its constitutional \npower, said to the Fed: You have two functions now: check inflation and \nstimulate full employment. That law we passed in 1978 set a goal of 4-\npercent unemployment for those 16 and older, 3 percent for those over \n19. We are near 4 percent now. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, \nconservative economists laughed at those goals. They said they were \nridiculous targets set by politicians. That is the law of the land, and \nit sure doesn't look so silly now.\n  I worry that the Fed has a hard time maintaining a balance between \ninflation and full employment concerns. They are only focused on the \nspecter of inflation, and there is no inflation out there. As I said, \nnew advances in our technology, in our computers, designing products at \nhigh speed, the rapid replacement of parts, tight controls on \ninventories at lower cost, reduces the inventory buildup, one of the \nclassic causes of past recessions. Communications costs are dropping \nlike a rock. Every day I get something in the mail that I can make \nlong-distance calls cheaper than I did the day before. Now you can get \ncomputers individually tailored for retail customers under $1,000 from \nGateway Computer. Amazing, a world economy, capital flowing around the \nworld.\n  I know others want to speak. I see my good friend from Minnesota, who \nhas been a great leader on this in the past, on the floor. I know he \nwants to speak. I took this time because, as I said, I don't want \nanyone to mistake that I have some personal animosity toward Mr. \nGreenspan. That is not so. I do have very deep-seated questions about \nthe direction of the Fed, the fact they are raising interest rates \nwithout any inflation, and they are going to choke off this great \ngrowth we are having in this country with a series of interest rate \nincreases. They are going to push up unemployment.\n\n  I will yield the floor with the final statement that we need to open \nup the Federal Reserve System's meetings. I don't want to make them \npolitical. It should not be political. We need to know why they are \nmaking the decisions they make. The decision they make on raising \ninterest rates taxes every working American. How would they feel if we \ndebated tax policy behind closed doors? I don't want to make it \npolitical, but I think it ought to be open. Secondly, I believe the Fed \nshould pay more attention to unemployment and to growth and not just \nget so fixated on some specter of inflation that is not even out there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from Virginia is here. I \nhave a fairly lengthy statement. I know our colleague from Virginia \nwants to speak. I wish to take a few minutes. I ask the Chair, are we \ngoing to vote tomorrow? Do we have a time limit today or not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We do have a time limit. The Senator has 49 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I take a few minutes now and then come back after \nthe Senator from Virginia speaks, are we going to be in session for a \nwhile tonight speaking on this? Will I be able to do that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is not aware of any time limit.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder, if I took but 3 minutes, would that convenience \nmy colleague?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have to leave anyway in a few minutes for a meeting \nwith some farmers. Let me take a few minutes, and I will be done. Then \nI will be pleased to yield the floor and then come back later.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the Senator from Iowa for \nhis comments. I think I can be brief because much of what he says I am \nin such strong agreement with.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow morning, do we have any time for debate \nbefore the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no orders that have been entered for \ntomorrow as of yet.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is there a scheduled vote tomorrow at a particular \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nothing has been ordered yet for tomorrow, so \nthe Senator can assume there might be some time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I may have 20 minutes to \nspeak tomorrow morning.\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I suggest that the manager \nof this nomination be consulted first. Can the Senator withhold that \nand as a matter of courtesy discuss it with the manager and leadership \nof the Senate? I think that would be an important consideration. At \nthis time, with no discourtesy to my colleague, I register an \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-two minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say with a great sense of humility that \nI have been privileged to be in public office for over 30 years. In the \ncourse of that time, I have had the privilege and wonderful opportunity \nto meet dozens and dozens of people who have held public office. I have \nlistened to the very interesting comments of my colleagues with regard \nto the economy and interest rates and the like concerning the \ndistinguished nominee, Mr. Greenspan. I simply go to a very simple but \ndirect point with regard to this nomination; that is, dollars have a \ndifferent meaning to people--savings, investments, and the like. But \nalmost without exception they represent the efforts of hard work.\n  Therefore, when it comes time to preserve, invest, save, whatever you \nmay do with those dollars--the man and woman primarily who have earned \nit--you want to know that the system, the value of that dollar, the \nprotection of that dollar is there for your anticipated use and in many \ninstances for the next generation. As to those people who are directly \nconcerned with the regulatory process and decision process which \nvitally affects the value of the dollar and the protection of the \ninvestments, you want to know they are of unquestionable character.\n  I have known the nominee for many years and have had the privilege of \nworking with him, playing golf and tennis with him. You get to know the \ntotality of the man. This man is extraordinary. There will not be \nraised in the course of this debate, in my judgment, one single comment \nby any of my colleagues questioning this man's character. He is known \nby many in this community, he is known in this country, and he is known \nworldwide. The solidarity of his character and ethical standards is \nsecond to none. You may differ with him on some of his decisions, and \nthat is understandable, but in terms of integrity, character, and \nethics, he is beyond question. How fortunate we are that the President \nhas selected this man to continue to serve this country and, indeed, \nthe world because we are the world's leader in economics, national \nsecurity, and in every other respect.\n  I am happy to add my few words and indicate my support that we are \nfortunate to have a person of his great character to step up once again \nand assume the arduous role and time-consuming lifestyle of this \nimportant post. But before we confer on him the advice and consent of \nthe Senate and every other aspect, he is not infallible. As I said, I \nremember someone many years ago talking about Great Britain who said: \nYou get to know a man--on the playing fields I think it was. He is not \ninfallible. This man cannot keep a golf score. His partners constantly \nhave to remind him. He cannot keep score in a tennis game. This is \nperplexing. I can bring witnesses to attest to this. But we have to \noverlook that minor matter as he deals with major figures, and we wish \nhim luck with the anticipated action of this distinguished body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto use as much time under Senator Gramm's time allotment as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Alan Greenspan's \nnomination as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Many years from \nnow, historians may look at the Clinton Presidency and say that the \nbest decision he made in office was to keep Alan Greenspan at the helm \nof the Federal Reserve.\n  Alan Greenspan, the individual, is a man of unquestioned integrity \nand intellect. I have known him for over two decades. He is truly one \nof our finest public servants. He has served at the Federal Reserve \nsince 1987, and a steady hand at the wheel he has been. When the \neconomy could have been volatile with a less experienced person, having \nhim there caused the seas to be more tranquil. As my colleague Senator \nGramm has said, he may be the finest central banker we have ever had in \nthe United States or, for that matter, the world has ever known.\n  In fact, it is the example he has shown that has caused many other \ncountries to realize the importance of having a central bank of \ntransparency, of having someone who is not political at the helm of \nFederal Reserve policy. This example is going to strengthen many new \ndemocracies we are seeing in the world today, and his example will be \nthe one they follow.\n  I find it curious that there are some in opposition to this \nnomination, and it is really ironic in light of yesterday's headlines \nthat the economic expansion that began in 1991 is now the longest in \nAmerican history. That did not happen by accident. It did not happen by \nluck. It happened because there was a steady hand at the wheel. That \nmay not be the only reason we have had economic expansion. Our \ncreativity, the spirit of entrepreneurship in our country, also has a \npart in that. But if we had someone who was trigger happy at the Fed, \nsomeone who would jump too quickly and too far, it could have caused a \nvery different result. I am very pleased that the President has \nrenominated Alan Greenspan.\n\n  There is an old saying: If it ``ain't'' broke, don't fix it. It seems \nto me some of the Senators I have heard on the floor today speaking in \nopposition to Alan Greenspan's renomination are fixing a Maytag. In \nfact, this ``ain't'' broke, and the last thing we need to do is tinker \nwith something that is working very well.\n  America is enjoying an unprecedented economic expansion. Of course, \nAlan Greenspan's steady hand at the Federal Reserve Board has allowed \nour economy to flourish and not be crippled by high inflation or \ninterest rates. It has not been an easy task. Every time the Federal \nOpen Market Committee meets, the airwaves are full of people saying the \nFed either made the right decision or the wrong decision, they should \nhave done more, they should have done less. It is a careful balancing \nact, but I can think of no one I would be happier to have in charge \nthan Dr. Greenspan.\n  He knows the power of his words. Many times I have been in the \naudience when he has spoken, and he is very careful not to overstep. He \nknows that what he says is going to affect the stock market, and he \ndoes not want to have such an impact. He himself jokes sometimes to \naudiences: If you think you understand what I am about to say, you have \nmisunderstood.\n  He does not want to do something that is going to have a drastic \nimpact, that will have a 1-day impact or a 2-day impact or a 1-week \nimpact. What he wants is to have a steady, noninflationary atmosphere \nso we will not have interest rates that are too high, interest rates \nthat are too low, an economy that is too hot, an economy that is not \nhot enough. He understands these issues because of his experience.\n  We do not know what our economic future holds, but this much we do \nknow: Whatever economic ups or downs may confront us in the future, and \nparticularly economic ups and downs of other countries which we cannot \ncontrol, the person most capable of dealing with them is Alan \nGreenspan. With him in charge, we are much more likely to avoid \neconomic pitfalls for our country.\n  I urge the Senate to approve his nomination. I am certain it will. \nFrom the speeches I have heard on the floor today, the overwhelming \nsentiment is going to be to confirm Alan Greenspan.\n  He has been at the Federal Reserve for 13 years. He has presided over \nthe greatest economic expansion in the\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\nworld, and most surely we will be in our strongest position to \nwithstand whatever might hit us in the future if we have someone with \nhis experience, his integrity, and his intellect at the head of the \nFederal Reserve Board.\n  I hope my colleagues will confirm him tomorrow and that it will be an \noverwhelming vote. The time has come for us to move on this important \nnomination.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Voinovich pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 38 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as I did 4 years ago, I wish to record \nmy emphatic and enthusiastic support for the nomination of the \nhonorable Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System. He is a national treasure. He \nhas served our Nation with principle and wisdom, and I shall attempt to \nshow in these brief remarks, unprecedented success.\n  Let me cite four principal reasons--updated from four years ago--why \nhe should again be confirmed by the Senate.\n  The economy is now in its 107th month of an expansion--the longest in \nAmerican history--which shows no sign of ending.\n  The unemployment rate for December was 4.1 percent and has been below \n5 percent for almost three years. Not too long ago, economists \nestimated that the NAIRU, as the acronym was for the nonaccelerating \ninflation rate of unemployment--what we might call full employment--was \nabout 6 percent.\n  Next, inflation is in check. Measured by the CPI--which economists \nbelieve overstates inflation--consumer prices have increased by less \nthan 3 percent per year for the past three years.\n  Finally, the misery index--the sum of the unemployment rate and the \ninflation rate--is about 7 percent, the lowest level in 30 years.\n  These outcomes are a tribute to Alan Greenspan's stewardship of our \nNation's monetary policy for the past 13 years. But his wisdom and \ninfluence extend far beyond mere stewardship of monetary policy.\n  Last Wednesday, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs he had this to say in \nresponse to a question about the use of budget surpluses from Senator \nPhil Gramm, the Committee's Chairman, Dr. Greenspan said:\n\n       . . . my first priority would be to allow as much of the \n     surplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the \n     public. . . . From an economic point of view, that would be, \n     by far, the best means of employing it.\n\n  And last month, in remarks before the Economic Club of New York, \nChairman Greenspan demonstrated why he has been so successful. He \nunderstands--as perhaps few others in high level economic policy \npositions--how the economy works. One can only marvel at the clarity \nand insights he brought to bear as he explained to his audience the \nimpact on productivity of just-in-time inventories, and reasons why the \nwealth effect from the increase in the stock market has sustained the \ncurrent expansion, while at the same time containing ``the potential \nseeds of rising inflationary and financial pressures that could \nundermine the current expansion.'' Ever vigilant to these potential \ndangers explains why the FED, under Chairman Greenspan, today increased \ninterest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point.\n  Based on his performance, Chairman Greenspan deserves to be \nreconfirmed. I have no doubt that the Senate will, in a near unanimous \nvote, concur.\n  I ask unanimous consent that remarks of Chairman Greenspan, at the \nEconomic Club of New York be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks by Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal \n Reserve System, before the Economic Club of New York, January 13, 2000\n\n       We are within weeks of establishing a record for the \n     longest economic expansion in this nation's history. The 106-\n     month expansion of the 1960s, which was elongated by the \n     Vietnam War, will be surpassed in February. Nonetheless, \n     there remain few evident signs of geriatric strain that \n     typically presage an imminent economic downturn.\n       Four or five years into this expansion, in the middle of \n     the 1990s, it was unclear whether going forward, this cycle \n     would differ significantly from the many others that have \n     characterized post-World War II America. More recently, \n     however, it has become increasingly difficult to deny that \n     something profoundly different from the typical postwar \n     business cycle has emerged. Not only is the expansion \n     reaching record length, but it is doing so with far stronger-\n     than-expected economic growth. Most remarkably, inflation has \n     remained subdued in the face of labor markets tighter than \n     any we have experienced in a generation. Analysts are \n     struggling to create a credible conceptual framework to fit a \n     pattern of interrelationships that has defied conventional \n     wisdom based on our economy's history of the past half \n     century.\n       When we look back at the 1990s, from the perspective of say \n     2010, the nature of the forces currently in train will have \n     presumably become clearer. We may conceivably conclude from \n     that vantage point that, at the turn of the millennium, the \n     American economy was experiencing a once-in-a-century \n     acceleration of innovation, which propelled forward \n     productivity, output, corporate profits, and stock prices at \n     a pace not seen in generations, if ever.\n       Alternatively, that 2010 retrospective might well conclude \n     that a good deal of what we are currently experiencing was \n     just one of the many euphoric speculative bubbles that have \n     dotted human history. And, of course, we cannot rule out that \n     we may look back and conclude that elements from both \n     scenarios have been in play in recent years.\n       On the one hand, the evidence of dramatic innovations--\n     veritable shifts in the tectonic plates of technology--has \n     moved far beyond mere conjecture. On the other, these \n     extraordinary achievements continue to be bedeviled by \n     concerns that the so-called New Economy is spurring \n     imbalances that at some point will abruptly adjust, bringing \n     the economic expansion, its euphoria, and wealth creation to \n     a debilitating halt. This evening I should like to address \n     some of the evidence and issues that pertain to these \n     seemingly alternative scenarios.\n       What should be indisputable is that a number of new \n     technologies that evolved largely from the cumulative \n     innovations of the past half century have not begun to bring \n     about awesome changes in the way goods and services are \n     produced and, especially, in the way they are distributed to \n     final users. Those innovations, particularly the Internet's \n     rapid emergence from infancy, have spawned a ubiquity of \n     startup firms, many of which claim to offer the chance to \n     revolutionize and dominate large shares of the nation's \n     production and distribution system. Capital markets, not \n     comfortable dealing with discontinuous shifts in economic \n     structure, are groping for sensible evaluations of these \n     firms. The exceptional stock price volatility of most of the \n     newer firms and, in the view of some, their outsized \n     valuations, are indicative of the difficulties of divining \n     from the many, the particular few of the newer technologies \n     and operational models that will prevail in the decades \n     ahead.\n       How did we arrive at such a fascinating and, to some, \n     unsettling point in history? The process of innovations, of \n     course, is never-ending. Yet the development of the \n     transistor after World War II appears in retrospect to have \n     initiated an especial wave of innovative synergies. It \n     brought us the microprocessor, the computer, satellites, and \n     the joining of laser and fiber-optic technologies. These, in \n     turn, fostered by the 1990s an enormous new capacity to \n     disseminate information. To be sure, innovation is not \n     confined to information technologies. Impressive technical \n     advances can be found in many corners of the economy.\n       But it is information technology that defines this special \n     period. The reason is that information innovation lies at the \n     root of productivity and economic growth. Its major \n     contribution is to reduce the number of worker hours required \n     to produce the nation's output. Yet, in the vibrant economic \n     conditions that have accompanied this period of technical \n     innovation, many more job opportunities have been created \n     than have been lost. Indeed, our unemployment rate has fallen \n     notably as technology has blossomed.\n       One result of the more-rapid pace of IT innovation has been \n     a visible acceleration of the process of ``creative \n     destruction,'' a shifting of capital from failing \n     technologies into those technologies at the cutting edge. The \n     process of capital reallocation across the economy has been \n     assisted by a significant unbundling of risks in capital \n     markets made possible by the development of innovative \n     financial products, many of which themselves owe their \n     viability to advances in IT.\n\n[[Page S273]]\n\n       Before this revolution in information availability, most \n     twentieth-century business decisionmaking had been hampered \n     by wide uncertainty. Owing to the paucity of timely knowledge \n     of customers' needs and of the location of inventories and \n     materials flowing throughout complex production systems, \n     businesses, as many of you well remember, required \n     substantial programmed redundancies to function effectively.\n       Doubling up on materials and people was essential as backup \n     to the inevitable misjudgments of the real-time state of play \n     in a company. Decisions were made from information that was \n     hours, days, or even weeks old. Accordingly, production \n     planning required costly inventory safety stocks and backup \n     teams of people to respond to the unanticipated and the \n     misjudged.\n       Large remnants of information void, of course, still \n     persist, and forecasts of future events on which all business \n     decisions ultimately depend are still unavoidably uncertain. \n     But the remarkable surge in the availability of more timely \n     information in recent years has enabled business management \n     to remove large swaths of inventory safety stocks and worker \n     redundancies.\n       Information access in real time--resulting, for example, \n     from such processes as electronic data interface between the \n     retail checkout counter and the factory floor or the \n     satellite location of trucks--has fostered marked reductions \n     in delivery lead times and the related workhours required for \n     the production and delivery of all sorts of goods, from books \n     to capital equipment.\n       The dramatic decline in the lead times for the delivery of \n     capital equipment has made a particularly significant \n     contribution to the favorable economic environment of the \n     past decade. When lead times for equipment are long, the \n     equipment must have multiple capabilities to deal with the \n     plausible range of business needs likely to occur after these \n     capital goods are delivered and installed.\n       With lead times foreshortened, many of the redundancies \n     built into capital equipment to ensure that it could meet all \n     plausible alternatives of a defined distant future could be \n     sharply reduced. That means fewer goods and worker hours are \n     caught up in activities that, while perceived as necessary \n     insurance to sustain valued output, in the end produce \n     nothing of value.\n       Those intermediate production and distribution activities, \n     so essential when information and quality control were poor, \n     are being reduced in scale and, in some cases, eliminated. \n     These trends may well gather speed and force as the Internet \n     alters relationships of businesses to their suppliers and \n     their customers.\n       The process of innovation goes beyond the factory floor or \n     distribution channels. Design times and costs have fallen \n     dramatically as computer modeling has eliminated the need, \n     for example, of the large staff of architectural \n     specification-drafters previously required for building \n     projects. Medical diagnoses are more thorough, accurate, and \n     far faster, with access to heretofore unavailable \n     information. Treatment is accordingly hastened, and hours of \n     procedures eliminated.\n       Indeed, these developments emphasize the essence of \n     information technology--the expansion of knowledge and its \n     obverse, the reduction in uncertainty. As a consequence, risk \n     premiums that were associated with all forms of business \n     activities have declined.\n       Because the future is never entirely predictable, risk in \n     any business action committed to the future--that is, \n     virtually all business actions--can be reduced but never \n     eliminated. Information technologies, by improving our real-\n     time understanding of production processes and of the \n     vagaries of consumer demand, are reducing the degree of \n     uncertainty and, hence, risk.\n       In short, information technology raises output per hour in \n     the total economy principally by reducing hours worked on \n     activities needed to guard productive processes against the \n     unknown and the unanticipated. Narrowing the uncertainties \n     reduces the number of hours required to maintain any given \n     level of production readiness.\n       In economic terms, we are reducing risk premiums and \n     variances throughout the economic decision tree that drives \n     the production of our goods and services. This has meant that \n     employment of scarce resources to deal with heightened risk \n     premiums has been reduced.\n       The relationship between businesses and consumers already \n     is being changed by the expanding opportunities for e-\n     commerce. The forces unleashed by the Internet are almost \n     surely to be even more potent within and among businesses, \n     where uncertainties are being reduced by improving the \n     quantity, the reliability, and the timeliness of information. \n     This is the case in many recent initiatives, especially among \n     our more seasoned companies, to consolidate and rationalize \n     their supply chains using the Internet.\n       Not all technologies, information or otherwise, however, \n     increase productivity--that is, output per hour--by reducing \n     the inputs necessary to produce existing products. Some new \n     technologies bring about new goods and services with above \n     average value added per workhour. The dramatic advances in \n     biotechnology, for example, are significantly increasing a \n     broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from \n     agriculture to medicine.\n       Indeed, in our dynamic labor markets, the resources made \n     redundant by better information, as I indicated earlier, are \n     being drawn to the newer activities and newer products, many \n     never before contemplated or available. The personal \n     computer, with ever-widening applications in homes and \n     businesses, is one. So are the fax and the cell phone. The \n     newer biotech innovations are most especially of this type, \n     particularly the remarkable breadth of medical and \n     pharmacological product development.\n       At the end of the day, however, the newer technologies \n     obviously can increase outputs or reduce inputs and, hence, \n     increase productivity only if they are embodied in capital \n     investment. Capital investment here is defined in the \n     broadest sense as any outlay that enhances future productive \n     capabilities and, consequently, capital asset values.\n       But for capital investments to be made, the prospective \n     rate of return on their implementation must exceed the cost \n     of capital. Gains in productivity and capacity per real \n     dollar invested clearly rose materially in the 1990s, while \n     the increase in equity values, reflecting that higher \n     earnings potential, reduced the cost of capital.\n       In particular, technological synergies appear to be \n     engendering an ever-widening array of prospective new capital \n     investments that offer profitable cost displacement. In a \n     consolidated sense, reduced cost generally means reduced \n     labor cost or, in productivity terms, fewer hours worked per \n     unit of output. These increased real rates of return on \n     investment and consequent improved productivity are clearly \n     most evident among the relatively small segment of our \n     economy that produces high-tech equipment. But the newer \n     technologies are spreading to firms not conventionally \n     thought of as high tech.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Footnotes at end of Remarks.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       It would be an exaggeration to imply that whenever a cost \n     increase emerges on the horizon, there is a capital \n     investment that is available to quell it. Yet the veritable \n     explosion of high-tech equipment and software spending that \n     has raised the growth of the capital stock dramatically over \n     the past five years could hardly have occurred without a \n     large increase in the pool of profitable projects becoming \n     available to business planners. As rising productivity growth \n     in the high-tech sector since 1995 has resulted in an \n     acceleration of price declines for equipment embodying the \n     newer technologies, investment in this equipment by firms in \n     a wide variety of industries has expanded sharply.\n       Had high prospective returns on these capital projects not \n     materialized, the current capital equipment investment boom--\n     there is no better word--would have petered out long ago. In \n     the event, overall equipment and capitalized software outlays \n     as a percentage of GDP in nominal dollars have reached their \n     highest level in post-World War II history.\n       To be sure, there is also a virtuous capital investment \n     cycle at play here. A whole new set of profitable investments \n     raises productivity, which for a time raises profits--\n     spurring further investment and consumption. At the same \n     time, faster productivity growth keeps a lid on unit costs \n     and prices. Firms hesitate to raise prices for fear that \n     their competitors will be able, with lower costs from new \n     investments, to wrest market share from them.\n       Indeed, the increasing availability of labor-displacing \n     equipment and software, at declining prices and improving \n     delivery lead times, is arguably at the root of the loss of \n     business pricing power in recent years. To be sure, other \n     inflation-suppressing forces have been at work as well. \n     Marked increases in available global capacity were engendered \n     as a number of countries that were previously members of the \n     autarchic Soviet bloc opened to the West, and as many \n     emerging-market economies blossomed. Reductions in Cold War \n     spending in the United States and around the world also \n     released resources to more productive private purposes. In \n     addition, deregulation that removed bottlenecks and hence \n     increased supply response in many economies, especially ours, \n     has been a formidable force suppressing price increases as \n     well. Finally, the global economic crisis of 1997 and 1998 \n     reduced the prices of energy and other key inputs into \n     production and consumption, helping to hold down inflation \n     for several years.\n       Of course, Europe and Japan have participated in this \n     recent wave of invention and innovation and have full access \n     to the newer technologies. However, they arguably have \n     been slower to apply them. The relatively inflexible and, \n     hence, more costly labor markets of these economies appear \n     to be an important factor. The high rates of return \n     offered by the newer technologies are largely the result \n     of labor cost displacement, and because it is more costly \n     to dismiss workers in Europe and Japan, the rate of return \n     on the same equipment is correspondingly less there than \n     the United States. Here, labor displacement is more \n     readily countenanced both by law and by culture, \n     facilitating the adoption of technology that raises \n     standards of living over time.\n       There, of course, has been a substantial amount of labor-\n     displacing investment in Europe to obviate expensive \n     increased employment as their economies grow. But it is not \n     clear to what extent such investment has been directed at \n     reducing existing levels of employment. It should always be \n     remembered that in economies where dismissing a worker is \n     expensive, hiring one will also be perceived to be expensive.\n       An ability to reorganize production and distribution \n     processes is essential to take advantage of newer \n     technologies. Indeed, the combination of a marked surge in \n     mergers and acquisitions, and especially the vast increase in \n     strategic alliances, including\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\n     across borders, is dramatically altering business structures \n     to conform to the imperatives of the newer technologies.\\2\\\n       We are seeing the gradual breaking down of competition-\n     inhibiting institutions from the keiretsu and chaebol of East \n     Asia, to the dirigisme of some of continental Europe. The \n     increasingly evident advantages of applying the newer \n     technologies is undermining much of the old political wisdom \n     of protected stability. The clash between unfettered \n     competitive technological advance and protectionism, both \n     domestic and international, will doubtless engage our \n     attention for many years into this new century. The turmoil \n     in Seattle last month may be a harbinger of an intensified \n     debate.\n       However one views the causes of our low inflation and \n     strong growth, there can be little argument that the American \n     economy as it stands at the beginning of a new century has \n     never exhibited so remarkable a prosperity for at least the \n     majority of Americans.\n       Nonetheless, this seemingly beneficial state of affairs is \n     not without its own set of potential challenges. \n     Productivity-driven supply growth has, by raising long-term \n     profit expectations, engendered a huge gain in equity prices. \n     Through the so-called ``wealth effect,'' these gains have \n     tended to foster increases in aggregate demand beyond the \n     increases in supply. It is this imbalance between growth of \n     supply and growth of demand that contains the potential seeds \n     of rising inflationary and financial pressures that could \n     undermine the current expansion.\n       Higher productivity growth must show up as increases in \n     real incomes of employees, as profit, or more generally as \n     both. Unless the propensity to spend out of real income \n     falls, private consumption and investment growth will rise, \n     as indeed it must, since over time demand and supply must \n     balance. (I leave the effect of fiscal policy for later.) If \n     this was all that happened, accelerating productivity would \n     be wholly benign and beneficial.\n       But in recent years, largely as a result of the \n     appreciating values of ownership claims on the capital stock, \n     themselves a consequence, at least in part, of accelerating \n     productivity, the net worth of households has expanded \n     dramatically, relative to income. This has spurred private \n     consumption to rise even faster than the incomes engendered \n     by the productivity-driven rise in output growth. Moreover, \n     the fall in the cost of equity capital corresponding to \n     higher share prices, coupled with enhanced potential rates of \n     return, has spurred private capital investment. There is a \n     wide range of estimates of how much added growth the rise in \n     equity prices has engendered, but they center around 1 \n     percentage point of the somewhat more than 4 percentage point \n     annual growth rate of GDP since late 1996.\n       Such overall extra domestic demand can be met only with \n     increased imports (net of exports) or with new domestic \n     output produced by employing additional workers. The latter \n     can come only from drawing down the pool of those seeking \n     work or from increasing net immigration.\n       Thus, the impetus to spending from the wealth effect by its \n     very nature clearly cannot persist indefinitely. In part, it \n     adds to the demand for goods and services before the \n     corresponding increase in output fully materializes. It is, \n     in effect, increased purchasing from future income, financed \n     currently by greater borrowing or reduced accumulation of \n     assets.\n       If capital gains had no evident effect on consumption or \n     investment, their existence would have no influence on output \n     or employment either. Increased equity claims would merely \n     match the increased market value of productive assets, \n     affecting only balance sheets, not flows of goods and \n     services, not supply or demand, and not labor markets.\n       But this is patently not the case. Increasing perceptions \n     of wealth have clearly added to consumption and driven down \n     the amount of saving out of current income and spurred \n     capital investment.\n       To meet this extra demand, our economy has drawn on all \n     sources of added supply. Our net imports and current account \n     deficits have risen appreciably in recent years. This has \n     been financed by foreign acquisition of dollar assets \n     fostered by the same sharp increases in real rates of return \n     on American capital that set off the wealth effect and \n     domestic capital goods boom in the first place. Were it \n     otherwise, the dollar's foreign exchange value would have \n     been under marked downward pressure in recent years. We have \n     also relied on net immigration to augment domestic output. \n     And finally, we have drawn down the pool of available \n     workers.\n       The bottom line, however, is that, while immigration and \n     imports can significantly cushion the consequences of the \n     wealth effect and its draining of the pool of unemployed \n     workers for awhile, there are limits. Immigration is \n     constrained by law and its enforcement; imports, by the \n     willingness of global investors to accumulate dollar assets; \n     and the draw down of the pool of workers by the potential \n     emergency of inflationary imbalances in labor markets. \n     Admittedly, we are groping to infer where those limits may \n     be. But that there are limits cannot be open to question.\n       However one views the operational relevance of a Phillips \n     curve or the associated NAIRU (the nonaccelerating inflation \n     rate of unemployment)--and I am personally decidedly doubtful \n     about it--there has to be a limit to how far the pool of \n     available labor can be drawn down without pressing wage \n     levels beyond productivity. The existence or nonexistence of \n     an empirically identifiable NAIRU has no bearing on the \n     existence of the venerable law of supply and demand.\n       To be sure, increases in wages in excess of productivity \n     growth may not be inflationary, and destructive of economic \n     growth, if offset by decreases in other costs or declining \n     profit margins. A protracted decline in margins, however, is \n     a recipe for recession. Thus, if our objective of maximum \n     sustainable economic growth is to be achieved, the pool of \n     available workers cannot shrink indefinitely.\n       As my late friend and eminent economist Herb Stein often \n     suggested: If a trend cannot continue, it will stop. What \n     will stop the wealth-induced excess of demand over \n     productivity-expanded supply is largely developments in \n     financial markets.\n       That process is already well advanced. For the equity \n     wealth effect to be contained, either expected future \n     earnings must decline, or the discount factor applied to \n     those earnings must rise. There is little evidence of the \n     former. Indeed, security analysts, reflecting detailed \n     information on and from the companies they cover, have \n     continued to revise upward long-term earnings projections. \n     However, real rates of interest on long-term BBB corporate \n     debt, a good proxy for the average of all corporate debt, \n     have already risen well over a full percentage point since \n     late 1997, suggesting increased pressure on discount \n     factors.\\3\\ This should not be a surprise because an excess \n     of demand over supply ultimately comes down to planned \n     investment exceeding saving that would be available at the \n     economy's full potential. In the end, balance is achieved \n     through higher borrowing rates. Thus, the rise in real rates \n     should be viewed as a quite natural consequence of the \n     pressures of heavier demands for investment capital, driven \n     by higher perceived returns associated with technological \n     breakthroughs and supported by a central bank intent on \n     defusing the imbalances that would undermine the expansion.\n       We cannot predict with any assurance how long a growing \n     wealth effect--more formally, a rise in the ratio of \n     household net worth to income--will persist, nor do we \n     suspect can anyone else. A diminution of the wealth effect, I \n     should add, does not mean that prices of assets cannot keep \n     rising, only that they rise no more than income.\n       A critical factor in how the rising wealth effect and its \n     ultimate limitation will play out in the market place and the \n     economy is the state of government, especially federal, \n     finances.\n       The sharp rise in revenues (at a nearly 8 percent annual \n     rate since 1995) has been significantly driven by increased \n     receipts owing to realized capital gains and increases in \n     compensation directly and indirectly related to the huge rise \n     in stock prices. Both the Administration and the Congress \n     have chosen wisely to allow unified budget surpluses to build \n     and have usefully focused on eliminating the historically \n     chronic borrowing from social security trust funds to finance \n     current outlays.\n       The growing unified budget surpluses have absorbed a good \n     part of the excess of potential private demand over potential \n     supply. A continued expansion of the surplus would surely aid \n     in sustaining the productive investment that has been key to \n     leveraging the opportunities provided by new technology, \n     while holding down a further reliance on imports and \n     absorption of the pool of available workers.\n       I trust that the recent flurry of increased federal \n     government outlays, seemingly made easier by the emerging \n     surpluses, is an aberration. In today's environment of rapid \n     innovation, growing unified budget surpluses can obviate at \n     least part of the rebalancing pressures evident in marked \n     increases in real long-term interest rates.\n       As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, it may be many \n     years before we fully understand the nature of the rapid \n     changes currently confronting our economy. We are unlikely to \n     fully comprehend the process and its interactions with asset \n     prices until we have been through a complete business cycle.\n       Regrettably, we at the Federal Reserve do not have the \n     luxury of awaiting a better set of insights into this \n     process. Indeed, our goal, in responding to the complexity of \n     current economic forces, is to extend the expansion by \n     containing its imbalances and avoiding the very recession \n     that would complete a business cycle.\n       If we knew for sure that economic growth would soon be \n     driven wholly by gains in productivity and growth of the \n     working age population, including immigration, we would not \n     need to be as concerned about the potential for inflationary \n     distortions. Clearly, we cannot know for sure, because we are \n     dealing with world economic forces which are new and \n     untested.\n       While we endeavor to find the proper configuration of \n     monetary and fiscal policies to sustain the remarkable \n     performance of our economy, there should be no ambiguity on \n     the policies required to support enterprise and competition.\n       I believe that we as a people are very fortunate: When \n     confronted with the choice between rapid growth with its \n     inevitable insecurities and a stable, but stagnant economy, \n     given time, Americans have chosen growth. But as we seek to \n     manage what is now this increasingly palpable historic change \n     in the way businesses and workers create value, our nation \n     needs to address the associated dislocations that emerge, \n     especially among workers who see the security of their jobs\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\n     and their lives threatened. Societies cannot thrive when \n     significant segments perceive its functioning as unjust.\n       It is the degree of unbridled fierce competition within and \n     among our economies today--not free trade or globalization as \n     such--that is the source of the unease that has manifested \n     itself, and was on display in Seattle a month ago. Trade and \n     globalization are merely the vehicles that foster \n     competition, whose application and benefits currently are \n     nowhere more evident than here, today, in the United States.\n       Confronted face-on, no one likes competition; certainly, I \n     did not when I was a private consultant vying with other \n     consulting firms. But the competitive challenge galvanized me \n     and my colleagues to improve our performance so that at the \n     end of the day we and, indeed, our competitors, and \n     especially our clients, were more productive.\n       There are many ways to address the all too real human \n     problems that are the inevitable consequences of accelerating \n     change. Restraining competition, domestic or international, \n     to suppress competitive turmoil is not one of them. That \n     would be profoundly counterproductive to rising standards of \n     living.\n       We are in a period of dramatic gains in innovation and \n     technical change that challenge all of us, as owners of \n     capital, as suppliers of labor, as voters and policymakers. \n     How well policy can be fashioned to allow the private sector \n     to maximize the benefits of innovations that we currently \n     enjoy, and to contain the imbalances they create, will shape \n     the economic configuration of the first part of the new \n     century.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Since the early 1990s, the annual growth rate in output \n     per hour of nonfinancial corporate businesses outside high \n     tech has risen by a full percentage point.\n     \\2\\ For example, the emergence of many alternate technologies \n     in areas where only one or two will set the standard and \n     survive has created high risk, high reward outcomes for their \n     creators. The desire to spread risk (and the willingness to \n     forgo the winner-take-all return) has fostered a substantial \n     number of technology-sharing alliances.\n     \\3\\ The inflation expectations employed in this calculation \n     are those implicit in the gap between the interest rates on \n     ten-year Treasury inflation-indexed notes and those on a \n     nominal security derived from Treasury STRIPS constructed to \n     have comparable duration. The latter are used because, they \n     have the same relatively limited liquidity as inflation-\n     indexed notes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, about the only chance we ever have to \ndiscuss interest rates and monetary policy in this body is when Alan \nGreenspan gets renominated to the Federal Reserve Board, which \nadmittedly seems to happen on a fairly regular basis.\n  That is a shame, because there aren't many issues we debate in the \nSenate that have a bigger impact on the average American family. Why \nare interest rates so important? Well, for one thing, the decision to \nraise or lower interest rates directly affects pretty much every single \nAmerican, in one way or another. Small businesses and farmers who need \nto take out loans. Families who want to buy a home or a car. Parents \nwho need a loan to send their children to college. The economic future \nof all these people may hinge on the decisions of the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n  More importantly, the decision to raise or lower interest rates has a \ndirect effect on anybody who has or wants a job. Interest rates have \ngot to be the single most important factor determining the rate of \nunemployment. They're also tremendously important in determining how \nfast our economy grows. If the Fed slams the brakes on the economy, \nconsumer demand falters, inventories pile up, employers lay workers \noff, and millions of lives are disrupted. The health and vitality of \nevery community in every corner of every state depends to some extent \non monetary policy decisions made by the Federal Reserve Board in \nWashington.\n  The importance of monetary policy has only grown over time. As former \nLabor Secretary Bob Reich likes to point out, we used to have two \naccelerator pedals for the economy. One was cutting interest rates. The \nother was government stimulus. But now that we're locked into running \nsurpluses for as far as the eye can see, fiscal policy is pretty much \ndead. Interest rates are the main policy tool we have left for \ninfluencing the economy. Indeed, interest rates have a greater impact \non most American families than the budgets we pass and most of the \nlegislation we consider.\n  Yet for some reason monetary policy has fallen off the political \nradar screen. At one time, of course, it was a front-burner political \nissue. Certainly in the late 19th century, there were few issues that \ninspired more heated debate among farmers in the Midwest than the gold \nstandard and monetary policy. And for decades after the Great \nDepression, one of our most pressing national political issues was full \nemployment, which was--and is--integrally connected to interest rates.\n  While interest rates and monetary policy have become the most \nimportant instruments of U.S. economic policy, they have also been \nvirtually walled off from democratic decisionmaking and debate. In this \nas in so many other areas, there seems to be an inverse relationship \nbetween an issue's importance to the American people and the amount of \ntime we spend debating it here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I don't think that's the way it ought to be. That's not the way a \ndemocratic government should operate. These are vitally important \nissues, and they deserve a full and open debate involving broad public \nparticipation.\n  We did have something of a debate on monetary policy the last time \nMr. Greenspan was renominated to the Board. Looking back on that \ndiscussion, I'm proud to say it was a substantive one. It focused not \non personal criticisms, but on the important issues of monetary policy \nthat affect all of our constituents.\n  I also think the arguments raised in the 1996 debate can serve as a \nuseful starting point for today's deliberations. We have a record from \nthat debate, and we have four years of economic experience to compare \nit against. And based on that record and that experience, we can draw \ncertain conclusions.\n  The conclusions I draw are as follows. I think monetary policy over \nthe past 4 years has been a pleasant surprise for some of us, in ways \nthat I'll discuss in a moment. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the \npremise of the current movement toward higher interest rates is not \nonly unfounded--but also contradicted by our experience of the last \nfour years. In other words, I'm less troubled by where we've been than \nby where I see us heading in the near future.\n  The past four years have been a tremendously successful experiment in \nmonetary policy. I would hope we could all draw the right lessons from \nthat success. During this entire period, we have had relatively low \nlevels of unemployment and strong economic growth. Yet throughout that \ntime, we have also heard repeated demands from various quarters for the \nFed to raise its rates.\n  We all know what these appeals sound like, but let me just give a \ncouple examples. In January 1997, soon after the conclusion of our last \ndebate, the Bond Buyer quoted an analyst from Merrill Lynch as saying,\n\n       If we see further employment gains that are above the \n     equilibrium level, it looks like wage acceleration will get \n     worse and that will be about as bad a news as we could have \n     for the markets.\n\n  In the January 1997 American Banker, an analyst from Chase Manhattan \nissued a very similar warning:\n\n       The labor market is growing progressively tighter because \n     of job growth, unemployment is near 20-year lows and there is \n     an unambiguous acceleration in wage rates when you get beyond \n     the volatility. At some point the Fed is going to have to \n     raise interest rates.\n\n  Another banker quoted in the January 1997 American Banker said,\n\n       The Fed is going to have to do something to slow the \n     economy down. If you want to have an impact and want to slow \n     the economy down, you hit it with the big stick first.\n\n  And so on and so forth. There is nothing unusual about these appeals \nfrom inflation hawks. We hear them all the time, no matter what \neconomic conditions may be. The Fed hears them all the time from the \nReserve Banks. In fact, Chairman Greenspan makes the same argument \nhimself from time to time. This is more or less the same argument he \nmade last month in his speech before the Economic Club of New York.\n  The difference is that back is 1997 and 1998, Mr. Greenspan and the \nFederal Reserve ignored those repeated and urgent appeals for higher \nrates to put a lid on wage growth. For its wise\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\nand dovish stance on interest rates in 1997 and 1998, I think the Fed \ndeserves a great deal of credit.\n  The important thing for us to realize is that this unexpected \nexperiment in monetary policy worked. The Fed's unusual deviation from \ntight money orthodoxy was clearly successful. Yesterday the President \nwas handling out kudos for the longest economic expansion in our \nhistory. He did praise Chairman Greenspan, but I think we need to be \nmore specific in our praise. The key policy choice we should be \nfocusing on is the Fed's reluctance to raise rates during a critical \nperiod in the mid to late 1990's.\n  The results of that policy choice have been much-discussed elsewhere, \nso I don't need to go into all the details here. But there is one thing \nI want to emphasize: the importance of sustained low unemployment for \npeople on the lower end of the income scale. Finally, in the last \ncouple years we are beginning to see wage gains for lower-income \nworkers--for the first time since the 1970's. Unemployment for workers \nwho haven't completed high school was only 6 percent in December, an \nhistorical low. And low unemployment is especially important for \nminorities, who traditionally experience higher rates of joblessness. \nBlack male joblessness has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years, \nthrough it's still about twice the rate for whites.\n  The benefits of low unemployment and strong economic growth extend \nbeyond the people who found jobs or are starting to see higher wages \nfor the first time in a long time. We all benefit. The principal reason \nwhy the federal budget went into surplus four years ahead of schedule--\nin 1998 rather than 2002--was because of higher-than-expected economic \ngrowth. That wouldn't have been possible had the Fed slammed on the \nbrakes.\n  Higher economic growth also extended the life of the Social Security \nTrust Funds, demonstrating how probably the best thing we can do to \nprotect Social Security is to ensure strong economic growth in the \nfuture. Because of lower unemployment and higher growth, crime rates \ndeclined, as many people who would otherwise have no hope were able to \nobtain stable employment. And finally, it goes without saying that the \nconsequences of welfare reform would have been much more devastating \nhad the Fed followed the advice of those inflation hawks and raised \ninterest rates.\n  There is one other milestone decision by the Fed that deserves to be \nsingled out for praise. In September 1998, I and several other senators \nspoke on the floor about the need for interest rate reductions to \naddress the instability in the global economy in the wake of the Asian \nCrisis and the collapse of the Russian economy. The Fed acted quickly \nand decisively. It not only resisted calls to raise rates in 1998; it \nactually lowered them by \\3/4\\ of a percentage point between September \nand November. I'm convinced that those rate reductions made a decisive \ncontribution towards stabilizing global financial markets.\n  So much for my sweet talk about the Federal Reserve. Today I also \nwant to express my deep concern about where the Fed appears to be \nheaded in the next few months. I'm troubled that the Board may be \nunlearning the lessons of its successful recent experiment in monetary \npolicy and reverting to its old ways. Already in June, August, and \nNovember of last year, the Fed raised rates by \\1/4\\ of a percentage \npoint. These hikes effectively restored rates to where they were before \nthe Russian crisis of 1998.\n  In his speech last month, Chairman Greenspan announced that he is \nonce again worried about wage-induced inflation. Virtually everyone \nunderstood those remarks as another signal that the Fed will raise \nrates soon. The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) has been meeting \nyesterday and today, and today announced another increase of \\1/4\\ \npercent. Some economists believe there could be a total of four rate \nincreases by the end of June.\n\n  To panic over inflation in the present economic circumstances strikes \nme as something close to irrational paranoia. Inflation is the true \n``Phantom Menace.'' First of all, the core inflation rate last year \nfell to 1.9 percent in 1999, the lowest it's been since 1965. Let me \nrepeat that: core inflation is the lowest it's been since 1965. It's \ntrue that consumer prices rose faster than that last year, but this was \ndue to sharply higher energy prices, which should not lead to higher \nrates. Most commodity prices are still at record lows.\n  In his speech last month, Chairman Greenspan spelled out his \nconcerns. He underscored the danger that rising wages could cause \ninflation to spiral out of control. I find this argument very \ntroubling. It seems to disregard our experience since 1996, for which \nthe Fed deserves, as I said, a great deal of credit. Just a moment ago \nI was praising the Federal Reserve for rejecting this very same \nargument in 1997 and 1998.\n  Simply put, I do not believe there is any credible indication that \nlabor costs are about to send inflation spinning out of control. Wage \ngrowth actually slowed in the last year, despite persistently low \nunemployment. In the fourth quarter of 1999, average hourly wages \nincreased at an annual rate of 3.3 percent. That's less than the 4 \npercent they increased from 1997 to mid-1999. Measured a different way, \nwage growth fell from 4.1 percent in 1999 to 3.6 percent in 1998. Wage \ngrowth could not have been slowing down over the past couple years if \nlabor markets were operating as Chairman Greenspan describes.\n  As Chairman Greenspan and the President have both pointed out, a \nremarkable feature of the current recovery is that workers' wage \ndemands have been lower than their historical levels. Yesterday the \nPresident claimed the reason why American workers have not made \n``enormous wage demands'' is that they have become ``very sophisticated \nabout the way the world economy works.'' That's an interesting comment. \nHe seems to be suggesting that the way the world economy works is to \ndepress wages.\n  In his now-famous testimony before the Senate Budget Committee in \nJanuary 1997, Mr. Greenspan had a slightly less upbeat explanation for \nslackening wage demands. He pointed to job insecurity. ``Heightened job \ninsecurity explains a significant part of the restraint on \ncompensation,'' he testified. Of course, Chairman Greenspan raised this \nissue because he was concerned the situation could not continue \nforever: ``At some point in the future,'' he said, ``the trade-off of \nsubdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end.''\n  There are several reasons why workers would be more insecure in \ntoday's economy, but it's hard for me to consider any of them good \nnews. An unprecedented wave of mergers and corporate restructurings has \nled to layoffs for many senior employees. Labor unions have lost a \ngreat deal of its bargaining power, for various reasons. These include \nderegulation, a trade deficit that destroys unionized manufacturing \njobs, and competition from low-wage imports.\n  But even if wage growth really were picking up steam, it would not \nnecessarily lead to inflation. I think pretty much every economist \nwould agree that wages can increase at least as fast as productivity \ngrowth--without causing a rise in prices. That's because when there's \nmore wealth to go around due to greater efficiencies, more of that \nwealth can be shared with workers without asking consumers to pay more.\n\n  And that's exactly what's been happening. Ever since 1996, \nproductivity has been rising at about 1 percent above the expected \ntrend line. For the past couple of years productivity has been rising \nat about 2 percent, though real wages rose only 1.5 percent last year. \nUnit labor costs have fallen since 1996, meaning that wages have not \nbeen keeping up with productivity. Moreover, productivity growth is \nexpected to remain strong in the future. There is plenty of room for \nmore wage growth.\n  One of the lessons of this recovery is that low unemployment can \nactually lead to higher productivity. It makes sense. For one thing, \nwhen labor markets are tight, businesses have to make more efficient \nuse of their workers. That leads to higher efficiency and more wealth \nthat can then be shared with workers. It's a virtuous cycle.\n  In fact, this recovery has taught us several lessons which don't seem \nto be reflected in the Fed's recent shift toward higher rates. First \nand foremost, the theory that there is a natural rate of unemployment--\naround 5.5 or 6 percent--below which inflation will spiral out of \ncontrol appears to be thoroughly discredited.\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\n  In June 1996, when we were debating Mr. Greenspan's previous \nrenomination, I came to the floor to take issue with this theory, which \nis called the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment). \nAt that time, unemployment was 5.6 percent. I was arguing that \nunemployment could go lower without sending wages--and therefore \nprices--into an upward spiral.\n  Let's look at the record since 1996. Unemployment has been below 6 \npercent the entire time, with no inflationary spiral in sight. \nUnemployment has been 4.1 percent for four months now. It's been below \n5 percent for 30 months. It's been below 4.5 percent for 14 months. Not \nonly is inflation not spiraling out of control, it's pretty hard to \ndetect any sign of inflation at all. Core inflation is the lowest it's \nbeen since 1965.\n  In the most recent issue of the American Prospect, the economist \nJames K. Galbraith writes,\n\n       Faced with such embarrassing facts, only a handful of \n     economists continue to defend the natural rate idea. And yet, \n     the natural rate movement still influences policy. Some of \n     its survivors vote on the Federal Reserve's Open Market \n     Committee. They are presently driving interest rates upward \n     on precisely the pretext that low unemployment must otherwise \n     soon bring rising inflation. It is a notion for which no \n     evidence exists. And except for the damage that higher \n     interest rates will do, it would be hard not to laugh.\n\n  The case for raising interest rates is also exceedingly weak. In \nfact, the very arguments made recently by Chairman Greenspan and \nvarious Wall Street analysts should actually persuade us to keep rates \nwhere they are. Yes, sustained low unemployment is having some effect \non wages, especially at the lower end. It's not sending inflation \nspiraling out of control, but it is having an effect. But this is a \npositive phenomenon that we should be attempting to prolong, for all \nthe reasons I listed before in praising the Fed's performance in 1997 \nand 1998. The price of raising rates now is all the benefits we've seen \nflowing from lower unemployment and faster growth.\n\n  After all, many working people are only now beginning to feel the \neffects of this recovery. Only in the last two years have wage \nincreases given workers back some of what they had lost over the past \ntwo decades. During most of the recovery of the 1990s, the median wage \nactually fell. Wages for low and middle-income workers dropped sharply \nin the early 1990's, due in part to an unnecessarily tight monetary \npolicy by the Federal Reserve.\n  This trend didn't start to reverse itself until 1996--thanks to a \nlooser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, as well as an increase \nin the minimum wage. It wasn't until 1999 that median wages regained \ntheir peak level from 1989, before the last recession. That's where \nmost workers are today: about where they were before the last \nrecession. This is no time to actively dampen wage growth--precisely at \nthe moment when workers are starting to benefit from this recovery. The \npolicies that brought about these much-delayed benefits for working \npeople are precisely the ones that the Federal Reserve is now poised to \nreverse.\n  I think we have an obligation to make sure all Americans, not just \ncorporate CEOs and those at the top of the income ladder, can benefit \nfrom this recovery. Just recently, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities and the Economic Policy Institute released a report on \nincome inequality in America. This is what they found. Despite strong \neconomic growth, income disparities were significantly greater in the \nlate 1990's than they were in the 1980's. In two-thirds of all states, \nincome inequality between the top 20 percent and the bottom 20 percent \nincreased. The earnings of the poorest fifth of American families rose \nless than 1 percent between 1988 and 1998, but the earning of the \nrichest fifth jumped 15 percent. The income gap significantly narrowed \nin only three states--Alaska, Louisiana, and Tennessee.\n  Even my friend John McCain has noted the widening gap between the \nhaves and the have-nots in America, and that message seemed to go over \npretty well in New Hampshire.\n  Raising interest rates now could also have an indirect effect on \ninequality--by raising the value of the dollar and therefore \ncontributing to the problems of our trade deficit. In the last 4 years, \nour trade deficit has grown from less than 1.0 percent of GDP to almost \n3.5 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 1999. This is \nunprecedented.\n  The burgeoning trade deficit has contributed to inequality by \nresulting in the loss of manufacturing jobs. We lost 248,000 \nmanufacturing jobs in 1999, and 520,000 since March 1998. Because of \nlow unemployment, those job losses are generally made up by job \ncreation elsewhere. But the new jobs tend to be nonunionized, with \nlower pay and fewer benefits. In the last two years, job growth has \noccurred exclusively in the service industries, where wages and \nbenefits are often much lower.\n  A second problem with the trade deficit is that it casts a pall over \nthis recovery. We are now the world's largest debtor nation. We have \naccumulated over $2 trillion in trade deficits over the last couple \ndecades. Yesterday, even President Clinton said he worried that if \nforeign investors lost confidence in our economy and pulled out their \nmoney, they could do major damage to the economy.\n  We have to consider the danger that unmanageable trade deficits or \nunnecessary monetary tightening could not only erase wage gains for \nlower-income workers, but could actually send the economy into a \ntailspin. This recovery has been kept alive by Americans who have been \nspending more than they earn, partly due to the ``wealth effect'' of \nsoaring stock prices. Lowering growth with higher interest rates could \ncause investors to reassess their rosy assumption about future growth \nand puncture the speculative bubble on Wall Street.\n\n  In fact, in his speech last month in New York, Chairman Greenspan \nalso mentioned the danger of a stock market correction. If the goal is \nto curb ``irrational exuberance'' on Wall Street, there are much better \nways of doing that. In the 1950's and 1960's, Fed Chairman William \nMcChesney Martin, Jr., repeatedly raised margin requirements, but Mr. \nGreenspan has refused to take that step.\n  Given the sizable dangers involved--both in terms of the damage it \nwould do to lower-wage workers and to the overall economy--I think \nraising interest rates at this time would be extremely unwise. If an \ninflationary situation actually materializes and turns out not to be a \nfigment of bankers' collective imaginations, the Fed can always deal \nwith that problem if and when it arises. Recent evidence suggests that \ninterest rate moves no longer operate with a lag due to the increased \nopenness of the Fed.\n  We have made a tremendous advance in the four years since we last \ndebated this issue. We have discovered that the three-decade-old \nmystery over falling wages and rising inequality turns out to be not so \nmysterious after all. The fact is, we know how to raise wages and \nreduce inequality. We do not have to reinvent the wheel. Among other \nthings, we need to maintain low unemployment over a sustained period. \nWe've done this before and we can do it again. It would be a tragedy if \nan unjustified fear of rising wages or an economic downturn kept us \nfrom continuing that progress.\n  I think Chairman Greenspan's performance at the Fed has been very \nhelpful in drawing out these lessons over the past 4 years. It would be \na tragedy--both for our country and especially for workers at the lower \nend of the income scale--if he were to ignore those lessons to once \nagain focus on putting a stop to rising wages.\n  Mr. President, it is kind of ironic that about the only time relevant \nto really discuss monetary policy or have a debate about monetary \npolicy is when Alan Greenspan gets renominated to the Federal Reserve \nBoard. It is a shame because there is probably not an issue that has \ngreater impact on people's lives. People just do not know that much \nabout monetary policy. But the fact is, when you look at the real \ninterest rates, you are talking about a policy that dramatically \naffects small business people, dramatically affects family farmers, \ndramatically affects the industrial base of our country, dramatically \naffects low- and moderate-income people, and it is critically important \nto policy.\n  There was a time in the history of our country, in the late 1800s, \nwhen there was a tremendous emphasis on monetary policy and the need to \nkeep real interest rates down. There was a time post-Depression when \nthere was a\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\nreal focus on employment policy and the need to move toward full \nemployment, and the whole question of what the tradeoff was between \nhaving high interest rates that would choke off economic growth, and \nthen people would not be able to find jobs at decent wages.\n  I think in 1996 we had a very good debate. I don't think the debate \nwas so much about Alan Greenspan--I voted against Alan Greenspan's \nnomination then--but it had more to do with the debate about monetary \npolicy.\n  What was going on during that debate is that many of us were saying \nwe were very concerned about the Federal Reserve policy. We were \nconcerned about the focus on raising interest rates, and what we argued \nwas all this discussion about NAIRU, all this discussion that you could \nnot have low levels of officially defined unemployment without at the \nsame time setting off an inflationary cycle, was simply wrong. What we \nwere saying is it is extremely important to have a public policy which \nputs as our first priority that people should be able to obtain jobs at \ndecent wages and that this was critically important when you looked at \nmonetary policy. That is because when interest rates go up, then in \nfact it is very difficult to sustain this kind of growth.\n  I am pleased to say tonight--I think this is the irony--I was right \nabout the policy and wrong about Alan Greenspan. I think I was right to \nsay that the Fed is not accountable to citizens in this country. There \nis no democratic accountability, with a small ``d.'' These are \ncritically important decisions that are sort of walled off from any \nkind of public accountability. I think that is a profound mistake. This \nis a decisionmaking body with enormous power that crucially defines the \nquality or lack of quality of people's lives. But what we were saying, \nsome of us, was that we took exception to the Fed's policy of always \nseeing inflation right around the corner when it did not exist, a kind \nof phantom inflation, and raising interest rates and having as \nits conscious policy: We are going to raise interest rates because \nunemployment is falling too low and we have to do something because \nsurely there will be inflation.\n\n  Therefore, many people still do not get jobs or the jobs they get are \njobs at fairly low wages. And, when real interest rates go up, it has a \ndraconian effect, again, on small businesspeople, a horrible effect on \nfarmers and producers in my State, and a very harsh effect on low- and \nmoderate-income people, a harsh effect on home buyers, a harsh effect \non people who do not have a lot of money who are trying to buy a car.\n  I give Alan Greenspan credit. What has happened in 1997 and 1998 is \nthat Alan Greenspan did a superb job of being a dove. He was a dove. He \ndid not raise the interest rates. There were many people in the Banking \nCommittee, many people in the financial community, who kept saying he \nneeded to raise those interest rates. He did not do so. I think his \nstewardship has been very important. As a result of that, this is what \nhas happened. As a result of not raising these interest rates up until \nthis past year, as a result of not accepting this orthodoxy, what have \nwe been able to accomplish? Record low levels of unemployment--that is \nvery important to communities of color; very important to people who \nare traditionally the ones who are most affected by high levels of \nunemployment. It is very important to the basic idea of economic \nopportunity in America because the key to economic opportunity is to be \nable to find a job, even more a job at a decent wage, even more a job \nat a decent wage under civilized working conditions.\n  What else has been accomplished? Because we have had low levels of \nunemployment, finally we have seen the lowest wage workers be able to \nbid up their wages because this is a good market for them. We are \nbeginning to see some closing of the gap. It is closing very little, \nbut up until the past couple of years, or this past year, we had not \nseen much improvement at all in terms of real wages. We have seen some \nimprovement.\n  What have we been able to accomplish? Record surpluses. What have we \nbeen able to accomplish? The Social Security trust fund appears much \nstronger than it did because of economic performance. What have we been \nable to accomplish? High levels of productivity. By the way, if your \nproductivity is ahead of your wage increases, I do not believe you are \never going to have to be concerned about an inflationary cycle.\n  So I come to the floor of the Senate to say it was important we had \nthis debate about monetary policy in 1996. I think those of us who took \nexception to the Fed's policy of continuing to raise interest rates \nwere correct. Those of us who did not accept NAIRU and this whole \nargument that below a certain level of unemployment you could not go \nany further, I think we were correct. Those of us who argued it was \nimportant to keep interest rates down for economic growth and economic \nrecovery and jobs at decent wages, that it was important to keep \ninterest rates down for the sake of our producers, for the sake of the \nmanufacturing sector, for the sake of small businesses, for the sake of \nmoderate- and middle-income households were right. I was wrong about \nAlan Greenspan because, as it turns out, under his guidance, the Fed \nhas what I think is a pretty darned good record.\n  Therefore, I now come to part three. I am perplexed that now, again \ntoday, we saw an increase. The Fed is now raising interest rates, this \npast year I think three or four times. Yet inflation is at a record low \nlevel, and the only sector of the economy where we see inflation is \nenergy costs, which has a whole lot to do with the OPEC cartel and does \nnot have anything to do with ordinary families in the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n  So it seems to me, for reasons I cannot explain, Mr. Greenspan and \nthe Fed are ignoring the very success that they have had. I do worry \nbecause I think if we continue to raise the interest rates, not only is \nit going to undercut our economic growth, not only will it have a \ndisproportionate negative effect on those Americans who struggle the \nmost, much less middle-income families, not only is it going to add to \nour already serious trade imbalance which plays havoc--which is both a \nresult of and plays havoc with our industrial sector--but I think if it \nis going to continue to raise these interest rates, it threatens this \nunbelievable economic performance we have seen.\n  One final point I make tonight is that during this period of economic \ngrowth we have not all grown together. To a certain extent we have \ngrown apart. Actually, the gap between the richest 20 percent and \npoorest 20 percent grows wider and wider. Why, given the success of the \nFederal Reserve, why, given the success of this economic performance \nwhile keeping interest rates down, why, given some improvement for the \nlowest wage workers, why, given the surpluses, why, given the Social \nSecurity trust fund looking better because people are working, because \npeople are making better wages, why at this point in time does Mr. \nGreenspan and the Federal Reserve seem to be going down the path of \nraising interest rates in direct contradiction to a policy that has \nbeen successful? That is the question.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to speak because I find it, as a \nteacher, much less a Senator, to be just an interesting and, to a \ncertain extent, perplexing irony. In 1996, we had a debate about \nmonetary policy. It only comes up when the Greenspan nomination comes \nup. I think we should be debating monetary policy more. Once upon a \ntime it was a front burner issue. But then Alan Greenspan has surprised \nme and kept real interest rates down. I want to give him all the credit \nin the world for that, and I think it has been very important and tied \nto our economic performance. It is very important to the people with \nthe least amount of economic clout in our country who do not do as well \nfinancially. But now it looks as if Alan Greenspan and the Federal \nReserve have been going in the exact opposite direction of what has \nbeen a successful economic policy. That I fear, that I worry about, \nthat I dissent from, and that I wanted to speak about as a Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S278-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S278-S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SECURITY CONCERNS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I just finished speaking with our \nSergeant at Arms on the Senate side, Jim Ziglar. He is in full accord \nwith what I am about to say.\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\n  Many of us, perhaps all of us, attended the services for Officer \nChestnut and Agent Gibson. I think one of the things we all agreed on \nis there were many ways we were going to honor these officers. One of \nthem was to make sure we provided the utmost support and security for \nthem, much less security for the Congress and the citizens who visit \nthe House and the Senate.\n  What I have noticed is that we have still been having single posts, \nwhere you have one officer at a very busy post with many people \nstreaming in. I have raised this question for quite a few months now. I \nhave never spoken about it on the floor of the Senate, but I am \nintending to try to put some pressure on as a Senator because we have \nto do something about this.\n  I know the Senate Sergeant at Arms feels strongly about this. I have \ntalked to many police officers whom I think all of us respect, and we \nowe them a real debt of gratitude for their service. Frankly, this is \nno way to say thank you to the Capitol Police--to have one officer at a \nstation where you have all sorts of people coming in, it is an \nimpossible security situation. It is impossible. I have seen this with \nmy own eyes. I have had police officers come up to me and say, ``This \nis just intolerable. We thought there was going to be a change.''\n  I want to say on the floor of the Senate--and I have waited month \nafter month to do this, but again I see it with my own eyes, and police \nofficers come to me about this--I believe there has to be change. I \ndon't think there can be any possible excuse for not living up to our \ncommitment that at least two police officers be at every one of these \nposts.\n  One example: One officer was at a post where during his shift 700 \npeople came in--one officer. This is unacceptable, absolutely \nunacceptable. I think we have to do much better.\n  I am not going to be a know-it-all, I am not going to tell you that I \nknow how much additional money needs to be spent, or whether this is a \nsystems or management issue, or whether there is some slowness on the \nHouse side. I don't know what is going on. I just know there is no \nexcuse for it.\n  We did a supplemental appropriation after these two officers were \nslain, murdered, of a little over a million dollars, about $50 million \neach year. That was for weapons, vests, for security enhancement, and \nfor overtime staffing up in ways that we need to staff up. I don't know \nwhat has happened with this appropriation, whether we need more money, \nmore authorization, or something. The only thing I know is we have a \nsituation right now--after two officers were murdered--where we have at \nsome of these posts just one officer. There should be two officers at \nevery post. I believe that is a commitment we have made. I speak on the \nfloor of the Senate to say that we have to do better for these police \nofficers, and the sooner we do, the better.\n  I say to my colleague from Virginia, I think I will come back every \nday and speak to this situation that exists. I will defer to my \ncolleague from Virginia and I say to the Chair that I hope to come back \nthis evening.\n\n\n       SENATE PASSAGE OF IMPORTANT HISTORIC PRESERVATION MEASURES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, unfortunately this statement was \ninadvertantly left out of the Congressional Record at the end of last \nsession. Therefore, today, I would like to recognize that on November \n19th the United States Senate unanimously passed much needed \nlegislation to protect some of America's most threatened historic \nsites, the Vicksburg Campaign Trail and the Corinth battlefield.\n  S. 710, the Vicksburg Campaign Trail Battlefields Preservation Act of \n1999, is a bipartisan measure that authorizes a feasibility study on \nthe preservation of Civil War battlefields and related sites in the \nfour states along the Vicksburg Campaign Trail.\n  As my colleagues know, Vicksburg served as a gateway to the \nMississippi River during the Civil War. The eighteen month campaign for \nthe ``Gibraltar of the Confederacy'' included over 100,000 soldiers and \ninvolved a number of skirmishes and major battles in Mississippi, \nArkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee.\n  The Mississippi Heritage Trust and the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation named the Vicksburg Campaign Trail as being among the most \nthreatened sites in the state and the nation. S. 710 would begin the \nprocess of preserving the important landmarks in the four state region \nthat warrant further protection. I appreciate the cosponsorship of \nChairman Murkowski, Chairman Thomas, and Senators Landrieu, Breaux, \nCochran, Hutchinson, and Craig on this measure.\n  Mr. President, the Senate also approved S. 1117, the Corinth \nBattlefield Preservation Act of 1999, a measure that establishes the \nCorinth Unit of the Shiloh National Military Park.\n  The battle of Shiloh was actually part of the Union Army's overall \neffort to seize Corinth. This small town was important to both the \nConfederacy and the Union. Corinth's railway was vitally important to \nboth sides as it served as a gateway for moving troops and supplies \nnorth and south, east and west. The overall campaign led to some of the \nbloodiest battles in the Western Theater. In an effort to protect the \ncity, Southern forces built a series of earthworks and fortifications, \nmany of which remain, at least for now, in pristine condition. \nUnfortunately, the National Park Service in its Profiles of America's \nMost Threatened Civil War Battlefields, concluded that many of the \nsites associated with the siege of Corinth are threatened.\n  S. 1117 would give Corinth its proper place in American history by \nformally linking the city's battlefield sites with the Shiloh National \nMilitary Park.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Robb, Cochran, and Jeffords \nfor cosponsoring this measure.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation to Chairman Thomas for \nhis ever vigilant efforts on parks legislation, and in particular, for \nmoving both the Vicksburg Campaign Trail and Corinth battlefield bills \nforward.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize Chairman \nMurkowski for his continued stewardship over the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. President, I also want to recognize Ken P'Pool, Deputy State \nHistoric Preservation Officer for Mississippi; Rosemary Williams, \nChairman of the Siege and Battle of Corinth Commission; John Sullivan, \nPresident of the Friends of the Vicksburg Campaign and Historic Trail; \nand Terry Winschel and Woody Harrell of the United States Park Service \nfor their support and guidance on these important preservation \nmeasures.\n  Lastly, I would like to recognize several staff members including \nRandy Turner, Jim O'Toole, and Andrew Lundquist from the Senate Energy \nCommittee, Darcie Tomasallo from Senate Legislative Counsel, and Stan \nHarris, Angel Campbell, Steven Wall, Jim Sartucci, and Steven Apicella \nfrom my office, for their efforts to preserve Mississippi's and \nAmerica's historic resources.\n  Mr. President, as a result of the Senate's action today, our children \nwill be better able to understand and appreciate the full historic, \nsocial, cultural, and economic impact of the Vicksburg Campaign Trail \nand the Siege and Battle of Corinth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S279-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GREENSPAN CONFIRMATION VOTE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the crisis in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. In that\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\ndevastated country, we see one of the worst international crises of the \nlast decade. It is a bloody and brutal conflict, one that has drawn \ncountry after country into an un-winnable struggle, one that has cost \nthe lives of thousands of civilians and has displaced hundreds of \nthousands more, and one about which this body has been strangely quiet.\n  Congo's conflict is as complex as it is destructive. It is born of \nthe long absence of any semblance of political legitimacy in the \ngovernment of that battered state, it is fed by the horrifying legacy \nof the Rwandan genocide, and it is intensified by the constant struggle \nfor resources and wealth in the region. The litany of the causes of the \nwar in Congo is a catalogue of the problems that plague the heart of \nAfrica. Its outcome will likely determine the course of the region's \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, we need to wake up and realize that the U.S. has a \nstake in that future. Our interests in global peace and stability, the \nrule of law, and respect for basic human rights are bound up in Congo's \nfuture. Africans and their potential American trading partners can have \nno hope of realizing Africa's vast economic potential until the \nregion's cycles of violence come to an end. And America urgently needs \nto stop the spread of infectious disease, to address environmental \ndegradation, and to build a global coalition to fight international \ncrime--but these needs cannot be met without stability in central \nAfrica.\n  And Mr. President, global forces of instability will thrive, and \ntheir insidious influence will grow, when parties to the conflict in \nCongo turn to them, in desperation, for support.\n  Mr. President, central Africa's leaders know that the region cannot \nprosper while the war in the D.R.C. continues. For that reason, last \nsummer the parties to the conflict signed a blueprint for ending the \nconflict--the Lusaka Agreement. That Agreement calls for an end to the \nfighting, for a free political dialogue within Congo, and lays out the \npath to the withdrawal of foreign forces.\n  Mr. President, I traveled to many of the countries involved in the \ncrisis at the end of last year. In Angola, Zimbabwe, and Namibia, in \nUganda and Rwanda, and in the D.R.C. itself, I personally heard heads \nof state acknowledge the importance of making the Lusaka Agreement \nwork. They understand the challenge before them, the precious \nopportunity embodied by Lusaka.\n  Last week the parties to the Congo conflict renewed their commitment \nto the Lusaka Agreement in a series of extraordinary meetings at the \nUnited Nations in New York. They have all agreed to a facilitator, \nformer President Masire of Botswana, to move the inter-Congolese \ndialogue forward. And all parties have called for a strengthening of \nthe Joint Military Commission that is at the heart of the framework for \npeace.\n  Mr. President, just as the U.S. has a stake in the outcome, the \nUnited States also has a role to play in supporting these efforts. The \nU.N. has already deployed a small team of liaison officers to the \nscene. Now, the United Nations Secretary General has issued a report \nlaying out the next phase of U.N. involvement. It calls for the \ndeployment of 500 monitors, with a 5,000-strong force providing \nsecurity and logistical support to their mission. They will have a \nrobust mandate that ensures their ability to protect themselves.\n  Mr. President, none of the troops would be American, and that is as \nit should be. In fact, in my meetings with heads of state in the \nregion, I explicitly asked about their expectations with regard to \nAmerican troops, and I can report that no one has visions of a large \nAmerican presence on the ground in Congo. But by creating the breathing \nroom necessary to allow the belligerents to move toward peace, these \ntroops will serve American interests.\n  The U.N. Secretary-General has endorsed a good plan. Its value comes, \nin part, from what it does not do. The U.N. does not plan to send tens \nof thousands of troops into Congo to impose peace on hostile parties. \nNor does the U.N. intend to stand by while the most brutal elements in \nCongo seize power through violence and impose their will on civilians.\n  Instead, the plan that has emerged in New York harnesses \ninternational support to the commitment of the parties to the conflict. \nIt recognizes that the only viable peace to be found in Congo is a \npeace created by the belligerent parties themselves. It acknowledges \nAfrican responsibility for this African war, and strengthens the Joint \nMilitary Commission created by combatants when they signed the Lusaka \naccords. At the same time, this plan ensures that the international \ncommunity does not turn its back on Africa.\n\n  There can be no double-standard, whereby African conflicts are \nmeasured by a different scale than that used for conflicts in Europe or \nAsia. The plan for the deployment of the monitors and their supporting \nteam has been vetted as thoroughly as any U.N. project. The stakes--in \nterms of human life and regional stability--are unquestionably high \nenough to meet the threshold for international action. Now, the U.N. \nhas an opportunity to get it right in Congo.\n  Supporting this U.N. mission is the least we should do to secure our \ninterests and fulfill our responsibilities as responsible members of \nthe international community. Should we fail to support it, should we \nignore this terrible conflict any longer, we will weaken the \ninternational community's mechanisms for burden-sharing at the dawn of \nthis new century. And we will lose an opportunity to reinforce a model \nfor ending conflict and embracing a better future.\n  I want to say, because obviously this has to be true and I am \nconcerned about it, that the plan is not guaranteed to succeed.\n  Little worth attempting ever is. Zambian President Frederick Chiluba \nwas right when he said, last week, that no peacekeeping operation \nanywhere in the world is risk-free. But Mr. President, this is the best \nchance for shoring up the Lusaka Agreement and helping African states \nto end the conflict that we are likely to see.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to look at this program that is being \nsuggested and to give it their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S280-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to provide for the development of remedies to resolve \nunmet community land grant claims in New Mexico; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               new mexico community land grant review act\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, \nalong with Senator Domenici, which will move us toward resolving a long \nstanding issue of great controversy in my State of New Mexico.\n\n  Today marks the anniversary of one of the most significant dates in \nthe creation of modern America. On this date one hundred and fifty-two \nyears ago, our government and the government of Mexico entered into an \nagreement which ended a bloody war, and which brought a huge swath of \nterritory into the United States.\n  The addition of this new territory, which became the American \nSouthwest, forever changed the makeup of our nation, its place on the \nworld stage, and its culture. The infusion of a large Hispanic \npopulation and a myriad of Native American communities into fabric of \nAmerican society enriched the diversity of country and strengthened the \ndynamism of our culture.\n  It is day which should be one for celebration. A day in which New \nMexicans should reflect on the confluence of cultures which make up our \nstate. It is a day to remember the sweat and grit of the people who \ntraveled north up El Camino Real (the Royal Road) passing through one \narea that was so arduous that it was known as La Jornada del Muerte \n(the Journey of Death), and those who came west over the Santa Fe trail \nto reach New Mexico and who, together with the Pueblo, Apache, and \nNavajo peoples who had already carved a life out of this arid land, \nbuilt our modern culture.\n  It is a day for celebration, but unfortunately it is also a day which \nrecalls great pain for many. For that agreement between nations which \nestablished the American Southwest, the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, \nalso carried with it a promise to the new citizens of America. That \npromise was that their ownership of lands established under Spanish and \nMexican law would be respected and validated by their new government. \nMany who would be celebrating today do not believe that that promise \nwas kept. The serious questions that have been raised concerning the \nvalidation of Spanish and Mexican community land grant claims in New \nMexico cast a cloud over this day, and a cloud over our national honor.\n  Given the long history of dispute over community land grant claims in \nNew Mexico, and the large amount of disputed land, a credible neutral \nanalysis of the United States' implementation of the Treaty has been \nneeded. To that end, Senator Domenici and I have requested that the \nGeneral Accounting Office review the United States' legal obligations \nunder the Treaty and whether the Federal government met those \nobligations with regard to community land grant claims.\n  This will be the first national study of the issue, and it is \noverdue. Given how long it has taken for the heirs of these land grants \nto get a credible review of their claims, it is that important that \nthis study not end up gathering dust on some shelf. If the GAO finds \nthat the United States denied\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\nthese communities their rights under the treaty, then it is imperative \nthat the Federal government develop a remedy to resolve this issue.\n  Therefore I, along with Senator Domenici, am introducing a bill today \nwhich will move us in that direction. This bill would require that, \nshould the GAO find that the United States has failed to meet its \nTreaty obligations, the Justice Department prepare for the President a \nlist of methods to remedy the problem, and that the President must \npropose to Congress his preferred remedy.\n  Unlike the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, which was an agreement \nbetween nations, this bill represents a promise directly to land grant \nheirs that their claim will be fully considered by the United States \nGovernment. I hope we can pass this measure, and make that promise to \nthem.\n  Mr. President I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 2022\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``New Mexico Community Land \n     Grant Reivew Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE, DEFINITIONS, AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \n     development of potential remedies to resolve unmet \n     obligations by the United States with regard to community \n     land grant claims in New Mexico under the Treaty of \n     Guadalupe-Hidalgo.\n       (b) Definitions.--As used in this Act:\n       (1) Treaty of guadalupe--hidalgo.--The term ``Treaty of \n     Guadalupe-Hidalgo'' means the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, \n     Limits, and Settlement (Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo), between \n     the United States and the Republic of Mexico, signed February \n     2, 1848, with the amending Protocol of Queretaro signed May \n     26, 1848; entered into force on May 30, 1948 (TS 207; 9 \n     Bevans 791).\n       (2) Community land grant.--The term ``community land \n     grant'' means a village, town, settlement, or pueblo \n     consisting of land held in common (accompanied by lesser \n     private allotments) by three or more families under a grant \n     from the King of Spain (or his representative) before the \n     effective date of the Treaty of Cordova, August 24, 1821, or \n     from the authorities of the Republic of Mexico before May 30, \n     1848, in what became the State of New Mexico, regardless of \n     the original character of the grant.\n       (3) Land grant claim.--The term ``land grant claim'' means \n     a claim to land owned by a community land grant.\n       (4) GAO.--The term ``GAO'' means the United States General \n     Accounting Office.\n       (c) Findings.--The Congress finds:\n       (1) New Mexico has a unique and complex history regarding \n     land ownership due to the substantial number of land grants \n     awarded by the King of Spain and the Republic of Mexico as an \n     integral part of the colonization of New Mexico prior to \n     the takeover of the area by the United States under the \n     Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.\n       (2) Under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the United \n     States agreed to respect valid land grants claims.\n       (3) Several studies, including the New Mexico Land Grant \n     Series published by the University of New Mexico, have called \n     into question whether the United States has fulfilled its \n     obligations under the Treaty. There continue to be claims \n     that citizens of the United States were illegally deprived of \n     the property rights protected by the Treaty of Guadalupe-\n     Hidalgo through the actions of the Office of the Surveyor \n     General established in 1854, the Court of Private Land Claims \n     established in 1891, and the Territory of New Mexico.\n       (4) There was a remarkable difference in outcomes between \n     the land claims adjudications in the State of California, \n     where approximately 73 percent of the claimed acreage was \n     confirmed, and the former Territory of New Mexico, where only \n     24 percent of the claimed acreage was confirmed. This \n     difference in outcomes raises serious questions as to whether \n     adjudications in New Mexico were equitably and fairly \n     administered.\n       (5) Following the United States' war with Mexico and for \n     much of this century, the economy of New Mexico was dependent \n     on land resources. When the land grant claimants lost title \n     to their land, the predominantly Hispanic communities in New \n     Mexico lost a keystone to their economy, and the effects of \n     this loss had long lasting economic consequences for these \n     communities.\n       (6) Whether the United States failed to meet its \n     obligations under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo has been a \n     source of continuing controversy and has left a lingering \n     sense of injustice in some communities in New Mexico over the \n     last one-hundred and fifty years.\n       (7) This issue, which regards the integrity of the United \n     States with regards to its international commitments and its \n     commitments to its citizenry, must be resolved.\n       (8) The GAO has been requested to review how the United \n     States implemented the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe-\n     Hidalgo which pertain to the protection of community land \n     grant claims New Mexico, and to provide a report to the \n     Congress and the President by December 31, 2002, which \n     includes an assessment of whether the procedures established \n     by the United States to implement the treaty appear to have \n     been adequate, and whether the community land grants claims \n     appear to have been equitably adjudicated.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEVELOPMENT OF REMEDY RECOMMENDATIONS AND \n                   PRESIDENTIAL PROPOSAL.\n\n       If the GAO concludes, in the report to Congress and the \n     President described in Section (2)(c)(8) of this Act, that \n     the obligations of the United States under the Treaty of \n     Guadalupe-Hidalgo regarding the protection of the community \n     land grant rights do not appear to have been met, the \n     Department of Justice shall prepare for the President a list \n     of alternative methods to remedy the problem. The President \n     shall then submit to Congress recommendations to resolve \n     these claims within six months of the submission of the GAO \n     report. In no event shall these recommendations include the \n     divestiture of private property rights.\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining \nSenator Bingaman in introducing legislation to help resolve whether the \nfederal government inadequately implemented the Treaty of Guadalupe-\nHildalgo in New Mexico. Today is the 152d anniversary of the signing by \nthe United States of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo with Mexico. Under \nthis 1848 treaty, the United States acquired the territory that is now \nCalifornia, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. \nUnfortunately, the potential failure of this country to meet its \nobligations under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hildalgo has been a source of \ncontinuing controversy, and many New Mexicans claim they were illegally \ndeprived of property rights by the federal government. For example, in \nCalifornia, about seventy-three percent of land grant claims have been \nconfirmed compared to only twenty-four percent in New Mexico, which \nraises questions as to whether adjudications in New Mexico were \nequitably and fairly administered.\n  We must take the opportunity to reverse the heritage of ill-will \nbetween the Hispanic people of New Mexico and the Federal government. \nHispanic descendants in our state have been waiting over 150 years to \nget the federal government to fairly look into the community land \ngrants issue. In 1848, land grant claimants were led to believe that \ntheir property rights would be honored and protected, but they have \nrepeatedly been frustrated by government officials. One Surveyor \nGeneral for New Mexico has been described by historians as ``steeped in \nprejudice against New Mexico, its people and their property rights.'' \nOther opportunists used long legal battles to acquire empires that \nextended over millions of acres--all at the expense of local Hispanics.\n  In 1891, the Surveyor General was replaced by the Court of Private \nLand Claims, but the court's procedures heavily favored the government. \nThe Court of Claims required that claimants prove that the Spanish or \nMexican granting official had the legal authority to issue the land \ngrant. The claimants did not have access to necessary documentation, \nand often did not speak English. Consequently, the court rejected two-\nthirds of the New Mexico claims presented before it. Ultimately, by one \naccount written by Richard Griswold del Castillo, only eighty-two \ngrants received Congressional confirmation. This represented only six \npercent of the total area sought by land claimants, leaving a bitter \nlegacy.\n  In the 105th Congress, Congressman Redmond was able to pass a bill \nout of the House of Representatives creating a Presidential Commission \nto evaluate the community land grants located in New Mexico. I was \nproud to introduce a companion bill, including a few changes based on \nthe lessons I learned from talking to the heirs of some of the land \ngrants; from reviewing the history; and from talking to scholars, \nhistorians and land grant lawyers.\n  After hearings and continuing dialog with land grant heirs, we \nrealized that the natural first step in the process was determining \nwhether the grantees' rights had been violated under the Treaty. It \nbecame clear that adequate time for a thorough study of the issue was \nneeded. Documents had to be gathered. Resolution of the dispute must \ntake into account intervening legal rights.\n  Last year, Senator Bingaman and I originally proposed that the \nAttorney General, acting through the Assistant\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\nAttorney General for Civil Rights, should investigate whether the \nUnited States properly implemented the provisions of the Treaty of \nGuadalupe-Hidalgo which pertain to the protection of valid land grant \nclaims in New Mexico. If that investigation found that the federal \ngovernment needed to rectify past abuses, the President would submit a \nproposal to Congress to resolve those claims. The Senate supported our \ndesire last fall to include in the Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations bill the requirement that the Justice Department conduct \nsuch a study. However, the Justice Department objected on the grounds \nthat it could not be a neutral examiner of the legal obligations of the \nUnited States in this situation.\n\n  The General Accounting Office (GAO) was recommended by House \nappropriators as an alternative, and language directing GAO conduct a \nstudy was included in the original conference report for Department of \nJustice appropriations. However, that provision was written in the \nwaning hours of the conference, without time for consultation with the \nGAO, and while the focus of the conference was turned to other matters. \nConsequently, we believed that language was inadequate to serve New \nMexico's needs. At our request, the appropriations conferees removed \nthe inadequate study language from the final version of the CJS \nconference report.\n  I must say that I respectfully disagree with the Justice Department's \ncontention that they could not properly conduct such a study. What \nbetter arm of the government should investigate whether the United \nStates properly implemented the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe-\nHidalgo which pertain to the protection of valid land grant claims in \nNew Mexico?\n  Nonetheless, after meeting with top-level representatives at the \nDepartment of Justice, Senator Bingaman and I met with GAO's General \nCounsel Robert Murphy and Principal Assistant Comptroller General Gene \nDodaro to craft language that more closely reflected the needs of New \nMexico, and the capabilities of the GAO. We have formally asked GAO to \nreview how the United States implemented the provisions of the Treaty \nof Guadalupe-Hidalgo which pertain to the protection of community land \ngrant claims in New Mexico.\n  The GAO will submit an interim report to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources and the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate, \nand to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and \nto the President of the United States, by the end of this year. A final \nreport will be submitted by the end of 2002. This will allow the GAO \nadequate time to investigate this complicated issue.\n  The report will include a description of the legal obligations of the \nUnited States to protect the rights of community land grants and its \nactions in carrying out the provisions of the treaty, an assessment of \nthe issues raised concerning the implementation of the treaty \nprovisions, and identification of potential methods of resolving any \nfailure by the United States with regard to community land grant \nclaims. The GAO shall also discuss the potential effects of resolution \noptions on intervening legal rights and on Tribal land claims. In no \nevent should any identification of remedies include divestiture of \nprivate property rights.\n  The bill we introduce today directs that if the GAO concludes that \nthe obligations of the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe-\nHidalgo regarding the protection of the community land grant rights do \nnot appear to have been met, the Department of Justice shall prepare \nfor the President a list of alternative methods to remedy the problem. \nThe President will then submit to Congress recommendations to resolve \nthese claims within six months of the submission of the GAO report. \nAgain, we also wish to ensure that no recommendations include the \npotential divestiture of private property rights. We do not wish to \ntransplant one potential injustice with another.\n  Trying to do justice 150 years after the fact is complicated. I am \nhopeful that this bill can address what has been, for too long, a tale \nof land loss and bitterness between the United States and some of its \nNew Mexico citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Abraham, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 2023. A bill to provide for the establishment of Individual \nDevelopment Accounts (IDAs) that will allow individuals and families \nwith limited means an opportunity to accumulate assets, to access \neducation, to own their own homes and businesses, and ultimately to \nachieve economic self-sufficiency, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                SAVINGS FOR WORKING FAMILIES ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to proudly \nintroduce with my esteemed colleagues, Senators Santorum, Abraham, \nFeinstein, Landrieu, Bayh, and Robb, the Savings for Working Families \nAct of 2000. This legislation directly addresses a problem that is now \nstarting to receive the attention that it deserves: the growing wealth \ngap in our country. This legislation builds on a bipartisan effort \nbegun last session to help more low-income working families join our \ncountry's economic mainstream by addressing that wealth gap. Passing \nthis legislation will help expand our economic winner's circle to \ninclude more working families. Because what goes up for the richest \nfamilies, particularly in these boom times, need not come down for \nother families.\n\n  Today with my colleagues, I put forward a modest yet promising \nproposal that we believe will help more low income families share in \nour country's economic prosperity. Today we will introduce new \nlegislation to support the expansion of Individual Development \nAccounts, or IDAs, an innovative and powerful tool to help the working \npoor save and develop the assets they need to get ahead and thrive in \nthe new economy--to enter the winner's circle.\n  The Savings for Working Families Act of 2000 will benefit working, \nlow-income families across this country to share in the unprecedented \nprosperity of our booming economy. Our bill brings together Republicans \nand Democrats, policy wonks and working mothers, and even financial \ninstitutions and consumers, all in support of a new approach to \nsustaining some American ideals--hard work, thrift, individual \nresponsibility, and entrepreneurship. The Savings for Working Families \nAct of 2000 provides the real incentives and real opportunities for the \nworking poor to build assets, both human and financial capital, which \nthey in turn will be able to invest in our national economy.\n  Today's economy is defying gravity. The stock market is jumping to \nrecord highs while inflation and unemployment are hovering at record \nlows. Millions of Americans are reaping the benefits of the longest \neconomic expansion in our history, including millions of working middle \nclass families. Unfortunately, millions more are not.\n  Several recent studies have documented a growing income gap in the \nU.S.--an increasing income disparity between the rich and poor with \ndeclining incomes for both poor and low-income families. In addition to \nthat income gap, a report released recently by the Federal Reserve \nBank, has identified a significant asset gap in this country. A gap \nwhere the net worth--or assets--of the typical American family has \nrisen substantially since 1989, while the net worth--or assets--of \nlower income families has actually declined during the economic boom of \nrecent years.\n  According to the Fed report, families earning under $10,000 a year \nhad a median net worth of $1,900 in 1989. That climbed to $4,800 in \n1995, but had slipped back to $3,600 by 1998. Those families earning \n$10,000 to $25,000 saw their net worth drop from $31,000 in 1995 to \n$24,800 in 1998. More specifically, while the percent of all U.S. \nfamilies that own a home or business has risen during the boom years of \n1995-98, the percent among lower income families has decreased. For \nexample, in 1995, 36.1% of families earning under $10,000 annually \nowned their home. By 1998 the rate had dropped to 34.5%. The drop for \nfamilies earning $10,000 to $25,000 was from 54.9% to 51.7%. The same \nstory is true for the percent of lower income families owning a \nbusiness.\n  The Savings for Working Families Act of 2000 will directly address \nexactly this asset gap. Our bill seeks to address this imbalance by \ndramatically expanding the use of IDAs. IDA programs\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\ndo work and are reporting real success in spurring savings and asset \nbuilding on a small scale in hundreds of communities across the \ncountry. Already 27 states have passed some form of IDA program \nlegislation.\n  In my home state of Connecticut, there is today only one pilot IDA \nprogram in existence. A handful of low income individuals are now \nstarting to take part in a strong IDA program run by the Committee for \nTraining and Employment, or CTE, a cutting edge community-based \norganization providing a range of services and activities to address \npoverty issues in the greater Stamford area. In Connecticut we are \nhopeful that we will soon be seeing an expansion of IDA accounts and \nprograms. A statewide IDA Task force, convened by Connecticut State \nTreasurer, Denise L. Nappier, recently released a report to jump-start \nmore IDA activity in the state. Its thoughtful analysis and \nauthoritative recommendations will certainly help to increase IDAs in \nour state. The Savings for Working Families Act of 2000 was drafted in \nconsideration of the excellent IDA work under way in states and \ncommunities all across the country.\n  The idea is simple, but powerful. Low income workers who put their \nhard earned dollars into IDAs would get matching funds from financial \nand other private entities. A federal tax credit will provide the \nincentives for those private sector investments in IDAs. The IDA \nsavings could then be used by low income working families to develop \nassets, specifically for the purchase of a home, the pursuit of a \npostsecondary education, or to start a business. In essence, this \nlegislation extends to lower income working families the type of \nincentives for building assets, such as the home mortgage interest \ndeduction, preferential capital gains rates and pension funds \nexclusions and incentives, that are now available on a large scale to \nthe non-poor and wealthy.\n  Just last week, President Clinton underscored the promise of this \napproach in his State of the Union Address, when he put forward his \nRetirement Savings Account (RSA) proposal. Those RSAs are similar to \nthe IDAs in this bill. In his proposal, the President rightly \nidentified the potential of the private sector in strengthening the \neconomic security of many of our most vulnerable citizens. Just as \nimportant, he made clear, as we do in the Savings for Working Families \nAct, that these IDA accounts are not simply an empty promise for a \nhandout. They are a means to integrate more Americans into the broader \neconomic mainstream.\n  In drafting this new IDA legislation, our objective was to keep it \nsimple and based closely on S. 895, a bill that Senator Santorum and I \nintroduced last year and that enjoyed strong bipartisan support. \nModifications in the Savings for Working Families Act of 2000 are \nprimarily technical in nature, recognizing that the IDA field has grown \nand evolved in the last year. We have also made a concerted effort in \nthe new bill to realize the potential of critical private sector and \nnonprofit organizations to be effective IDA providers, including credit \nunions and community service organizations.\n  Moving forward, we are confident that we can get this bill passed \nbecause it addresses a threat to our fundamental faith in the American \ndream and to the vitality and long-term stability of our national \neconomy. Our bill cannot singlehandedly eliminate the wealth gap, but \nwe are confident that it will help carve out a little more space in \nthat winner's circle and move us a step closer to making the American \ndream real for more working families.\n  Finally, I would like to thank each of the cosponsors of this bill, \nespecially Senators Santorum and Abraham. Through their hard work, and \nin conjunction with the financial services industry and the IDA field, \nwe have legislation that achieves a very public interest. In \nparticular, I would like to note the leadership of the Corporation for \nEnterprise Development (CFED) for helping to bring the voice of the IDA \ncommunity to this creation of this bill. With the Savings for Working \nFamilies Act of 2000, we are able to harness the creative forces of the \nmarketplace to help secure our core democratic values, holding out the \nhope of free enterprise without the false promise of a free lunch, and \ngiving some tangible meaning to those core values of community, \nopportunity and responsibility. In expanding the use of IDAs across the \ncountry as an empowerment tool for working families, this legislation \nspeaks to our shared aspirations as Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2026. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nauthorize appropriations for HIV/AIDS efforts; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n              THE GLOBAL AIDS PREVENTION (GAP) ACT OF 2000\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last month, the United States held \nthe rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council. And something \nhistoric happened. Under the leadership of Ambassador Holbrooke and \nVice President Gore, the Security Council for the first time ever \ndiscussed an international health issue.\n  The issue was the spread of AIDS, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. \nIn raising the profile of this issue--in putting it before the U.N. \nSecurity Council--there was a recognition that the AIDS crisis is a \nsecurity threat--a threat to the peace, stability, and prosperity of \nnations around the world.\n  Nowhere is that more true than in sub-Saharan Africa, where the \nUnited Nations has said that AIDS is ``the worst infectious disease \ncatastrophe since the bubonic plague.''\n  Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, 13.7 million people in \nsub-Saharan Africa have died of AIDS. That is 84 percent of all the \npeople in the world who have died of AIDS since the beginning of the \nepidemic. Last year, two-thirds of all new cases of HIV/AIDS were in \nsub-Saharan Africa. And of all the people in the world living with HIV/\nAIDS, 69 percent of them live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  Mr. President, this is not just a matter of more deaths and more \ncases because there are more people. Of adults in sub-Saharan Africa \nwho are aged 15-49, eight percent of them have HIV/AIDS. Percentages \nfrom specific countries are even more dramatic. In Zimbabwe, it is \nestimated that 26 percent of all adults aged 15-49 are living with the \ndisease. In Botswana, it is 25 percent, and in Namibia, it is 20 \npercent.\n  Unlike any other area of the world, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-\nSaharan Africa is predominately a woman's disease. A majority of \ninfected adults--55 percent to be exact--are women.\n  This creates ripple effects. When women get the disease, they often \npass it along to their unborn babies. As a result, about 10 percent of \nthe HIV/AIDS cases in sub-Saharan Africa are children. More \ndramatically, when women die, their children often become orphans. By \nthe end of this year, the HIV/AIDS epidemic will be the reason that \nover 10 million children in sub-Saharan Africa are orphans.\n  How many children is that? There are about 10 million people 18 years \nold and younger in California. Imagine if every single one of them was \nan orphan. That is what we are talking about in sub-Saharan Africa. Ten \nmillion children. Even worse, according to those who are working on \nthis issue in Africa, the number of children orphaned there because of \nHIV/AIDS could double, triple, or even quadruple in the next decade.\n  I have mentioned, Mr. President, a lot of statistics, a lot of \nnumbers. but behind each number there is a face. A face of a man living \nwith HIV; a face of a woman dying of AIDS; a face of an orphan with no \nfamily and no place to go. In Sub-Saharan Africa, there are faces upon \nfaces upon faces.\n\n  This is a global tragedy, a global catastrophe, a global emergency. \nIt requires a global response. And the United States must lead the way.\n  So today, I am introducing, along with my colleague on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Gordon Smith, the Global AIDS Prevention \nAct--the GAP Act. It calls on the United States Agency for \nInternational Development--USAID--to make HIV/AIDS a priority in the \nforeign assistance program and to undertake a comprehensive, \ncoordinated effort to combat HIV/AIDS. That effort must include primary \nprevention and education; voluntary testing and counseling; providing \nmedications to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS from mother to \nchild; and care for those living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\n  To accomplish this, the GAP Act would increase funding for USAID's \ninternational HIV/AIDS effort. Over five years, the bill would \nauthorize $2 billion for the fight against AIDS, and at least $1 \nbillion of that is dedicated to the problem in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  I want to commend the work done so far by USAID. This year, the \nAgency will spend $200 million to fight HIV/AIDS abroad. Unfortunately, \nthis is the first time in six years that there has been an increase in \nthe funding for this important effort. And it is still far short of \nwhat is needed. It is time to close the gap. Passing the GAP Act would \nbe a great step forward.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have talked about the problem in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. That is where the problem is the worst and where the need is \nmost urgent. It has also been the focus of most of the public attention \nin the last few months.\n  But, be warned. We must not fool ourselves into thinking that sub-\nSaharan Africa is the only place with a problem. In terms of raw \nnumbers, India has more people living with HIV/AIDS than any other \nnation in the world. And experts tell us that in the near future, the \nproblem may actually grow faster in Southeast Asia than in Africa.\n  The GAP Act recognizes the need to be flexible. As I mentioned, it \ndedicates at least 50 percent of the funding to sub-Saharan Africa. \nUSAID is actually spending about 65 percent of its AIDS dollars in that \nregion now. This bill will continue to allow USAID to spend that higher \npercentage, but it will also provide the Agency with the flexibility to \naddress the problem elsewhere in the world.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, I am joined in this effort by Senator \nGordon Smith. He and I worked together last summer in introducing a \nbill to fight the international tuberculosis problem. I am pleased and \nhonored to join with him again in introducing bipartisan legislation to \naddress an urgent international health problem.\n  Mr. President, in the United States, When the epidemic first hit two \ndecides ago, too many people in positions to make a difference ran \ninside, locked the doors, closed the curtains, and just hoped it would \ngo away. The victims were blamed instead of helped. Those at risk were \nridiculed instead of educated. Those who were dying were shunned \ninstead of cared for.\n  We did not begin to make progress against HIV/AIDS in this country \nuntil we discussed the problem in the light of day and until we made a \nserious investment in education, prevention, treatment, care, and \nresearch. Progress will not be made in Africa or anywhere else in the \nworld unless we do the same. Now is not the time to pretend the problem \ndoes not exist or that it does not matter to us. Now is the time to \nact.\n  The GAP Act would help to close the gap between what we need to fight \nthis disease and what we are now spending. The GAP Act would help to \nclose the GAP between the developed and the developing world in dealing \nwith this epidemic. The GAP Act would help to close the gap between our \nwords and our actions. I ask my colleagues to close these gaps by \ncosponsoring the GAP Act.\n  Finally, I ask that a copy of the bill and a letter of endorsement \nfrom Family Health International be inserted in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                S. 2026\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global AIDS Prevention Act \n     of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic 2 decades \n     ago, more than 16,300,000 people worldwide have died of the \n     disease.\n       (2) More than 33,600,000 people in the world are living \n     with HIV/AIDS; more than 3,000,000 of them are children.\n       (3) Sub-Saharan Africa has been particularly hard hit by \n     the disease, as the region has accounted for--\n       (A) 84 percent of the worldwide deaths from HIV/AIDS;\n       (B) two-thirds of the new infections in 1999; and\n       (C) 69 percent of those living with the disease.\n       (4) In sub-Saharan Africa, 55 percent of the infected \n     adults are women and, as a result, more than 10,000,000 \n     children have been orphaned in sub-Saharan Africa because of \n     HIV/AIDS--a figure that could double or triple in the next \n     decade.\n       (5) According to the United Nations, HIV/AIDS in sub-\n     Saharan Africa is the ``worst infectious disease catastrophe \n     since the bubonic plague''.\n       (6) The HIV/AIDS problem in Southeast Asia is growing \n     dramatically. In 1999, 20 percent of the new infections in \n     the world were in Southeast Asia.\n       (7) New investments and treatments hold out promise of \n     making progress against the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senator Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Based on Family Health International's \n     14 years of experience managing more than 1,200 HIV/AIDS \n     prevention and care projects in 60 countries--the majority in \n     sub-Saharan Africa--we strongly support The Global AIDS \n     Prevention Act of 2000.\n       The need for scaling up HIV/AIDS prevention and care \n     programs in Africa is urgent. We know firsthand that the \n     United States needs to provide more assistance than it has in \n     the past to save more lives, bolster regional security and \n     protect the interests of the United States not only in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, but around the world.\n       We are pleased that you and members of the U.S. Senate and \n     Congress recognize the urgency of this need and the crucial \n     role the United States plays in international HIV/AIDS \n     prevention and care programming. We have the tools and \n     expertise needed to make a dramatic difference in preventing \n     more people from being infected with HIV and caring for \n     people living with HIV/AIDS. But, this difference can only be \n     made by providing the level of resources it will take to \n     greatly expand the initiatives the United States already has \n     underway with our hundreds of local partners overseas.\n       We appreciate your recognition and support for the \n     critically important work being done by nongovernmental \n     organizations, including Family Health International, and the \n     United States Agency for International Development. \n     Continuing leadership by the United States on HIV/AIDSs \n     initiatives is needed more urgently now than ever before: by \n     the end of this year, some 60 million people, including over \n     a million Americans, will have been infected with HIV since \n     this global pandemic began.\n       Your support and that of the U.S. Senate is needed now more \n     than ever, Senator Boxer. We need much more support to save \n     more lives, increase the basic health, well-being and \n     productivity of millions threatened by, infected with or \n     affected by HIV/AIDS, including millions of children, \n     worldwide.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                              Peter R. Lamptey, M.D. Dr. P.H.,\n\n                                         Director, IMPACT Project,\n                             Senior Vice President, AIDS Programs.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator \nBoxer in introducing the Global AIDS Prevention Act. This legislation \nauthorizes $2 billion over the next five years to support the Agency \nfor International Development's [AID] efforts to prevent and treat HIV/\nAIDS abroad. Fully half of the funds authorized would go to fight AIDS \nin sub-Saharan Africa. The remainder will go to other areas, including \nsome countries of Southeast Asia where infection rates are growing at \nalarming rates.\n  While the nations of sub-Saharan Africa have faced a myriad of \ndisasters in\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\nthe last decades of the 20th century, few reach the cataclysmic \nproportions that the spread of AIDS has wrought on every level of life \nin that area. The statistics are mind-numbing--in some countries, one \nof four adults are living with HIV/AIDS. Life expectancies in those \ncountries over the next 5 years have been slashed from the mid-60s to \nthe early forties. Cumulative deaths attributable to AIDS numbered over \n13 million by 1999 and the number of children orphaned by AIDS is \nestimated between 7 and 10 million. An estimated 1 million children in \nAfrica are HIV positive.\n  These numbers impact every facet of life in this region of Africa. \nWhere populations of adults aren't likely to enter the workforce or \ncare for their children, an economy cannot prosper and grow. Where \nmillions are orphaned, many times watching their parents die, a future \nthat includes any basic education is likely not to happen. Where \ngovernments struggle with civil strife, the basic medical needs of its \npopulations go unmet. I am proud of the private and religious \norganizations that have heroically struggled to fight the impact on \nfamilies, however it is clear that the scope of the AIDS crisis \nrequires additional support.\n  In an area where some country infection rate reaches one out of four \nof the adult population, our diplomatic efforts must first and foremost \ninclude a means to stop this epidemic. While the internal political \nstrife in some of these countries can be equally heartbreaking in \noutcome, the ongoing devastation spread by AIDS in some of these \ncountries needs to be addressed in a broad and immediate way.\n  I would like to commend my colleagues from California for her strong \nleadership in this area and I call on my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support this legislation and meet this devastating \nepidemic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. Gramm):\n  S.J. Res. 38. A joint resolution to provide for a Balanced Budget \nConstitutional Amendment that prohibits the use of Social Security \nsurpluses to achieve compliance; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                balanced budget constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \nreleased figures last week showing that the United States is on track \nto achieve a $23 billion on-budget surplus this fiscal year. If CBO's \nfigures hold up, then the United States will have achieved a true, on-\nbudget surplus for the first time in 40 years.\n  In addition, the United States could enjoy an on-budget surplus \nranging somewhere between $11 billion and $69 billion in fiscal year \n2001, depending on which set of figures you use.\n  But what I find truly amazing is what CBO reports could occur over \nthe next 10 years. Under the most realistic assumptions about \ndiscretionary spending, CBO estimates we could achieve an on-budget \nsurplus of nearly $900 billion.\n  As good as this sounds, we must remember not to get ahead of the \ngame. Just because we could obtain an on-budget surplus, does not mean \nwe have obtained an on-budget surplus.\n  Whatever on-budget surplus we actually achieve this year--and the \nyears that follow--is predicated on the ability of Congress and the \nPresident to resist the urge to spend it. Unfortunately, with an amount \nof unobligated money that large, there will be calls from all segments \nof society and Government to increase funding for this program, or \ncreate that program, or institute massive tax cuts.\n  That is why the very first priority for this year must be to oppose \nthe temptation to squander this year's surplus on a pork-laden \nsupplemental appropriations bill. I implore my colleagues to maintain \nthe necessary discipline that will let these surpluses grow.\n  Even though I am cautiously optimistic about the on-budget surpluses \nprojected for this year and the next, I still do not believe we should \ntreat CBO's projections as the gospel truth as we plan 10 years, or \neven 5 years, down the road.\n  That is because, as most any economist will tell you, the only thing \ncertain about projections is their uncertainty.\n  In testimony before the House Banking Committee last year, Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       . . . it's very difficult to project with any degree of \n     conviction when you get out beyond 12, 18 months.\n\n  In addition, he stated:\n\n       Projecting five or ten years out is a very precarious \n     activity, as I think we have demonstrated time and time \n     again.\n\n  Last July, CBO Director Dan Crippen said, in testimony before the \nSenate Budget Committee that ``10-year budget projections are highly \nuncertain'' and that ``economic forecasting is an art that no one has \ntruly mastered.'' And that is from the Director of CBO--the man in \ncharge of making Congress' surplus projections.\n  More alarming, as we all know, these surplus projections don't \nreflect the ticking time bomb of Social Security and Medicare costs \nthat will explode when the baby boomers begin to retire--something that \nCongress and the President must address now.\n  More importantly as we bask in the euphoria of these projected \nsurpluses, we must not forget the sobering fact that we still have a \n$5.7 trillion national debt--a national debt that costs us more than \n$224 billion a year to service. That is more than $600 million a day in \ninterest costs alone.\n  Out of every Federal dollar spent, 13 cents goes to pay the interest \non the national debt.\n  In comparison: 16 cents goes for national defense, 18 cents goes for \nnondefense discretionary spending, and 53 cents goes for entitlement \nspending.\n  Here is the chart. I think most people are not familiar with it. This \nshows where the Federal dollar goes: net interest, 13 percent; national \ndefense, 16 percent; nondefense discretionary spending, 18 percent; and \n53 percent for mandatory spending.\n  Think about it. We spend more on interest each year than we spend on \nMedicare. It is easy to understand our difficulty in reforming Medicare \nor providing a prescription drug benefit or funding countless other \nbeneficial programs when the money we could use to pay for such \nprograms or activities is being spent on interest.\n  That is why I believe every fiscal decision we make from here on must \nbe measured against the backdrop of how it will decrease our $5.7 \ntrillion national debt.\n  In fact, in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee last week, \nCBO Director Crippen stated:\n\n       Most economists agree that saving the surpluses, paying \n     down the debt held by the public, is probably the best thing \n     that we can do relative to the economy.\n\n  On the very same day, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan said,\n\n       My first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus \n     to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public. From \n     an economic point of view, that would be, by far, the best \n     means of employing it.\n\n  Lowering the debt sends a positive signal to Wall Street and to Main \nStreet. It encourages more savings and investment which we really need \nin the country, and, in turn, it fuels productivity and continued \neconomic growth. It also lowers interest rates, which in my view, is a \n``bird-in-the-hand'' cost reduction for most Americans, and better than \nthe ``two-in-the-bush'' tax-reduction proposals floating around this \nCongress.\n  Furthermore, devoting on-budget surpluses to debt reduction is the \nonly way we can ensure that our Nation will not return to the days of \ndeficit spending should the economy take a sharp turn for the worse or \na national emergency arise.\n  As Alan Greenspan recently testified:\n\n       A substantial part of the surplus. . .should be allowed to \n     reduce the debt, because you can always increase debt later \n     if you wish to, but it's effectively putting away the surplus \n     for use at a later time if you so choose.\n\n  Even as most economists agree that the best use of any surplus is to \napply it against the debt, the bad news is, the President and some of \nmy colleagues believe the best use of this possible surplus is to \nincrease spending and provide tax expenditures.\n  By merely proposing his plan, as he outlined at his State of the \nUnion Address, the President has assured a path of confrontation both \nwith this Congress and within this Congress.\n  I believe that Congress and the President need to avoid such partisan \npolitics and work together on reaching an agreement as to how best to \nutilize these surpluses.\n  Further, I believe the best option available to us is to agree on a \nrealistic\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\nadjustment to the 1997 budget caps, do the best we can to respond to \nthe needs of the American people within that limit, and use the balance \nof the surplus to pay down the national debt.\n  If we can't start paying down our national debt now, with the longest \nperiod of economic growth in the history of our Nation, with record low \nunemployment and low inflation, when will we ever be able to do it?\n  We have a moral obligation to do it now.\n  I am ashamed, and so should my colleagues be ashamed, that because of \n30 years of irresponsible fiscal policies our national debt has \nincreased 1,300 percent. My granddaughters, Mary Faith and Veronica, \nand my 2-week-old grandson, John, have each inherited a debt of nearly \n$21,000 because Members of Congress and our Presidents weren't willing \nto pay for the things they wanted, or, in the alternative, do without \nthose items they could not afford.\n  I agree with General Accounting Office Comptroller General David \nWalker, who, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee \nsaid:\n\n       This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future \n     generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to \n     provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and \n     to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and \n     affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today \n     while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively \n     large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal \n     wave.\n\n  Fortunately, that message is starting to be heard. Last month, \nSpeaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, announced his goal of eliminating \nall federal debt held by the public by 2015. Not soon enough, but \nSpeaker Hastert gets it. And I hope my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle join us in supporting debt reduction as our primary fiscal goal \nbecause it is in the best interest of this nation.\n  In order to ensure fiscal discipline and prevent us from \n``backsliding'' into the fiscal mess we've been in for the past 30-plus \nyears, I am introducing today a Balanced Budget Amendment to the \nConstitution, or what I like to refer to as the ``backbone budget \namendment.''\n  I believe it is the only guarantee that we will never return to the \ndays of deficit spending and the accumulation of debt, and we should do \nit now. Now! The time is right, and those of my colleagues who have \nchampioned this in the past should seize upon this opportunity to join \nme in this effort, because, as they know, or should know, a Balanced \nBudget Amendment is the most effective method of keeping a handle on \nspending.\n  My proposal is a departure from previous proposals by stipulating \nthat Social Security surpluses be exempt from deficit calculations. \nThat is, a true balanced budget must be achieved without using off-\nbudget Social Security surpluses to finance spending in other areas. A \nfederal balanced budget constitutional amendment will help Congress and \nthe President make the hard decisions because they will no longer be \nable to tap the Social Security surplus.\n  It is a simple matter of fact that without constitutional and \nstatutory balanced budget provisions at the state and local level, many \nof our state and local governments would be in the same degree of debt \nas the federal government.\n  And let me just touch on my own personal experience, because I've had \nto deal with very real financial problems in my state. Without a \ncharter provision and a constitutional requirement, it would have been \nvirtually impossible for me to bring the City of Cleveland out of the \ndefault I inherited when I was Mayor, and to deal with Ohio's $1.5 \nbillion deficit when I was Governor.\n  Think about it--if we had a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment, \nand if we were to have a President who didn't want to make tough budget \nchoices on his or her own, the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment \nwould give the President the backbone he or she needs to make those \ntough choices.\n  And believe me, I've discovered after just 1 year in the Senate, this \nCongress needs the ``Backbone Budget Amendment'' to force us to make \nthose tough choices. If we pass the amendment, I'm confident that \nthree-fourths of our state legislatures would ratify it without \nquestion, because most of them are required by laws in their respective \nstates to balance their budgets.\n  And there is one other thing we need to do now, and that is enact \nSenator Domenici's biennial budget legislation.\n  I am a co-sponsor of this legislation because I believe it is an \nimportant tool to help use federal funds more efficiently and \nstrengthen Congress' proper oversight role.\n  Right now, we spend far too much time debating the federal budget, \nparticularly discretionary spending. Conversely, we don't devote nearly \nas much time as we should on oversight of the federal agencies because \nof the time and energy consumed by the budget resolution, budget \nreconciliation and the appropriations process.\n  Indeed, when he introduced his legislation last year, Senator \nDomenici pointed out in his statement that in 1996, 73% of the votes \ntaken in the Senate that year were related to the budget--often the \nsame subject is voted upon 3 or 4 times a year.\n  A biennial budget will help Congress and the Executive Branch avoid \nthe annual, lengthy budget and appropriations process and allow us to \nincrease our attention on the government oversight portion of our job.\n  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management \nand Restructuring, I have noted that GAO report after GAO report sits \non the shelf and no one does anything about them because no one has the \ntime to conduct the follow-up.\n  And from career bureaucrats to Cabinet Secretaries, nearly everyone \nin the Executive branch knows that when they're asked to come up to the \nHill for an oversight hearing, once it's over, it's over--rarely do \nthey have to worry about any follow-up hearings because Congress just \ndoesn't have the time.\n  Unfortunately, that reality can create problems that impact public \nsafety or national security.\n  As a freshman Senator, I was shocked to learn when we had hearings \nthis past year regarding Dr. Lee and the situation at the Los Alamos \nNational Lab that for 20 years we've had a problem with security at the \nDepartment of Energy, and no one did anything about it. But GAO knew: \nthey've released 31 major reports on nuclear-security problems at the \nDepartment since 1980. That's just incredible!\n  We need the time for oversight, and the 2-year budget cycle will make \nthat possible, just like it did when I was Governor of Ohio.\n  There is an old saying, ``prepare for tomorrow, today.'' The \nPresident and Congress must make a real commitment to fiscal \nresponsibility, and if we need an example, all we have to do is emulate \nwhat most American families do when they have extra money. They don't \ngo out and start spending wildly. They look to pay off their debts--\ntheir credit cards, their loans and their mortgages.\n  With our booming economy and with inflation and unemployment at \nhistorically low levels, there exists the best opportunity in a \ngeneration to pay down the national debt, reform and preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare and ensure that our Nation meets its \nconstitutional obligations. Such a legacy of fiscal responsibility \nwould be the best possible gift we could give to our children and \ngrandchildren, and to our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of my \nlegislation in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                               S.J.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution \nalong with 25 of my colleagues to designate March 25, 2000, as ``Greek \nIndependence Day: A Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.''\n  One hundred and seventy-nine years ago, the Greeks began the \nrevolution that would free them from the Ottoman Empire and return \nGreece to its democratic heritage. It was, of course, the ancient \nGreeks who developed the concept of democracy in which the supreme \npower to govern was vested in the people. Our Founding Fathers drew \nheavily upon the political and philosophical experience of ancient \nGreece in forming our representative democracy. Thomas Jefferson \nproclaimed that, ``to the ancient Greeks * * * we are all indebted for \nthe light which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' It is fitting, \nthen, that we should recognize the anniversary of the beginning of \ntheir efforts to return to that democratic tradition.\n  The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of \nthe many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient \nGreeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to \nthe United States of America, in the areas of art, philosophy, science \nand law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make \nvaluable contributions to American society, business, and government.\n  It is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate \nwill serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with \nwhom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history. Similar \nresolutions have been signed into law each of the past several years, \nwith overwhelming support in both the House of Representatives and the \nSenate. Accordingly, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important resolution.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nresolution submitted by Senator Specter designating March 25, 2000 as \nGreek Independence Day. The Greek-American community has made \nsignificant contributions to the United States. It is in honor of those \nachievements that we recognize Greek Independence Day.\n  The ancient Greeks conceived the very notion of democracy when they \nplaced the power to govern in the hands of the people. Our founding \nfathers relied on the political and philosophical experiences of \nancient Greece to create the government we have today. As a result, \nAmerica's close relationship with Greece is long and historic. I \nbelieve that James Monroe best expressed America's feelings toward \nGreece when he said, ``The mention of Greece fills the mind with the \nmost exalted sentiments and arouses in our bosoms the best feeling of \nwhich our nature is susceptible.''\n  As Greece fought for its independence in the 1820s, the American \nRevolution became a driving ideal. In fact, Greek intellectuals \ntranslated our own Declaration of Independence to use as their \nstatement of freedom. By the end of World War II, Greece was one of our \nmost important allies in the region as it fought to stem the Communist \ntide across Europe. In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower \nappropriately noted this effort when he said, ``. . . Greece asked no \nfavor except the opportunity to stand for the rights which it believed, \nand it gave to the world an example of battle, a battle that thrilled \nthe hearts of all free men and free women everywhere.''\n  Today, we know that Greece is one of only three nations in the world \nwhich has allied itself with the United States in every major \ninternational conflict this century. Through immigration, we have grown \neven closer. During the early 1900s, one out of every four Greek males \nbetween the ages of 15 and 45 emigrated to the United States. Greek-\nAmericans have the highest median educational attainment among all \nAmerican ethnic nationalities, and they are now a successful and \nintegral part of this country.\n  The relationship between Greece and America is a unique one which has \nsurvived the test of war and the looming threat of Communism. We owe a \ngreat deal to Greece, and to its people who have chosen to make America \ntheir home. Greek civilization touches our lives as Americans and \nenhances the cultural existence of this great nation. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in expressing our gratitude to Greece and all \nGreek-Americans for the role they have played in building this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S293-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S293-S294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 252--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT REBIYA \nKADEER, HER FAMILY MEMBER AND BUSINESS ASSOCIATE, SHOULD BE RELEASED BY \n                     THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 252\n\n       Whereas members of the Uighur minority population in \n     Xinjiang, China, are subject to ongoing repression and \n     violations of their internationally recognized rights of free \n     expression, association, and belief;\n       Whereas on August 11, 1999, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China arbitrarily detained Rebiya Kadeer, a \n     prominent and respected Uighur businesswoman well-known in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas from 1993 to 1998, Ms. Kadeer was an elected member \n     of the Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference \n     in Xinjiang;\n       Whereas in 1995, Ms. Kadeer was a delegate to the United \n     Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing;\n       Whereas the police have detained Ms. Kadeer previously and \n     kept her under close surveillance, threatening her because of \n     the alleged separatist activities of her husband, who came to \n     the United States in 1996 and was granted political asylum \n     after publishing articles critical of the Chinese Government;\n       Whereas on September 2, 1999, Chinese authorities formally \n     charged Ms. Kadeer with ``illegally offering state secrets \n     across the border'', and she is currently detained in Urumqi, \n     the capital of Xinjiang;\n       Whereas Ms. Kadeer's son, Ablikim Abdyirim, and her \n     secretary, Kahriman\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\n     Abdukirim, were also arbitrarily detained by Chinese security \n     forces in August 1999 in Urumqi, without any justification or \n     evidence of their involvement in criminal activities of any \n     kind; and\n       Whereas on November 20, 1999, Ablikim Abdyirim was sent for \n     2 years to the Wulabai Reeducation Through Labor School, \n     without charge or judicial review, in clear violation of \n     international human rights standards, and Kahriman Abdukirim \n     received a 3-year sentence in the same facility: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the President should express to the \n     representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China the sense of the Senate that Ms. Kadeer, her family \n     members and business associate, should be immediately and \n     unconditionally released.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, China's terrible treatment of ethnic \nminority Uighurs, a Muslim community in the northwestern province of \nXinjiang, has not received the same level of international attention as \nthat of the Tibetans. The Uighurs are also subject to ongoing \nrepression and violations of their internationally recognized rights of \nfree expression, association and belief. The Chinese government is \ncracking down on a separatist movement in Xinjiang as part of its \noverall strategy of maintaining ``stability'' at all costs. According \nto human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human \nRights Watch, over the past year China has used draconian measures \nincluding public sentencing rallies, long prison terms, and--\nalarmingly--a rising number of executions of suspected ``splittists.''\n  In an apparent attempt to stop the flow of information overseas about \nthis crackdown, Chinese security officials arbitrarily detained a \nprominent Uighur businesswoman, Ms. Rebiya Kadeer, this past August in \nUrumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. Her husband is a U.S. resident who \nbroadcasts on Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, championing the \ncause of his people.\n  For years, Ms. Kadeer has been praised by the Chinese government for \nher efforts to promote development in Xinjiang, including a project \nhelping Uighur women develop their own businesses. She has also been \npraised in the Wall Street Journal for her business savvy. She owns a \ndepartment store in Urumqi as well as a profitable trading company.\n  But now she has been put out of business, is being held in prison \nawaiting trial, charged last September with ``illegally offering state \nsecrets across the border.'' Even worse, her son and her secretary were \nalso detained and have already been sent to a labor camp. If Ms. Kadeer \nis convicted, she could be sent to prison for many years.\n  Ms. Kadeer's case demonstrates that even business people in China are \nnot safe from the arbitrary use of state power. As China tries to \nbecome a member of the World Trade Organization, this reality is \ncrucial to bear in mind--both for Chinese and foreign investors.\n  I urge my colleagues to call on the President to seek the immediate, \nunconditional release of Ms. Kadeer, her son, and secretary. Today I \noffer a sense of the Senate resolution urging their release, and hope \nit can be considered quickly and adopted unanimously by this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S294-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true \nMontana hero--Jim Atkinson. His death, after a long battle with \nleukemia last December, was a great loss to me personally and to the \nState of Montana.\n  You know, we always talk about how important education is. Especially \nhere in Congress, we talk about how children are the future and that we \nneed to invest in that future, and that's true. But Jim Atkinson did \nmore than just talk about education; he lived it. He was on the front \nlines every day, as a principal at Charlo Elementary and later as the \nvice president of the Montana Association of Elementary and Middle \nSchool Principals.\n  As an Administrator in the Montana school system, Jim was \ninstrumental in the effort to modernize our State's schools. He \nrealized quickly how important technology would be to students, and set \nup a computer lab for the Charlo school. Without people like Jim all \nour talk about education wouldn't amount to anything. His foresight and \ndedication to education in Montana made him a true hero. But there was \nmore to Jim than just his job.\n  Originally a native of Abington, PA, it was the outdoors and the land \nthat brought Jim to Montana. He was an accomplished mountain climber \nand fly fisherman. Montana's rugged peaks and blue ribbon trout streams \nhad a hold on Jim's soul. And Jim was a true family man.

Petty Officer 3rd Class \nMatthew E. Schlimme was just such an American. He was an extraordinary \nhero in service to his nation and fellow man.\n  Raised on a farm in Southeast Missouri, Matthew knew the value of \nhard work, the necessity for respect and consideration of others, and \nthe need to overcome obstacles. One such obstacle he had from an early \nage was a fear of the water. Not only did Matthew join the U.S. Coast \nGuard to overcome his fear, but in doing so he served his country and \nsaved a life.\n  On February 12, 1997, Officer Schlimme and two other Coast Guardsmen \nwere thrown overboard in 24-foot seas while attempting to rescue a \nsailboat. Before going overboard, Schlimme was able to buckle in Seaman \nApprentice Benjamin Wingo. Mr. Wingo was the sole survivor. Officer \nSchlimme lost his life, but gained the thanks of a nation.\n  Mr. Schlimme's parents, Larry and Haroletta Schlimme, of \nBurfordville,\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\nMissouri, were present at the January 27, 2000, dedication of the \nMatthew E. Schlimme Industrial Facility in St. Louis. The building will \nprovide a production site for navigation equipment and will house the \nSt. Louis Electronic Support Detachment.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Schlimme can be proud of their son's bravery and \ncourage. His act of heroism has been remembered in the hearts of many \nMissourians.

Mr. President, I am most pleased to join with \nthe citizens of Maryland, Governor Parris Glendening, and other \ncolleagues in government in welcoming Maestro Yuri Temirkanov, one of \nthe most talented and gifted conductors of our time, as the new Music \nDirector of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.\n  Maestro Temirkanov's inspired energy, imagination, and popularity, \ncoupled with the renowned excellence and stellar reputation of the \nBaltimore Symphony Orchestra, promises Marylanders and the nation an \nunprecedented artistic combination. As the eleventh Music Director in \nthe Orchestra's 83-year history, Maestro Temirkanov will oversee all \nartistic programming of the BSO, conduct twelve subscription concerts, \nthe opening fundraising gala, any recordings, and will lead tours as \nwell.\n  The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, through its critically-acclaimed \nconcert tours, Grammy Award-winning recordings, and cutting-edge \nconcert formats, has earned deserved respect in the world of classical \nmusic. The addition of Maestro Temirkanov takes the BSO to the highest \nechelon of musical excellence and achievement. A recent article from \nthe Baltimore Sun included the following quote from Mikhail \nBaryshnikov:\n\n       Baltimore audiences can look forward to special excitement, \n     because Yuri Temirkanov is one of the truly inspired maestros \n     of today.\n\n  Mr. President, as a strong supporter of the arts, and on behalf of \nthe citizens of Maryland, I take great pleasure in welcoming Maestro \nTemirkanov to the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and ask that recent \narticles from the Baltimore Sun, Baltimore Magazine, and the Washington \nPost, be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Jan. 21, 2000]\n\n                    Temirkanov Powerful in BSO Debut\n\n                          (By Terry Teachout)\n\n       So how does a brand-new music director go about making a \n     really big impression at his inaugural concert?\n       Yuri Temirkanov, who took the helm of the Baltimore \n     Symphony Orchestra last night, did it by detonating a \n     performing of Gustav Mahler's 90-minute-long ``Resurrection'' \n     Symphony at Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, aided and abetted \n     by soprano Janice Chandler, mezzo-soprano Nancy Maultsby and \n     the Baltimore Symphony Chorus. Short of inviting John Waters \n     to set off nuclear weapons at midnight in the Chesapeake Bay, \n     you can't get much bigger than that.\n       The 61-year-old Temirkanov is not a household name outside \n     his native Russia, where he took over the legendary St. \n     Petersburg Philharmonic in 1968 (back when it was the \n     Lenigrad Philharmonic) and led it by all accounts with great \n     distinction.\n       But he has already made waves in Baltimore. Several inches \n     of snow didn't stop local music lovers from turning out in \n     force to hear his official debut, and Mayor Martin O'Malley \n     was on hand to declare him an honorary citizen of the city, \n     expressing the hope that ``what is now great will become even \n     greater.''\n       Though he's a certified performer, the major is hardly a \n     full-fledged music critic. Still, I think he's onto \n     something. Temirkanov gave us a ``Resurrection'' that was \n     weighty, emphatic, deliberate and eloquent, with a \n     resplendent finale full of great sunbursts of sound. What's \n     more, the BSO has very clearly taken to him--with good \n     reason. He is a powerful musical communicator with something \n     strongly individual to say. Furthermore, it's clear that he \n     has the kind of personality that makes orchestras long to \n     play their best.\n       To be sure, orchestras almost always play their best when \n     Mahler is on the program. He has become so popular in recent \n     decades that it is hard to remember a time when he was ever \n     anything else. Yet in his own time and for long afterward, \n     the extreme emotional weather of his music struck most \n     concertgoers as peculiar at best, neurotic at worst. Though \n     his proteges, Bruno Walter and Otto Klemperer among them, \n     resolutely insisted on programming and recording his \n     symphonies, he was widely thought to be little more than a \n     virtuoso conductor who composed on the side; in Ralph Vaughan \n     Williams' wrong-headed but witty summing up, his years of \n     podium experience had turned him into ``a tolerable imitation \n     of a composer.''\n       We know better now, but do we really know Mahler? And are \n     his violent passions likely to wear well in our icy age of \n     Irony Lite? Certainly anyone who sees him as a musical \n     special-effects man, or his colossal symphonies as turn-of-\n     the-century equivalents of such movies as ``Independence \n     Day,'' is missing the point. Mahler was nothing if not \n     serious, especially about spiritual matters. Above all, he \n     was (in Walter's apt phrase) ``a God-seeker,'' and his \n     search was fraught with angst.\n       When rehearsing the ``Resurrection'' Symphony for his 1907 \n     farewell concert with the Vienna Philharmonic, he went so far \n     as to confess to that hard-boiled bunch of conductor-haters \n     that it was a musical portrayal of ``the wrestling of Jacob \n     with the Angel, and Jacob's cry to the Angel: `I will not let \n     thee go except thou bless me.' '' Whatever else that is, it \n     isn't cool.\n       If the Second Symphony, completed in 1894, is a supreme \n     masterpiece of religious art, it is one whose essential \n     character is as much theatrical--even operatic--as it is \n     spiritual. The expansive first movement was conceived as a \n     free-standing symphonic poem called ``Todtenfeier'' (Funeral \n     Rites), and the four sharply contrasting movements that \n     follow describe a journey from fathomless despair to the \n     ecstatic deliverance of the Last Judgment.\n       Like Beethoven in his Ninth Symphony, Mahler ups the \n     expressive ante by introducing vocal soloists and a chorus, \n     who sing of the world's end and the heavenly life to come: \n     ``All that has perished must rise again! Cease from \n     trembling! Prepare to live!''\n       As it happens, the BSO is scarcely in need of resurrection. \n     In his 13 years at the orchestra's helm, David Zinman \n     deprovincialized what had long been perceived in the music \n     business as a stodgy second-tier ensemble and turned it into \n     one of America's strongest orchestras.\n       Among countless other good things, he taught the BSO how to \n     play Mahler's demanding music. His 1995 performance of the \n     Third Symphony is one of the happiest and most vivid memories \n     of my concert-going life. In all the hoopla surrounding \n     Temirkanov's arrival, it's worth remembering that what \n     happened last night would not have been possible had it not \n     been for Zinman's superb stewardship.\n       But Temirkanov is very much his own man, and he has had a \n     striking effect on the sound of the BSO. Zinman was a quirky, \n     intelligent modernist; Termirkanov is a high-octane romantic \n     of the old school. A slight man who conducts without a baton, \n     he makes large but straightforward gestures with his \n     startlingly long and supple arms; he likes a dark, full \n     sound, built from the basses up, and he favors plenty of \n     portamento, the great swooping string slides that are so \n     stylish in Mahler.\n       He doesn't value precision for its own sake--the first \n     movement was expansive rather than tightly controlled, not \n     always to its best advantage--but he knows how to rise to an \n     expressive occasion, and the great choral finale was \n     beautifully controlled and superbly passionate.\n       On the whole, this was a rather slow performance, more like \n     Leonard Bernstein than Klemperer, and my taste runs to a \n     Mahler that is tauter and more sardonic. Yet there a more \n     than one way to make magic, and Temirkanov's interpretation \n     seemed to me indelible. Indeed, the finale brought tears to \n     my eyes, and I doubt I was alone.\n       The soloists, not surprisingly, were excellent. Janice \n     Chandler was bright and pure, Nancy Maultsby ripe-voiced and \n     warm. The Baltimore Symphony Chorus did itself proud and \n     deserved its share of the 12-minute standing ovation at \n     evening's end.\n       Aside from everything else, last night's concert (which \n     will be repeated tonight at 8 p.m. and tomorrow at 11 a.m.) \n     and next week's follow-up, an all-French program featuring \n     pianist Leon Fleisher, are obviously designed to send out a \n     subliminal message about the BSO's new boss. Most Russian \n     conductors are perceived in the West as one-trick ponies, and \n     Temirkanov is no exception: Of his 26 recordings, all but two \n     are of Russian music.\n       To kick off his first season with Mahler, Debussy and Ravel \n     is thus to issue a bold declaration of independence from \n     repertoire stereotypes, which bodes well for a conductor who \n     will be rightly expected to play the field. Judging by last \n     night's performance, I'd say he's off to a terrific start. I \n     plan to return next week to hear the second chapter in what \n     promises to be a fascinating musical story. You come, too.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Baltimore Magazine, Sept. 1999]\n\n                         From Russia, With Love\n\n                             (By Max Weiss)\n\n       Yuri Temirkanov cannot tell a joke. He starts to tell it--\n     in Russian, of course--and then halfway through, he starts to \n     laugh. And then you start to laugh, because even though you \n     haven't the faintest clue what he's saying, when Temirkanov \n     laughs, it's impossible not to laugh with him. By the time he \n     spits out the punchline, tears are streaming down his face; \n     he's laughing this joyous, exuberant, completely guileless \n     guffaw. And pretty soon, tears are streaming down your face \n     even though his interpreter--\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\n     the inscrutable Mariana Stokes--has barely started \n     translating. At this point, the joke is completely \n     irrelevant.\n       But, just for the record, Temirkanov favors viola jokes. \n     (Violas, in case you didn't know, are the Rodney Dangerfield \n     of the orchestra.) And here's the first (of many) viola jokes \n     Temirkanov tells:\n       How do you teach a viola player to play staccato?\n       You write out a whole note and tell him it's a solo.\n       (Okay, so maybe it's funnier in Russian.)\n       When David Zinman announced his retirement as music \n     director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra two years ago, \n     you could feel the panic in the music community. It was \n     Zinman who had put the BSO on the map--made it artistically \n     viable, world-renowned, even cutting edge. And it was Zinman \n     who had really connected to Baltimore audiences with his \n     regular-guy, artist-as-mensch persona. How could we possible \n     replace him?\n       Enter Yuri Temirkanov.\n       It's not just that the 59-year-old Temirkanov--the music \n     director of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and the \n     former principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic in \n     London--is widely considered one of the most prodigiously \n     talented conductors alive. It's also that Temirkanov is so \n     completely lovable.\n       There are some people who exude empathy, whose every facial \n     expression, gesture, vocal inflection conveys an emotion. \n     That's Temirkanov. You can see this remarkable body language \n     when he conducts. As he dances on the podium, waving his arms \n     (he doesn't use a baton), he looks like he's playing an \n     elaborate game of charades. Here he's petting a horse. Here \n     he's churning butter. Here he's tinkling at an imaginary \n     piano in the air. And yet every gesture is eminently clear. \n     The horse petting thing: That's Temirkanov trying to get the \n     brass to play with a more emphatic rhythm. The butter \n     churning, that's urging for a more blended, sweeping sound. \n     The tinkling in the air, that's to suggest the tossed-off \n     nature of a woodwind arpeggio.\n       ``He's very clear with what he wants,'' says Phillip \n     Kolker, the orchestra's principle bassoonist. ``He doesn't \n     speak much, but he has a very effective way of \n     communicating.''\n       Because of his emotional expressiveness--coupled with his \n     puckish good looks (he suggests a smaller, older Kenneth \n     Branaugh), his romantic sensibilities (he has a penchant for \n     lush interpretations of Beethoven and Shostakovich), and his \n     insouciant charm (at a spring press conference, reporters \n     hung delightedly on his every word)--Temirkanov is already a \n     big hit with Baltimore fans.\n       When he performed his first concert series as BSO music \n     director last March, the crowds were simply ecstatic. It was \n     as if the audience wanted to embrace Temirkanov with a giant \n     bear hug of applause and appreciation.\n       Temirkanov is humbled by this warm response--``it's \n     incredibly touching,'' he says--but it's a safe bet that he \n     wasn't happy with any of his first three performances.\n       ``I never had a concert where I said to myself, `Ahhh, that \n     was really something!' '' he explains, munching on a cannoli \n     at Vaccaro's Italian pastry cafe in Little Italy. ``When I \n     play the concert, I know exactly what has gone wrong. And \n     when people say, `Wonderful! Wonderful!' I listen to the \n     compliments with pleasure. But I know it wasn't that good.''\n       He equates the praise of concertgoers with well-wishers at \n     a funeral. Then he giggles at the thought: ``Have you ever \n     heard a bad word at a funeral? If only the people could hear \n     what is said about them! No one felt this so strongly when \n     they were alive!''\n       To Temirkanov, a true artist is never satisfied with his \n     work. ``It will mean that I'm beginning to die as an \n     artist,'' he says.\n       Striving to be a great artist is the focal point of \n     Temirkanov's life. Sure, he has hobbies--fishing, cartoon-\n     drawing (he can whip off a giant-schnozzed, Hirschfield-like \n     caricature of himself in 30 seconds flat). And of course he \n     has family: His son plays violin with the St. Petersburg \n     Philharmonic Orchestra, and his beloved wife died in 1997. \n     But it's clear that music shuts out most other earthly \n     concerns. As such, he is notorious for eschewing such modern \n     trappings as computers and televisions and cars.\n       Once, ill-advisedly, the trusty Marina Stokes--who has been \n     with the maestro as an assistant and friend for over 15 \n     years--tried to teach Temirkanov to drive.\n       ``It was a disaster,'' she says with thinly concealed \n     mirth. ``He drove over a flower bed.''\n       ``You see!'' laughs Temirkanov. ``Even my left foot is \n     romantic! I don't drive into cars. I drive into flower \n     beds.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Jan. 21, 2000]\n\n                 Baltimore Symphony's Man of Substance\n\n                         (By Philip Kennicott)\n\n       The solid and sensible Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which \n     puts its decidedly working-man's city on the cultural map, \n     has an aristocrat at its head. Yuri Temirkanov, the eminent \n     and respected Russian conductor, gave his inaugural concert \n     as the BSO's music director last night. If his tenure builds \n     on the strengths of this performance, the Temirkanov years \n     could be legendary.\n       Baltimore is a lucky city. Fifteen years ago, when the Cold \n     War was still in progress, the idea that one of the Soviet \n     Union's foremost and distinguished artists would take the \n     head artistic job at the BSO was inconceivable. Temirkanov \n     was the chief of Leningrad's Kirov Opera, and within a few \n     years, would take the helm of the country's most respected \n     orchestra, the St. Petersburg Philharmonic. He was a blue-\n     blood musician, if not in the traditional sense, in the \n     artistic sense, a man of wide culture, immense influence and \n     a reputation for artistic and personal integrity. He could \n     afford to take risks that would have sunk a lesser figure.\n       Then the Cold War ended, and with it the subsidies that \n     made the Soviet musical scene flourish. The St. Petersburg \n     Philharmonic, which he still leads, maintains its quality but \n     is threatened by dwindling audiences and dwindling resources. \n     To keep it afloat, Temirkanov must tour the orchestra, and \n     when he does, foreign audiences want him to bring Russian \n     repertoire--Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, Prokofiev.\n       But Temirkanov doesn't want to be pigeonholed. One might \n     have expected that the world's very best orchestras would \n     offer one of the finest living conductors the chance to \n     conduct Elgar and Mahler; yet Baltimore secured him, and now \n     a very good orchestra has a very great conductor. Early signs \n     suggest that both will flourish.\n       Temirkanov chose Mahler's Symphony No. 2 for his first \n     official concert as music director. Like Beethoven's Symphony \n     No. 9, which also does service for large, ceremonial \n     occasions, Mahler's Second is best heard infrequently; even \n     for listeners who love it beyond reason, it takes discipline \n     to keep its brutality raw and its sentimentality delicate and \n     unself-conscious. Although it lasts at least an hour and a \n     half, it is perhaps Mahler's most succinct statement: \n     Everything that he does before and after this symphony is \n     here in germ, the funeral marches, the bucolic alpine sounds, \n     the despair of death and the frisson of hope that perhaps \n     this world is not wrought from cold, insensible iron.\n       The new music director conducts Mahler with little wasted \n     motion. In this often violent and saturnine work, Temirkanov \n     called for only those cataclysms necessary to make the \n     composer's point. He is a purist on the podium, attending \n     diligently if not slavishly to the score, taking the spare \n     theatrical liberty that proves he is confident of the \n     audience's attention. He will extend a pause to the breaking \n     point or allow the sound of offstage horns to die into \n     protracted silences, but these exceptional moments only \n     underscore his judicious, masonry approach.\n       The excitement of the performance was the excitement of \n     comprehension. One heard Mahler's effort to build a new \n     psychology for the orchestra while remaining somewhat distant \n     from the music's bellicose and sloppy extremes. It made \n     Mahler unfold the way Beethoven unfolds, though at a much \n     more geological pace.\n       This runs counter to misguided expectations about how \n     Russian-trained conductors conduct, and how Mahler is \n     supposed to be played. Temirkanov's interpretation was not a \n     cinematically sweeping approach, nor an overly personal one. \n     But it invited serious listening, appreciation of the \n     orchestra's manifold strengths and respect for the \n     conductor's attention to balance.\n       Temirkanov was rewarded by his new orchestra with ferocious \n     attention. String sounds were clear and incisive, woodwind \n     playing precise and balanced, horns and trumpets warm and \n     blended. Chaos was always intentional, never an unfortunate \n     accident. Soprano Janice Chandler and mezzo-soprano Nancy \n     Maultsby were well chosen, and used as elements within the \n     musical construct rather than soloists dominating it. The BSO \n     chorus sang its opening whisper of resurrection--\n     ``Auferstehen''--with a sound familiar from Robert Shaw, a \n     fully fleshed whisper, at the limit of a large chorus's \n     ability to sing a shade above silence.\n       Baltimore and the orchestra made the evening an event. \n     Outside the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, a searchlight cut \n     laserlike swaths through the cold night sky. Mayor Martin \n     O'Malley gave the new conductor honorary Baltimore \n     citizenship. But musical protocol and political protocol \n     don't mix well; Mahler's monumental symphony was the point of \n     the evening, and Temirkanov seemed uncomfortable receiving \n     his first huge ovation before having conducted a note. But \n     that discomfort represents the strengths this cultured, \n     dignified and exceptional conductor will bring to the \n     orchestra: a style long on substance and refreshingly free of \n     empty gestures and self-aggrandizement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S296-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S296-S297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEMORIAL OF MRS. JEAN MACARTHUR\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the passing \nof a wonderful woman and a great American. On the 21st of January, at \nthe age of 101, Mrs. Jean MacArthur passed away at Lenox Hill Hospital \nin New York.\n  In 1988, President Reagan recognized her contribution to America by \npresenting her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As you know, the \nMedal of Freedom is the highest award our country can give to a \ncivilian. The citation for the award recognized that ``Jean MacArthur \nhas witnessed the great cataclysms of our time, survived war and peace, \nconquered tragedy and known triumph.'' President Reagan\n\n[[Page S297]]\n\nalso referred to her as ``a shining example, a woman of substance and \ncharacter, a loyal wife and mother, and like her General, a patriot.''\n  The General and Mrs. MacArthur were married in 1937. Mrs. MacArthur \nremained devoted to her husband until his death in 1964. Her devotion \nto him was not only emotional, but involved a great deal of physical \nsacrifice. You see, Mr. President, Mrs. MacArthur lived with the \nGeneral in Manila until they were forced to retreat to Corregidor by \nthe Japanese. While on Corregidor, she endured daily air attacks while \nraising their 4 year old son, Arthur. Furthermore, when it was obvious \nthe Japanese would take the Philippines, the president of the \nPhilippines offered passage for her and her son to Australia. She \nreplied: ``We have drunk from the same cup; we three shall stay \ntogether.'' She then continued to stay with her husband in the field \nuntil General MacArthur finally accepted the surrender of the Japanese \nin Japan.\n  After the death of General MacArthur, Mrs. MacArthur lived out her \nlife in New York where she remained active in philanthropic activities. \nShe even served as the honorary chairman of the MacArthur Foundation, \nwhich was created in honor of her husband.\n  The spouses of our Americans in uniform seldom receive the \nrecognition they deserve for their contribution to the valor, \npatriotism, and loyalty of our fighting forces. Her contribution to \nAmerica cannot be quantified, but it must not be forgotten. It's no \nwonder that General MacArthur often introduced her as ``my finest \nsoldier.''\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in paying tribute \nto this outstanding woman and her sterling contribution to \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S297-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THOMASINA ``TOMMY'' ROGERS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, the World Conference on Religion and \nPeace (WCRP) is an organization that is dedicated to promoting \ncooperation among the religions of the world on behalf of peace while \nmaintaining respect for religious differences.\n  Since its founding in 1970, the WCRP has become a genuinely global \nmovement with over 30 national chapters and members in over 100 \ncountries.\n  Two months ago, in Amman, the capital city of Jordan, the WCRP held \nits 7th World Assembly, which brought together senior leaders of many \nof the major religions of the world as well as their civil and \npolitical counterparts.\n  The Assembly was held on November 26 and 27, 1999, under the \npatronage of King Abdullah II and the chairmanship of Prince El Hassan \nbin Talal, and was attended by some 1,300 delegates from 68 countries.\n  I note that among the participants in the Amman Assembly was our \ndistinguished former colleague, a Member from Indiana for 22 years of \nthe House of Representatives, where he was Majority Whip, and is now \nPresident Emeritus of New York University, Dr. John Brademas.\n  Dr. Brademas, who is also Chairman of the National Endowment for \nDemocracy (NED), presided at a discussion in Amman on ``The Shape of \nthe Future as a Challenge to Religion.''\n  Mr. President, the Assembly also convened a ``Forum of South Eastern \nEuropean Religious Leaders'' to promote inter-religious cooperation for \nreconciliation, reconstruction and development in the region. \nRepresentatives from more than 25 different religious communities in 10 \ncountries from South Eastern Europe participated in the forum.\n  I am pleased to note that the person who organized and chaired this \nforum, James Cairns, WCRP Project Director, South Eastern Europe, \nSarajevo, lived several years in Elkhart, Indiana, where his father was \na Presbyterian Church pastor.\n  As the Secretary-General of WCRP, Dr. William F. Vendley, observed, \n``This unprecedented gathering of religious leaders from South Eastern \nEurope will initiate a process of contact and a dialogue among the \nreligious communities both within specific states and throughout the \nregion to develop concrete inter-religious cooperation.''\n  Mr. President, together this group of leaders of several faiths, \ndrawing on their diverse traditions and working together, produced a \nstatement calling for the promotion of reconciliation, democracy and \nthe peaceful development of South Eastern Europe, and committing \nthemselves to opening dialogue among their communities.\n  Mr. President, because of the great importance of the events in this \ntroubled part of the world and the significant role of religious \nleadership in South Eastern Europe, I ask to have the statement printed \nin the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n  Statement of Religious Leaders on Reconstruction and Development in \n                          South Eastern Europe\n\n       As leaders and responsible representatives of religious \n     communities from South Eastern Europe we have gathered at \n     this Forum in Amman Jordan on 26-27 November 1999, in the \n     context of the Seventh World Assembly of the World Conference \n     on Religion and Peace, to discuss the current situation in \n     our region and to identify how our communities can work \n     together to promote reconstruction and development both \n     within our respective states and throughout the region as a \n     whole.\n       As religious people, we must affirm that in each of our \n     traditions human life is sacred. Any violation of the rights \n     of any person is not acceptable and must be condemned. Our \n     religious traditions all seek to promote fullness of life \n     through peace, justice, mercy and love.\n\n\n                    CONFLICT IN SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE\n\n       Sadly, our recent experience in South Eastern Europe has \n     been filed with conflict that has denied these to many \n     people. After the fall of communism, our region has suffered \n     through unrest and conflict. These conflicts have rekindled \n     old prejudices and created mutual distrust and division among \n     peoples. We regret that key actors in the international \n     community lacked the vision, commitment and preventive \n     strategies to prevent these catastrophes. Even countries that \n     have escaped the violence that has afflicted the states of \n     the former Yugoslavia have faced serious social crises that \n     have created considerable instability in their societies.\n       We are proud of the role that our religions have played in \n     the history, culture and traditions of the nations and \n     peoples of our region. Our religious identities have been and \n     will continue to be an essential part of who we are as \n     believers and as people. But, we are also aware that this \n     close identity between religious and national communities has \n     been misused by those in positions of influence and power. \n     Too often, within our ethnic and religious c0ommunities there \n     have been efforts to portray others as the enemy and a danger \n     to the safety of our own community. We must resist and \n     overcome such stereotyping to ensure that our heritage can \n     serve to build strong futures for all people and not simply \n     be used to perpetuate the myth that security comes only in \n     ethnically pure states.\n\n\n                        JUSTICE AND FORGIVENESS\n\n       We regret and mourn the destruction and death of so many \n     innocent victims in the\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\n     conflicts that have raged through the region, as well as the \n     destruction of religious objects in all our communities. We \n     are challenged to ask for forgiveness and seek reconciliation \n     across communities, not because religious communities are \n     responsible for these conflicts, but because religion must \n     set the example for the rest of the society to follow. We \n     acknowledge that as members of communities we cannot escape a \n     sense of collective shame for what has occurred, but we must \n     preserve the principle of individual guilt and responsibility \n     for acts and atrocities committed during these conflicts, \n     particularly those leaders who were instrumental in creating \n     these crises. The deep principle of justice in each of our \n     traditions requires that those responsible be judged based on \n     international standards of law without guilt being assigned \n     to entire communities. Punishing entire populations simply \n     multiplies injustices and the suffering of the innocent.\n\n\n                       THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY\n\n       As we look to the future, religious communities can and \n     must play a central role in building strong civil society \n     throughout the region. Political leaders and institutions \n     have a primary role and responsibility for building strong \n     states, but material reconstruction and development can be \n     long lasting only with a corresponding moral and social \n     reconstruction and development. Religious communities must be \n     decisive leaders in a process of promoting truth, justice and \n     reconciliation in their societies so that all persons and \n     groups can have their rights respected and \n     protected throughout the region. In this regard, we must \n     develop a new concept of security. Security cannot be \n     based solely on armaments and military strength, but must \n     be based on strong and open societies, in which all are \n     protected and cared for and in which conflicts are \n     resolved through dialogue and negotiation rather than \n     through violence. Therefore, we urge the governments in \n     our region to reduce their militaries and armaments and to \n     work to reduce the presence of arms among their \n     populations.\n       As religious leaders and representatives from the region, \n     we are encouraged by the efforts of the international \n     community to develop the Stability Pact of Reconstruction and \n     Development in South Eastern Europe. We must remind both \n     international authorities and our own national leaders, \n     however, that the welfare of human beings individually and as \n     groups must remain at the center of such efforts. Without \n     this human dimension no amount of good works will provide \n     true security, peace and prosperity.\n       In this regard, we express our solidarity with the brothers \n     and sisters in each of our faith communities in Yugoslavia. \n     Both for stability and successful regional integration it is \n     essential for Yugoslavia to be part of the Stability Pact \n     process as soon as possible. In the meantime, however, \n     humanitarian assistance must not be denied to those in need \n     and we urge the international community to allow basic \n     foodstuffs, medicines, and heating fuel to be provided to the \n     people of that country without delay.\n\n\n        a common call to the governments of south eastern europe\n\n       Almost all of our communities are emerging from a communist \n     period that severely marginalized religion in society. \n     Together we seek to promote a strong civil society and the \n     essential role of religious communities in that process, but \n     we cannot accomplish this goal alone. Therefore, we call on \n     civil authorities at the local, state, regional and \n     international level:\n       To promote and actively practice democracy, human rights, \n     and the rule of law, with particular protection for minority \n     groups, in all states in the region.\n       To respect and establish the formal separation of political \n     and religious institutions so that each can freely perform \n     its own tasks and respect the functions of the other.\n       To regard religious communities, which possess both \n     infrastructure and expertise in providing social services to \n     the people and which have an essential role in protecting the \n     social security of all people, as legitimate partners in the \n     work of reconstruction and development.\n       To provide support for the development of strong civil \n     society through adopting appropriate laws, financial \n     regulations, and other policies that will provide the \n     necessary environment for religious communities and other \n     civic organizations to thrive.\n       To allow free practice of religious belief for all persons \n     and to ensure the availability of religious service in the \n     military and other social institutions.\n       To promote policies of economic development that are \n     sustainable and humane and can ensure economic security for \n     all people in the region. Integration into broader European \n     structures is an important dimension of this process.\n       To adopt and implement laws on restitution of property to \n     religious communities that was nationalized or expropriated \n     by previous regimes. This property is essential for religious \n     communities to retain their independence from political \n     control and to carry out their religious and social mission.\n       To develop media practices that do not promote division, \n     mistrust and hostility among peoples, but can contribute to \n     building healthy democratic societies. In this regard we call \n     for greater access for all religious communities to the media \n     in their respective countries.\n\n\n                       opening religious dialogue\n\n       As representatives of our respective religious communities, \n     we know that there is no alternative to dialogue both within \n     and among our communities, and we commit ourselves to take \n     the following steps to promote dialogue and cooperation among \n     ourselves and to enhance the role of our communities as \n     important social institutions in our societies:\n       We will seek partnerships with other civic and social \n     organizations in our societies to carry out social welfare \n     activities for which we share a common concern.\n       We will educate all persons to understand and respect our \n     different faith traditions in order to prevent ignorance and \n     fear from once again fueling violence. To this end we must \n     ensure that school curriculums and textbooks treat each \n     religious tradition in a way that individuals from that \n     tradition can recognize themselves. We will also provide \n     basic information about each religious community and organize \n     teacher exchanges in our own religious institutions to \n     promote better understanding and mutual respect.\n       We commit ourselves to pray for and to promote tolerance, \n     coexistence and peace both within our own communities and for \n     our brothers and sisters in other communities. We also pledge \n     ourselves to promote a climate of peace within our \n     communities by stressing to our own officials that preaching \n     must not interpret our own faith by attacking others. We must \n     show respect to others by not using inflammatory language in \n     our public statements.\n       We encourage the formation of inter-religious working \n     committees in each state to foster contact and dialogue among \n     the communities as a first step towards practical \n     cooperation.\n       We will work to take part in joint public meetings and \n     visits by religious leaders within our own states and around \n     the region to promote the idea of tolerance and common living \n     among communities and peoples.\n       We pledge ourselves to find the means to provide mutual \n     assistance for those who suffer in whatever way in our \n     societies. In these efforts, we want to state that majority \n     religious communities have a particular responsibility to \n     protect the human and religious rights of smaller or minority \n     communities in their areas.\n       Our region continues to face considerable challenges in the \n     process of reconstruction, reconciliation and development. We \n     believe that religious communities can play a vital role in \n     this process, and we are thankful to God that we have had the \n     opportunity to meet together and discuss such critical \n     issues, and we express our appreciation to the World \n     Conference on Religion and Peace for convening this important \n     meeting. We commit ourselves to pursuing contact and dialogue \n     with each other both within the states of South Eastern \n     Europe and across the region as a whole for the purpose of \n     building active instruments of interreligious cooperation, \n     and we ask for the World Conference on Religion and Peace to \n     continue to assist us in facilitating this process of \n     building cooperation in our region.\n\nForum of South Eastern European Religious Leaders, World Conference on \n                           Religion and Peace\n\n\n                           participants list\n\n                                Islamic\n\n       Mr. Mehmet Emin Aga, Mufti of Xanthi, Greece.\n       Dr. Rexhep Bojaj, Mufti and President, Islamic Community of \n     Kosovo.\n       H.E.

Mr. President, on February 6 of this year, in the \nDivine Providence Church, in Southfield, Michigan, several hundred \nLithuanian Americans will gather to mark the tenth anniversary of the \nrestoration of Lithuania's independence. Joined by Lithuania's \nambassador to the United States, His Excellency, Stasys Sakalauskas, \nthey will be celebrating their nation's original, modern independence \nday, February 16, 1918, as well as the events of March 1, 1990, the \ndate on which Lithuania was finally and irrevocably released from the \ngrip of Soviet communism.\n  Michigan's Lithuanian-American community also will celebrate the \nperseverance and sacrifice of their people, which enabled them to \nachieve the freedom they now enjoy.\n  I have reviewed the bare facts before: On March 11, 1990, the newly \nelected Lithuanian Parliament, fulfilling its electoral mandate from \nthe people of Lithuania, declared the restoration of Lithuania's \nindependence and the establishment of a democratic state. This marked a \ngreat moment for Lithuania and for lovers of freedom around the globe.\n  The people of Lithuania endured 51 years of oppressive foreign \noccupation. Operating under cover of the infamous Hitler-Stalin Pact of \n1939, Soviet troops marched into Lithuania, beginning an occupation \ncharacterized by communist dictatorship and cultural genocide.\n  Even in the face of this oppression, the Lithuanian people were not \ndefeated. They assisted their oppressors and kept their culture, their \nfaith and their dream of independence very much alive even during the \nhardest times.\n  The people of Lithuania were even able to mobilize and sustain a non-\nviolent movement for social and political change, a movement which came \nto be known as Sajudis. This people's movement helped guarantee a \npeaceful transition to independence through full participation in \ndemocratic elections on February 24, 1990.\n  Unfortunately, as is so often the case, peace and freedom had to be \npurchased again and again. In January of 1991, ten months after \nrestoration of independence, the people and government of Lithuania \nfaced a bloody assault by foreign troops intent on overthrowing their \ndemocratic institutions. Lithuanians withstood this assault, \nmaintaining their independence and their democracy. Their successful \nuse of non-violent resistance to an oppressive regime is an inspiration \nto all.\n  Lithuania's integration into the international community has been \nswift and sure. On September 17, 1991, the reborn nation became a \nmember of the United Nations and is a signatory to a number of its \norganizations and other international agreements. It also is a member \nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the North \nAtlantic Cooperation Council and the Council of Europe.\n  Lithuania is an associate member of the European Union, has applied \nfor NATO membership and is currently negotiating for membership in the \nWTO, OECD and other Western organizations.\n  The United States established diplomatic relations with Lithuania on \nJuly 28, 1992. But our nation never really broke with the government \nand people of Lithuania. The United States never recognized the \nforcible incorporation of Lituania into the U.S.S.R., and views the \npresent Government of Lithuania as a legal continuation of the inter-\nwar republic. Indeed, for over fifty years the United States maintained \na bipartisan consensus that our nation would refuse to recognize the \nforcible incorporation of Lithuania into the former Soviet Union.\n  America's relations with Lithuania continue to be strong, friendly \nand mutually beneficial. Lithuania has enjoyed Most-Favored-Nation \n(MFN) treatment with the United States since December, 1991. Through \n1996, the United States has committed over $100 million to Lithuania's \neconomic and political transformation and to address humanitarian \nneeds. In 1994, the United States and Lithuania signed an agreement of \nbilateral trade and intellectual property protection, and in 1997 a \nbilateral investment treaty.\n  In 1998 the United States and Lithuania signed The Baltic Charter \nPartnership. That charter recalls the history of American relations \nwith the area and underscores our ``real, profound, and enduring'' \ninterest in the security and independence of the three Baltic states. \nAs the Charter also notes, our interest in a Europe whole and free will \nnot be ensured until Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are secure.\n  Mr. President, I commend the people of Lithuania for their courage \nand perseverance in using peaceful means to regain their independence. \nI pledge to work with my colleagues to continue working to secure the \nfreedom and independence of Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors, and I \njoin with the people of Lithuania as they celebrate their \nindependence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S299-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S299-S300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNITION OF THE NACHES VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL LEADERSHIP CLASS\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to debate \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the coming weeks, one of \nthe topics we will no doubt address is this issue of school safety.\n  I want to recognize the extraordinary efforts of a group of students \nand teachers in eastern Washington in addressing violent crime in their \ncommunity and making their school a safer place for all students. The \nLeadership Class at Naches Valley High School has done an excellent job \nat incorporating creative solutions and programs to curb gang activity \nand encourage fellow students to do well in school. For their efforts, \nI am presenting these students and their teacher, Mr. Sanford Jetton \nwith my ``Innovation in Education'' award.\n  Naches Valley is a rural school district at the foot of the eastern \nside of the Cascade Mountains. For years, Naches Valley High School \nreflected the small community values with little conflict between \nstudents. In 1996, it discovered it was not immune from the problems \nthat are common-place in most large urban schools--gangs, drugs, \ndepression, crime, to name a few.\n  When the high school had its first incident of gang violence, \nstudents in the Leadership class were both frightened and angry. While \nsuch a reaction would be expected, their response was anything but \ntypical. Not only did the students confront the gang members, \nchallenging them to be positive contributors to the school atmosphere, \nbut they proactively worked with their principal, their Leadership \nteacher Sanford Jetton, the Mayor, and the deputies from the sheriff's \ndepartment to address the problem.\n  The students helped write a town ordinance which declared the local \npark to be part of the school grounds for an hour before and an hour \nafter school, or whenever that park is being used for school \nactivities. This allows for disruptive students to be dealt with both \nby law enforcement and the school's own ``zero tolerance'' gang policy.\n  As a result of this direct intervention, most of the gang members \nrelinquished that affiliation and eventually graduated from Naches. In \naddition, there have been no further incidences of gang violence at \nNaches Valley High School since 1996.\n  The Leadership class did not stop with the problem of gang violence. \nIts members looked for innovative ways to promote drug and violence \nprevention through school and community service. The list of student-\ninitiated accomplishments is quite impressive:\n  The class established a Student Accountability Board (S.A.B.) which \nprovides alternative consequences for students pulled over by the \nsheriff's office for traffic violations. The S.A.B. has resulted in a \n50 percent reduction in traffic citations. Seat belt use among students \nhas also risen from 63 percent in 1997 to 93 percent in 1999.\n  Working with the University of Washington, the class prepared a \nsuicide awareness program which has since spread to six other schools.\n  The class initiated a ``Student Sharing Solutions'' program which \nteams up schools throughout the Yakima Valley for such events as a \ncountrywide graffiti paint-out.\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\n  The class has also taken the lead in such projects as replenishing \nlocal food banks and in raising money for a fellow NVHS student who was \nseverely injured in a car crash and whose family has no medical \ninsurance.\n  These young leaders, and their teacher have been recognized in their \ncommunity at problem solvers and generous servants. In 1998, the Naches \nValley Leadership Class received the Greater Yakima Chamber of Commerce \nService Award.\n  As the Senate prepares to take on the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, I believe we in Congress would \ndo well to trust students and teachers, like Sanford Jetton and his \nLeadership class with more freedom and flexibility to create these \ntypes of innovative programs.\n  That is why I have introduced my Straight A's education bill to give \nparents, teachers, principals, superintendents and school board members \nwith the flexibility to make the best decisions about how to educate \nour children and provide measures to keep states accountable for the \nresults.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S300-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SUPER BOWL CHAMPION, ST. LOUIS RAMS\n\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nrise today with my distinguished colleagues to support the pending \nresolution and express my sincere congratulations to the Super Bowl \nXXXIV Champion St. Louis Rams. In the aftermath of a heart-stopping NFC \ndivision victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and an outstanding \nregular season record of 13 wins and 3 losses, the St. Louis Rams \nincreased their intensity to win Super Bowl XXXIV, bringing home the \nmost priced possession in the National Football League, the Lombardi \nTrophy. In an extraordinary effort and show of heart, the Rams \ncountered the incredible second-half push by the Tennessee Titans in a \ngame that more than lived up to its billing of ``Super'' and made \nhistory on Sunday, January 30, 2000, by pulling out a thrilling victory \nby the score of 23-16, becoming the Super Bowl XXXIV Champions.\n  This was Coach Dick Vermeil's third year as head coach of the Rams. \nCoach Vermeil previously led the Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl \nin 1980, but had been away from coaching for almost 15 years. The \npassionate 63-year-old coach showed he still had the stuff it takes to \nlead this team of stars to the championship. The fans of professional \nfootball have appropriately awarded Coach Vermeil by voting him the \nStaples Coach of the Year, the only NFL honor determined solely by a \nvote of the fans.\n  The three-year path to glory began slowly, with 9 wins and 23 losses \nover the previous two seasons, including just 4 victories last season, \nbut the team turned it around this year. While the Rams were truly a \nteam that played well together all year, this triumphant season can be \nattributed to the performance of several key players, including six \nplayers that were chosen to start in the Pro Bowl.\n  Kurt Warner, stepping in as the starter after Trent Green was injured \nin an early preseason game, enjoyed one of the best years ever for an \nNFL quarterback, throwing for 4,353 yards, 41 touchdowns and only 13 \ninterceptions, a performance worthy of being awarded the NFL's Most \nValuable Player and the Pro Bowl starting quarterback. This remarkable \nindividual, in just his second season in the NFL, was bagging groceries \nin Waterloo, Iowa, just five years ago. While setting passing and \nscoring records in the Arena Football League for 3 seasons and 1 season \nin the NFL Europe, he never gave up his dream of playing in the NFL. \nLast night, he helped to bring the dream of a Super Bowl championship \nhome to St. Louis.\n  Marshall Faulk, one of the league's premier running backs, set an NFL \nrecord this season for combined rushing and receiving yards from the \nline of scrimmage in a single season with 2,429, in addition to scoring \n12 touchdowns. He was also chosen to start in the Pro Bowl.\n  All season long, the team benefited from a stellar group of talented \nreceivers, led by Isaac Bruce, who will join his teammates in the Pro \nBowl; Torry Holt; Az-zahir Hakim; and Ricky Proehl. Proehl, you may \nremember, caught a clutch game-winning touchdown in the closing minutes \nof the Rams' win last week over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while Bruce \nmade a truly spectacular play in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl \nby catching a 73 yard touchdown pass that sealed the championship. \nThese stars helped the Rams to establish early on that they were an \noffensive-minded team, scoring a total of 526 points this season, the \nthird-most in NFL history.\n  But as the saying goes, ``Defense wins championships,'' and the Rams \nproved this adage, by leading the NFL in rushing defense, and ranking \nsixth in the league in overall defense. This season, the Rams' \ndefensive end, Kevin Carter, led the league with 17 quarterback sacks \nand earned his first start in the Pro Bowl. After only 5 years in the \nleague, this outstanding defender has developed a well-documented work \nethic that has helped him achieve more sacks over the past two seasons \nthan anyone else in the league.\n  We all know that to be champions requires a strong commitment to work \nharder and be more disciplined than the rest. The Rams' Super Bowl win \nis a credit to the extraordinary efforts by the entire Rams' \norganization. After moving to St. Louis in 1995, the management went to \nwork in hiring excellent personnel and a committed coaching staff. This \nseason, the organization's slogan was aptly and accurately versed: \n``Gotta go to work!'' With the whole organization working as one \ncohesive unit and regularly working well beyond the hours of 9 to 5, \nthey showed us just how much can be accomplished when everyone works \ntogether for a common goal and is committed to doing more than his or \nher fair share.\n  We would be remiss if we overlooked another admirable quality of this \nfine organization, and that is the commitment to the community. When \nthe Rams relocated to St. Louis in 1995, the team identified community \ninvolvement as one of the top priorities. Since that time, many \ncharitable organizations have benefited from the time and resources of \nthese big-hearted athletes, as various Rams players have dedicated \ndollars for every touchdown, interception, field goal, sack and more. \nSome examples of how these stars contribute to the community include:\n  1. The defense live--donating $500 for every quarterback sack to a \nlocal homeless shelter.\n  2. Wide receive Isaac Bruce--donating $500 for every touchdown to \nEdgewood's Childhaven, an educational center for children with learning \ndisabilities.\n  3. Running back Marshall Faulk--continuing the ``Marshall Plan'' that \nbegan in Indianapolis by donating $2,000 for every touchdown that he \nscores to the Marshall Faulk Foundation.\n  4. Quarterback Trent Green--donating $300 for every Rams passing \ntouchdown to the Trent Green Family Foundation.\n  5. Safety Keith Syle--donating $500 for every interception to local \nliteracy programs.\n  6. Kicker Jeff Wilkins--donating $50 for every field goal to Cardinal \nGlennon Children's Hospital.\n  7. Tight end Roland Williams--donating $86 for every catch to the \nRoland Williams Youth Life Line Foundation which supports children in \nRoland's hometown.\n  Most of these players have also been successful in receiving matching \ncommitments from local businesses and individuals, helping to foster a \ntrue sense of community. In addition, each year, players make countless \nappearances at local schools, hospitals and youth centers to use their \ninfluence with children to stress the importance of education and \nmaking proper choices in life.\n  The hard work and dedication of the Rams to their team and the people \nof the St. Louis metropolitan area deserves our highest commendations. \nSo, on behalf of myself and the good people of my state of Illinois, I \ncongratulate Coach Dick Vermeil, Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Kurt \nWarner, Marshall Faulk, Isaac Bruce, and the entire St. Louis Rams team \non an outstanding performance.\n  Coach Vermeil, players, and fans: congratulations on a great season \nand an outstanding victory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S300-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S300-S301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE ST. LOUIS RAMS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, On January 30th, the St. Louis Rams \nfaced the\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\nTennessee Titans in one of the most spectacular Super Bowls ever. Both \nteams played valiantly, and in the end, the Rams were triumphant.\n  The Rams' victory in Super Bowl XXXIV was the only fitting ending for \na season that one expects to find in a movie script. From day one, the \nRams' motto was ``Gotta Go To Work.'' Embracing that attitude, the Rams \nposted one of the best seasons ever. Quarterback Kurt Warner, the \nregular season and Super Bowl MVP, came from bagging groceries and \nplaying in the arena football league to lead his team to the most \ncoveted prize in football. He became only the second man ever to throw \n40 or more touchdown passes in one season. Runningback Marshall Faulk \nset a new record for total yards from scrimmage. The offense scored 526 \npoints, the third highest total ever. Head Coach Dick Vermeil was named \nthe NFL's coach of the year. Six Rams were chosen to start in the Pro \nBowl. The team's defense was top rated in the NFL against the run.\n  Perhaps even more impressive than the Rams' regular season was their \nperformance in the Super Bowl. The Rams, living their slogan ``Gotta Go \nTo Work,'' played like a team possessed. Warner set a new Super Bowl \nrecord with 414 yards passing. Wide receiver Isaac Bruce caught a 73-\nyard touchdown pass. Wide receiver Torry Holt set a rookie record with \n7 catches for 109 yards--and a touchdown. The defense, led by defensive \nend Kevin Carter and linebacker London Fletcher, never yielded for a \nmoment. When their backs were up against the wall, linebacker Mike \nJones heroically tackled the Tennessee Titan's wide receiver Kevin \nDyson to seal the victory.\n  My congratulations go out to the Rams players, the coaching staff, \nand the loyal St. Louis fans, who have supported the Rams in \nanticipation of this moment.\n  The spirit of the St. Louis Rams provides an example for St. Louis, \nand all of America, of how to live and work. I commend Kurt Warner, \nIsaac Bruce, Mike Jones and all of the Rams for the sense of unity and \npride they have brought to St. Louis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S301-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CLOTURE VOTE VITIATED--S. 1287\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today as part of my \non-going work to ensure that the city of Seattle gets the money it \nshould receive for security costs incurred during the 1999 World Trade \nOrganization Ministerial.\n  Mr. President, I have been working with the city of Seattle, the \nadministration, and others on this issue for more than a year and let \nme say that I welcome Senator Gorton's interest in this topic earlier \ntoday.\n  Actually, back in 1994, I worked to resolve a similar problem \nassociated with Seattle's hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic \nCooperation forum. In 1994, working with the Clinton administration, we \nwere able to provide the\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\ncity of Seattle with close to $1 million for APEC related costs.\n  Mr. President, for the record, I want to walk my colleagues through \nsome of the history of the issue of the funding of the WTO that was \ndiscussed on the floor earlier today.\n  From the moment Seattle was awarded the WTO Ministerial meeting, I \nworked with the city of Seattle and others to ensure Seattle was given \nan opportunity to successfully host the WTO. For almost a year, I met \nwith the city, the Seattle Host Organization, our Trade Representative \nCharlene Barshefsky and others within the executive branch. At every \nopportunity, I stressed the importance of supporting the city of \nSeattle in its efforts to provide the necessary security arrangements \nto the delegates and other WTO visitors.\n  The Clinton administration--in its fiscal year 2000 budget--requested \n$2 million in State Department money for WTO related expenses. This \nrequest was formulated months before a U.S. host city for the WTO was \nselected. From the very beginning, the Washington congressional \ndelegation and WTO organizers in Washington state realized this request \nwould be inadequate.\n  Beginning in March of 1999, with my appropriations request letter to \nthe Commerce, Justice, State appropriations subcommittee, I encouraged \nthe Congress to provide $5 million to the State Department for WTO \nrelated expenses. And I urged the Congress to essentially earmark one-\nhalf of this money for Seattle to meet a portion of the WTO security \nexpenses.\n  The Senate Commerce, Justice, State bill did provide the State \nDepartment with $5 million for WTO related expenses, but the House \nversion did not. During the conference report, I worked with my \nWashington state congressional colleagues to protect the $5 million in \nnew WTO money.\n  Unfortunately, the original CJS conference report did not provide new \nmoney. Instead, it said the State Department could take up to $5 \nmillion for existing accounts and move them over to be used for WTO \nexpenses.\n  When I saw that language, I was concerned. To me, it increased the \nlikelihood that the State Department would not assist Seattle with WTO \nsecurity related costs. Fortunately, as often happens with \nappropriations bills, the final product is a compromise between the \nCongress and the administration.\n  On several occasions, I continued to express to the administration \nthe need for securing $5 million in new money--rather than relying on \nthe State Department to move old money around.\n  Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter dated September 28, 1999.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the \n         Judiciary, Senate Appropriations committee, The Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: As you know, the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) Ministerial will be held in Seattle later \n     this year. The Seattle Host Organization is busy preparing to \n     host the largest trade meeting ever held in the United \n     States. About 5,000 official delegates from 135 nations as \n     well as thousands of reporters, demonstrators and other \n     interested parties will converge on Seattle to participate in \n     WTO Ministerial events. In addition, President Clinton and \n     numerous heads of state are expected to attend the meetings \n     and play an active role in the Ministerial.\n       The City of Seattle and other local law enforcement \n     officials are spending considerable time and resources \n     preparing for the numerous security issues associated with \n     the high-profile event. The Senate-passed fiscal year 2000 \n     Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations Act provides $5 \n     million to the State Department for WTO-related expenses. \n     This is the only federal contribution directed to the WTO \n     Ministerial. The House bill, unfortunately, did not include \n     any federal commitment for WTO expenses. In conference, I \n     strongly encourage you to protect the Senate's $5 million WTO \n     appropriation. Additionally, I urge you to include the \n     following report language in the conference report.\n       ``Requested Conference Report language: The conference \n     recommendation directs that $5 million be made available from \n     this account for the costs associated with hosting the World \n     Trade Organization conference in Seattle, WA and that 50% of \n     such funds be allocated for reimbursement, through the City \n     of Seattle, of local law enforcement and fire agencies for \n     costs incurred in providing security for the meeting, \n     including costs for overtime and motorcade expenses.''\n       I look forward to your continued attention and support for \n     this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Patty Murray,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This letter was written to the Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations Committee and in close consultation with WTO organizers \nin Seattle, including the City of Seattle. Unfortunately, despite \nefforts by my office and the City of Seattle, no other Senators signed \nthe letter urging the Appropriations Committee to provide the WTO \nfunding, as well as earmark funds for the City of Seattle.\n  I worked to make it a bipartisan letter. Perhaps if other Senators \nhad signed the letter when I asked last year, we would have been able \nto provide earmark money for Seattle and avoid part of the problem now \nfacing my state, as was discussed by my colleague from Washington \nearlier today.\n  The WTO was a difficult period for my constituents. We are continuing \nto deal with the many issues raised for our state during the \nministerial. The city of Seattle and other local governments have been \nforced to bear $12 million in security costs. this is a far higher cost \nthan anyone anticipated. It threatens to force other budget cuts to \nmake up for the State Department's refusal to work with my \nconstituents.\n  Congress--with strong assistance from the President and Vice \nPresident--did provide $5 million in WTO money. The issue before us now \nis between my constituents--who have been asked to absorb virtually all \nWTO security costs--and the State Department.\n  Obviously, this issue will not go away. And I have already begun to \nwork with the administration to get further support in forcing the \nState Department to assume some responsibility for the $12 million in \nWTO security costs.\n  Now is not the time for the State Department to discredit or deny the \nlegitimate issues raised by my constituents. And now is not the time to \npoliticize an issue that remains difficult and volatile for my \nconstituents. Seattle and Washington state want to heal the WTO wounds\n  This administration has been enormously helpful to Washington state \ninterests. Across the board, the President and the Vice President, have \nboth devoted time, energy and resources to Washington state's problems \nfighting for jobs for aerospace workers, supporting our high tech \neconomy, devoting new resources to environmental problems, and \naddressing our difficult transportation problems are all examples of \nthe close working relationship between this administration and \nWashington state.\n  And I expect the same degree of support in trying to resolve the \ncurrent problem on WTO security related costs incurred by the city of \nSeattle and other local governments in Washington state.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in working with \nthe administration to address this very difficult problem. The best way \nto do this is through cooperation--by trying to convince the State \nDepartment that in hosting international events, we must be careful not \nto ask local governments to assume costs that are clearly federal \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I will continue my efforts to ensure that the city of \nSeattle and other local governments are not left holding the bag, and \nonce again, I welcome my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/02/senate-section/article/S302-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
