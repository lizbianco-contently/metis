All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no objection, the Journal of \nproceedings of the trial are approved to date.\n  The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, we are now prepared to \nhear arguments regarding the subpoenaing of witnesses and the taking of \ntheir depositions. I understand the House managers will submit the list \nand begin their argument; the White House counsel will then state their \narguments, with the House managers making the final closing statement. \nThis period has been limited to 4 hours instead of the 6 hours that had \nbeen earlier indicated.\n  I also expect a motion may be offered again to close the session with \nregard to deliberations by the Senators. I need some further \nconsultation with Senator Daschle to confirm that. It could be that we \ncould work it out without having to do the recorded vote. Therefore, \nvotes could occur this evening--probably between 4:30 p.m. and 5 \no'clock.\n  As always, we expect to take a break after about an hour and a half \nin the proceedings, and it may be a little bit longer than usual, so \nthat if Senators were not able to grab a quick bite, they might be able \nto grab a little something in the cloakroom during that first break. So \nit might be a little longer than ordinary. And I expect that will occur \nsometime around 1:30 approximately.\n  Before we begin, since I see that there are still a few Senators who \nare not in the Chamber, I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. Chief \nJustice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. If all Senators, counsel and managers would return to their \ndesks, I believe we are ready to begin.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, again, just for the information of all Senators, \nwhat happens next is I believe that a manager will be recognized on \nbehalf of the House to present a motion with regard to subpoenaing \nwitnesses and then the presentations will begin first by the House \nmanagers and then by the White House counsel and then closed by the \nHouse managers to be spread over 4 hours, but that at approximately \n1:30 we will take a break so that we can assess how to proceed the \nbalance of the day, and perhaps even get a bite to eat if Senators \nhadn't had that opportunity. It won't be an extended break, but it will \nbe longer than normal.\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\n  I believe we are ready to proceed, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Bryant on behalf \nof the House managers.\n\n\n      Motion for Appearance of Witnesses and Admission of Evidence\n\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice, I have a motion to present.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The manager will send the motion to the desk. The \nclerk will read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion of the United States House of Representatives for \n     the appearance of witnesses at a deposition and to admit \n     evidence not in the Record.\n\n       Now comes the United States House of Representatives, by \n     and through its duly authorized Managers, and respectfully \n     submits to the United States Senate its motion for the \n     appearance of witnesses at a deposition and to admit evidence \n     not in the record in connection with the Impeachment Trial of \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n       The House moves that the Senate authorize and issue \n     subpoenas for the appearance of the following witnesses at a \n     deposition for the purpose of providing testimony related to \n     the Impeachment Trial:\n       1. Monica S. Lewinsky;\n       2. Vernon Jordan; and\n       3. Sidney Blumenthal.\n       Further, the House moves that the Senate admit into \n     evidence the following material not currently in the record:\n       1. the affidavit of Barry Ward, Law Clerk to the Honorable \n     Susan Webber Wright, U.S. District Court Judge for the \n     Eastern District of Arkansas;\n       2. the sworn declaration of T. Wesley Holmes, and \n     attachments thereto; and\n       3. certain telephone records which document conversations \n     between Monica S. Lewinsky and William Jefferson Clinton, \n     including a 56-minute exchange on December 6, 1997.\n       Additionally, the House petitions the Senate to request the \n     appearance of William Jefferson Clinton, President of the \n     United States, at a deposition, for the purpose of providing \n     testimony related to the Impeachment Trial.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to Senate Resolution 16, as modified by \nthe order of January 25, the managers on the part of the House of \nRepresentatives and counsel for the President each have 2 hours to \npresent their arguments on this motion.\n  The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Bryant.\n  Mr. Manager McCollum.\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Senate, we are here today to \nargue for the presentation of witnesses, and I want to state at the \noutset a couple of observations of mine regarding this.\n  The House managers have always understood the Senate's sense of the \nrules on these matters, and we don't question that fact. But I think it \nis important, to set the record clear here today, to say at the outset \nthat we have always believed, and we still do believe, that 10 or 12 \nwitnesses are what we should have and should have been permitted to \ncall to prove our case. We have estimated that this could be done in a \nmatter of 2 weeks at the outside, including all cross-examination. That \nis what we think the normal order would have been; it is what we think \nit should have been. But we have been told again and again, and we \nbelieve it is true, that if we made such a request it would not be \napproved. And a few weeks ago we thought--maybe even a few days ago--\nthat we could submit a list of maybe five or six witnesses and there \nwould be a reasonable chance that for deposition they would be approved \nand maybe two or three of them actually could be presented here live in \nthe Chamber.\n  Now we have been led to believe, and we think it is an accurate \nassessment, that in order to get a vote to approve the opportunity to \ntake depositions alone, whether or not anyone is called, we cannot \nsubmit more than two or three witnesses to you.\n  That is what we have done today. We have submitted a motion for \nsimply three witnesses: Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney \nBlumenthal.\n  The two people who know the most about this are Monica Lewinsky and \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton, and while we have not submitted to \nyou today the name of President Clinton in our motion, we strongly urge \nthat if you allow us to have witnesses, which we believe you should, \nthat you, in addition--or even if you don't--on your own call President \nClinton here to testify. We think that it is exceedingly important that \nyou have an opportunity, we have an opportunity for you to examine him \nand these other witnesses to get at the truth of this matter and to end \nall the speculation that would resolve this matter and let you draw the \nproper inferences and conclusions.\n  I will simply say that I am going to make a brief outline of the \nmatter of why we should have witnesses for you, the three we are asking \nfor, and I will be followed in order, so you can get some sequence to \nthis, by Manager Bryant, who will discuss in detail the reason why we \nthink it is appropriate to call specifically Monica Lewinsky; Manager \nHutchinson, who will discuss Mr. Jordan as a witness; and Manager \nRogan, who will discuss Mr. Blumenthal.\n  If our motion is granted--I want to make this very, very clear--at no \npoint will we ask any questions of Monica Lewinsky about her explicit \nsexual relations with the President, either in deposition or, if we are \npermitted, on the floor of the Senate. They will not be asked. That, of \ncourse, assumes that White House counsel does not enter into that \ndiscussion, and we doubt that they would.\n\n  Secondly, we do not see why the entire process of deposing and \ncalling all of these witnesses right here live would have to take more \nthan just a very few days, 2, 3, 4, 5, maybe early next week at the \nlatest. There is no reason why it has to be longer than that. We \nabsolutely reject the argument that some were making--and I do not know \nwhy they were making it--that somehow, if we have a single witness out \nhere, it is going to mean weeks and weeks of protracted delay in this \ntrial.\n  That is not so, and certainly not so with the three witnesses we are \nasking you today to permit us to present.\n  I also want to address the argument that has been made by some that \nwitnesses should only be permitted if there is new evidence.\n  Now, we believe, we managers, that we will present to you new \nevidence with the witnesses that we have asked you to let us depose, \nbut think through this with me for one moment. Under the rules you have \nset up, if we take depositions, which we are required to do, of every \none of these witnesses, at the end of the day when those depositions \nare completed, all the new evidence that we could imagine certainly \nwill be--from those three witnesses--in those depositions, and the \nargument will be made, I am sure, that there is no reason to have a \nlive witness out here at all.\n  That had to be a preconceived notion by somebody who thought of that \nin the first place. If that is the argument, that should not be the \nstandard. It should be one of the standards but not the standard, not \nthe sole standard. There is a lot more to a witness, and the reason why \nyou need to have a witness out here, than simply new evidence.\n  In real criminal trials, virtually all witnesses are deposed before \nthey are brought to trial, and then the counsel on each side decide \nwhich witnesses they will call. They are called. They are examined. \nThey are cross-examined. And unless a witness is deceased or laid up or \nthere is some other extraordinary reason why that witness isn't there, \nespecially a key witness, then the witness normally is here live.\n  It is especially true in a case like this where much of the evidence, \nnot necessarily all of it--there is quite a bit of direct evidence--but \nmuch of the evidence is circumstantial and requires you to draw, as \nmany finders of fact do all across this country every day, inferences \nand conclusions that involve the credibility of the witness, that \ninvolve the way it is said, that involve inflections and spontaneity of \nthe witness, the exchange of the counsel asking the question and the \nwitness, and a description and flavor of which you simply can't get \nwithout having the person here to observe.\n  That is what jurors do all the time. I think it is especially \nimportant, as well, because there is conflicting testimony.\n  Now, I do not suppose we have a stand here today, but you have in \nfront of you a credibility of witness instruction I think we passed \nout. We would like for you to keep it. It is a credibility of witness \ninstruction that--here it is over here on this side. It is a \ncredibility of witness instruction that is\n\n[[Page S993]]\n\nlonger than that. I just excerpted a part of it and put it up here on \nthis board. I know you can't all see that but you should have this \nsheet. If you don't, please ask for it. This is a jury instruction that \nis given in the District of Columbia. It is something that is given \nhere as a part of our Federal system. And it is important, I think, for \nthis particular paragraph, to read it, to understand it, because you \nwouldn't even write this jury instruction if you didn't expect to have \nlive witnesses:\n\n       In reaching a conclusion as to the credibility of any \n     witness, you may consider any matter that may have a bearing \n     on the subject.\n\n  That is part of the instruction.\n\n       You may consider the demeanor and behavior of the witness.\n\n  I think that is important. It is the third paragraph you looked at, \nthe bottom paragraph.\n\n       You may consider the demeanor and the behavior of the \n     witness on the witness stand; the witness' manner of \n     testifying; whether the witness impresses you as a truthful \n     person; whether the witness impresses you as having an \n     accurate memory and recollection; whether the witness has any \n     motive for not telling the truth; whether the witness had a \n     full opportunity to observe the matters about which he or she \n     has testified; whether the witness has any interest in the \n     outcome of this case or friendship or hostility toward other \n     people concerned with this case.\n\n  Demeanor, manner, truthfulness, how the witness impresses you--if you \ndon't have that witness here, and it is a critical witness, there is no \nway as a trier of fact you can make those judgments fairly. There just \nisn't any way. We think that it is terribly critical, not only that we \nare permitted to depose these witnesses, but with respect particularly \nto Monica Lewinsky and perhaps all three of them, that we be permitted \nto bring those witnesses here at the end of the day and examine them \nand let the President's counsel examine them.\n  The arguments of the President's counsel have been, to some extent, \nto you and to me--and I have heard it repeated several times--that \nsomehow circumstantial evidence is not that important, that it is \nsomehow inferior to direct evidence. I am not going to pass out a jury \ninstruction on that again. You have already heard us talk about that. \nThe reality is the jury instruction, if we passed one out to you today, \nwould say exactly what we said before: Circumstantial evidence is given \nthe same weight, the same weight as direct evidence. Inferences have to \nbe drawn.\n  I don't know any case in this country in a criminal matter--or \nrarely; I should not say ``any.'' I suppose there is a confession that \nalways you get once in a while and you read about it in the paper. But \nin almost every criminal case, you have to draw inferences; there has \nto be circumstantial evidence of some sort. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. President's counsel has said that somehow the nature of the \nevidence means that you should automatically acquit him. I just don't \nbuy that at all.\n  What are inferences? Let's put inferences up for a second so you can \nlook at that. Inferences are on this side. This is another jury \ninstruction. I don't know if you have got this one, but we will give it \nto you. This is another one that is given out:\n\n       An inference is a deduction or a conclusion which you . . . \n     as finders of facts--are permitted to draw . . . from \n     the facts which have been established by either direct or \n     circumstantial evidence. In drawing inferences you should \n     exercise your common sense. . . . You are permitted to \n     draw from the facts which you find to be proven, such \n     reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of \n     your experience.\n\n  A few days ago one of the White House counsel, Mr. Kendall, attempted \nto make you think it was very difficult to prove a crime by \ncircumstantial evidence. You may remember Mr. Kendall told the story \nabout a fellow who came out of his house one morning and he saw his \ndriveway was wet and he immediately thought it must have rained last \nnight. But, Mr. Kendall said, this man noticed right after that that \nhis neighbor's water sprinkler was dripping and he thought, well, maybe \nthe water sprinkler caused it to be wet. And he used that \nillustration--ended the story right there--of how difficult \ncircumstantial evidence is and how likely you might draw the wrong \nconclusion from inferences.\n  Mr. Kendall didn't allow you to proceed with the next commonsense \nstep that shows how powerful circumstantial evidence can be. Let's \nsuppose the man got up in the morning, he walked out of his house, he \nsaw that his driveway was wet, he thought maybe it had rained. He \nimmediately observed the water sprinkler was dripping. He thought, \nwell, maybe the water sprinkler caused it and he looked down the street \nthen and looked at not only his neighbor's sidewalk where it was wet as \nwell as his, and the driveway, but he looked at his neighbor's. And he \nlooked at several others all around his neighborhood and they were dry.\n  The obvious conclusion from circumstantial evidence is the neighbor's \nwater sprinkler caused his sidewalk or his driveway to be wet and it \ndidn't rain. It is a kind of a reasonable, commonsense, inferential, \ncircumstantial conclusion you are allowed to draw. You are the finders \nof fact, and I think that that suggestion was wrong.\n  But this is why we need witnesses. You need to be able to see the \ntemperament, you need to be able to have the background, you need to be \nable to have the feel or the flavor to draw those inferences properly.\n  In the impeachment case before you, you have both direct and \ncircumstantial evidence that the President engaged in a pattern of \nobstruction, perjury, and witness tampering designed to deny the court \nin the Jones case what Judge Wright had determined that Jones had a \nright to discover in order to prove her claim. You have to use your \ncommon sense to get at this. Seeing, hearing, observing those live \nwitnesses is important.\n  If you remember at the outset of this case, at the outset of these \nproceedings, I tried to draw your attention to what this was about in a \nnutshell. Some have said it is a theory of the case. The White House \nwants to call it speculation. It is not speculation. It is what, from \nall the evidence--especially once you have heard Monica Lewinsky and \nVernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal, I think adding the flavor that you \nneed to have, adding the body language you need to observe, adding the \ncredibility that you need to establish in this--I think that is the \nproper inference and the proper conclusion you need to draw.\n  What was that nutshell? I won't bore you with going into every detail \nagain, but I want to remind you what the record, we think, shows that \nthis additional witness presentation would augment and be very \nimportant to. It shows the President had a well-thought-out scheme. He \nresented the Jones lawsuit. He was alarmed when Monica Lewinsky's name \nappeared on the witness list and even more alarmed when Judge Wright \nissued her order signaling the court would hear the evidence of the \nrelationship.\n\n  To keep his relationship with Monica Lewinsky from the court once it \nwas apparent to him he was going to have to testify, he knew he would \nhave to lie to the court. To succeed at this, he decided he had to get \nMonica Lewinsky to file a false affidavit to try to avoid her \ntestifying. He needed to get her a job to make her happy, to make sure \nshe executed the affidavit and then stick with her lies if questioned.\n  Then the gifts were subpoenaed. He had to have her hide the gifts, \nthe only tangible evidence that could link him to her. She came up with \nthe idea of giving them to Betty Currie and the President seized on \nthat. Who would think to ask Betty? Then he would be free to lie to the \ncourt in the deposition. But after this, he realized he had to make \nsure Betty would lie and cover for him. He got his aides convinced to \nrepeat his lies to the grand jury and the public, and all this worked \nuntil the dress showed up. Then he lied to the grand jury to try to \ncover up and explain away his prior crimes.\n  The President knowingly, intentionally, willfully set out on a course \nof conduct in December 1997 to lie to the Jones court, to hide his \nrelationship, and to encourage others to lie and hide evidence to \nconceal the relationship with Monica Lewinsky from the court.\n  That is the straightforward case that we presented. It is there. But \nit is very important that you recognize this is not speculation but it \nis supported by the evidence. But it needs to have the witnesses here.\n  I am not going to go into every one of the articles. I am not going \nto go over all that again. You have them in\n\n[[Page S994]]\n\nfront of you. But you know there are four provisions, four different \nprovisions of the perjury article, and there are seven counts in the \nobstruction article. And, in addition to the seven counts, we believe \nyou have the right to consider the lies the President made in the civil \nPaula Jones deposition as a part of his obstruction of justice, as \nwritten in the body of that article.\n  Why do I raise what is there on the table? Well, you can find the \nPresident guilty of any one of the perjury or obstruction of justice \ncharges. In our judgment, if you find him guilty of any one, you can \nconvict him and you can remove him from office. We think that is \nappropriate. We think that you should, that every one of them rises to \nthat level.\n  I want to make a point to you, too, for example, about the first one \nin the perjury, about the nature and details of his relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky. Let's just say for a minute, so you will get this one \nclear, if I could beg your indulgence, there were a lot of questions \nraised out here about particular statements that might be perjurious, \nsome of which may have sounded a little bit more stretched to you than \nothers did. But the body and the gravamen of that is that they are all \ngrand jury perjury about that relationship. Cumulatively, that is what \nyou are voting on. You are not voting on each and every one of these; \nparticularly ``the'' singular lie that hangs the President of the \nUnited States. And there are four--there are three more in addition to \nthat to look at. So, please, look at all of them.\n  We also strongly believe that each of these constitutes high crimes \nand misdemeanors. It is very hard for us to conceive that there is a \ndifferent standard for impeaching the President and impeaching a judge. \nWe know that has been argued to you out here, but it is very hard for \nus to conceive of this. On the other hand, I am aware that many of you \nbelieve, and I am sure some of you at least do--I hope it is not many, \nbut I said many--that no matter whether or not the President is guilty \nof the perjury and obstruction of justice, everything that is in here \nin great detail, everything we have told you, there are some of you who \nbelieve that none of that rises to the level of a high crime and \nmisdemeanor and that the President should not be removed from office.\n  On the other hand, I think that the majority of you do believe that, \nif the President committed all of this, surely it would rise to the \nlevel of high crimes and misdemeanors. How can you leave a man in \noffice who is President of the United States who has so intentionally, \nthrough his scheme that he has concocted to deny the court justice, \ndeny information to a person who is trying to plead their case, gone \nthrough it systematically and lied again and again and again and then \nwent intentionally, calculatingly, and lied to the grand jury about it \nagain?\n  It is very hard to conceive of that. But I also suspect that most of \nyou at the end of the day will question some of these and, as I said \nearlier, you don't have to conclude that he committed all of them to \nconvict him, certainly not to find him guilty of the charges, but \nsomewhere in between. Is it 50 percent of them? Is it seven-eighths of \nthem? How many of them does it take? What is the weight for some of \nyou? Each one of you will be judging this differently.\n  But in that process, there is no doubt in my mind that you need to go \nthrough the process of looking and hearing from these witnesses to make \nthat decision, and if you have a doubt, not in your own mind, maybe \nsome of you have no doubt at all that he is guilty of any and all of \nthese crimes, but if you think one of your other colleagues does have \nthat doubt at this moment, for gosh sakes, let's let the witnesses come \nhere and let us have the chance to erase that doubt in the way you \nnormally do in a trial.\n  For a few of the criminal charges under the articles of impeachment, \nunder both of them, it is our judgment that the President's guilt is so \nclear and convincing and compelling that we don't think that any \nwitnesses are needed to be called in deposition or in person.\n  First, contrary to the impressions that the White House counsel would \nlike to leave you, it should be clear to anybody reading the record \nthat the President committed perjury before the grand jury when he told \nthat he never touched certain body parts of Ms. Lewinsky, which \ntouching the President admitted would clearly be within the definition \nof sexual relations in the Jones case.\n  Ms. Lewinsky testified that he touched these parts on a number of \ndifferent occasions in a manner clearly within the President's \nunderstanding of that definition. The record contains testimony from at \nleast six different friends and counselors with whom Ms. Lewinsky spoke \nand described these details contemporaneously as they occurred.\n  White House counsel has repeatedly tried to dismiss this absolutely \nclear perjury by claiming that Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is \nuncorroborated and, therefore, you couldn't prove perjury to the court. \nThey say again and again and again, it is a ``he says-she says'' \nsituation.\n  This is a gross misstatement of the law. Even if there were no \ncorroborating witnesses--and there are in this case--a person could be \nand would be convicted of perjury before any court in this country \nbased on the evidence that is in this record now. We don't have to \nbring anything else in here, and we are not planning to do so to prove \nthat.\n  The law covering grand jury perjury, which has been on the books \nsince 1970, does not require a corroborating witness and does not \nrequire corroborating evidence. There are more than 100 people serving \nin Federal prison today who have been convicted under this 1970 grand \njury statute for perjury where it is one person's word against another, \nseveral of them for lies about sexual relations.\n  All you need to convict is to accept Monica Lewinsky had no motive to \nlie about this, the President did, and you have to draw the inferences \nyou logically can from the chain of events that are in this record. But \neven though you don't need any corroborating testimony, there is \ncorroborating testimony. There are the six people--friends and \ncounselors--with whom she talked about this contemporaneously. Again, \nthe White House counselors have tried to persuade you, wrongly, that \nyou should not consider this, that this would not be admissible, these \ncorroborating witnesses in any courtroom in the country, they say, and \nthat is not true.\n\n  There are at least three exceptions to the hearsay rule which would, \nin all probability, permit those prior consistent statements to come in \nand corroborate that testimony.\n  The bottom line is the perjury of the President in this case is as \nplain as day on the record, and we don't need to call any witnesses on \nthis matter. And we also believe there are a number of other perjuries \nin that grand jury, that I am not going to go into detail about, that \nare just as plain on the record. We don't need to call witnesses that \nhe perjured himself when he told the grand jury it was his goal to be \ntruthful in the Jones deposition. That is what he told the grand jury. \nIt was his goal to be truthful.\n  The record is replete with many lies that he told in that deposition \nand, in the face of telling the grand jury that his goal was to be \ntruthful, he committed perjury.\n  Nor do we believe that any witness needs to be called to further \nestablish the President's guilt of the crime that is obstruction of \njustice and witness tampering in the case where he met Betty Currie on \nthe day after his Jones deposition and suggested to her all those false \ndeclaratory statements that we have been over so many times in here.\n  Betty Currie's testimony in this matter is undisputed on the record. \nThe White House counsel's argument that the President was just \nrefreshing his memory is absurd on its face.\n  The same is true of the obstruction of justice and perjury charges \nrelated to allowing his attorney during the Jones deposition to make \nfalse and misleading statements with regard to Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit \nand then lying about not even paying attention to the attorneys' \nexchange with the judge on this matter. The record is clear. You \nwatched the videotape on it. Inferences are perfectly appropriate to be \ndrawn from body language. You saw it on the videotape. You saw it. No \nmore witnesses are needed. The President committed these crimes.\n\n[[Page S995]]\n\n  On the other hand, we believe that you do need--we need to bring in \nwitnesses to resolve conflicting testimony to give you a true picture \nof the President's scheme to lie and conceal evidence for the other \nobstruction of justice charges and certainly for the last perjury \ncharge. They are more complex. They are more dependent on \ncircumstantial evidence and inferences you logically have to draw. And \nthat is why you need to hear from Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and \nSidney Blumenthal, to tell you about these things themselves.\n  When you do, you are just plain going to get a different flavor; you \nare going to feel the sense of this. We believe you will find at the \nend of the day, once you have done that, even though you don't need to \nuse this standard, that the President is guilty of the entire scheme we \npresented to you in every detail beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  Remember, you don't need to convict him to find him guilty of all of \nthe crimes we have suggested by any stretch of the imagination. You \ndon't need to use the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. That is not \nrequired of you. But we can understand why many of you or some of you \nmight.\n  The reality is that we are in a position--you are in a position--\nwhere you need, though, to make these determinations, and to make them \nyou need to have the witnesses. In any courtroom where you are going to \ncertainly judge something beyond a reasonable doubt, you need to assess \nthe credibility of the witnesses where you have conflicting testimony.\n\n  One point in that regard, too, is, we have heard White House counsel \nsay a number of times that somehow the fact that there is so much \nconflicting testimony makes our case weaker. That is not so. Again, \nunless the bad guy admits he is guilty, when you go to trial in a \ncriminal case you always have conflicting testimony, at least you \ncertainly have the accused denying it, and very, very frequently, most \noften, you have a lot of other people who are conflicting.\n  The fact that there is conflict is something for the triers of fact \nto resolve, but, again, resolve by listening to the witnesses, checking \ntheir demeanor, watching their body language, determining their \ncredibility, feeling the case-flow, seeing how it fits together, \nwatching.\n  I am not going to be the one describing what Monica Lewinsky is going \nto show you if she comes in here. I am going to tell you, even if we \ndepose her, having had the opportunity to talk with this intelligent \nand very impressionable young woman the other day, I can tell you that \nshe herself will convey this story to you in a way that it cannot be \nconveyed off a piece of paper. It just cannot be.\n  I suppose that is why the White House counselors are so afraid of our \ncalling any witnesses. They don't want you to have the opportunity to \nsee that, an opportunity you can only get the full flavor of if not \nonly you let us take the depositions, but you at least let us call her \nlive here on the floor, preferably with our other two witnesses as \nwell.\n  They know that the written record conceals this. There is no way to \nlift that out. There is no way for you to see the relationship, how she \nresponds to the questions, how she answers, how she conducts herself in \nmaking it very apparent what the President's true meaning and intent \nwas.\n  If you remember, a lot of this is his state of mind. In the not too \ndistant future, Monica Lewinsky is going to be free of the gag order \nand is going to go out and talk to people freely. She should. At that \npoint in time, she is going to have the public judging her, and they \nare going to be judging this case, as will history, and I suggest that \nthe public at that point in history as well will be judging you and not \njudging the Senate well if it doesn't let her come here and testify.\n  Let me briefly turn to the last thing I want to do. I want to \ndescribe, so you know what it is, the three additional pieces of new \nevidence we would like admitted in this motion.\n  First is the affidavit of Barry W. Ward who had been a law clerk to \nJudge Wright during the consideration of the Jones case. None of this, \nI think, should be controversial, but we do have it, and I want to \ncover it briefly. In his affidavit, he attests to the fact that at \nPresident Clinton's deposition in the Jones case, that he, Mr. Ward, \nwas sitting at the conference table next to Judge Wright, that he was \nable to observe the colloquy between the judge and Mr. Bennett.\n  You recall, Mr. Bennett was engaged in this colloquy about the \naffidavit of Monica Lewinsky. And that is what you saw, the film \nfootage of the President and the questions. Was the President \nobservant? Was he watching? Was he keen? And that affidavit goes to \nthat point. And it is the testimony of Mr. Ward with regard to the fact \nthat the President was observant.\n  Secondly, we have a piece of new evidence, and that is the \ndeclaration of the Jones attorney, T. Wesley Holmes, and the attached \ncopies of the subpoena in that case, the subpoena in that case to Betty \nCurrie, dated January 22, 1998, along with proof of service, dated \nJanuary 27, 1998.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. It is my \nunderstanding that Senate Resolution 16 says----\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Vermont is advised it takes \nunanimous consent to allow a parliamentary inquiry in the proceeding.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chief Justice, I object to the references the manager \nis making to new information. It is my understanding that from Senate \nResolution 16, the material outside the record may only be presented in \nconnection with a motion to expand the record. This new information--we \nhave skirted it already with the Lewinsky interview this weekend, but \nnow the latest that Mr. Manager McCollum states, I would say \nrespectfully, expands that record and, indeed, we are not at that \npoint.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Yes. I think the motion that the managers have \nmade is a motion to authorize the presentation of evidence that is not \nin the record. And so I think that is a fair comment. I overrule the \nobjection.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chief Justice.\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The attachments to Mr. Holmes' declaration is the proof of the \nsubpoena being issued to Betty Currie in January, on January 22, 1998, \nalong with service in the Jones case on January 27, 1998, and a copy of \nthe supplemental witness list, including the name of Betty Currie, \nwhich was served on January 23, 1998. And in his declaration, Mr. \nHolmes explains that Ms. Currie was subpoenaed because of testimony \ngiven by President Clinton in his deposition and because of reliable \ninformation which the attorneys had received to this effect--that Ms. \nCurrie was an instrumental person in facilitating Monica Lewinsky's \nmeetings with the President and central to their ``cover story,'' as \nMr. Holmes refers to it. He explicitly denies that any ``Washington \nPost'' article played any part in the decision of the Jones attorneys \nto subpoena Ms. Currie.\n  And in the third and final piece of new evidence that we ask you to \ntake in and accept is a declaration and accompanying documents with \nregard to a telephone conversation showing that a conversation occurred \non December 6 for 56 minutes between the President and Ms. Lewinsky, \nwhich we believe that is what it shows. Obviously, the phone records \nshow the phone records. And they state what they are. But we suggest to \nyou that that is relevant information because it confirms what we think \nthe testimony in the record otherwise would lead you to believe.\n\n  At this point in time, having given you an overview and having given \nyou this amount of new evidence, I want to turn the microphone over and \nyield to my colleague, Mr. Bryant, the rest of the time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Bryant.\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice, may I inquire as to our time \nremaining?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Just under 90 minutes.\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Distinguished Senators, a recent letter from Manager Hyde to Senator \nDaschle stated that it has always been the position of the House \nmanagers\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\nthat a trial with the benefit of relevant witnesses is in the best \ninterest of the Senate and the American people. The defense attorneys \nfor the President, as well as others in this body, have publicly stated \nthat they do not want witnesses.\n  Through the question-and-answer session that we have just \nparticipated in over the last few days, some in this body have made it \nclear that they would prefer a few sharply focused witnesses limited \nonly to the most relevant witnesses. We heard this. And as a result of \nour submission this morning, you will see that we have proposed three \nwitnesses.\n  Now, as background, we have brought this down from some 15 witnesses \nthat we initially thought we would like to call. We eliminated, \nobviously, many witnesses that we would still like to call. But with \nrespect for this body, and certainly the sensitivity that we feel, we \nheard that three witnesses would be probably the best situation.\n  I think from, again, the tone of the questions, the directness of \nmany of the questions, we did get that message clearly. And from these \nthree witnesses we feel that we have the broadest coverage of the two \narticles of impeachment.\n  Within the obstruction article, there are in essence seven so-called \ncounts, seven instances that we allege. And with these three witnesses, \nwe managed to cover six of those seven, with the one that we don't \nquite cover being the tampering with Betty Currie. As you will note she \nis not on that list. But, again, bringing this down to three, we had to \neliminate, again, some witnesses we would have preferred to call.\n  Also, based on what we have read and what we have heard, it is clear \nthat a very few have already determined that even assuming the truth of \nthe articles of impeachment--the perjury and obstruction of justice--\nthat they are insufficient to convict this President of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. Since each of you, as Senators, must consider this matter \nand vote your own conscience with impartial justice, that is apparently \nyour individual decision, although with all due respect, I would \nsuggest a premature decision before all the proof and all the arguments \nare made.\n  One example of not having heard a complete case is Ms. Lewinsky. She \nis probably the most relevant witness, that is, aside from the \nPresident himself who so far has indicated through his counsel that he \nwill not testify; and I might add also has not answered the questions \nthat at least some Senators sent to the White House for his answering, \nbased on his attorney's statement that he would be willing to answer \nquestions.\n\n  So with that aside, Ms. Lewinsky is probably the most important \nwitness left. And wouldn't you at least like to see and hear from her \non this? As the triers of fact, wouldn't you want to observe the \ndemeanor of Ms. Lewinsky and test her credibility--as I say, look into \nthe eyes and test the credibility of these witnesses? Compare her \nversion of the testimony to the contested events. And remember, the \nPresident's attorneys, in numerous ways, in their vigorous defense of \nthe President, have challenged Ms. Lewinsky's version of the facts.\n  I believe the majority of other Senators have not yet reached a final \ndetermination, and it is to you now that I make this further \nproposition. If there is one witness you and the American people \nhonestly do need to hear, it is Ms. Lewinsky. As you probably read in \nthe newspapers, her lawyers don't want her to testify. They are good \nlawyers, and they don't want to have her out here.\n  And despite the protestations of the White House and their attorneys \nduring the House hearings that they wanted to hear fact witnesses, we \nnow know absolutely and without a doubt the White House does not want \nto hear Ms. Lewinsky--does not want you to hear Ms. Lewinsky. And Ms. \nLewinsky, if the truth be known, probably does not want to come in here \nand testify.\n  These are not our witnesses. We didn't get this case in a brown \nenvelope. We sort of didn't have any choice in selecting the witnesses. \nThe witnesses are all out there--basically White House employees, \nfriends of the White House, or former employees. These are not going to \nbe our friends if they come in and testify. They are not going to be \nsympathetic to us, although we can anticipate that they would tell the \ntruth. And that certainly would be our belief with Ms. Lewinsky if she \nwere called.\n  We believe she understands her responsibility, despite any feelings \nthat she might have about the President, or the job that he is doing as \nPresident, that she understands the responsibility to tell the truth.\n  And Senators, she does have a story to tell. And given the link that \nshe has, that common thread that she has in most of the charges of \nthese articles of impeachment, I would suggest that she should be \npermitted to testify.\n  I would go further to say that a closure of this case is somehow \nnecessary, and without the direct presentation by Ms. Lewinsky, we \nall--political and public--would be denied the complete picture that \nshe should be able to give us to better sort this out. As Manager \nGraham said yesterday, please don't leave us all hanging for the \nanswers we so dearly need.\n  Is this good, is it bad or is it ugly? We managers believe that it is \nbad, ugly and illegal. We all like to talk about the Constitution, and \nit is a great document. The opportunity to confront witnesses is \npresent in that Constitution, and it can be argued that this principle \nof confrontation of witnesses against you should apply to these \nproceedings. While we realize that confrontational right is one that \nbelongs to the criminal defendant in the Constitution, in this case \napparently any right to confront Ms. Lewinsky and other witnesses is \nbeing waived by the President and his lawyers since they don't want to \ncall witnesses in these proceedings.\n  Isn't it time, though, for the rest of us to make that choice that we \ndo want to see and hear some witnesses? Her testimony, in particular, \nwould be extraordinarily enlightening in resolving factual disputes \nabout the very charges for which we ask you to convict the President of \nthe United States for the felonies of perjury and obstruction of \njustice. These particular charges go to the very heart of our cobranch \nof government, the Judiciary. And Members of the Senate, in terms of \nthe impact on our judicial system in the search for truth, there is no \ndifference between a person lying, which is perjury, and a person \npaying another person to lie, which is bribery. The bribery is in the \nConstitution and the perjury is not specifically mentioned.\n  In terms of this proposition of proportionality, is the 106th Senate \nprepared to have as its record of sexual harassment laws that perjury \nabout sex is not illegal? After all, that is what this whole \nproportionality argument is about, that if it is about sex it is OK to \nlie. Because Senator Bumpers said that upwards of 80 percent of his \ndivorce cases from his Arkansas practice of law involve lying, that \ndoes not legitimize perjury, nor should it provide any authority for \nthis Senate to somehow legitimize perjury if it is just about sex.\n  We allege that the President, in a reasoned and in a calculated \nmanner, prevented Paula Jones from obtaining truthful testimony and \nevidence that might have helped her lawsuit. At the time the President \nattempted his coverup efforts, he, obviously, felt the disclosure of \nthat information in the Paula Jones case would be material and helpful \nto her. The President not only committed himself to illegal actions, \nbut he enlisted others to assist, some knowingly, and others, perhaps, \nunknowingly.\n  Ms. Lewinsky is one of these who, interestingly enough, might fit \ninto both categories of knowing and unknowingly at different times. She \nwould be able to share with this Senate the so-called tone and tenor of \nher conversations with the President. Who else can do that but she or \nthe President?\n  This tone and tenor and observing her demeanor and listening to her \ntalk about that filing of the affidavit and those things, and how the \nPresident talked to her and how she read what he said and exactly what \nhe did say, these are all very important, because as we know in \nWashington, and so many other places where there is a lot of power and \nprestige and so forth, there are actions that can be prompted without \neven a direct specific order. Things can get done even without it being \nsaid just by the tone and tenor, the gestures, the appearance and so \nforth of\n\n[[Page S997]]\n\ncertain things. Often these direct words, as I said, are not necessary. \nAnd Ms. Lewinsky can tell you about some of these occasions.\n\n  An appropriate examination--and an appropriate cross-examination, I \nmight add; let's don't limit the White House attorneys here--of Ms. \nLewinsky on the factual disputes of the affidavit and their cover \nstory, wouldn't that be nice to hear? The concealment of gifts--what \nreally happened there and the job search--why did she get the job \nwithin 48 hours of the affidavit, after months of unsuccess? Wouldn't \nit be nice to hear Ms. Lewinsky's version of this when it is so \nimportant to the overall case of obstruction of justice?\n  These are just a few examples where the Senate could be helped by her \ntestimony, and it very well could be dispositive, and it is even \npossible that she could help the President in some ways. But I assure \nyou that she is an impressive young lady, and I suspect that she still \nvery much does admire the President and the work that he is doing for \nthis country. Yet, she would be a person who in all likelihood would be \nforthcoming.\n  If you have not made up your mind, and, indeed, if you have further \ninterest in resolving many of the facts here, I do commend Ms. Lewinsky \nfor your consideration. It would be my intent to lead her through \ndirect examination, the perjury charge, as it is alleged with the \nPresident, by having her simply affirm those provisions of her written \ntestimony which are the ones that are generally referred to as \nsalacious, without specifically mentioning those words.\n  On the more complicated obstruction of justice, the pattern of \nobstruction of justice which does not involve these salacious details \nand matters, they will be addressed more specifically. It would be my \nintent for immediate clarification and to dissolve discrepancies and \ndifferent inferences that have been drawn by House managers and defense \ncounsel for the President, to ask her about the December 28 transfer of \nMs. Lewinsky's gifts from the President--transfer to Ms. Currie, \nparticularly the cellular telephone call that has been put into issue \nby the defense team, about her conversation with the President and her \noffer to allow him to review this false affidavit before she submitted \nit to her lawyer and eventually to the court, and his comment that he \ndidn't need to review it because he had seen 15 others just like it. \nWouldn't you like to know what are we talking about--15 others? Fifteen \ndrafts or 15 other type of affidavits in other cases?\n  She would also be asked about her job interviews and her discussions \nwith the President about these job interviews over a period of time, \nwhich are very important, her discussions with Vernon Jordan, and \nspecifically why she felt that the interview that she did with Revlon \nthe day after she signed the affidavit, her impression that it went \npoorly, whereas we heard--not testimony, but statements in the \npresentation of White House lawyers that, in fact, it didn't go poorly, \nit went very well, but she felt it went so poorly that she went \nimmediately out to call Vernon Jordan. Why? Why not hear her come in \nand tell us why she did that?\n  There will, of course, be other matters of record that she can \nclarify, and certainly being available to the White House defense team \nshe will be vigorously cross-examined. I am sure that might also \nclarify other matters.\n  It is my feeling that a fair and comprehensive examination without \ninterruption could be conducted of Ms. Lewinsky in 2 to 4 hours, and \ndepending on the length of cross-examination by White House attorneys, \nwe may not need any redirect examination.\n  While defense counsel for the President and others for the \nPresident--I heard it so many times, I am not sure exactly who said \nthis so I don't want to attribute to defense counsel, and maybe they \nhaven't even said it, but there has been word out of the White House \nthat if we call one witness, we might as well settle into a siege here \nin the Senate; we will be here for months and months and months. I \nsuggest that is an outrageous statement, that we will need that amount \nof time to pursue this case if witnesses are called.\n  We are confident that that, basically in its best case, is an attempt \nto discourage you from calling witnesses; and in its worst case, \nunfortunately, is a veiled threat that they will be dilatory and drag \nthis out for months and months if the Senate would allow.\n  House managers are establishing a good-faith effort to cut our \nwitnesses, as I said, down to three people, and to commit to reasonable \ntimes of examination with the assurance that we will finish this as \nquickly as we can and we will hope and perhaps the Senate their defense \nteam.\n  Witnesses can be called and a fair trial could be accomplished if all \nconcerned would agree. Would the Senate consider requesting the \nPresident's defense team to also select 3 or fewer witnesses in an \neffort to move this process along? And we think, too, that the \ndepositions, while they are important, if they are solely for the \npurpose of discovery, I ask, why would the White House need to discover \nwhat Vernon Jordan has to say, what Betty Currie has to say, or Sidney \nBlumenthal, or John Podesta--any of these witnesses? They would have to \ntake Monica Lewinsky's deposition, but any other discovery deposition, \nit seems to me, they have complete access to already.\n  As I close, I want to leave you with some words that have been of \nsome comfort to me, and I think we have all needed some comfort at \ntimes during these proceedings. It is a very short quote of the opening \nremarks of Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter Rodino in 1974. Again, in \npart, he says:\n\n       We know that the very real security of this Nation lies in \n     the integrity of its institutions and the informed confidence \n     of its people.\n\n  He talked about the Nixon hearings.\n\n       We will conduct our deliberations in that spirit. It has \n     been said that our country, troubled by too many crises in \n     recent years, is too tired to consider this one. In the first \n     year of the Republic, Thomas Paine wrote, ``Those who expect \n     to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the \n     fatigue of supporting it.''\n\n  Back to Rodino:\n\n       Now for almost 200 years, Americans have undergone the \n     stress of preserving their freedom and the Constitution that \n     protects it. It is now our turn.\n\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I respectfully ask you to permit \nthe House managers to call these 3 named witnesses and add this \nadditional evidence. I thank you. I yield to Mr. Manager Hutchinson.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Hutchinson.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of \nthe Senate, my responsibility is to address the testimony of Vernon \nJordan and the need to call him as a witness in this case.\n  Before I go into the details of that, let me just reflect for a \nmoment on the Senate trial process. I said many days ago that I had \nconfidence in the United States Senate, and I thought that at this \nparticular juncture it might be good if I reassured you that I still \nhad confidence in the United States Senate. When I think about the \ntrial process that we are going through, I have to compliment you on \nthe fact that you have structured a bipartisan process. I think that is \nimportant because you gave this process credibility. So you did the \nright thing, and I, for one, am pleased with what you were able to \naccomplish in that endeavor.\n  Now, whenever you achieve a bipartisan process, you have to make \ncompromises along the way. And the result is a format that is not \nparticularly helpful to the trial managers, the House managers, who \nwish to call witnesses. We have struggled through that. But \nnotwithstanding the present difficulty, I still compliment you and \nthank you for what you have done in achieving that bipartisan \nconsensus. I think back to that meeting that I had early on, and some \nother managers, with the bipartisan group of Senators from this body--\nand I now look at some from both sides of the aisle--and I went in \nthere with this high-minded thought that we could make a case for \nwitnesses because of what the other managers have described as the tone \nand demeanor of witnesses. Well, that was quickly brushed aside by them \nsaying, ``No, no, no, we want to hear about what conflicts exist in the \ntestimony; just tell us what the conflicts are because that is a strong \ncase for calling witnesses.'' Well, that threw me back on my heels. So \nI went back and, as you know, in the question and answer session I \naddressed the question of conflicts. I think we did a good job of \noutlining the conflicts between various witnesses.\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\n  Well, then I was informed that, ``We really are not as interested in \nthe conflicts because the conflicts exist in the current transcript. \nTherefore, really, we want to know what new information and what \ndynamic these witnesses can add.'' That threw me back for a curve. So \nwe looked at this again and we tried to make a case.\n  I'm going to show you what new dynamics and questions can be asked. \nUltimately, when you take the depositions, many of those questions are \ngoing to be answered. So you come back full circle to where we started \nin the beginning--that ultimately I hope witnesses are called so you \ncan evaluate their credibility, determine their demeanor, and assess \nthe truth in this case. I think that is important. I know people talk \nabout me as being a former Federal prosecutor. Actually, at one time, I \nconfess, I represented a defendant in a murder case. This gentleman was \ncharged with murder, and the prosecution in Logan County, Arkansas --\nnear Senator Bumpers' hometown--decided they wanted to handle one of \nthe key witnesses by deposition, as that person was out of State. I \nobjected and objected, because I thought that witness ought to be in \nthe courtroom. The judge overruled me and said, ``You can go take the \ndeposition and the defense counsel will be there to cross-\nexamination.'' So we traipsed off to the other State and took this \nwitness' deposition, and she made a lousy witness. I said she would not \nbe believed for anything because of the way she appeared. Well, we \nbrought the transcript back to the courtroom. The prosecution, over my \nobjection, put the transcript into the record and, all of a sudden, \nthat cold transcript was believable --particularly when they had it \nread by another witness that didn't look anything like the original \nlady. My client was convicted, but that case was reversed in the \nArkansas supreme court because the court said it was important that the \njury look into the eyes of the witness, see the demeanor of that \nwitness and determine the credibility.\n  So ultimately, we come back to that same point--that somehow you are \ngoing to have to resolve the conflicts. I know of only one way to do \nit. We have tried to be extraordinarily helpful and cooperative with \nthe United States Senate. I came in with this idea that we were going \nto present this case with 14 or 15 witnesses. Clearly, that is off the \ntable. We have narrowed this down to 3 witnesses; that is tough to \ndecide, but we believe that represents the basic heart of the \nobstruction of justice case and gets to at least 6 of the 7 elements, \nso that you can evaluate that. But we want to assist you, clearly, in \ngetting to the truth, but also to bring this matter to a conclusion \nfairly and as expeditiously as possible.\n  Now, let's look to Mr. Vernon Jordan. Should he be called as a \nwitness in this case? His testimony goes to the heart of one of the \nelements of obstruction of justice--that is, the job search and the \nfalse affidavit, and the interconnection between those. I have tried, \nduring my presentation of this case, to present portions of his \ntestimony--excerpts, if you will, from his testimony. But you will see \nthat he has testified 5 times before the Federal grand jury. I have \nread all of this. I am not going to ask for a show of hands, but how \nmany of you have read all of this? And so you have had to rely upon a \ntrial--an ordeal by lawyers, rather than a trial by witnesses because I \nhave had to present the testimony of Vernon Jordan in excerpt fashion \nwith limited quotes here and there--as the defense counsel has done \nlikewise. That makes it difficult because the problem is, one, you are \nhearing it from her, but, second, it is not a story, it is excerpts, \nand there is no way you can assess the truth because of that.\n\n  If you look at the times that Mr. Jordan has testified before the \ngrand jury: March 3, 1998; March 5, 1998; May 28, and June 9; the last \ntime he ever testified was June 9, 1998--let's look at what has \nhappened since then, since Mr. Jordan last testified before the grand \njury. I believe these charts are in front of you.\n  July 22, Ms. Currie testified before the grand jury. So any of the \nfacts we gain from Ms. Currie were not utilized in the last examination \nof Vernon Jordan.\n  August 6, what happened on that date? Ms. Lewinsky testified before \nthe grand jury and she revealed some new facts during that time that \nMr. Jordan has never had an opportunity to explain, respond to, or \nanswer. I will go into that. One of them is about disposing of notes. \nThe second one is about drafting the affidavit. And, of course, by that \ntime the DNA on the dress had been revealed.\n  Then the next thing that happened was the President's revelation to \nthe Nation that this relationship did exist. And then he testified \nbefore the grand jury. All of the facts revealed from those instances \nwere not revealed at the time Vernon Jordan last testified before the \ngrand jury.\n  Obviously, any lawyer would understand there are naturally questions \nthat arise from each of those incidents that could be posed to Mr. \nJordan. Why has that not been done? Quite frankly, I have talked to, as \nI mentioned the other day, the attorney for Mr. Jordan. I have not \ntalked to Mr. Jordan personally. I think that clearly the Senate does \nnot want us to do that until we get past this next hurdle. But those \nare the things that need to be resolved.\n  Let me address briefly three areas of conflicts and testimony between \nMr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky that point up other areas of questioning \nthat would be appropriate that he should have the opportunity to \nexplain.\n  I have been accused of being harsh to Mr. Jordan, and I don't mean to \nbe that way. There have been certain things that have been stated by \nwitnesses in this case that ought to be explained, that ought to be \nquestioned of Mr. Jordan. But we need to have good answers to these \nquestions. We need to know those answers.\n  The first conflict--I will get to that--is between Mr. Jordan's \ntestimony and Ms. Lewinsky's testimony about whether Mr. Jordan knew \nthe true nature of the relationship with the President.\n  In Mr. Jordan's testimony of May 28, he was asked a question, \n``You're saying no one to your recollection ever suggested or alleged a \nsexual relationship prior to the 18th of January between Monica \nLewinsky and the President.'' The answer: ``That is correct.''\n  That was on May 28. Ms. Lewinsky was asked the same series of \nquestions months later--in August of 1998--and she indicated, she \ntestified, ``And I remarked that I really didn't look at him as the \nPresident''--that, ``I saw him more as a man and reacted to him more as \na man and got angry at him like a man and just a regular person. Mr. \nJordan asked me what I got angry at the President about. So I told him \nwhen he doesn't call me enough or see me enough.''\n\n  Another statement:\n\n       And so after we had the conversation I was just talking \n     about with Mr. Jordan, he said to me, ``Well, you know what \n     your problem is,'' and I said, ``What?'' He said, ``Don't \n     deny it,'' and he said, ``You're in love. That's what your \n     problem is.''\n\n  This is Monica Lewinsky referring to what Mr. Jordan had said.\n  So clearly those are relevant questions that need to be readdressed \nto Mr. Jordan because they were raised by Ms. Lewinsky in subsequent \ntestimony that have never been asked to him in that fashion.\n  There is a conflict in the testimony between Mr. Jordan and Ms. \nLewinsky about whether the subpoena was discussed at the December 22 \nmeeting. Mr. Jordan testified in March that, ``We did not talk about \nthe subpoena. She wanted to know about her job. That was the purpose of \nher coming.'' And the question was, ``Anything beyond that?'' The \nanswer was, ``No.''\n  And that is March 6 of 1998. Ms. Lewinsky testified contrary.\n  Let's turn our attention then to December 22, which is the day she \nmet with Frank Carter. ``And I think you said you were going to meet \nwith Mr. Jordan.'' Answer: ``So I came to see Mr. Jordan earlier, and I \nalso wanted to find out if he had in fact told the President that I had \nbeen subpoenaed.''\n  That was her testimony which is in direct conflict--that the subpoena \nwas discussed on the same day that she went to see Mr. Carter about the \nrepresentation.\n  Where is the relevance in this?\n  If you recall, Mr. Jordan said it didn't take an Einstein to figure \nout that, whenever you combine whenever she got the subpoena, that it \nchanged the circumstances.\n  Here you have three problems. You have a job search, you have a \nwitness\n\n[[Page S999]]\n\nin court, and if you combine that with the knowledge of a relationship, \nthose are three dynamite issues combining together that should cause \nanyone--not just one change of circumstances but it elevates it to a \nhigher level of danger because of the correlation between each of those \nthree separate facts--each of these conflicts, and the testimony of \nMonica Lewinsky goes to those key fundamental issues. And Mr. Jordan \nhas never been asked sufficiently about those areas.\n  The third conflict--this is key--is the testimony of Monica Lewinsky. \nMr. Jordan testified that he never talked to Ms. Lewinsky about Linda \nTripp. That is his March 5, 1998, testimony. But Ms. Lewinsky testifies \nin her August 6 testimony about a meeting with Mr. Jordan on December \n31.\n  This is the third exhibit. I will read that:\n\n       And I met Mr. Jordan for breakfast on . . . the morning of \n     [December] 31st, at the Park Hyatt Hotel. And in the course \n     of the conversation I told him that I had had this friend, \n     Linda Tripp . . . and I was a little bit concerned because \n     she had spent the night at my home a few times and I \n     thought--I told Mr. Jordan, I said, well, maybe she's heard \n     some--you know--I mean, maybe she saw some notes lying \n     around. And Mr. Jordan said, ``Notes from the President to \n     you?'' And I said, ``No, notes from me to the President.'' \n     And he said, ``Go home and make sure they're not there.''\n\n  This is Ms. Lewinsky's testimony of August 6 before the grand jury.\n  And before anything is said, I am not accusing anyone of anything. \nBut let me tell you, it would be significant if Mr. Jordan is asked a \nquestion if that is a true statement and he says yes. It is significant \nto the case. If he says no, that is significant because there is a \nclear conflict in the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky. And her testimony goes \nto the heart of the issue. If he says, ``I don't remember,'' which is a \nthird alternative--by the way, I hate giving these prospective \nwitnesses all my questions--but if he says, ``I don't remember,'' that \ndoes not put the issue in dispute with Ms. Lewinsky and establishes \nreally her recollection of the incident.\n  So I could go through more. I could go through more conflict with Ms. \nLewinsky about whether Mr. Jordan saw the unsigned draft copy of her \naffidavit, a key issue in this case. Ms. Lewinsky testifies one way. \nMr. Jordan did not have the benefit of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony when he \nwas asked earlier in the grand jury. So that needs to be addressed with \nhim.\n  There is a conflict with Ms. Lewinsky on whether they discussed the \ncontents of the affidavit--not just whether they saw the signed \naffidavit, but whether the contents were discussed. The question to Mr. \nJordan was, ``Did you ever discuss with Ms. Lewinsky what she was going \nto include in the affidavit?'' Answer: ``I was not Ms. Lewinsky's \nlawyer. The answer to that is no.''\n  But he goes on and elaborates on that. Ms. Lewinsky testified that \nshe and Jordan did have a conversation about deleting a certain \nsentence in the affidavit and reworking that.\n  That is what I just covered on the contents of the affidavit.\n  Let me just go to one other on the conflict where the affidavit was \ndiscussed at their last meeting. Mr. Jordan testified in March that she \ncame into the office:\n\n       She gave me a tie. I said, ``Monica, I am really busy, \n     thank you.'' And she thanked me, and she is gone.\n\n  ``Any subsequent conversation?'' The answer: ``No.''\n  Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is:\n\n       I stopped in to see him for five minutes to thank him for \n     giving me the job, and I gave him a tie.\n\n  She further testified,\n\n       I believe I showed him a copy of the affidavit.\n\n  Clear conflict, very important, once again showing a connection \nbetween the job, the false affidavit, and, of course, if you tie in the \nother aspect about the relationship, it gets very significant and \nsomething that needs to be further inquired about.\n  So there are some of the conflicts between the testimony, and an area \nthat we need to inquire of Mr. Jordan about.\n  The notes to the President that Ms. Lewinsky said she had a \nconversation with him about, that has never been addressed to Mr. \nJordan whatsoever.\n  The December 19 meeting we need to explore more with Mr. Jordan. This \nis the meeting when Ms. Lewinsky was subpoenaed. She called Mr. Jordan. \nHe says, ``Come over.'' She goes over there to meet with Mr. Jordan, \nand during that meeting, according to the telephone logs, Mr. Jordan \nreceived a call from the President of the United States. Mr. Jordan has \ntestified that he told the President that Ms. Lewinsky got subpoenaed.\n  That appears to be exactly during the meeting--the conversation he is \nhaving with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  I think appropriate questions to Mr. Jordan are: Did you excuse Ms. \nLewinsky from the meeting? Did you have a private conversation with the \nPresident about the subject that you were talking to Ms. Lewinsky \nabout? And when you renewed your conversation with Ms. Lewinsky, did \nyou in fact tell her about your conversation with the President? If Ms. \nLewinsky was not told about that conversation, I think there is some \nsignificance there, that things were going on that people were \ncompartmentalizing and not sharing with the other interested parties, \nand I think that is significant and that needs to be explored. His \ninvolvement with reviewing the affidavit needs to be developed, and the \nconflicts, his knowledge of the nature of the relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky.\n  So all of these need to be further explored. There are a number of \nunanswered questions.\n  One final area. I obviously have a number, but I don't want to \nbelabor this point. There was testimony I mentioned about Mr. Isikoff \nand how Betty Currie felt compelled to go see Mr. Jordan about Mr. \nIsikoff inquiring about the courier records on the gifts from Ms. \nLewinsky to the President. There is some indication that that \ninformation might have been shared with Mr. Frank Carter because Ms. \nLewinsky testified that she received a page from Mr. Carter, her \nattorney, about the Isikoff call, the Isikoff request. How did that \ninformation get to Mr. Carter? I think there are some legitimate \nquestions that should be asked there.\n  So we would respectfully ask the Senate to permit us to call Mr. \nJordan as a witness, to depose him. But, further, we hope we will be \nable to call him so that you can evaluate the conflicts that I am sure \nexist now, that very likely will exist later on as well. The story \nneeds to be told. The truth should be determined. Justice should be \naccomplished. That is done not through lawyers up here talking, it is \nnot done through transcripts, but through witnesses. Edmund Burke said \nthat to fail to hear the evidence is to fail to hear the cause. I know \nthat you have transcripts, but I would contend to you that to fail to \nhear these witnesses is in essence to fail to hear the cause.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, could I inquire about the balance of the \ntime remaining for the House managers?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Yes. The managers have 52 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Do they intend to use more of their time now?\n  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that we take a 30-\nminute break at this point.\n  There being no objection, at 1:22 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n1:59 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I have a unanimous consent request to \npropound. We have discussed this with Senator Daschle and it has been \ncleared.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the conclusion of the \narguments by the managers and the White House counsel today on the \nmotion to subpoena witnesses, it be in order at that point only for \nSenator Harkin or Senator Wellstone to make a motion to open that \ndebate pursuant to his motion timely filed, and that the Senate proceed \nimmediately to the vote, pursuant to the impeachment rules.\n  I further ask that following that vote, if defeated, it be in order \nto move to close the session for deliberations on the motion to \nsubpoena witnesses, as provided under the impeachment rules of the \nSenate and proceed to immediate vote.\n  If we have any change in either one of these, certainly we would have \nto ask for consent on that and would notify Members to that effect.\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\n  I further ask that if the Senate votes to proceed to closed session, \nthose deliberations be limited to 3 hours equally divided between the \ntwo leaders, notwithstanding the 5-minute allocation of time under the \nimpeachment rule.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate concludes its \nbusiness today, it stand in adjournment until 1 p.m. on Wednesday, \nJanuary 27.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that pursuant to S. Res. 16, the \nvotes occur immediately upon convening on Wednesday, first on the \nmotion to dismiss, and if defeated, the motion to subpoena witnesses \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. In the absence of objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, we are ready to proceed with \nWhite House counsel.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Counsel Kendall.\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, we reserve our time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well.\n  Mr. Kendall.\n  You are going to use it now? You have 52 minutes remaining. The Chair \nrecognizes Mr. Manager Rogan.\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the \nSenate. When I was a trial judge back in California, there was \nsomething I had to do in every single case, whether it was a criminal \nor civil case, and that was to advise the triers of fact --in that \nparticular case, the jury--that what the lawyers say is not evidence. \nThis is a universal warning that is given in courtrooms throughout the \ncountry to the triers of fact, because the law prefers that those \npeople who have to make the determination as to what the facts are make \nthat determination based not only on interpretation of the evidence, \nbut based upon what the evidence actually is. And that has been the \nunderpinning of our argument before this body from the very first day \nas to why witnesses are needed--not to accommodate us, but for the \nSenate to be able to make the ultimate conclusion as to what is the \ntruth.\n  A perfect example of why the evidence should come from witnesses \nrather than lawyers can be seen from the fact that throughout these \nproceedings lawyers on both sides have tried to characterize what is \nthe evidence and tried to characterize the interpretation that this \nbody should adopt.\n  I am reminded when we were before the Judiciary Committee, just \nbefore we voted articles of impeachment, White House counsel suggested \nto our committee, as they do before this body, that the President's \nstate of mind during his various statements under oath were intended to \nmislead people but to be truthful. They say the President didn't lie. \nInstead, they say he carefully crafted these hypertechnical definitions \nto protect himself from any perjury charge.\n  We believe the evidence will show that by so doing, Paula Jones was \ndenied the information a Federal judge said she was entitled to have \nand, thereby, perjury and obstruction of justice lie.\n  Before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Ruff reaffirmed this was the \nPresident's strategy. This is what Mr. Ruff told our committee:\n  Question to Mr. Ruff:\n\n       I do want to make sure I understand your position. From the \n     beginning, the President has taken the position that he never \n     lied to the American people or lied while giving testimony \n     under oath. Essentially claims he simply misled [them] with a \n     different definition, and he was sending the same message \n     both to the American people and the court.\n\n  Answer by Mr. Ruff:\n\n       I think that is fair, Congressman. Yes.\n\n  Question:\n\n       And he did that intentionally, because in his own mind he \n     drew a distinction between the technical definition of \n     ``sexual relations'' and the definition of ``improper \n     relationship,'' or something along those lines, which is how \n     he now characterizes his relationship with Monica Lewinsky?\n\n  Answer by Mr. Ruff:\n\n       Yes, I think that's correct.\n\n  Question:\n\n       You suggested earlier in your testimony this distinction is \n     one he has drawn since the Jones deposition. My notes \n     indicate you said the definitions are one that he held in \n     his mind in January and in August and he has so testified.\n\n  Answer by Mr. Ruff:\n\n       Yes.\n\n  Question:\n\n       In determining whether the President either perjured \n     himself or lied under oath in this matter, you are asking the \n     committee to look to his state of mind from the beginning of \n     this whole episode and make that determination?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       Yes.\n\n  Members of this body, we suggest that the evidence has shown, and the \nevidence will further show by the calling of the witnesses that we \npropose, that the President denied under oath specific facts that were \nrelevant to the case, relevant to the Jones case, relevant to the \nperjury and obstruction investigation by the grand jury, and, in so \ndoing, among the other lies that my colleagues have pointed out, we \nwill show that he lied to his aides.\n  This is important, because he, the President, admitted he knew that \nhis aides were potential witnesses in a criminal investigation before \nthe grand jury. This is the portion of the grand jury transcript where \nthe President testified about his conversations with key aides once the \nMonica Lewinsky story became public.\n  Question to the President:\n\n       Did you deny it to them or not, Mr. President?\n       Answer: . . .I did not want to mislead my friends, but I \n     wanted to find language where I could say that. I also, \n     frankly, did not want to turn any of them into witnesses, \n     because I--and, sure enough, they all became witnesses.\n       Question: Well, you knew they might be witnesses, didn't \n     you?\n       Answer: And so I said to them things that were true about \n     this relationship. That I used--in the language I used, I \n     said, there's nothing going on between us. That was true. I \n     said, I have not had sex with her as I defined it. That was \n     true. And did I hope that I would never have to be here on \n     this day giving this testimony? Of course. But I also didn't \n     want to do anything to complicate this matter further. So, I \n     said things that were true. . ..\n\n  The President's position is they were misleading, but they were true. \nNo lies, and that is precisely what Mr. Ruff told the Judiciary \nCommittee, and that is the position that White House counsel takes \nbefore this body.\n  Remember, the grand jury was conducting a criminal investigation. \nThey were seeking evidence of possible perjury and obstruction of \njustice, and the White House contends before this body that the \nPresident did nothing to obstruct their investigation. The evidence \nshows that he did. One of those witnesses who will demonstrate that to \nthis body is the President's own aide, Sidney Blumenthal. That is why \nwe request this body to allow Mr. Blumenthal to be deposed, and, \nfurther, we hope that you will allow him the opportunity to testify \nbefore you so that you can gauge his credibility and his demeanor as he \npresents the answers that we expect he will give.\n  Mr. Blumenthal's testimony puts him in direct conflict with the \nclaims of the President and shatters the myth of the President's \ntruthful but misleading answers given under oath.\n  Just for a quick way of background, Mr. Blumenthal, on January 21, \n1998, was an assistant to the President. That was the day the Monica \nLewinsky story broke in the national press through the Washington Post. \nThat story broke in the morning.\n\n  Later the same day, Mr. Blumenthal met both with the First Lady and \nthen with the President to discuss these news revelations. One month \nlater, Mr. Blumenthal was called to testify before the grand jury. His \ntestimony was not particularly helpful during that time because, \nthrough most of the questioning that involved conversations that he had \nat the White House, Mr. Blumenthal claimed executive privilege.\n  That issue was apparently litigated, and then he returned in June to \ntestify before the grand jury twice, on June 4 and on June 25, 1998.\n  When Mr. Blumenthal was free to share his recollections of the \nevents, this is how Mr. Blumenthal characterized his meetings with \nPresident and Mrs. Clinton before the grand jury. It is interesting to \nnote, by the way, that there was a dual lie going on here from the \nPresident. The President was lying to his wife, who could never be \ncalled as a witness against him, but he was also lying to his aides \nwhom he admitted could be called.\n  This is from Mr. Blumenthal's testimony on June 4.\n\n       The First Lady said that she was distressed that the \n     President was being attacked, in\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\n     her view, for political motives, for his ministry of a \n     troubled person. She said that the President ministers to \n     troubled people all the time. . .and he does so out of \n     religious conviction and personal temperament.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       And the First Lady said he had done this dozens if not \n     hundreds of times with people, the President came from a \n     broken home and this was very hard to prevent him from trying \n     to minister to these troubled people.\n       So I related that conversation to the President. . .. And I \n     said to him that I understand that you. . .want to minister \n     to troubled people, that you feel compassionate, but that \n     part of the problem with troubled people is that they're. . \n     .troubled. . ..\n       I said, ``However, you're President and these troubled \n     people can just get you in incredible messes. . .you have to \n     cut yourself off from them.''\n       And he said, [meaning the President, he said,] ``It's very \n     difficult for me to do that, given how I am. I want to help \n     people.''\n\n  Then Mr. Blumenthal testified that the President said Dick Morris \nsuggested that the President go on television and admit in a national \naddress whatever he may have done wrong.\n  Once again Mr. Blumenthal testified:\n\n       And I said to the President, ``What have you done wrong?'' \n     And he said, ``Nothing. I haven't done anything wrong.'' \n     [And] I said, ``Well, then, that's one of the stupidest ideas \n     I've ever heard. Why would you do that if you've done nothing \n     wrong?''\n       And it was at that point that he gave his account of what \n     happened to me and he said that Monica--and it came very \n     fast. He said, ``Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual \n     demand on me.'' He rebuffed her. He said, ``I've gone down \n     that road before, I've caused pain for a lot of people and \n     I'm not going to do that again.''\n       She threatened him. She said that she would tell people \n     they'd had an affair, that she was known as the stalker among \n     her peers, and that she hated it and if she had an affair or \n     said she had an affair then she wouldn't be the stalker \n     anymore.\n       And I repeated to the President that he really needed never \n     to be near people who were troubled like this, that it was \n     just--he needed not to be near troubled people like this. And \n     I said, ``You need to find some sure footing here, some solid \n     ground.''\n       And he said, ``I feel like a character in a novel. I feel \n     like somebody who is surrounded by an oppressive force that \n     is creating a lie about me and I can't get the truth out. I \n     feel like the character in the novel Darkness at Noon.''\n       And I said to him, I said, ``When this happened with Monica \n     Lewinsky, were you alone?'' He said, ``Well, I was within \n     eyesight or earshot of someone.''\n       I said, ``You know, there are press reports that you made \n     phone calls to her and that there's voice mail. Did you make \n     phone calls to her?\"\n       He said that he remembered calling her when Betty Currie's \n     brother died and that he left a message on her voice machine \n     that Betty's brother had died and he said she was close to \n     Betty and had been very kind to Betty. And that's what he \n     recalled.\n\n  And then in his June 24 deposition, Mr. Blumenthal expanded on this \nthinking. He was asked the question:\n\n  In your conversation with the President when he stated that Monica \nLewinsky threatened to disclose an affair, or fabricate an affair in a \npublic disclosure, did you understand him to be saying that if the \nPresident didn't concede or didn't agree to have some [type] of sexual \ncontact with her, that she would report an affair?\n       Answer: My understanding was that she demanded to have \n     sexual relations. He rejected her. And she said that--this is \n     --I recall him saying--that, ``They called me the Stalker.'' \n     That's what Lewinsky said. ``And if I can say we had an \n     affair, then they won't call me that,'' something like that.\n       Question: Now, you previously characterized Ms. Lewinsky's \n     comments to the President as a threat, if you will?\n       Answer: Right, yeah, I would interpret--that's my \n     understanding.\n\n  Then Mr. Blumenthal told the grand jury about the impact the \nPresident's emphatic denials had upon his state of mind-- the mind of a \npotential grand jury witness.\n\n       Question: In response to my question how you responded to \n     the President's story about a threat or discussion about a \n     threat from Ms. Lewinsky, you mentioned you didn't recall \n     specifically. Do you recall generally the nature of your \n     response to the President?\n\n  Answer by Mr. Blumenthal:\n\n       It was generally sympathetic to the President. And I \n     certainly believed his story. It was a very heartfelt story, \n     he was pouring out his heart, and I believed him.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Question: Did the President explain to you what Monica \n     Lewinsky's trouble was that he was helping?\n       Answer: No.\n       Question: And you never asked him?\n       Answer: No.\n       Question: Did anyone else, including the First Lady, tell \n     you what Monica Lewinsky's trouble was that the President was \n     ministering about?\n       Answer: No.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Question: What did you understand the President to mean by, \n     he had done nothing wrong?\n       Answer: My understanding was that the accusation against \n     him, which appeared in the press that day, was false, that he \n     had not done anything wrong.\n       Question: That he had not had any sort of sexual \n     relationship?\n       Answer: He had not had a sexual relationship with her and \n     had not sought to obstruct justice or suborn perjury.\n\n  Mr. Blumenthal then went on to say he then asked the President about \nsome of these reports that there were phone calls between him and \nMonica Lewinsky.\n\n       Question: Did the President say anything to you about \n     telephone calls with Monica Lewinsky?\n       Answer: As I testified, I had said to him that there were \n     reports that his voice was on her voice mail, her tape \n     machine at home to take message--message machine. And he \n     said to me that he could recall that after Betty's brother \n     died he may have called Monica because Monica had been \n     very close to Betty. And Betty didn't have a way of \n     relating to her that her brother had died, so that he had \n     called and left a message that Betty's brother died.\n       Question: Did he suggest to you that that was the only call \n     he had ever made to Monica Lewinsky?\n       Answer: That's the only one he told me about.\n       Question: Did you ask him if there were any more calls than \n     that?\n       Answer: He said that's the only one he could remember.\n\n  Well, we now know certainly from White House logs that ``the only one \nthe President remembered'' isn't quite true, that in fact I believe it \nwas over 50 telephone conversations between the President and Monica \nLewinsky. And it begs the question: Why was the President, on the day \nthis story broke, pulling his aides in to relay information that the \nPresident knew was patently false when he knew that they were potential \nwitnesses before the grand jury?\n  Now, it is important to remember that this testimony from Mr. \nBlumenthal was given 1 month before Monica Lewinsky decided to opt to \ncooperate with the Office of Independent Counsel. Thus, these questions \nwere asked of him in a vacuum without the benefit of Ms. Lewinsky's \nextensive testimony, as well as the President's own grand jury \ntestimony. And the House managers agree that these and other areas need \nto be more fully explored with the gentleman under oath in light of the \nlater revelations that occurred surrounding this case.\n  Now, we know a couple of things. We know that the Monica Lewinsky \nstory broke on January 21. We know that the President spoke to Sidney \nBlumenthal the very same day. We know that the President said he knew \nhis aides could be potential witnesses before the grand jury. And we \nalso know that Mr. Blumenthal was called three times before the grand \njury--once in February, twice in June.\n  There is an important question that was never asked Mr. Blumenthal \nduring his testimony. It could not have been asked because at the time \nhe testified, the revelation that the President shared with America in \nAugust and Monica Lewinsky's revelation had not yet been aired. If the \nPresident knew that Mr. Blumenthal was going to be a witness, a \npotential witness before the grand jury, if 6 months after this story \nbroke the President presumably knew that his aide had gone down, not \nonce but twice, to the grand jury, I would like to know from Mr. \nBlumenthal: Did the President ever come up to you and say something to \nyou? Did he ever say to you: Do you remember that story I told you back \nin January? Well, now that you're actually going to be a witness, I \nknow that you're going down to testify before the grand jury, I don't \nwant you to give the grand jury a false impression. I don't want you to \ngive false information to the grand jury. I don't want you to be a cog \nin the wheel of an obstruction of giving the grand jury the opportunity \nto hear the truth. I need to recant for you what I told you.\n  There is no evidence of that. And we would like to find that out. And \nthe only way we can do that is by deposing Mr. Blumenthal and hopefully \nbringing him in and sharing that information with this body.\n  Another area we would like to inquire about is the area of a \npotential plan to destroy Monica Lewinsky if she\n\n[[Page S1002]]\n\never decided to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. Mr. \nBlumenthal told the grand jury that, following the Monica Lewinsky news \nrevelations, White House aides held twice-a-day staff briefings, at \n8:30 in the morning and at 6:45 in the evening, every day to discuss, \namong other topics, the media impact of the Lewinsky scandal and how to \ndeal with it in the press.\n  Mr. Blumenthal testified that the primary purpose of these meetings \nwas to discuss press strategy.\n  In making his presentation to the Judiciary Committee last month, \nchief investigative counsel, David Schippers, related some of the \nquotes that emanated in the press following the Lewinsky story. I want \nto read a few paragraphs from Mr. Schippers' presentation:\n\n       Worst of all, in order to win, it was necessary to convince \n     the public, and hopefully, those grand jurors who read the \n     newspapers, that Monica Lewinsky was unworthy of belief. If \n     the account given by Monica to Linda Tripp was believed, then \n     there would be a tawdry affair in and near the oval office. \n     Moreover, the President's own perjury and that of Monica \n     Lewinsky would surface. How do you do this? Congressman \n     Graham showed you. You employ the full power and credibility \n     of the White House and the press corps of the White House to \n     destroy the witness.\n\n  Mr. Schippers then quoted from several news sources. Now, this is \njust a few days after the President told Mr. Blumenthal that Monica was \nknown as ``the stalker.''\n\n       Inside the White House, the debate goes on about the best \n     way to destroy ``that woman'' as President Clinton called \n     Monica Lewinsky. Should they paint her as a friendly \n     fanaticist or as a malicious stalker?\n\n  Again, January 30th:\n\n       It's always very easy to take a mirror's eye view of this \n     thing, look at this thing from a completely different \n     direction and take the same evidence and posit a totally \n     innocent relationship in which the President was a victim of \n     someone, rather like the woman who followed David Letterman \n     around.\n\n  From another source, ``One White House aide called reporters. . .''\n\n       One White House aide called reporters to offer information \n     about Monica Lewinsky's past, her weight problem, and what \n     the aide said was her nickname ``the stalker.''\n\n  Just hours after the story broke, one White House source made \nunsolicited calls offering that Lewinsky was the troubled product of \ndivorced parents.\n  And the reference goes on and on. You can find the complete reference \nin the committee report.\n  Now the question is, Was this a mere coincidence that the President's \nfalse statements to Mr. Blumenthal about Monica Lewinsky being a \n``stalker'' quickly found their way into press accounts, even though \nthose accounts are attributed by the press to sources inside the White \nHouse? The answer to the question is, yes, it is a coincidence, \naccording to White House counsel. And we heard that from them just 3 \ndays ago. Mr. Ruff said in his presentation, and I am quoting:\n\n       The White House, the President, the President's agents, the \n     President's spokespersons, no one has ever trashed, \n     threatened, maligned, or done anything else to Monica \n     Lewinsky. No one.\n\n  Mr. Blumenthal needs to be questioned now under the light of the \nfacts as we now know them. All we have from Mr. Blumenthal are the \nfacts as he testified before the revelations saw the light of day, and \nhe needs to be questioned for the benefit of those who must make a \ndetermination of credibility and the determination of guilt or \ninnocence. This is the reason we have included Mr. Blumenthal on our \nproposed list. He is just one example of several aides whose testimony \nis already before you in the record. But we feel it would be \nbeneficial not only for the body to hear him, but certainly to question \nhim in light of the revelations that occurred following his grand jury \ntestimony.\n\n  Mr. Chief Justice, with that, we reserve the balance of our time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well, the Chair recognizes Mr. Counsel \nKendall for the White House.\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentleman of the \nSenate, House managers, the purpose of the managers' motion and what I \nam going to address, is whether you need to add any evidence to the \nrecord before you. And that is all I am going to address. Now, I am \ntempted--it is like waving a red flag at the bull to take on the \nsubstantive arguments that have been presented here as to why the \nPresident is guilty. I am going to refrain from doing that, but my \nrefraining from doing that is not because I agree with them, but that \nwe have already addressed them. I think here that the proper procedure \nis just address the need for new evidence to add to the record before \nyou.\n  The managers' case is in no way--no way--harmed by being unable to \ncall witnesses at this point. The independent counsel conducted a wide-\nranging investigation. It was intense. It was comprehensive of every \nconceivable allegation against the President after the Lewinsky \npublicity erupted on January 21, 1998. In the record of publicly \navailable materials, which the Senate has asked the House managers to \ncertify, the actual number of pages is somewhat understated, because as \nI mentioned before, frequently four or five pages of transcript are \nreproduced on a single page of the bound. But, in fact, there are over \n10,000 pages of grand jury testimony, over 800 pages of other testimony \nsuch as depositions, 3,400 pages of documentary evidence, 1,800 pages \nof audio transcripts, and 800-some pages of FBI interviews.\n  The Office of Independent Counsel has an unlimited budget with \nunlimited investigative resources, ranging from the FBI to private \ninvestigators. Its agents interviewed people all over the country, used \nseveral different grand juries, conducted hundreds of interviews, even \ncalled people back from abroad. If the OIC could have turned up \nanything that was negative or prejudicial, it would be in those \nvolumes. You can rest assured that they did their best to find that \nevidence.\n  And the Starr team has been fully supportive of the pro impeachment \nforces in the House of Representatives; indeed, so supportive that the \nindependent counsel's ethics advisory professor, Sam Dash, resigned to \nprotest Mr. Starr's zealous advocacy of the impeachment of the \nPresident.\n  Just this week, Mr. Starr and his staff have aggressively continued \nto support the House managers during these Senate proceedings. Some \ncommentators have commented that the independent counsel is, perhaps, \nthe honorary 14th House manager.\n  Now, I rehash this all not to cast aspersions at Mr. Starr, but to \nremind the Senate that after 5 years and $50 million President Clinton \nmay be the most investigated person in America. I would certainly say \nthis for Mr. Starr: He is thorough. He is thorough. After all the work \nthat has been done for them by the independent counsel, there is simply \nno way that the House managers are prejudiced by not being able to add \nto this record at this point.\n  Now, Mr. Manager McCollum repeated this morning that we are afraid of \nwitnesses. We are not. We have reviewed in detail in our presentations \nwhat the evidence shows about both the perjury and the obstruction of \njustice allegation. We are not at all afraid of what the witnesses \nwould say. Indeed, we know what they are going to say because it is all \nright there in the volumes before you. We think that you have \neverything there on the basis in which you can make a fair judgment and \nachieve a fair resolution. The managers' hope to call more witnesses is \nsimply a product of their desire, their hope, their prayer, that \nsomething will come to rescue their case.\n  Let's be clear about one thing: Any delay in the process necessary \nfor us to have fair discovery is on their heads. Our point here is that \nthere is simply no need to go outside this record, because what you \nhave before you is voluminous, and it is a completely adequate basis \nfor your decision.\n  As I pointed out the other day in the questioning period, the only \nthing left out of this record is evidence that might be exculpatory or \nhelpful to the President. And if we must, we will as conscientious \nlawyers, seek out that helpful additional evidence through discovery.\n  This body has been scrupulously fair in these proceedings, and I am \nconfident it will be fair concerning our need for discovery if the \n``genie'' of discovery is let out of the bottle and live witnesses are \ndeemed to be appropriate. Then we are going to need a fair period of \ntime for our own discovery.\n  But, again, the point today on this motion is that the managers have \nsimply identified no particular need for witnesses, no specific areas \nof testimony that might contribute to what is already in the record \nand, indeed, no\n\n[[Page S1003]]\n\nmaterial questions--you can always think of questions that were \nunasked--but no material questions, given the allegation in the two \narticles that are not in the record before you.\n  Just recall, in the House the managers believed that this was an \nadequate record to come to you and urge removal of the President. They \nrested on that record in the House, and they impeached an elected \nPresident on the basis of that record. They cannot now complain that it \nis, for some reason, unfair to submit this same record to you for \njudgment at this point. We are not afraid of or reluctant to call \nwitnesses, but we think that at the end of the day, the addition of \nmore testimony from the three witnesses you have heard about won't \naffect any evidentiary judgment you have to make.\n  Mr. Manager Barr declared during his presentation a week ago Friday, \non January 15, that this was in fact a relatively simple case, although \nwe, the White House lawyers, would try to nitpick the evidence. He told \nyou that what we have before us, Senators and Mr. Chief Justice, is \nreally not complex--critically important, yes, but not essentially \ncomplex. The able House managers have kept insisting on their need for \nwitnesses, but they haven't indicated what substantial, material, and \nrelevant questions the witnesses would be asked, which haven't already \nbeen asked, or why such questions are essential or even relevant to the \nresolution of this proceeding.\n  Frankly, I think this is because there just aren't that many more \nquestions to ask of these witnesses. Mr. Manager McCollum kind of let \nthe cat out of the bag on this one when, a week ago Friday, he told \nyou, ``I don't know what the witnesses will say, but I assume if they \nare consistent, they will say the same thing that's in here.''\n  I was surprised at some of the statements the managers made during \nthe questioning period on Friday and Saturday. Mr. Bryant said, ``We \nwould very much like to talk to some of these witnesses.'' And he \nadded, ``It is very critical that you talk to the witness before having \nthat witness testify.'' Mr. Manager McCollum stated, ``As a matter of \nfact, we think we would have been incompetent and derelict as \npresenters of the evidence if we hadn't talked to them first.'' Just \nthis Sunday Mr. Manager Hyde, on ``Meet the Press,'' observed that the \npurpose of the court-ordered Office of Independent Counsel's chaperoned \ninterview of Ms. Lewinsky last Sunday was to get a sense of what kind \nof a witness she would make.\n  I say this respectfully, but I am duty-bound to observe that it is, \nin fact, a dereliction of duty to have come this far in the process, to \nhave made this serious set of charges as have been made against the \nPresident to seek his removal, and not to have talked to the witnesses \non whom they purport to rely. How can they have come this far and now \ntell you: Oh, yes, we now need to meet face to face with the witnesses? \nWe don't know what they sound like, how credible they will be, but we \nhave rested our judgment on this. We need to see them personally.\n  This procedure, I submit to you, is just backward. First, they filed \nthe charges, which have been spoon fed by Mr. Starr. They don't bother \nto check these out; they take them at face value, and now they finally \nwant to talk to the witnesses, and they again use Mr. Starr to threaten \nMs. Lewinsky with imprisonment unless she cooperates with them.\n  Now, it is no answer to say that the witnesses didn't want to talk to \nus. There was a way to talk to them in the House of Representatives, \nand that was through the subpoena power that the House could have used \nif they had wanted to talk to their witnesses, if they had fulfilled \nthe obligation they had before they proffered these charges to you.\n  This has been a partisan process on the part of the House managers. \nIn the House, they had the votes. They didn't think they needed to talk \nto witnesses. When you have the votes and the independent counsel on \nyour side, you don't need to independently develop the evidence. \nIndeed, Sunday, on CNN, Mr. Manager Cannon provided some insight----\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I object to White House counsel's continual reference \nto comments made on television programs which are outside the record \nbefore the Senate.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is on a motion to call additional witnesses, \nand the argument has been very free form and kind of far reaching. I \nthink this is a permissible comment, so I overrule the objection.\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think Mr. \nManager Cannon's comments did provide some insight into the need for \nwitnesses or the justification for witnesses here. He noted that the \nRepublicans had lost five seats in the November election, and he went \non to say that, accordingly, the Republicans felt a need to speedily \ncomplete impeachment in the lame duck session before the 106th began \nits session. He said, ``Republicans on the Judiciary Committee were \ncommitted to being done by the time we got done,'' and that is where we \ngot on that track with no witnesses.\n  Now, they are trying to take a different track, and I think it comes \nfrom desperation. You have had the case analyzed before you; you have \nhad the evidence in the case assessed. I think it has been demolished \nin an adversary proceeding.\n  The House managers are like the character in David Copperfield, Mr. \nMicawber, who was always hoping that something would turn up. They \ncontinue to hope that something will turn up for them. They don't know \nwhat it is, but they believe they will know it when they see it and \nthey hope if, for the first time in these proceedings, they actually \ntalk to the witnesses on whom they have relied, they will find \nsomething to persuade you to overcome the evidence in the record.\n  Now the managers have said, ``Well, we told the White House that they \ncould have called witnesses in the House if they wanted to, and they \nchose not to do so, so it is really their fault.'' I respectfully \nsubmit to you that only in the world of Franz Kafka do you have to \npresent evidence of your own innocence before you even hear the charges \nor the allegations against you.\n  It was the burden of the House to establish, by an adequate \nevidentiary basis, a case for impeaching the President. They failed to \ndo that, I respectfully submit. They are a little like a blackjack \nplayer who sees 20 on the table and has 19 and is going to try to draw \nthat 2, hoping against the odds. Here they are simply gambling. And \ngambling may have its place as a recreation, but I don't think it has a \nplace in this impeachment trial when the fate of the President is at \nstake.\n  Now, I don't want to be uncharitable to the House managers--and they \nare able--but I think it is perhaps appropriate to remind you, as my \npartner Ms. Seligman did in her argument yesterday, that in their own \nChamber the House managers sang a very different song about the need \nfor witnesses. And to be fair, this was not just one manager; they sang \nas kind of a barbershop chorus. Most of them are on the record to this \neffect, and I think the very best witnesses you have about the need for \nwitnesses are the House managers themselves.\n  Let's listen to some of the comments of the managers on whether live \nwitnesses needed to be heard to supplement the evidence in the many \nvolumes already gathered by the independent counsel.\n  For example, on November 5, Mr. Manager Hyde said:\n\n       We believe the most relevant witnesses have already \n     testified at length about the matters in issue, and in the \n     interest of finishing our expeditious inquiry we will not \n     require most of them to come before us to repeat their \n     testimony.\n\n  He added that, ``[Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp] have already \ntestified under oath. We have their testimony. We don't need to \nreinvent the wheel.''\n  The very next day, on November 6, Mr. Manager Gekas stated:\n\n       Bringing in witnesses to rehash testimony that's already \n     concretely in the record would be a waste of time and serve \n     no purpose at all.\n\n  On December 1, during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee \nto which the committee received testimony concerning the consequences \nof perjury and related crime, Mr. Manager Chabot stated:\n\n       We could call more and more and more witnesses. We are \n     trying to get this wrapped up\n\n[[Page S1004]]\n\n     as expeditiously as possible. I think both sides want to do \n     that. If we call more witnesses and drag this on into next \n     year, then they are going to scream because they say we are \n     on a fishing expedition, we have already got enough evidence.\n\n  At that same period, Mr. Manager Canady said, of the need for \nwitnesses:\n\n       Now, we do have a responsibility to make certain that we \n     act on a solid basis. We should not move forward with \n     articles of impeachment on the basis of insubstantial \n     evidence. I think all of us agree on that. The fact of the \n     matter is that we have a mountain of sworn testimony. . . .\n\n  On December 9, Congressman Coble, who was a member of the House \nJudiciary Committee, told us during our presentation on behalf of the \nWhite House:\n\n       Mr. Ruff, I want to address a couple of myths and one myth \n     is that we have no evidence because there have been no fact \n     witnesses called . . .\n\n  Five volumes sit alongside me. These are the same five volumes that \nare at our table that contain sworn testimony before a criminal grand \njury, FBI interviews, depositions and other materials.\n  Mr. Manager Hyde made two statements on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives during the debate over the articles of impeachment \nwhich I think bear quotation here.\n  On December 18, Mr. Manager Hyde stated:\n\n       We had the facts, and we had them under oath. We had Ms. \n     Lewinsky's heavily corroborated testimony under a grant of \n     immunity that would be revoked if she lied; we accepted that \n     . . . .\n\n  And then the next day, on Saturday, December 19, Mr. Manager Hyde \nstated:\n\n       No fact witnesses, I have heard that repeated again and \n     again. Look, we had 60,000 pages of testimony from the grand \n     jury, from depositions, from statements under oath. That is \n     testimony that we can believe and accept. We chose to believe \n     it and accept it. Why reinterview Betty Currie to take \n     another statement when we already have her statement? Why \n     interview Monica Lewinsky when we had her statement under \n     oath, and with a grant of immunity that if she lied, she \n     would forfeit?\n\n  ``Why interview Monica Lewinsky when we had her statement under oath, \nand with a grant of immunity that if she lied, she would forfeit.''\n  After the House voted its two articles of impeachment, the House \nmanagers still sought no need for live witnesses. On December 29, Mr. \nManager Gekas stated:\n\n       We are going to make the case that there is already enough \n     testimony under oath, in one grand jury testimony and \n     affidavits.\n\n  Then again, a week later, Mr. Manager Gekas stated:\n\n       In my judgment, there might not be any real rationale for \n     calling Linda Tripp or Betty Currie or Vernon Jordan if the \n     testimony of Monica Lewinsky is accepted as being what she \n     offered on grand jury terms.\n\n  Rollcall reported on January 7 that Mr. Manager Cannon stated, \nregarding calling Ms. Currie as a witness in the Senate trial:\n\n       I am reluctant to call [Ms. Currie] because it's a rotten, \n     nasty thing to do to a public servant.\n\n  When confronted with this inconsistency, the managers, who are \ntalented attorneys and successful Congressmen, have all argued, ``Oh, \nwell. The forum has changed,'' as if it is no big deal for the House to \nimpeach a President without witnesses. But it would be unconscionable \nfor the Senate to acquit the President without first doing the \n``rotten, nasty thing''--Mr. Manager Cannon's phrase--to some \nwitnesses. How can you have a trial, they protest, without witnesses? \nOne might ask, How can you have a hearing without witnesses? But the \nHouse did. How can you impeach a President without witnesses? The House \nshowed you.\n  Finally, it is instructive to note that when the managers were \npresenting their case in the House in the Judiciary Committee, they did \nnot declare that they would insist on witnesses when they got to the \nSenate. They did not tell their colleagues, We will not need witnesses \nin the House because we will have them in the Senate. No. They rushed \nthis through the House because they had the votes and now they want to \ndelay in the Senate because they are afraid they don't have the votes.\n  There is no reason, we respectfully submit, to delay this Chamber, to \ndrag out these proceedings and defer doing the business of the American \npeople.\n  I would like to discuss each of the five categories. I will call them \ncategories. There are three witnesses. Then there are the two \naffidavits, and then there are the telephone records. There are really \nsix. I would like to discuss these in terms of whether they add \nanything, or whether the managers have made a proffer that they add \nanything to the record which is now before you, because I think that is \nthe question you have to determine.\n  On this motion, you are not voting whether substantively to convict \nthe President. You are simply determining, Is the record adequate?\n  Let's first take Ms. Lewinsky. On Sunday the House managers, with the \ngentle assistance of the independent counsel prosecutors, were able to \ninterview Ms. Lewinsky after schlepping her across the country from \nCalifornia. They did so despite the fact that the Senate had \nestablished by a 100-to-0 vote a procedure for the orderly calling of \nwitnesses after discussion and debate. They did so after declining to \ninterview Ms. Lewinsky at any time during the House proceedings when \nthey could have compelled her appearance by the House subpoena power. \nAnd they did so without providing us here with any reliable record for \nwhat that ``talk-fest'' on Sunday may have produced.\n  Newspaper reports indicate that the managers did not take notes. You \nwill recall, of course, that during the questioning period on Saturday \nthey explicitly rejected a request they received during the question \nperiod that they provide either an unedited transcript or a videotape \nof that interview to be sure that the interview would be open to \nscrutiny for fairness, and ascertain whether Ms. Lewinsky in that \ninterview really did add anything to the record. They declined to do \nthat. But when they emerged from the Mayflower Hotel on Sunday, after \nmeeting for their sidewalk press conference, we heard some general \nstatements generally commending Ms. Lewinsky. Mr. Manager Bryant called \nher ``an impressive person.'' Mr. Manager Hutchinson praised her \n``intelligence and poise.''\n  I thought to myself, where have we heard that before about Ms. \nLewinsky? It was deja vu all over again. Of course, we heard from Mr. \nJordan, from Ambassador Richardson, and from the people who interviewed \nMs. Lewinsky for a job in New York. It is helpful that the House \nmanagers have now at least confirmed those observations in the record.\n  At their press conference we heard the managers make some abstract \npronouncements about what Ms. Lewinsky was going to add--she would be a \nvaluable witness; she would be a helpful witness; and it was a \nproductive meeting and a benefit to our case.\n  That is what we heard. But Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Mr. Plato Cacheris \nthrew, if I might say, some cold water on those happy and optimistic \npronouncements. It could not have been clearer in his comments that, \nnot surprisingly, nothing new whatsoever had emerged from that session. \nYou really didn't hear that. I think the House managers were quite \nhonest about the session, because you heard nothing about what had \nemerged from that today.\n  Mr. Cacheris told the press conference--some of you may have seen it: \nMs. Lewinsky answered all their questions; there was nothing new; she \nadded nothing to the record that is already sitting before the Senate. \nShe shouldn't be called to the Senate to testify.\n  The New York Times reported yesterday that after the interview, Ms. \nLewinsky told a friend: It went really well; I feel positive about it, \nbut I didn't have anything new to say.\n  Now, according to the Washington Post, the managers were focused on \nmaking sure Ms. Lewinsky had no intention of changing her testimony. \nThe Washington Post went on to confirm that she did not indicate any \ndesire to change her testimony in any way. And the Post article \ncontinues that, in fact, Lewinsky reaffirmed her grand jury statement \nthat no one ever asked her to lie or offered her a job in exchange for \na false affidavit in the Jones case.\n  Now, as you are well aware, Ms. Lewinsky was interviewed extensively \nby the Office of Independent Counsel. She testified twice before the \ngrand jury. She gave a lengthy deposition to the prosecutors. She was \nextensively interviewed by the agents. There are over 20 interview \nreports.\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\n  I should also add that a great deal of this comes after the President \nwas examined in the grand jury on August 17. Ms. Lewinsky has given \ndetailed and explicit testimony, particularly in her August 26 \ndeposition, as to her account of the physical relationship she had with \nthe President. Nothing at all would be added by further interrogation \nof her. Nothing could be gained by repetition in a Senate deposition or \nin the well of this body by a repetition of that testimony.\n  I confess I don't fully understand--I seem to hear Mr. Manager Bryant \nand Mr. Manager McCollum say slightly different things about what they \nintended to present in the way of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony. The record \non that is what it is. But whenever I hear somebody tell me, as the \nvery able Mr. Manager Bryant did, they don't need to cross-examine, \nreally, I am reminded of what Senator Bumpers said, and he got it from \nH.L. Mencken, who probably got it from somebody else: The more they say \nthey don't have to cross-examine, the more need I feel to cross-\nexamine.\n  I don't know what they intended to do there, but in the grand jury \nthe President plainly acknowledged an improper relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky. He declined to answer further key questions about that. The \nOffice of Independent Counsel did not seek either to compel him or it \ndidn't seek to issue a new grand jury subpoena which would cause the \nPresident to come back and go through those explicit details.\n  The testimony is what it is, and I don't think anything further from \nMs. Lewinsky is going to in any material way affect it or even add to \nit.\n  With regard to some of the conflicts that are there, I think we have \naddressed those in the question period. I am not going to go over them \nagain in full. Did the improper relationship begin in November? Did it \nbegin 6 or 7 weeks later? That conflict is utterly immaterial, I \nrespectfully submit, in view of what the parties have acknowledged. Mr. \nManager Hyde, indeed, stated in a House Judiciary Committee hearing on \nDecember 1 that that particular point did not strike him as a terribly \nserious count, and I agree with that.\n  The managers have claimed, Mr. Manager Hutchinson claimed this \nmorning, that there is a contradiction in the President, in the \ntestimony of the President and Ms. Lewinsky with regard to cover \nstories. This is not true. We have gone over that again and again. \nThere is nothing that links this testimony to any deposition in the \nJones case. These were discussed, the record shows, in a nonlegal \ncontext.\n  I don't think there is anything further to be gained from Ms. \nLewinsky's testimony that is not already there in the record.\n  Now, Mr. Vernon Jordan, let's take him. Mr. Manager Hutchinson was \nkind enough to leave up here his copies of Mr. Vernon Jordan's five \nappearances before the grand jury. He held them up on a chart. I think \nit is proper to point out that Mr. Jordan's testimony runs over 900 \npages. On March 3, the transcript is 196 pages; 2 days later, on March \n5, with the transcript running to 212 pages, Mr. Jordan emerged from \nthe grand jury, and he made the following statement which I would like \nto play for you:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       First of all it is a fact that I helped Monica Lewinsky \n     find private employment in New York. Secondly, it is a fact \n     that I took Monica Lewinsky to a very competent lawyer, Frank \n     Carter, here in Washington, D.C. And thirdly, it is a fact \n     that I kept the President of the United States informed about \n     my activities. I want to say two further things. One is I did \n     not in any way tell her, encourage her, to lie. And secondly \n     that my efforts to find her a job were not a quid pro quo for \n     the affidavit that she signed.\n\n  Mr. Jordan testified a third time before the grand jury on May 5, and \nthat transcript runs to 285 pages. Finally, he testified two more \ntimes, on May 28, for 128 pages, and he observed as he exited the grand \njury room, if we could have the videotape again:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       For the fourth time I have answered every question over and \n     over and over again. I suspect, however that I will have to \n     answer the same questions over and over and over again.\n\n  And guess what. Mr. Jordan was clairvoyant because he was called back \nto the grand jury for a fifth time on June 9. He said as he exited:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       When I came here in March, early March, I said that I \n     helped Ms. Lewinsky get a lawyer. I helped her get a job. I \n     had assurances that there was no sexual relationship and I \n     did not tell her to lie. That was the truth then. And that is \n     the truth today. And I've testified five times, over and over \n     again to those truths.\n\n  One of the justifications Mr. Manager Hutchinson offered for calling \nMr. Jordan was to explore an alleged conflict between Mr. Jordan and \nMs. Lewinsky over whether Mr. Jordan had told her to go home and make \nsure that notes she had been keeping were not there. Here, I think Mr. \nManager Hutchinson is referencing a statement that Ms. Lewinsky made in \nher proffer to the Office of Independent Counsel describing her \nrecollection of a breakfast she believed she had with Mr. Jordan. It is \nin the appendix volume at page 716.\n  Now, the thing to note, ladies and gentlemen, about this statement is \nits date. Ms. Lewinsky said this on February 1, 1998. She had written \nthen that she expressed concern about Ms. Tripp to Mr. Jordan and that \nMs. Tripp may have seen notes when she was in Ms. Lewinsky's house. \nAccording to the offer, ``Mr. Jordan asked if the notes were from the \nPresident. Ms. Lewinsky said that they were notes to the President. Mr. \nJordan suggested to Ms. Lewinsky,'' the proffer says, ``that she check \nto make sure they were not there, or something to that effect,'' from \nMs. Lewinsky.\n  Now, contrary to this supposed conflict, Mr. Jordan was never asked \nin the grand jury on any of the five occasions he was there--all of \nwhich, I remind you, were after this February 1 proffer about this \nmatter. He wasn't asked about it. It doesn't concern the President, in \nany event. And I think, most importantly, it is nowhere alleged, if you \nlook in the actual articles--if you look at article II, nowhere is this \nconversation alleged in any way as a basis for impeachment, a basis for \ncharging the President with obstruction. I think in fact it is a \ngratuitous smear of Mr. Jordan. And it certainly does not provide a \nbasis for extending this proceeding to ask him questions about it.\n  Now, Mr. Manager Hutchinson also claims that there is a conflict \nbetween the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan on the issue of \nwhether they discussed specific changes that were subsequently made in \nher affidavit. He said to you that he thought that was a basis for \ncalling them as witnesses. However, the record is clear, it could not \nbe clearer, that the idea of certain deletions in the affidavit came \nfrom Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Mr. Frank Carter.\n  As I mentioned in my presentation on Thursday, Ms. Lewinsky discussed \nthat she had talked to Mr. Jordan about some affidavit changes and he \ntold her: Go talk to your lawyer.\n  In any event, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Mr. Frank Carter, testified \nunequivocally to the grand jury: I don't recall Vernon ever asking me \nthe substance of what Monica told me or tried to talk about the \nsubstance of what Monica told me. He clearly never told me how I should \nproceed or what I should do.\n  Mr. Carter further testified that paragraph 6 of the affidavit in its \ndraft form, the last part of the sentence, ``has certain words about \nthe private meeting.''\n  That paragraph, Mr. Carter--Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer--testified, was \nmodified when we sat down in my office on January 7. He further \ntestified that it was his idea before that meeting to take it out \nbecause he didn't want to give Ms. Jones' lawyers any hint of a one-on-\none meeting.\n  There is simply no basis to call Mr. Vernon Jordan once again to have \nhim go through the things he has testified about a great many times \nalready.\n  Now we come to Sidney Blumenthal. Mr. Manager Rogan very ably argued \nthat there was a need to call Mr. Blumenthal because of Mr. \nBlumenthal's testimony as to what the President had told him, Sidney \nBlumenthal, in the aftermath of the explosion of publicity over the \nLewinsky matter in January a year ago.\n  First of all, there is no conflict here that is material because the \nPresident has never disputed Mr. Blumenthal or his aide's accounts of \nthis conversation. Any dispute is wholly immaterial as to the two \ncounts--the two articles of impeachment. The President was examined \nextensively about this subject\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\nin his own grand jury testimony and he testified as to what he tried to \nsay. But he also added that in this period things were a ``blur,'' is a \nterm he used one time; ``a blizzard'' was a term he used another time--\nthat he had discussions with a number of his aides, including Mr. \nBlumenthal, he tried to be careful in what he said, he thought he was \ntechnically accurate, but he would not dispute and did not dispute \ntheir characterizations of what they recalled of the conversations with \nhim.\n  Again, Mr. Blumenthal--Mr. Rogan pointed this out--testified three \ntimes before the grand jury. His recollection of his conversations with \nthe President has been analyzed in detail and a further round of \ndeposition would add nothing of substance to that testimony. Indeed, \nthe President's speech to the Nation the day of his grand jury \ntestimony, when he spoke to the Nation on the evening of August 17, \nalso represented an acknowledgment by the President that he had misled \nhis aides, such as Sidney Blumenthal.\n\n  As I indicated last Thursday, however, any statements to the White \nHouse staff could have had no impact whatsoever on the Paula Jones \ncase, as article II alleges each of the seven grounds has, because Mr. \nBlumenthal had no firsthand knowledge of the President's relation with \nMs. Lewinsky. He could only report to the grand jury what the President \nhad told him, however misleading those statements of the President may \nhave been at the time. There is no dispute here, there is no material \nreason to call Mr. Blumenthal, except to try to embarrass the President \nby the presentation of testimony from a member of his senior staff.\n  Now, the next two things that the managers would seek to add to the \nrecord are not, they tell you, live witness testimony. But don't let \nthat fool you. They want to put in two sworn declarations--like an \naffidavit--from two people. One of them is a Mr. Wesley Holmes, a \nlawyer for Ms. Paula Jones, and the other is Mr. Barry Ward.\n  Now, I don't have the pleasure of knowing Mr. Wesley Holmes, but I do \nknow Mr. Barry Ward. He is a very intelligent, very hard-working and \nknowledgeable young lawyer in Little Rock, AR, who works as a law clerk \nfor Chief Judge Wright. He has got an encyclopedic knowledge of \nRazorback athletic lore. He has a lot of fine characteristics. He is \nvery helpful as a law clerk and gets information to you and back very \nefficiently. But there is one thing Mr. Ward is not, and I am sure he \nwould agree with that, he is not a mind reader. He is not a mind \nreader. There were a number of people in the room at the deposition. \nNone of them were mind readers. They could all give their testimony \nabout what they thought was going through the President's mind. The \nPresident has addressed that a number of times. You have seen the \nvideotape.\n  Now, the second witness is exceedingly interesting, and that is Mr. \nHolmes. And Mr. Holmes would give a sworn declaration to, among other \nthings, say what he had in mind when he issued the witness subpoena to \nBetty Currie which was several days--which was days after the \nPresident's conversation with her on December 18.\n  Well, he would be a very interesting witness to depose, let me tell \nyou. This is one of Paula Jones' lawyers talking about offering a \ndeclaration about his litigation strategy. And I think the opportunity \nto depose him would provide a great deal of information about what \nreally motivated the events of January 1998. I think we could show that \nthere were a number of connections between the independent counsel, \nLinda Tripp, and the Paula Jones lawyers. But I don't think you need to \nget into that briar patch because Mr. Holmes is not a mind reader any \nmore than Mr. Ward is. You simply don't need that testimony to \nilluminate the record.\n  Now, the last category--let me just, before I leave that, make the \npoint that while the managers would like very much to throw in a couple \nof sworn declarations, you should be assured of our need to take \ndiscovery and, in Mr. Holmes' case, take comprehensive discovery. I \ndon't think anything in S. Res. 16--I don't know if you have gotten to \nthis, but I don't read the resolution as authorizing simple hearsay \nevidence.\n  We would need to depose the Paula Jones lawyers in some detail, and I \nthink they have now waived significant legal protections that would \nmake that possible.\n  Finally, there was a category of telephone records. It is a little \nhard to address that category. Those are just documents. I don't think \nthe record need be expanded by their addition, and I will tell you why.\n  Telephone records, as I said the other day, really tell you nothing, \nunless--it is very important to time, to date a particular call. They \nreally are inscrutable. You have to have the witness testify about what \nthey mean. I don't see anything in there that would justify opening the \nrecord to add certain telephone records.\n  Finally, I want to be candid with you. I don't want to be alarmist, I \nwant to be honest, though, about what opening the door for discovery \nwill mean for this process. I said before that the Senate had been fair \nin these proceedings, and it has been fair. I think the identification \nof a specific record which the parties could agree on, have in the \nsunlight, talk about, argue about, was the fair thing to do and the \nright thing to do. I think if discovery is inevitable, we will \nanticipate and believe that you will be fair in allowing us the \ndiscovery we are going to need.\n  I ask you, if you would, to read our trial memorandum, because at \npages 124 to 130 we have set forth there our need for discovery. It is \nnot a new invention. Should the Senate decide to authorize the House \nmanagers to call additional witnesses live in this proceeding or have \nthe depositions taken, we will be faced with a critical need for the \ndiscovery of evidence useful to our defense.\n  I made the point that the discovery of evidence in the Office of the \nIndependent Counsel proceeding was--not to put too fine a point on it--\nnot aimed at getting us exculpatory or helpful evidence. We need to be \nable to do that. We have never had the kind of compulsory process, the \nkind of ability to subpoena documents and witnesses that you will have \nin a garden variety civil case. We have not had access to a great deal, \nmany thousands of pages of evidence which is, first of all, in the \nhands of the House managers that they got from the Office of \nIndependent Counsel, but did not put into the public record, did not \nprint up. We also need discovery of those other documents, witness \ntestimony transcripts, interview notes, other materials, which may be \nhelpful or exculpatory that are in the hands of the independent \ncounsel.\n  Our dilemma is this: We do not know what we do not know. That is what \ndiscovery means. You have to get discovery so you can find out what is \navailable. It may not necessarily prolong a trial, but it makes you \navailable to defend your client in the way you have to be able to do as \na lawyer. It doesn't turn on the number of witnesses.\n  The calling of these witnesses produces a need in us to be ready to \nexamine them, to cross-examine them. It initiates a process that leaves \nus unprepared and exposed unless we have adequate discovery. This is a \nproceeding, I need not remind you--I know everyone recognizes its \ngravity--to remove the President of the United States. You have to give \nus, and I believe you will, the discovery that will enable us to \nrepresent the President adequately, competently and effectively.\n  The sequence of discovery is also important. I want to be clear about \nthat. It is all very well and I recognize how it happens for one side \nto say, ``Well, we are going to put on three witnesses and they can put \non three witnesses.'' Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, we don't know \nright now how to make a reasoned choice because we haven't had the \ndiscovery you would normally have to do that. We would first need to \nobtain and review the relevant documents. I have indicated where those \nare. We would then need to be able to depose relevant witnesses. We \nneed to know whether the witness depositions that the House managers \nhad taken would need to lead to other depositions there. Only at that \npoint when we have had discovery of our witnesses will we be able to \nidentify the witnesses we might want to call.\n  This is a logical procedure, and I think those of you who have tried \ncases will recognize it as such. It is simply impossible from where we \nnow are to see how a witness designated by the House managers can be \nfairly rebutted without ourselves having access to all of the available \nevidence.\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\n  Given what is at stake, I think fundamental fairness requires fair \ndiscovery. We will be expeditious, but in the event the genie is out of \nthe bottle, we need time, we need access to defend the President in the \nway any client ought to be defended.\n  I think the Senate has wisely elected to proceed on a voluminous \nrecord, a record that is available for public scrutiny that was \nassembled by people not favorable to the President. I think you have \nenough evidence to make your decision on the basis of that record.\n  But in the event you decide to expand it, affording us adequate \ndiscovery is essential if we are really going to practice the rule of \nlaw as I believe the Senate would intend for that rule of law to be \npracticed in its proceedings.\n\n  But let me conclude by saying that I don't think, and I respectfully \nsubmit to you, that there is a need to prolong this process. We hope \nthat you will render your decision in a manner that is speedy, and we \nare confident that you will decide to make that decision in a manner \nthat is fair, and that this body will, as so often it has done in past \ntimes of crisis, be able to bring to the country both the closure and \nreconciliation that the country wants so very much. Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Does counsel for the President have any more \npresentation?\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. No, you can't reserve it. It is open, respond and \nrebuttal.\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. I will then quitclaim the rest of my time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice, may I inquire how much \nrebuttal time we have remaining?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I will be brief and \nask other managers to come up and follow me. I have four quick points \nto make.\n  Before I get into that, I want to thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom DC, Mr. Kendall. Over my practice of law for several years, I have \nreceived a number of jabs before in the courtroom, but never so gentle \nand never so eloquently, and I thank you.\n  I think his presentation was very good, but probably makes the best \nillustration of why witnesses are needed in that he has chosen to use \nselective quotes. He likes to use those quotes and point to the \nmanagers over there where we were quoted without a real context and \ncertainly that is what this hearing has been about so far, both sides \npicking and choosing among quotes that best illustrate the point we \nwant to make at the time.\n  Really, what we need is the big picture, the entire, complete picture \nthat witnesses and only witnesses can provide in this case.\n  Let me go back to a couple of the selective quotes, and that is the \nquotes that we made back in the House when we were involved in the \nproceedings, which I would remind each one of you involved these very \nsame stacks of books here, the record, that they have shown you in the \npast in a very, I guess very often form, that this is the record here; \nwhy do we need to go outside the record? That very same record was \nthere in the House, and it was at that time Mr. Lowell, the minority \ncounsel, was representing the President's interests, but also Mr. \nKendall was there. In fact, both together examined Mr. Starr. That was \nwhen they were making the request for the witnesses, based on this very \nsame record. Notwithstanding that, we need witnesses. I simply point \nthat out to you to show you that Mr. Kendall and his very talented \nstaff do not have a monopoly on consistency.\n  Another example of selective quoting has to do with quotes made about \nour occasion to visit Ms. Lewinsky, to talk to her. This was the one \nwitness we have not been able to talk to. He pulled those quotes out as \nif we need to talk to all the witnesses. We don't need to talk to all \nthe witnesses, but we just need to sit down and talk with her. I might \ntell you she was ably represented by three attorneys. She had as many \nlawyers there as we did and perhaps more. So she was not imposed upon.\n  I think in terms of my statement about discovery, I think I perhaps \nwas misunderstood, but I certainly conceded the White House might want \ndiscovery to depose Ms. Lewinsky, but I still have a hard time \ndetermining why they would need to discover what Ms. Currie might want \nto say, who sits right outside the President's office every day, or \nwhat Mr. Jordan might say, who plays golf with Mr. Clinton every day, \nor Mr. Podesta, his former Chief of Staff.\n  I am just trying to save this Senate some time and question why we \nwould need to go through discovery of those types of people.\n  My last point I would like to make before I bring Mr. Hutchinson in \nis Mr. Kendall makes a point, and I am not sure where they were going \nin perhaps trying to worse case this situation, in terms of taking \nforever and a day to conclude all kinds of witnesses. He alluded we \nneeded to take all the lawyers of Paula Jones and question her \nmotivation. I suggest to you that a real clue for her motivation for \nthis lawsuit, we could say, was the 850,000 reasons motivation she \nreceived the other day. But let me end with that note and bring up Mr. \nHutchinson who will continue this process.\n\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Hutchinson.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I will just \ntake a moment.\n  Mr. Kendall did an outstanding job, as he always does, of making his \ncase for not calling witnesses. I thought the most compelling example \nas to why we need witnesses was the fact that he called a live witness, \nVernon Jordan. Mr. Jordan testified here in this Chamber. Why did they \nnot present a transcript? Why did he want to bring a live witness? \nBecause it was real. It was alive. He was more meaningful than a \ntranscript. He told the story in short, concise ways that I have not \nbeen able to do during my presentation during the last week. We would \nlike to have the same opportunity, not through video, but to present a \nlive witness so that he could cross-examine, so that we could question. \nI think that is a fair proceeding.\n  Now, Mr. Kendall raised the point that the statements about the notes \nthat Ms. Lewinsky testified she discussed with Mr. Jordan were \nreferenced in her February 1998 proffer. When I was making my point, I \nwas referencing her August grand jury testimony, not the February \nproffer, because my recollection is that the February proffer that was \nsubmitted by Mr. Ginsburg had subsequently become a subject of \nlitigation because we were not able to reach an immunity agreement. So \nperhaps that was the reason that subject was not inquired into by the \nindependent counsel. For whatever reason, my review of the transcripts \nis that that subject was never broached with Mr. Jordan. I do not \nprofess perfect knowledge of it, but that is my understanding of it.\n  And then finally I want to also look at the discovery that Mr. Bryant \nreferenced. There was a gambling illustration that Mr. Kendall used \nabout blackjack. But another part of poker is bluffs. And I don't know \nwhether they are bluffing. I don't know whether they are serious about \nall the discovery that they need to have. But I know that lawyers do \nthat sometimes to intimidate, to scare you away.\n  But I think even more important is that the House managers have \nsubmitted to the rules of the Senate. We were not particularly happy \nabout all of them, but we recognized it was important to have \nlegitimacy in this process. We accept that. We move on.\n  I hope that whatever rules of discovery, whatever limitations you \nwish to put, whatever timeframes you wish to put, that the White House \ncounsel will be as amenable to the desire of this Senate and this \nNation to conclude this as we have been in adopting what our desires \nare to your schedule.\n  I yield to Mr. McCollum.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager McCollum.\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you very much.\n  I want to make a couple of observations, and one of them seems pretty \napparent. Mr. Kendall says they are not afraid and I was wrong in \ncharacterizing them as being afraid--the White House counsel--of \ncalling witnesses. But I am going to tell you, I cannot rationalize any \nother way why he would\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nbe out here to make the pitch as hard as he is against witnesses, \nespecially the sort of threat that this is going to go on and on and on \nif we open the door and we call three witnesses. You know, we are down \nfrom thinking we ought to have 10, 12, maybe 15 witnesses, to 3--Monica \nLewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal. And we have introduced \nthree--or proposed to introduce three very simple pieces of new \nevidence. That can't take a lot of discovery, the need to go further \nthan that. You know, if he wants to produce witnesses, that is fine. \nBut I just can't imagine why that opens that door.\n  Mr. Holmes, he talks about, the attorney. What is the significance of \nthat declaration or affidavit, that sworn declaration that we would \nlike you to take in that says, ``well, we have to depose Mr. Holmes. \nThat was put in very simply because the counsel on the other side--I \ndon't accuse them of doing it intentionally--but the other day they \nmisled us, I think unintentionally misled you, on the idea that the \nPresident, at the time he left the deposition in the Jones case and \nwent over to talk to Betty Currie the next day, didn't and couldn't \nhave had any idea that she was going to be called as a witness. In \nfact, I think they said she never was on the witness list and she never \nwas subpoenaed.\n  What Mr. Holmes' declaration does, as I said earlier, is bring into \nthe record the subpoena that in fact was issued within a day or so of \nthat time of when Betty Currie was talked to. Remember, she was talked \nto twice, the notice about it and her name being put on the witness \nlist--that is what that is all about--and a general explanation of why \nthey chose, as attorneys, to make that case, why they chose to put her \nname out there, and subpoena her, so it is clear on the record.\n  Very simple. If you look at it--and I am sure you will have it before \nyou--his declaration is very short. It is like three paragraphs. And it \ngoes straight to the point. And it encloses these accompanying \ndocuments.\n\n  I don't think you should, for one minute, think it opens the door to \nsome great big, gigantic discovery period. That is simply an idle \nthreat to intimidate, in my judgment--with a proper intimidation \neffort, proper tactic; I don't accuse him of anything improper--to try \nto discourage you from letting us have these three witnesses.\n  Second, I want to point out that with respect to some of the things \nthat I said, one thing I did say earlier is I don't know what all the \nwitnesses would say if we called them. I don't know what they all would \nsay, certainly. But I would expect them all to be consistent with what \nthey have already said in their sworn testimony. And there is nothing \ninconsistent with my expecting them to be consistent on the facts.\n  We already know with that sworn testimony in the case of Monica \nLewinsky--she has immunity--that if she deviates and goes off of it, \nshe can get herself in trouble. But by no means does my expectation \nthat the testimony you already have will remain true mean that I don't \nthink there are new things to be brought out or that you shouldn't have \nlive witnesses here.\n  And I thought it interesting that Mr. Kendall totally ignored the one \nthing that was most significant, in my mind, and that is, the whole \nidea that there is a need for witnesses out here to determine their \ncredibility, to check their demeanor, to see how they respond to \nquestioning, to do all of those things that I described earlier, that \nany reasonable attorney in any courtroom setting in this country in a \ncriminal case--and you do have to decide whether the crimes were \ncommitted or not--would expect to do. So you can, as my colleagues have \nsaid, look them in the eye and make that determination yourself. He \ndidn't even address that. And I think that that alone is sufficiently \ngood reason to have a live witness here, as I said before to you.\n  So with that in mind, I will yield to Mr. Rogan.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Rogan.\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, Mr. \nKendall made a very able and strong presentation. It was particularly \neffective when he brought up a series of quotations from House Members \nand House managers talking about the need for witnesses or the lack \nthereof. It would be more effective if it were presented in context, \nbut it could not be, because the context of every single one of those \nquotations was in reference to the distinction between the House's \nfunction as the accusatory body versus the Senate's constitutional \nfunction of being the body where an impeachment case is tried. There he \nblurs the distinction. That is why in the Constitution a President is \nimpeached solely on the majority vote. But removal requires at the \ntrial a two-thirds vote.\n  Now, Mr. Kendall's presentation begs the question, did the founders \nget it wrong when they designed this process? Did the founders simply \nintend for us to waste our resources rather than conserve them and \nsimply do the very same thing, first in one body and then in the other, \nwith the sole distinction that the only difference would be the \nultimate vote? That was not their intent. That was not the procedure \nestablished by the Constitution. And it is not the procedure recognized \nthroughout the country in court proceedings.\n  There is a reason why courts of inferior jurisdiction will be able to \nhold a defendant in a criminal case to answer for trial at a \npreliminary hearing based on hearsay testimony, based on transcripts, \nbased solely on police reports.\n  But that defendant at a trial has a constitutional right to come \nforward. And the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses is \nsupremely guaranteed in the Constitution, because the Framers \nunderstood the difference, even if White House counsel refuses to \nacknowledge the difference.\n  Now the argument they have really isn't with the House managers. \nTheir argument is with the precedence of the House. Their argument, in \nfact, is with people like the venerable Barbara Jordan, our late \ndistinguished former colleague. She understood the difference between \nthe House's function in an impeachment role versus the Senate's \nfunction. She said during the Rodino hearings in establishing the \ndivision between the two branches of the legislature, the House and the \nSenate:\n\n       Assigning to one the right to accuse and to the other the \n     right to judge, the Framers of the Constitution were very \n     astute. They did not make the accusers and the judges the \n     same person.\n\n  Now, in the words of Yogi Berra, ``I fear that we are going through \ndeja vu all over again'' with Mr. Kendall's able proceeding, because \nwhat he has accentuated in this presentation has been accentuated by \nWhite House counsel ever since they first rose to address this body at \nthe lectern, and that is the complaint that no witnesses were called \nbefore the House Judiciary Committee, and how wrong it is for members \nof the House managers now to assert the need and the right to have \nwitnesses before this body when, in fact, no witnesses were called \nbefore the Judiciary Committee.\n  Once again, he mistakes the function of the two Houses. But I would \ninvite the Members of this body, if that is an issue concerning them, \nto go back and review the voluminous transcripts during the Judiciary \nCommittee where Chairman Hyde did everything but get on his knees and \nbeg the members of the President's defense team, beg our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, to identify for us which witnesses they \nwished to dispute, what facts they wanted to challenge, let us know who \nthe witnesses are where there is a contention in the evidence, and \ndespite their complaining, and despite their griping and despite their \nanger over a supposedly unfair process, they never once identified in \nthe factual record whose testimony they wished to challenge.\n  What we heard repeatedly, day after day in the hearing and outside \nbefore the cameras, was an attack upon the process rather than an \nidentification of the issues where there are factual disputes. In fact, \nthey refused to identify, despite the repeated pleas of Chairman Hyde, \nwho those witnesses were that they felt were appropriate, because the \nchairman said, ``Tell us who they are, we will call them.''\n  They champion the cause of witnesses in word but they do not champion \nthe cause of witnesses in deed, at least not in the House, because the \nsame people who were complaining of the unfairness in the House for not \nhaving witnesses suddenly have an allergic reaction to the concept of \nwitnesses being called before this body where it counts the most, where \nthe ultimate decision is to be made, where\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\nthe triers of fact have to make the constitutional decision whether the \ncase is sufficient for removal of the President.\n  And Mr. Kendall's repeated hints and statements that somehow they \nwere denied some form of due process in the House by not being able to \ncall witnesses is patently unfair and does not withstand the test of \nthe record. Chairman Hyde alluded to it a couple of days ago, and based \nupon Mr. Kendall's presentation, I feel it is worth a minute or two of \nthis body's time. Mr. Kendall has stated in these proceedings, and I am \nquoting:\n\n       We have never had the chance to call witnesses ourselves, \n     to examine them, to cross-examine them, to subpoena \n     documentary evidence--at no point in this process.\n\n  The record is to the contrary:\n  On October 5, the House passed a procedure by a voice vote which \nincluded the right to call witnesses. On October 21, the House \nJudiciary Committee staff met with Messrs. Ruff, Kendall and Craig. At \nthat time, Judiciary Committee staff asked the White House to provide \nany exculpatory information and provide a list of any witnesses the \nPresident wished to call. On November 9, the House Judiciary Committee \nstaff wrote to Messrs. Ruff, Kendall and Craig and again informed them \nof the President's right to call witnesses. On November 19, Independent \nCounsel Starr testified before the House Judiciary Committee. The \nPresident's counsel was given the opportunity to question the \nindependent counsel. The President's counsel did not ask a question \nrelating to the facts of the independent counsel's report and \nallegations against the President. On November 25, Chairman Hyde wrote \na letter to the President asking the President, among other things, to \nprovide any exculpatory information and inform the committee of any \nwitnesses he wished to call. On December 4, 2 working days before the \npresentation of the President to the Judiciary Committee, counsel for \nthe President requested to put on 15 witnesses. The White House was \nallowed to present all 15 witnesses, and not a single one of the 15 \nwitnesses did they wish to call, that they asked to call, were factual \nwitnesses.\n\n  And so the complaints of unfairness are unfair.\n  One other point I want to make, because again I see a reversal in \nroles, is that Mr. Kendall can't seem to decide in what type of \n``ogre'' role he wants to portray us, because he said in his \npresentation just a few minutes ago that we were somehow--at least he \nalluded to the fact we were somehow tools of Judge Starr and the Office \nof Independent Counsel. I was a little surprised to hear him suggest \nthat Judge Starr spoon-fed us the charges, and that Judge Starr spoon-\nfed them to us to the point where he didn't know whether Judge Starr \nshould be deemed an honorary member of the House management team.\n  Well, that is an interesting proposition, because it seemed to me \njust a day or two ago the same lawyers who are now making this \nallegation were claiming constitutional unfairness before this body and \nasking that this body dismiss the articles of impeachment. Why? Because \nthe House Judiciary Committee and the managers didn't present the exact \nsame charges that the independent counsel suggested. You can't have it \nboth ways. You can't fashion the argument depending on what the result \nis being sought, and yet that is exactly what the managers with the \nWhite House counsel are attempting to do.\n  Yesterday we were renegades who didn't follow the strict rules of \nJudge Starr and didn't give them proper notice. Now, of course, he is \nthe marionette and we are the puppets doing his will.\n  Members of this body, it is the job of the House of Representatives, \nit is the constitutional obligation of the House of Representatives, to \nact as the accusatory body in an impeachment proceeding. The \nConstitution gives the authority to this body the right to try that \ncase. This is the place for trial. This is the place to determine \nguilt. This is the place to determine credibility. This is the place \nfor witnesses.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the remainder of our time to our \ndistinguished chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Hyde. Mr. Manager \nHyde, you have 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. I won't use the entire 9 minutes.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished counsel and Senators, I will be very \nbrief. Mr. Rogan and my colleagues have handled this very well, but \nthere are just a couple of things I want to talk about.\n  It is disturbing, it is annoying, it is irritating when I hear that \nthe counsel for the President had been cut off from information, that \nwe have sequestered things. I pleaded with them to produce witnesses, \nmade the subpoenas available to them. They have a positive allergy to \nfact witnesses.\n  Oh, they will come up with academics. We saw a parade of professors. \nYou know what an intellectual is? It is someone who is educated beyond \ntheir intelligence. I certainly don't mean that of some of those \nHarvard professors who they paraded out, even though we disagreed with \nthem, but you would get eye strain looking for a fact witness.\n  And it is remarkable, the flexibility they have, that they complain \nthat we called no witnesses in the House. Now they are complaining that \nwe are calling witnesses in the Senate as though they don't understand \nthe difference in the threshold. There we had to prove we had enough to \nsubmit to the Senate for a trial but not try it over there. And a \nmajority vote prevails over there. Here, you have an extraordinary \nmountain to climb: a two-thirds vote and the trial is here, and that is \nthe difference.\n  And witnesses help you. They won't help me. I know the record. I am \nsatisfied a compelling case is here for removal of the President. But \nthey will help you. And we aren't dragging this out. We have been as \nswift as decency will let us be throughout this entire situation.\n  Their defense has never been on the facts. If they can come up with a \ngood fact witness that has something to say, we will see a reenactment \nof the Indian rope trick, it seems to me. We will see professors, \nthough, if past is prologue. I don't know. But the threat of prolonged \nhearings, I suppose, is supposed to make you tremble. It doesn't to me, \nbut then different things--different strokes, I guess, for different \nfolks. Their defense has been to demonize Mr. Starr to a fare-thee-well \nand then yell about the process. That is their defense.\n\n  I will be frank with you. I am not sure I could stand a lot more of \nthat. But that is what they will do. As far as the information not \navailable to them, maybe not. Maybe some of the stuff we got from the \nindependent counsel was held in executive session, but it was available \nto Mr. Conyers, available to Abbe Lowell, available to every Democrat \non the Judiciary Committee, and they went through it. I wrote with Mr. \nConyers to Mr. Starr a letter saying, ``Show us what you didn't send \nus. Let's look at what you have over there. There might be some \nexculpatory material.'' Mr. Conyers sent his people over and they \nlooked and they looked and they looked, and I would assume they were in \ntouch with you folks. I would assume they were. If they weren't, they \nshould have been. That is a breakdown in communication.\n  We have a good case. We have an excellent case without the witnesses. \nBut the witnesses help you. We have narrowed it down to three--a \npitiful three. I should think you would want to proceed with that \nminimum testimony, and Mr. Kendall can try his cross-examination skills \non them, and that I want to watch.\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The time of both sides has now expired. The Chair \nrecognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, in view of the time that we have been in \nwithout a break, the next pending business is that we would want to \nhave a motion by Senator Harkin or Senator Wellstone. Before we do \nthat, I suggest that, without objection, we take a 15-minute break.\n  There being no objection, at 3:42 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n4:04 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that during each\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\nday the Senate sits as a Court of Impeachment, it be in order for \nSenators to submit to the desk statements and introduce legislation.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. In the absence of objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Now, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe at this point it would be \nin order for a motion to be made that we go into open debate, if any, \nand then when that is dispensed with, we would go to the move to close \nand would deal with that issue, and then we would begin the closed \nsession. And so I believe we are ready for a motion to be offered, if \nany, at this time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin.\n\n\n                      Motion to Suspend the Rules\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, in accordance with rule V of the \nSenate's Standing Rules, I filed a motion of intent to move to suspend \nthe rules to open debate on this motion to subpoena witnesses. The \nmotion is at the desk. It is No. 5, I believe.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, for himself and Mr. \n     Wellstone, moves to suspend the following portions of the \n     Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on \n     Impeachment Trials in regard to debate by Senators on a \n     motion to subpoena witnesses during the trial of President \n     William Jefferson Clinton.\n       (1) The phrase ``without debate'' in rule VII.\n       (2) The following portion of rule XX: ``, unless the Senate \n     shall direct the doors to be closed while deliberating upon \n     its decisions. A motion to close the doors may be acted upon \n     without objection, or, if objection is heard, the motion \n     shall be voted on without debate and by yeas and nays, which \n     shall be entered on the record''; and\n       (3) In rule XXIV, the phrases, ``without debate except when \n     the doors shall be closed for deliberation in that case'' and \n     ``, to be had without debate.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the budget neutrality adjustment factor used in calculating \nthe blended capitation rate for Medicare+Choice organizations; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               medicare+choice payment equity act of 1999\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my colleague from Oregon Senator \nGordon Smith, and I are introducing this legislation today to correct \nan inequity in the payment formula for Medicare+Choice plans. In states \nlike Oregon, with historically low cost health care systems, these \ninequities leave many Medicare beneficiaries with few or no choices in \ntheir health care services.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 contained a promise to provide \nseniors with more choices, but that promise has gone unfulfilled \nbecause of these inequities.\n  The legislation that Senator Smith and I are introducing today will \nfulfill that promise by fully funding what is known as the ``blend'' \nportion of the formula used to determine payment rates. The legislation \nbrings parity to areas that have been historically efficient in \ndelivering health care services. Under the current system, the Medicare \npayment formula has not rewarded these areas for their efficiency and \nlow costs. As a result, beneficiaries in these areas have not received \nthe range of benefits available in areas with less efficient and more \ncostly health care systems.\n  This legislation also assures beneficiaries will no longer be \npenalized because they live in a rural or low-cost area. We must assure \nthat seniors living in Oregon and other low cost areas receive the full \npromise of Medicare+Choice.\n  With managed care playing a larger role in Medicare, this bill is \nneeded now more than ever. Nearly 100 plans elected to drop out of the \nMedicare program for 1999. Many of those plans served seniors in low \ncost and rural areas, leaving too many beneficiaries not only without \nchoice but also out in the cold. Other managed care plans made benefit \nchanges that limit the promise we all had hoped would occur through \nMedicare+Choice.\n  We need to make sure that all seniors are included in the \nMedicare+Choice promise and that managed care plans in Oregon, Iowa and \nother low-cost areas are no longer penalized because of their historic \nefficiency.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na 2-month extension for the due date for filing a tax return for any \nmember of a uniformed service on a tour of duty outside the United \nStates for a period which includes the normal due date for such a \nfiling; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the uniformed services filing fairness act\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, American soldiers in the modern \nmilitary operate under a great deal of strain. Forced to work harder \nwith fewer resources, our men and women in uniform bear a heavy burden \ndefending our nation. This is especially true for those deployed \noverseas. Not only must these troops defend American interests, but \nthey also live under constant threat of attack and must spend months \naway from their homes and their families.\n  In addition to their duty to protect our nation's security, American \nservice men and women still must fulfill obligations back home, \nincluding paying their taxes. However, in an incredible cart-before-\nthe-horse scheme that could only be found in our nation's tax code, the \nfederal government extends for our troops abroad the deadline for \nfiling income tax forms by 2 months, but requires that service men and \nwomen still pay interest and penalties during the extension period. Mr. \nPresident, this is unconscionable.\n  The Uniformed Services Filing Fairness Act, which I introduce today \nwith Senators Levin, McCain, Torricelli, Hutchison, and Cleland is \nsimple. It codifies the current two-month extension period available to \nour troops and eliminates the interest and penalties that would \notherwise be charged. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated the \ncost of this commonsense correction at just $4 million over 10 years. \nMr. President, how can we not afford to pass this bill?\n  We must show our nation's soldiers that we support them through \nconcrete action. The bill I introduce today will help make the lives of \nsoldiers deployed overseas a little easier. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in this simple, inexpensive correction of an unfair tax \nlaw.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 309. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat a member of the uniformed services shall be treated as using a \nprincipal residence while away from home or qualified official extended \nduty in determining the exclusion of gain from the sale of such \nresidence; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the uniformed services home sales act of 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I, along with Senator Thurmond, and \nothers are proud to sponsor this bill to allow members of the Uniformed \nServices, who are away on extended active duty, to qualify for the same \ntax relief on the profit generated when they sell their main residence \nas other Americans.\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\n  This bill will not create a new tax benefit; it merely modifies \ncurrent law to include the time members of the Uniformed Services are \naway from home on active duty when calculating the number of years the \nhomeowners has lived in their primary residence. In short, this bill is \nnarrowly tailored to remedy a specific dilemma.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 delivered sweeping tax relief to \nmillions of Americans through a wide variety of important tax changes \nthat affect individuals, families, investors and businesses. It was \nalso one of the most complex tax laws enacted in recent history.\n  Mr. President, as with any complex legislation, there are winners and \nlosers. But in this instance, there are unintended losers: members of \nthe Uniformed Services.\n  The 1997 act gives taxpayers who sell their principal residence a \nmuch-needed tax break. Prior to the 1997 act, taxpayers received a one-\ntime exclusion on the profit they made when they sold their principal \nresidence, but the taxpayer had to be at least 55 years old and live in \nthe residence for 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale. This provision \nprimarily benefitted elderly taxpayers, while not providing any relief \nto younger taxpayers and their families.\n  Fortunately, the 1997 act addressed this issue. Under this law, \ntaxpayers who sell their principal residence on or after May 7, 1997, \nare not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit from the sale, joint \nfilers are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit they make from \nselling their principal residence. The taxpayer must meet two \nrequirements to qualify for this tax relief. The taxpayer must (1) own \nthe home for at least 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale, and (2) live \nin the home as their main home for at least 2 years of the last 5 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the bipartisan cooperation that resulted in \nthis much-needed form of tax relief. The home sales provision sounds \ngreat, and it is. Unfortunately, the second part of this eligibility \ntest unintentionally and unfairly prohibits many of our women and men \nin the armed forces from qualifying for this beneficial tax relief.\n  Constant travel across the United States and abroad is inherent in \nthe Uniformed Services. Nonetheless, some members of the Uniformed \nServices choose to purchase a home in a certain locale, even though \nthey will not live there much of the time. Under the new law, if a \nserviceman does not have a spouse who resides in the house during his \nabsence or the spouse is also in the military and also must travel, \nthat service member will not qualify for the full benefit of the new \nhome sales provision, because no one ``lives'' in the home for the \nrequired period of time. The law is prejudiced against dual-military \ncouples who are often away on active duty. They would not qualify for \nthe home sales exclusion because neither spouse ``live'' in the house \nfor enough time to qualify for the exclusion.\n  This bill simply remedies an inequality in the 1997 law. The bill \namends the Internal Revenue Code so that members of the Uniformed \nServices will be considered to be using their house as their main \nresidence for any period that they are away on extended active duty. In \nshort, members of the Uniformed Service will be deemed to be using \ntheir house as their main home, even if they are stationed in Bosnia, \nthe Persian Gulf, in the ``no man's land,'' commonly called the DMZ \nbetween North and South Korea, or anywhere else on active duty orders.\n  In 1998 alone, the United States had approximately 37,000 men and \nwomen deployed to the Persian Gulf region, preparing to go into combat, \nif so ordered. There were also 8,000 American troops deployed in \nBosnia, and another 70,000 U.S. military personnel deployed in support \nof other commitments worldwide. That is a total of 108,000 women and \nmen deployed outside of the United States, away from their primary \nhome, protecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold so dear.\n  We are in a period of robust growth. Many Americans are reaping the \nbenefits of our country's growth by investing in the stock market. Many \nof our nation's recent millionaires became millionaires through the \nstock market. However, many middle- and lower-income Americans do not \nhold vast amounts of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and the like. \nTherefore, how does the average American participate in our nation's \nrobust growth? Through home ownership.\n  Appreciation in the value of a home because of our country's overall \neconomic growth allows everyday Americans to participate in our \ncountry's prosperity. Fortunately, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nrecognized this and provided this break to lessen the amount of tax \nmost Americans will pay on the profit they make when they sell their \nhomes.\n  The 1997 home sale provision unintentionally discourages home \nownership among members of the Uniformed Services, which is bad fiscal \npolicy. Home ownership has numerous benefits for communities and \nindividual homeowners. Having a fixed home provides Americans with a \nsense of community and adds stability to our nation's neighborhoods. \nHome ownership also generates valuable property taxes for our nation's \ncommunities.\n  We also cannot afford to discourage military service by penalizing \nmilitary personnel with higher taxes merely because they are doing \ntheir job. Military service entails sacrifice, such as long periods of \ntime away from friends and family and the constant threat of \nmobilization into hostile territory. We must not use the tax code to \nheap additional burdens upon our women and men in uniform.\n  In my view, the way to decrease the likelihood of further \ninequalities in the tax code, intentional or otherwise, is to adopt a \nfairer, flatter tax system that is far less complicated than our \ncurrent system. But, in the meantime, we must insure that the Tax Code \nis as fair and equitable as possible.\n  The Taxpayers' Relief Act of 1997 was designed to provide sweeping \ntax relief to all Americans, including our women and men in uniform. \nYes, it is true that there are winners and losers in any tax code, but, \nthis inequity was unintended, Enacting this narrowly tailored remedy to \ngrant equal tax relief to the members of our Uniformed Services \nrestores fairness and consistency to our increasingly complex Tax \nCode.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself and Mr. Cleland):\n  S. 310. A bill to provide for a Dekalb-Peachtree Airport Buyout \ninitiative; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             DEKALB-PEACHTREE AIRPORT BUYOUT COMPLETION ACT\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation--the Dekalb-Peachtree Airport Buyout Completion Act--which \naccelerates the long-awaited buy-out of homes and businesses around \nGeorgia's second busiest airport. Specifically, this legislation grants \na priority airport designation for the Dekalb-Peachtree Airport and \nauthorizes the FAA to make available $35 million for the buyout \ninitiative.\n  This is a very import project to the citizens of Dekalb County, \nGeorgia. In the 1990s, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed to \nbuy the businesses and residential properties located in the Dekalb-\nPeachtree Airport's Runway Protection Zone. This was the result of FAA \nstudies that found increased operations at the airport too noisy and \ntoo unsafe for residents and businesses in the northern vicinity. While \nthe citizens of Georgia and myself are grateful that the FAA has \nassisted in purchasing some of the properties, this financial \nassistance has been extremely slow. The FAA's failure to provide the \nremaining federal financial assistance in a timely manner has caused \nlocal residents and businesses to remain in limbo and very upset. \nBusinesses cannot expand and poorer residents cannot afford to move out \nuntil the buyout is complete. Those residents who have moved out are \nleasing their homes to lower-income individuals and families. These \ncircumstances have also caused the crime rate in the area to \nsubstantially go up.\n  My proposed legislation would help alleviate this problem by \nauthorizing the federal funds necessary to complete the buyout of the \nremaining residential and business properties. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate on this important proposal and \nurge its speedy consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCain (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Cleland, and Mr. \n        Kerrey):\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\n  S. 311. A bill to authorize the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial \nFoundation to establish a memorial in the District of Columbia or its \nenvirons, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                 DISABLED VETERANS MEMORIAL LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer legislation to \nauthorize the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation to establish \na memorial on Federal land in the District of Columbia to honor all \ndisabled American veterans. This legislation is not controversial, \ncosts nothing, and deserves prompt consideration and passage during the \nfirst session of the 106th Congress.\n  As a nation, we owe a debt of gratitude to all Americans who have \nworn their country's uniform in the defense of her core ideals and \ninterests. We honor their service with holidays, like Veterans Day and \nMemorial Day, and with memorials, including the Vietnam Wall and the \nIwo Jima Memorial. But nowhere in Washington can be found a material \ntribute to those veterans whose physical or psychological well-being \nwas forever lost to a sniper's bullet, a landmine, a mortar round, or \nthe pure terror of modern warfare.\n  To these individuals, we owe a measure of devotion beyond that \naccorded those who served honorably but without permanent damage to \nlimb or spirit. For these individuals, a memorial in Washington, D.C. \nwould stand as testament to the sum of their sacrifices, and as proof \nthat the country they served values their contribution to its cause.\n  We cannot restore the health of those Americans who incurred a \ndisability as a result of their military service. It is within our \npower, however, to authorize a memorial that would clearly signal the \nnation's gratitude to all whose disabilities serve as a living reminder \nof the toll war takes on its victims.\n  Under the terms of this legislation, the Disabled Veterans' LIFE \nMemorial Foundation would be solely responsible for raising the \nnecessary funding. Our bill explicitly requires that no Federal funds \nbe used to pay any expense for the memorial's establishment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Coverdell, Cleland, and \nKerrey in support of this legislation. America's disabled veterans, of \nwhom Senator Cleland himself is one of our most distinguished, deserve \na lasting tribute to their sacrifice. They honored us with their \nservice; let us honor them with our support today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH MEMORIAL.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial \n     Foundation is authorized to establish a memorial on Federal \n     land in the District of Columbia or its environs to honor \n     disabled American veterans who have served in the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (b) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The \n     establishment of the memorial authorized by subsection (a) \n     shall be in accordance with the Act entitled ``An Act to \n     provide standards for placement of commemorative works on \n     certain Federal lands in the District of Columbia and its \n     environs, and for other purposes'', approved November 14, \n     1986 (40 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2.

No Federal funds may be used to \n     pay any expense of the establishment of the memorial.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require certain entities that operate homeless \nshelters to identify and provide certain counseling to homeless \nveterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n                          veterans legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nassist homeless veterans and eliminate some of the suffering of these \nless fortunate Americans who served their country in uniform. This \nlegislation would develop better methods for identifying veterans who \nutilize federally funded homeless shelters so that they can be educated \nabout veteran benefits to which they are entitled, including Department \nof Veterans Affairs health care.\n  A homeless shelter which receives federal funding would be required \nto inquire if a person entering the shelter is a veteran. This \ninformation would be used solely to assist in tracking the number of \nhomeless veterans and providing counseling to the veteran regarding all \navailable benefits, including job search, veterans preference rights, \nand medical benefits. Additionally, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nand the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development would coordinate \nthese activities and specify a schedule for notifying the Department of \nVeterans Affairs of the status of these homeless veterans. It is the \nintent of this legislation to require homeless shelters to follow this \nprocedure if they are to be eligible for additional Federal grants.\n  It goes without saying that this country owes a great deal to the men \nand women who bore arms to keep America free. Today there is no easy \nway to ensure that veterans who are homeless have access to the \nbenefits they have earned. We do not even know how many of our veterans \nare homeless. I find this astonishing. The Department of Veterans \nAffairs estimates the number of homeless veterans to be between 275,000 \nand 500,000 over the course of a year. Conservatively, one out of every \nthree individuals who is sleeping in a doorway, alley, or box in our \ncities and rural communities has worn a uniform and served our country. \nMr. President, the time is right, right now, to give a helping hand.\n  Based on the figures the Department of Veterans Affairs does have, \nhomeless veterans are mostly male; about three percent are women. The \nvast majority are single; most come from poor, disadvantaged \ncommunities; forty percent suffer from mental illness; and half have \nsubstance abuse problems. More than seventy-five percent served our \ncountry for at least four years, and Vietnam veterans account for more \nthan forty percent of the total number estimated.\n  Mr. President, there are many complex factors affecting all \nhomelessness: extreme shortage of affordable housing, poverty, high \nunemployment in big cities, and disability. A large number of displaced \nand at-risk veterans live with the lingering effects of post traumatic \nstress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse, compounded by a lack of \nfamily and social support networks.\n  I do not mean to be critical of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or \nthe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in offering this \nlegislation. To a great degree, the Department of Veterans Affairs has \nbeen very responsive in taking care of some homeless veterans. But the \nones who are receiving critical medical treatment and veterans benefits \nare those who know that such programs exist. It is incumbent on our \ngovernment to reach out to all veterans, particularly those who are \nhomeless. However, to do that, there must be a process in place.\n  Homeless veterans need a coordinated effort, between the Secretaries \nof Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, that provides \nsecure housing and nutritional meals, essential physical health care, \nsubstance abuse aftercare, and mental health counseling. They may need \njob assessment, training, and placement assistance. To those who may \nargue that this is a new entitlement program, I would say that these \nrights and benefits currently exist for veterans today. Why would we as \na nation not do everything in our power to provide this help for those \nless fortunate veterans?\n  Mr. President, our veterans deserve no less. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this legislation and support our veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 312\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 4\n\n       Whereas Asia is the largest regional export market for \n     America's farmers and ranchers, traditionally purchasing \n     approximately 40 percent of all U.S. agricultural exports;\n       Whereas the Department of Agriculture forecasts that over \n     the next year American agricultural exports to Asian \n     countries will decline by several billion dollars due to the \n     Asian financial crisis;\n       Whereas the United States is the producer of the safest \n     agricultural products from farm to table, customizing goods \n     to meet the needs of customers worldwide, and has established \n     the image and reputation as the world's best provider of \n     agricultural products;\n       Whereas American farmers and ranchers, and more \n     specifically, American pork and beef producers, are dependent \n     on secure, open, and competitive Asian export markets for \n     their product;\n       Whereas United States pork and beef producers not only have \n     faced the adverse effects of depreciated and unstable \n     currencies and lowered demand due to the Asian financial \n     crisis, but also have been confronted with South Korea's pork \n     subsidies and its failure to keep commitments on market \n     access for beef;\n       Whereas it is the policy of the United States to prohibit \n     south Korea from using United States and International \n     Monetary Fund assistance to subsidize targeted industries and \n     compete unfairly for market share against U.S. products;\n       Whereas the South Korean Government has been subsidizing \n     its pork exports to Japan, resulting in a 973 percent \n     increase in its exports to Japan since 1992, and a 71 percent \n     increase in the last year;\n       Whereas pork already comprises 70 percent of South Korea's \n     agriculture exports to Japan, yet the South Korean Government \n     has announced plans to invest 100,000,000 won in its \n     agricultural sector in order to flood the Japanese market \n     with even more South Korean pork;\n       Whereas the South Korean Ministry of Agriculture and \n     Fisheries reportedly has earmarked 25,000,000,000 won for \n     loans to Korea's pork processors in order for them to \n     purchase more Korean pork and to increase exports to Japan;\n       Whereas any export subsidies on pork, including those on \n     exports from South Korea to Japan, would violate South \n     Korea's international trade agreements and may be actionable \n     under the World Trade Organization;\n       Whereas South Korea's subsidies are hindering U.S. pork and \n     beef producers from capturing their full potential in the \n     Japanese market, which is the largest export market for U.S. \n     pork and beef, importing nearly $700,000,000 of U.S. pork and \n     over $1,500,000,000 of U.S. beef last year alone;\n       Whereas under the United States-Korea 1993 Record of \n     Understanding on Market Access for Beef, which was negotiated \n     pursuant to a 1989 GATT Panel decision against Korea, South \n     Korea was allowed to delay full liberalization of its beef \n     market (in an exception to WTO rules) if it would agree to \n     import increasing minimum quantities of beef each year until \n     the year 2001;\n       Whereas South Korea fell woefully short of its beef market \n     access commitment for 1998; and,\n       Whereas United States pork and beef producers are not able \n     to compete fairly with Korean livestock producers, who have a \n     high cost of production, because South Korea has violated \n     trade agreements and implemented protectionist policies: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) Believes strongly that while a stable global \n     marketplace is in the best interest of America's farmers and \n     ranchers, the United States should seek a mutually beneficial \n     relationship without hindering the competitiveness of \n     American agriculture;\n       (2) Calls on South Korea to abide by its trade commitments;\n       (3) Calls on the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the \n     United States Executive Director of the International \n     Monetary Fund to promote vigorously policies that encourage \n     the opening of markets for beef and pork products by \n     requiring South Korea to abide by its existing international \n     trade commitments and to reduce trade barriers, tariffs, and \n     export subsidies;\n       (4) Calls on the President and the Secretaries of the \n     Treasury and Agriculture to monitor and report to Congress \n     that resources will not be used to stabilize the South Korean \n     market at the expense of U.S. agricultural goods or services; \n     and\n       (5) Requests the United States Trade Representative and the \n     U.S. Department of Agriculture to continue bilateral \n     consultations with the Government of South Korea on its \n     failure to abide by its international trade commitments on \n     beef market access, to consider whether Korea's reported \n     plans for subsidizing its pork industry would violate any\n\n[[Page S1015]]\n\n     of its international trade commitments, and to determine what \n     impact Korea's subsidy plans would have on U.S. agricultural \n     interests, especially in Japan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/26/senate-section/article/S1014-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this bill, \nwith Senator Coverdell and others, to provide a 2-month extension to \nfile federal taxes for U.S. military personnel who are on duty abroad.\n  Current Treasury regulations allow military personnel to file federal \ntax forms on June 15 rather than April 15. However, filers who elect to \nuse this exception are still subject to interest and penalties during \nthat two-month grace period.\n  This legislation codifies the existing Treasury regulations and adds \na waiver of the interest and penalties that could be charged during the \ntwo-month grace period against military personnel who elect to take the \nfiling exception.\n  Military personnel, serving their country overseas are often isolated \nfrom the resources necessary to prepare their tax returns. The Internal \nRevenue Service and the Department of the Treasury recognized this \nreality and provided our nation's military personnel with a much-needed \ntwo-month grace period to file their taxes.\n  However, it is inconsistent to grant a grace period for filers, but \nto penalize those who take it. These brave men and women have not \ncommitted any wrongdoing; all they are doing is serving their country.\n  Travel to remote regions is inherent to military service. In 1998 \nalone, the United States had approximately 37,000 men and women \ndeployed to the Persian Gulf region, preparing to go into combat, if so \nordered. There were also 8,000 American troops deployed in Bosnia, and \nanother 70,000 U.S. military personnel deployed in support of other \ncommitments worldwide. That is a total of 108,000 women and men \ndeployed outside of the United States, away from their primary home, \nprotecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold so dear.\n  We cannot afford to discourage military service by penalizing \nmilitary personnel with interest and penalties merely because the \nunique characteristics of their job makes it difficult to file their \ntaxes on time. Military service entails sacrifice, such as long periods \nof time away from friends and family and the constant threat of \nmobilization into hostile territory. We must not use the tax code to \nheap additional burdens upon our women and men in uniform.\n  This measure will restore equity and consistency to this tax \nprovision, and, at the same time, provide a small measure of tax relief \nto our men and women in the military.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and my other cosponsors to support \nthis much-needed measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/26/senate-section/article/S1015-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MAJ. GEN. WILLIAM P. BLAND, JR.\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Major \nGeneral William P. Bland, Jr., a native of Statesboro, Georgia, who \nafter more than four decades of dedicated service to the State of \nGeorgia and to this country as an officer in the Georgia National \nGuard, is retiring and coming home to the Savannah area. On January 31, \n1999, Maj. Gen. Bland will be honored during a retirement ceremony at \nthe 165th Airlift Wing's headquarters in Savannah, where he started his \ncareer with the Georgia Air National Guard in 1962.\n  General Bland began his military service with the 165th Tactical \nAirlift Group in Savannah and later served as Deputy Commander of the \nAir National Guard at Air National Guard Support Center at Andrews Air \nForce Base. During the past eight years he has served as the Adjutant \nGeneral for Georgia during which time he and his staff responded to \nblizzards and floods, directed 15,000 National Guardsmen for Olympic \nsecurity, beefed up training for Guard volunteers, upgraded the state's \nmilitary capabilities and reorganized the state defense department. As \nadjutant general, Bland led the Georgia Department of Defense and \ncommanded more than 12,000 volunteer and full-time members of the \nGeorgia Army and Air National Guards.\n  Bill's most challenging year as adjutant general came in 1996. He \nsupervised the largest relocation of an Air National Guard unit in \nhistory with the move of the 116th Bomb Wing, which included 1,000 \npeople and eight B-1 bomber airplanes, to Robins Air Force Base near \nMacon. The bomb wing's move helps ensure Robins' future as a military \nbase because the B-1 is one of the Air Force's newest bombers and will \nremain in active service for many years to come. Bland also oversaw the \n48th Infantry Brigade's deployment to the National Training Center at \nFort Irwin, California, and witnessed the deployment of two units of \nthe Georgia Army National Guard to Bosnia.\n  However, the most demanding duty in Bland's career came with the 1996 \nOlympics in Atlanta when he organized 15,000 National Guard volunteers \nfrom 47 states to help with security. Most recently he restructured the \nstate Department of Defense by changing the department's contracting \nsystem and placing the Army and Air Guard recruiting under one office.\n  General Bland has made a positive impact on the lives of many \nAmericans and personifies the definition of a true and loyal American \nwho sets the standard for all citizens to live by. He is an outstanding \nexample to his family and friends, and has been an asset to the many \ncommunities, states and nations that he has touched over the years.\n  Mr. President, I would like to honor and commend Major General \nWilliam Bland for his outstanding and innumerable contributions over \nthe years to the State of Georgia and to our entire nation, and I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in saluting and congratulating Bill on his \nretirement and in wishing him many more joyous and successful years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/26/senate-section/article/S1015-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1015-S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AND AIRMEN'S BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \non the Armed Services Committee in sponsoring the Soldiers, Sailors, \nand Airmen's Bill of Rights. This legislation addresses the critical \nneed of improving retention in our military services. The President's \nBudget has too long ignored the challenges facing our military \nrecruiters as they competed against the civilian sector for highly \nskilled personnel. For too long, we\n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\nhave spend tax dollars training recruits in critical skills such as \naviation maintenance, nuclear engineering, and medicine only to have \nthese skills transferred to civilian companies. We need to stop the \nhemorrhaging and address the problems that underlie this issue.\n  First, we need to raise the pay of service personnel to keep salaries \ncompetitive with civilian equivalents. This bill raises base pay by \n4.8% in 2000, with additional pay raises tied to the Employment Cost \nIndex. Second, we need to provide incentives for active duty personnel \nto keep longer service commitments. To do this, we need to repair the \ndamage done in 1986 to the military retirement system. This bill re-\nestablishes the pre-1986 retirement system for military personnel who \ncommit to serving their country for 15 years or more. Finally, we need \nto provide service members with the opportunity to save for their \nretirement. This bill would allow service members to contribute up to \n5% of their base pay, before taxes, into the Thrift Savings Plan. This \nis the same plan available to all government civilian employees and has \nalready encouraged thousands of government employees to take an active \nstep in their retirement planning. By extending this benefit to the \nmilitary, we encourage them to think ahead and to save for their \nretirements.\n  The quality of our uniformed service is second to none in the world. \nWe owe it to the people standing on the front lines to ensure that \ntheir commitment to our country does not include a commitment to debt \nand poverty. This bill is an overdue first step in improving the \nquality of life for all of the men and women who serve in uniform. We \nowe it to them; we owe it to their families. I strongly encourage my \ncolleagues to support its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/26/senate-section/article/S1015-4", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLARK CLIFFORD\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, at a time when we risk the ever \ncoarsening of our pubic affairs, we would do well to remember a man \nwhose service to this country was distinguished as no other for \ncivility and elegance. I ask that this tribute to Clark M. Clifford by \nSander Vanocur be printed in the Record.\n  The tribute follows\n\n                       Tribute to Clark Clifford\n\n (By Sander Vanocur at the Washington National Cathedral, November 19, \n                                 1998)\n\n       The following anonymous poem was sent to Clark Clifford's \n     daughters, Joyce and Randall, by their sister, Faith, who \n     could not be here today:\n\n     Think of stepping on shore\n         and finding it Heaven,\n     Of taking hold of a hand\n         and finding it God's,\n     Of breathing new air,\n           and finding its celestial air,\n     Of feeling invigorated\n         and finding it immortality,\n     Of passing from storm and tempest\n         to an unbroken calm,\n     Of waking up,\n         and finding it Home.\n\n     In the secular sense, Clark Clifford found that home in \n     Washington more than fifty years ago. And having found that \n     home, let it be said that while he was here, he graced this \n     place.\n       It was a much different place when he and Marny came here, \n     smaller in size but larger in imagination, made larger in \n     imagination by World War II. It may have been, then and for a \n     good time after, as John F. Kennedy once noted, a city of \n     Southern efficiency and Northern charm. But it was also at \n     least then, a place where dreams could be fashioned into \n     reality. Being an intensely political city, dreams, as \n     always, had to be fashioned by reality. And it was in this \n     art of political compromise where Clark Clifford flourished. \n     He was known as the consummate Washington insider. Quite \n     often the term was used in the pejorative sense. It should \n     not have been. If you believe as he did in what George Orwell \n     meant when he wrote that in the end everything is political, \n     it should be a cause for celebration rather than lamentation \n     that he played the role, for if he had not played this role \n     who else of his generation could have played it quite so \n     well, especially when the time came to tell a President of \n     the United States, who was also a very old friend, that the \n     national interests of this nation could no longer be served \n     by our continuing involvement in Vietnam?\n       We know of his public triumphs. Some of use also know of \n     his personal kindnesses. Many years ago, at a very bleak \n     period in both my personal and professional life--you know in \n     this city it is bleak when your phone calls are not returned \n     by people you have known for years--there were two \n     individuals in this city who faithfully returned my calls. \n     One was Ben Bradlee. The other was Clark Clifford. When Clark \n     first invited me to his office during this bleak period to \n     offer encouragement and guidance, he closed the door, took no \n     phone calls, sat behind his desk, his hands forming the \n     legendary steeple and listened and advised. On that first \n     visit to his office I looked down on his desk where there \n     appeared to be at least fifty messages, topped by what seemed \n     to be inaugural medallions. I thought to myself on that first \n     visit that Clark Clifford had put the world on hold just to \n     listen to me. But the third time I came to his office, it \n     occurred to me that it was just possible those messages had \n     been there for twenty years.\n       Clark Clifford's final years were not what he would have \n     wished for himself nor what his friends would have wished for \n     him and for his family. They seemed to echo the first lines \n     in Chapter Nine of Henry Adam's novel ``Democracy,'' perhaps \n     the best novel ever written about this city. The lines are: \n     ``Whenever a man reaches to the top of the political ladder, \n     his enemies unite to pull him down. His friends become \n     critical and exacting.'' On this occasion, I cannot speak of \n     this enemies, but I can say that his friends will not be \n     critical or exacting. We will think, instead, of Othello's \n     words just before he dies:\n\n       ``Soft you; a word or two before you go.\n       ``I have done the state some service, and they know it--\n       ``No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,\n       ``When you shall these unlucky deeds relate.\n       ``Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate.\n       ``Nor set down aught in malice.''\n\n       We who loved Clark Clifford will do that and more. We will \n     say now and henceforth: Clark Clifford did the state some \n     service and we know it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/26/senate-section/article/S1016-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Executive nominations received by the Secretary of the Senate January \n26, 1999, under authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, \n1999:\n\n\n                             the judiciary\n\n       Marsha L.
