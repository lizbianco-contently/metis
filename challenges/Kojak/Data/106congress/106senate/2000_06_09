Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 3279 with the time equally divided.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume, obviously up to the limit, but I will not use all of it.\n  I will make a few brief remarks about the pending amendment which I \nlaid down last night and spoke shortly on that particular time. My \namendment requires the Department of Defense to match disbursements \nwith obligations before making payments.\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\n  I know this sounds like commonsense stuff--it is really basic \naccounting 101--but it goes to a very major problem we have within the \nDepartment of Defense. They don't always make payments based on \ninvoices. They don't always match the check being mailed out for \ncertain goods or services received.\n  I am sure my colleagues must be wondering why the Senator from Iowa \nhas to offer an amendment such as this. They must be asking themselves \nthis question: Isn't DOD already doing it?\n  Unfortunately, the fact remains that the Pentagon bureaucrats are not \ndoing it.\n  Businesses do it on a routine basis. And most citizens do it, too. \nYou just don't write out a check and pay a bill until you are \nabsolutely certain that you owe the money. You must first verify that \nyou have a legitimate obligation to pay the bill. And you have enough \nmoney in the bank to cover it.\n  This amendment and device that has been used now for several years to \ntry to straighten things out in the Pentagon is a handy device also for \ndeterring fraud. And it helps to prevent mismanagement and other abuses \nin the Pentagon's vast financial accounts.\n  This policy has been incorporated in the last six appropriations \nacts.\n  Each year we have ratcheted down the threshold or dollar level where \nthe matching must be done.\n  In 1995, we started out with payments of $5 million.\n  Each year since then, we have gradually lowered the threshold but \nalways keeping the pressure on for reform.\n  Last year the Senate voted to lower the threshold to $500,000.\n  This year--in the amendment--I am recommending that the threshold be \nmaintained at $500,000.\n  I think we should keep it at the current level for another year. I am \nnot sure DOD is ready to move to a lower level--not meaning that it \nwouldn't be right to move to a lower level. But if they don't have the \nmechanical capability of moving to a lower level, we want to make sure \nthat we make progress in this area. However, we don't want to hold up \nthe normal way of doing business or the process of doing business in \nthe Defense Department.\n  The General Accounting Office will look at this issue again and \ndetermine when and how the threshold should be lowered in the future, \nand in future years I would follow their recommendations.\n  I also take this opportunity to thank my good friend from Alaska, the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Stevens, and my good friend from \nHawaii, the ranking minority member, Senator Inouye, for their support \nof this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  If it is the desire that other Members yield back the remainder of \ntheir time, I will yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I and Senator Inouye welcome the \ncooperation of the Senator from Iowa to keep the current level for next \nyear. We are trying our best to have the ability to take it down to \nzero in the near future.\n  For now, we do thank the Senator for once again calling the attention \nof the Department of Defense to the fact that Congress wants good \naccounting procedures followed. He is right that this is the procedure \nfollowed by profit and nonprofit entities in our country.\n  I ask my friend if he desires any time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I join my chairman in supporting the \nmeasure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. With that, I yield back our time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3279. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON BRINGING PEACE TO CHECHNYA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Senate of the United States unanimously passed \n     Senate Resolution 262 on February 24th, 2000, which condemned \n     the indiscriminate use of force by the Government of the \n     Russian Federation against the people of Chechnya and called \n     for peace negotiations between the Government of the Russian \n     Federation and the democratically elected Government of \n     Chechnya led by President Aslan Maskhadov;\n       (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     received credible evidence reporting that Russian forces in \n     Chechnya caused the deaths of innocent civilians and the \n     displacement of well over 250,000 other residents of Chechnya \n     and committed widespread atrocities, including summary \n     executions, torture, and rape;\n       (3) the Government of the Russian Federation continues its \n     military campaign in Chechnya, including using indiscriminate \n     force, causing further dislocation of people from their \n     homes, the deaths of noncombatants, and widespread suffering;\n       (4) the Government of the Russian Federation refuses to \n     participate in peace negotiations with the democratically \n     elected government of Chechnya;\n       (5) the war in Chechnya contributes to ethnic hatred and \n     religious intolerance within the Russian Federation, \n     jeopardizes prospects for the establishment of democracy in\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\n     the Russian Federation, and is a threat to the peace in the \n     region; and\n       (6) it is in the interests of the United States to promote \n     a cease-fire in Chechnya and negotiations between the \n     Government of the Russian Federation and the democratically \n     elected government of Chechnya that result in a just and \n     lasting peace;\n       (7) representatives of the democratically elected President \n     of Chechnya, including his foreign minister, have traveled to \n     the United States to facilitate an immediate cease-fire to \n     the conflict in Chechnya and the initiation of peace \n     negotiations between Russian and Chechen forces;\n       (8) the Secretary of State and other senior United States \n     Government officials have refused to meet with \n     representatives of the democratically elected President of \n     Chechnya to discuss proposals for an immediate cease-fire \n     between Chechen and Russian forces and for peace \n     negotiations; and\n       (9) the Senate expresses its concern over the war and the \n     humanitarian tragedy in Chechnya and its desire for a \n     peaceful and durable settlement to the conflict.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Government of the Russian Federation should \n     immediately--\n       (A) cease its military operations in Chechnya and \n     participate in negotiations toward a just peace with the \n     leadership of the Chechen Government led by President Aslan \n     Maskhadov;\n       (B) allow into and around Chechnya international missions \n     to monitor and report on the situation there and to \n     investigate alleged atrocities and war crimes; and\n       (C) grant international humanitarian agencies full and \n     unimpeded access to Chechen civilians, including those in \n     refugee, detention, and so-called ``filtration camps'', or \n     any other facility where citizens of Chechnya are detained;\n       (2) the Secretary of State should meet with representatives \n     of the government of Chechnya led by President Aslan \n     Maskhadov to discuss its proposals to initiate a cease-fire \n     in the war in Chechnya and to facilitate the provision of \n     humanitarian assistance to the victims of this tragic \n     conflict; and\n       (3) the President of the United States, in structuring \n     United States policy toward the Russian Federation, should \n     take into consideration the refusal of the Government of the \n     Russian Federation to cease its military operations in \n     Chechnya and to participate in peace negotiations with the \n     government of Chechnya.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. First of all, I compliment the distinguished clerk because \nthere was a name or two that was difficult to pronounce. I probably \nwill have the same difficulty. In any case, I wanted the amendment to \nbe read to serve notice that this is a matter of great importance and \none that bothers me tremendously.\n  It grew out of a meeting yesterday morning with Mr. Ilyas Akhmadov, \nthe Foreign Minister of Chechnya, who represents Chechnya's \ndemocratically elected President. He is visiting Washington hoping to \ndiscuss with the Clinton administration his government's efforts to \nbring an immediate cease-fire to the brutal war that has wrought so \nmuch misery and destruction upon the Chechen people. His proposals to \nachieve a cease-fire and peace negotiations deserve close consideration \nby Russia and, indeed, the entire international community.\n\n  I find it incredible that Mr. Akhmadov's requests for a meeting with \nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright and other senior U.S. Government \nofficials have been flatly rejected. As a matter of fact, I resent the \nfact that they conducted themselves as they did because this is an \noutrage.\n  The United States should be working to facilitate peace in Chechnya, \nnot to encourage the Kremlin to further its brutal campaign against the \nChechen people.\n  There is simply no excuse for the Secretary of State to refuse even \nto meet with Mr. Akhmadov. Any meeting to discuss the democratically \nelected Government to Chechnya's legitimate peace proposal would not \nconstitute a de facto recognition of Chechen independence. And the \nSecretary of State and others know that.\n  But this refusal even to meet with Mr. Akhmadov will certainly be \ninterpreted, by Russia's President Putin, as yet another green light \nfrom the Clinton-Gore administration to continue its indiscriminate \ncampaign of violence against the Chechen people--a campaign that has \nled to the death, starvation, and torture of countless of innocent \npeople in Chechnya.\n  In our meeting yesterday morning, Mr. Akhmadov and I discussed the \natrocities that Russian forces are committing against the Chechen \npopulation. He shared with me, with tears in his eyes--and these were \nnot pretended tears; this man was almost distraught about what is \nhappening to his people--he gave me a grim picture of life in Chechnya \nunder the repeated and indiscriminate assault by the Russian military.\n  Countless families continue to be bombed out of their homes. Chechens \nare still rounded up and sent to what are called ``filtration camps'' \nwhere they are tortured, raped, and then executed.\n  For too long, our President has refused to use his power and \ninfluence to pressure the Kremlin into genuine negotiations to end the \nbloody conflict in Chechnya which already has cost countless thousands \nof lives of men, women, and children.\n  Aside from empty rhetoric from the administration, not one finger has \nbeen lifted to make clear the outrage of the United States at the \natrocities committed by Russian forces against innocent Chechen \ncivilians.\n  Worse still, the administration has even legitimized Russia's \nmilitary campaign in Chechnya with public declarations comparing this \nconflict to the Civil War in the United States.\n  For this reason, I submit this amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill. It calls upon the Kremlin to cease immediately its military \noperations in Chechnya.\n  It calls upon the Kremlin to grant international humanitarian \norganizations access to the victims of this conflict and do it \nimmediately. And, this amendment calls upon Secretary of State Albright \nto meet with Mr. Akmadov to at least consider his proposal to bring an \nend to this terrible war in Chechnya.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I had not intended to speak on this, and I \nwill not take any length of time. I think we are on the Defense \nappropriations bill. I don't know whether his intent was to offer this \non Defense authorization or Defense appropriations. My colleague does \nnot have to rise.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am absolutely amazed that any Senate \nDemocrat, particularly my long-time friend from Connecticut, would talk \nabout offering legislation on appropriations bills. I hope he won't \ntake this further because I will cite hundreds of instances in the last \n2 years where his side has bollixed up the operation of the Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague said he was amending the Defense authorization \nbill. This is the Defense appropriations bill. I just wondered if he \nwas clear as to what bill we were dealing with at this moment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Let me tell you something, my friend. I will put this \namendment on anything I can, if it does one ounce of benefit for the \nChechen people.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. HELMS. And if it will encourage your President to at least stop \nsome of his other activities and look at what is happening over there.\n  Mr. DODD. I had not seen the proposal that my good friend and \ncolleague from North Carolina offered, but he made two observations. I \ndon't disagree with the substance of his sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, whether it is on an authorization bill or an appropriations \nbill. This body has spoken out unanimously expressing outrage over the \natrocities in Chechnya.\n  I will say, on behalf of the Secretary of State and the President, \nthat this matter has been raised by them with their counterparts at the \nhighest levels, including a summit a few days ago when the President \nmet with President Putin in Russia. I know the Secretary of State has \nraised it on numerous occasions in conversations I have had with her \nand others have had in hearings.\n  There is a sense, somewhat, of redundancy here, in that all of us \nhave expressed this view, at the executive branch level and at the \nlegislative branch level. I think the word has certainly gone forth \ndirectly to Mr. Putin on behalf of the President of the United States \nthrough our Department of State and through resolutions passed here.\n  I have no objection at all to the resolution and don't disagree with \nany of the substance of it. But Madeleine Albright has conducted \nherself admirably in this regard, as has the President. We all hope the \ntragedy there\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\nwill end and a political resolution will be what results from their \nefforts, and that the atrocities will stop.\n  It is obviously up to the floor managers on how they want to consider \nthis, but I don't have any objection to it being on this bill or any \nother bill. I just wanted to make an observation. That was all I was \ntrying to suggest to my friend and colleague.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and the \nranking Democrat for their patience.\n  Every day that we have been in session over the last several weeks, \nthe Democratic leader or his designees have identified those people who \non this date in the year past lost their lives to gun violence in the \nUnited States. It is a way in which we have tried to highlight the \nsignificance of this issue. We have talked about Columbine High School \nand the tragedy of people losing their lives on that day.\n  The point the leader and those of us who support his efforts in the \narea of gun control have tried to make is that every single day in this \ncountry, there is a Columbine High School, and there has been for some \ntime. So today, in that spirit of reminding our colleagues and the \ncountry again of the ongoing tragedy that occurs every single day in \nthe United States, I will read the names of those people who on June 9, \n1999, all across our country, lost their lives.\n  This is not the complete list in that this list only represents 100 \ncities with a population of more than 12,000 people. There are many \nother communities for which we don't have data.\n  The names are the following: Humberto Albear, Houston, TX; Jeffrey \nBarbush, St. Louis, MO; Guido Colomo, Houston, TX; Maria Cruz, \nPhiladelphia, PA; Bernard Freeman, Chicago, IL; Scott Hawkins, \nBaltimore, MD; Robert Koch, Davenport, IA; Johnnie Martin, Chicago, IL; \nMartin Mendoza, Memphis, TN; Terrance Morrison, Boston, MA; John Rice, \nPhiladelphia, PA; Gerardo Rios, Charlotte, NC; Cherie Shaw, Charlotte, \nNC; Chon Tang, Houston, TX; Tracy Taylor, Chicago, IL; Oscar J. \nTunales, Laredo, TX; unidentified male, Norfolk, VA.\n  Mr. President, the violence still continues in this country. While \nthere is no simple answer, including gun control, there are many other \naspects that provoke and cause this level of violence. There are \nseveral measures that could be adopted by the Congress that would \nreduce this wave that continues every single day in our country.\n  In memory of these 17 people and more--I assume, since we do not \nreflect communities of 12,000 or more who lost their lives, that almost \nthat many will lose their lives today somewhere in this country--it is \nour fervent hope that we will do a better job in reducing this level of \nviolence in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/09/senate-section/article/S4918-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4918-S4920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, when we were debating the authorization \nbill earlier this week, it had come to my attention that there would be \nan amendment offered dealing with the testing program of the National \nMissile Defense System and that some criticism was going to be cited in \nsupport of that amendment attributed to Mr. Ted Postol, who is a \nphysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n  That amendment has not yet been offered. We are now on the \nappropriations bill. I expect we will hear, during the debate on this \nbill, suggestions that we are either appropriating too much money for \nnational missile defense or the program is flawed or in other ways \ncriticism of this program on various--some imagined, some maybe real--\nbases, complaining about the national missile defense appropriations \nand theater missile defense appropriations contained in this bill.\n  I am rising today almost as a preemptive debate against these \ncriticisms which I expect will be made by some Senators. They will use \nMr. Ted Postol from MIT as the authority for their arguments. So I wish \nto give the Senate some background, particularly in view of the New \nYork Times article this morning as an example of merchandising, again, \nof a lot of these arguments that have been made by Mr. Postol.\n  On May 11, Mr. Ted Postol, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology, wrote to a number of Clinton administration officials \nclaiming to have discovered evidence that the National Missile Defense \nsystem now being tested will be easily defeated by simple \ncountermeasures, that the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's own \ndata proved this, and that BMDO and its contractors conspired to hide \nthis information by tampering with flight test data. Mr. Postol also \nclaimed that BMDO had altered the National Missile Defense flight test \nprogram in order to hide the truths he claimed to have discovered.\n  Mr. Postol says he discovered the fatal weakness in the NMD system \nafter studying BMDO data from Integrated Flight Test 1A, which was \nconducted in June, 1997, and was a test of a prototype kill vehicle \nbuilt by the Boeing Company for the NMD interceptor missile. The test \nwas not an attempt to destroy the target, but only to understand the \nseeker's performance. It was intended specifically to understand how \nwell the infrared sensor on the kill vehicle performed, compared to \nexpectations, when it encountered a target warhead and a number of \ndecoys and other penetration aids.\n  Mr. Postol contends that the results of Flight Test 1A showed that \nthe NMD kill vehicle could not distinguish between a simple balloon \ndecoy and an actual warhead, and that the entire test program, \nbeginning with Integrated Flight Test 2, was restructured using far \nsimpler targets to cover up this deficiency in the capacity of the \nvehicle to operate properly.\n  This contention by Mr. Postol is just not true. The facts are that \nFlight Test 1A involved a kill vehicle built by the Boeing Company. \nFlight Test 2 was conducted with a kill vehicle built by Raytheon, and \nused exactly the same target complex as Flight Test 1A, contrary to Mr. \nPostol's claims. Simpler targets were used in Flight Tests 3 and 4 \nbecause these tests had different objectives. Flight Tests 1A and 2 \nwere intended to characterize the performance of the competing seekers; \nFlight test 3 was the first attempt to intercept and destroy a target \nwarhead. Just as testing of any new aircraft begins with a taxi test, \nthen a simple takeoff and landing, the first NMD intercept testing \nbegan with a single warhead accompanied by a balloon decoy. Subsequent \ntests will become progressively more difficult, an approach which \nfollows the recommendations of a panel of experts headed by retired Air \nForce Chief of Staff Larry Welch. In fact, the Welch panel recommended \nthat the Defense Department attempt its first intercept without \ncountermeasures of any kind, in order to begin the testing as simply as \npossible, but BMDO believed it was worth the risk to attempt a more \ncomplicated test.\n  Mr. Postol appears to be unaware that the Boeing kill vehicle is no \nlonger being used in the flight test program. The competing kill \nvehicle built\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\nby Raytheon, which has independently developed software, was selected \nfor the NMD system and has been used in every test since Flight Test \n1A.\n  Mr. Postol claims to have discovered in the data from Flight Test 1A \nthat--and I quote--``the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) will be \ndefeated by the simplest of balloon decoys.'' The fact is that in \nFlight Test 3, on October 2, 1999, exactly the opposite happened, when \nthe EKV disregarded a balloon decoy and successfully destroyed its \ntarget.\n  This isn't the first time Mr. Postol has been notoriously wrong about \nour missile defense program. In 1994, when the United States was \npreparing to conduct the first flight test of its Theater High Altitude \nArea Defense--or THAAD--system, he and some of his colleagues at MIT, \nin an article in Arms Control Today, claimed to have demonstrated that \ntheater missile defenses like THAAD would--and I quote--``almost \ncertainly have significant capabilities against strategic RVs [reentry \nvehicles]'' and that any agreement permitting such capabilities would--\nI quote--``significantly erode the ability of the ABM Treaty to control \nstrategic defenses by allowing systems that could defend areas of tens \nof thousands of square kilometers.''\n  As it turns out, in spite of that suggestion by Mr. Postol and his \ncolleagues from MIT, even the government of Russia never complained \nabout THAAD or similar systems which Mr. Postol said would so upset the \nstrategic balance. And when other technical experts challenged his \nconclusions, Mr. Postol adopted the tactics of questioning the \ncompetence and integrity of his critics. A technical team under \ncontract to the Defense Department reviewed Mr. Postol's THAAD findings \nand found they contained errors. Mr. Postol's response was to write a \nseries of letters to government officials, accusing the technical team \nwhose findings differed from his of ``spreading false and misleading \ninformation'' that ``impugns the scholarly reputation of myself and my \ncolleagues.'' He accused the general officer heading the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Organization of mismanagement and of ``providing false \ninformation to members of the Russian Duma'' in an attempt to--in his \nwords--``influence the Russian debate through subterfuge.'' Mr. Postol \ndemanded that the Defense Department retract its study and issue a \nletter acknowledging its errors. DoD did none of this because they were \nright all along and it was Postol and his MIT colleagues who were wrong \nagain.\n  Two years later, in 1996, Mr. Postol's campaign against missile \ndefenses had taken a new approach. In addition to arguing that systems \nlike THAAD would undermine the Russian strategic deterrent, Mr. Postol \nargued that they would be easily defeated by countermeasures. He said \nin effect that U.S. TMD systems were so good that they would threaten \nthe Russian strategic force and at the same time so bad that they could \nbe easily defeated by even the simplest of countermeasures. Both those \nclaims could not be true.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. Postol continued to promote this argument, and \ncreated detailed drawings illustrating how an aspiring missile power \nmight go about deploying countermeasures to U.S. defensive systems. \nThese ideas were elaborated in an 80 page document which Mr. Postol \ndistributed widely and which was eventually made available on the \ninternet, so that anyone--including those who would benefit most from \nmeasures that could defeat U.S. weapon systems--could obtain it.\n  The claims that Theater Missile Defenses would both threaten \ndeterrence and at the same time be overwhelmed by simple \ncountermeasures is now being made by Postol and his co-authors for \nNational Missile Defense. He is arguing that any nation which can build \na long-range ballistic missile can necessarily build in measures that \nwill allow it to penetrate missile defenses.\n  At the same time, these scientists believe, or say they believe, that \ndeployment of a limited NMB system--even though they believe they can \nscientifically prove it will not work--will cause Russia to maintain \nhigher force levels and China to construct a strategic buildup. All of \nthis is contained in an elaborate, glossy, 175-page document which Mr. \nPostol and his colleagues have distributed widely.\n  It is relatively easy to conceive of devices that are theoretically \npossible using scientific principles. The best science fiction employs \njust such an approach. But it is another thing altogether to transform \nthose concepts from the realm of ideas into hardware. Actually \nengineering a complex device like a weapon system is far different from \nmerely imagining it. For every idea that is transformed into hardware \nand subjected to the real world's trials, many others, thought up by \nsmart people with Ph.D.s from the best universities, are discarded as \nimpractical. Countermeasures are no less subject to this reality than \nare the weapon systems they are intended to frustrate. Imagining is one \nthing; designing, building and testing is quite another.\n  Countermeasures aren't free. Every countermeasures which someone \nattempts to put on a ballistic missile costs real money. \nCountermeasures also consume weight and space, which mean lowered \nperformance or less payload. Countermeasures introduce complexity, \nwhich means more things can go wrong and engineers must spend more time \ntrying to ensure they go right. Engineers trying to perfect \ncountermeasures are diverted from other activities they could be \nworking on, such as extending a missile's range or improving its \nreliability. In short, successful pursuit of countermeasures means \nsacrificing something else, and some may not choose to make that \nsacrifice.\n  Countermeasures are an issue that must be taken seriously by the \ndesigners of our missile defense systems. And, fortunately, they are. \nWhether the weapon is an artillery piece or a ballistic missile, it \nwill have to confront efforts to counter it. In fact, missile defense \nis itself a countermeasure to the ballistic missile. Missile defense \nshould not be abandoned because of the probability that someone will \nattempt to develop a countermeasure. The talented men and women of our \nNational Missile Defense program--who are operating in the real world \nin which ideas must be translated into hardware that works--are \nanticipating and preparing for countermeasures. This is a point that \nhas apparently been lost on Mr. Postol and his concerned colleagues, \nwho would have us believe that new capabilities materialize because \nthey can imagine them.\n  I believe we are going to see more not less criticism as we move \nforward to implement the provisions of Public Law 106-38 and deploy our \nnational missile defense system. Some of the critics have impressive \nacademic credentials. Fortunately, however, people who are impressive \nexperts in the design and construction of our modern weapons are \nworking hard to carry out the mandates of our government to build \nmissile defense systems that will protect our country and all our \nAmerican citizens.\n  An interesting article was published this week in the June 5 issue of \nNational Review, written by John O'Sullivan, entitled ``By Winding \nStair,'' which discusses missile defenses and its antagonists. This is \nan interesting article and is relevant to the subject I have discussed. \nI ask unanimous consent a copy of that article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            By Winding Stair\n\n                          (By John O'Sullivan)\n\n       Although at a glacial speed, and obstructed at every stage \n     by the Clinton administration, America is moving steadily \n     toward the deployment of a national system of missile \n     defense. Public opinion has always been in favor of a \n     commonsense protection against missile attacks from rogue \n     states or accidental launches. Most Americans believe, \n     indeed, that they already enjoy such a defense and are \n     shocked when pollsters inform them otherwise. It was the \n     politicians who needed convincing.\n       A growing sense of U.S. vulnerability led Congress to pass \n     legislation in May 1999 mandating the deployment of a limited \n     national missile-defense system as soon as technically \n     possible. President Clinton signed the legislation, though he \n     continues to drag his feet, insisting that a final decision \n     to deploy will not be made until later this year on the basis \n     of interceptor tests. Given that 2000 is an election year, \n     however, and that there is growing bipartisan support for a \n     decision to deploy, it looks a foregone conclusion.\n       If this progress is a reminder of Bacon's dictum that ``all \n     rising to a great place is by winding stair,'' it is at least \n     spiraling in the right direction. But among America's NATO\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\n     allies, a very different mood prevails. Europe as a whole has \n     not fundamentally rethought its view of missile defense since \n     the morning after Ronald Reagan's ``Star Wars'' speech, when \n     it collectively decided that such schemes were technically \n     impractical, strategically destabilizing, and a threat to \n     arms control. To these earlier criticisms it now adds \n     the post-Cold War complaint that an American decision to \n     build missile defenses would alienate the Russians. Thus, \n     Europeans on the NATO conference circuit regularly snipe \n     at the proposed U.S. missile defense.\n       What is curious about this frozen attitude is not so much \n     that it neglects the new risks from rogue states as that it \n     ignores the fact that they especially threaten Europe. As \n     seasoned defense expert William Schneider Jr. points out: \n     ``Current developments will enable proliferators in the \n     Middle East and Asia to place all of Europe within range of \n     ballistic missiles [possibly armed with mass-destruction \n     warheads] within five years.'' And this threat is growing--\n     with 36 nations possessing ballistic missiles, 17 nations \n     thought to have chemical- and/or biological-warfare programs, \n     8 nations certainly owning nuclear weapons, and 4 nations \n     believed to be ``of nuclear-proliferation concern.'' \n     Unfortunately for Europe, three of these last four are Iran, \n     Iraq, and Libya, all on the periphery of the continent.\n       When such inconvenient facts are pointed out--and they \n     seldom are--Europeans take refuge in the argument that \n     deterrence will protect them against minor rogue states even \n     more securely than it did against the mighty Soviet Union. \n     Now, deterrence may well work for the major powers like \n     Russia and China, which have relatively stable political \n     establishments and a great deal to lose--though it has to \n     fail only once for disaster to occur. But there are a number \n     of reasons for doubting this assurance in other regards. In \n     the first place, deterrence cannot protect against accidental \n     launches, the danger of which increases with proliferation \n     among states that currently operate unsafe airlines. Nor can \n     it protect against a missile launched by a terrorist group \n     with no return address. Nor can it provide a cast-iron \n     defense against the miscalculation of a megalomaniac warlord.\n       And there is a more subtle danger. Will European nations be \n     prepared to intervene to prevent the spread of Third World \n     conflicts if their intervention provokes threats to \n     retaliate with ballistic missiles? This danger is \n     discussed in ``Coming into Range,'' a report by the all-\n     party Missile Proliferation Study Group in London. As it \n     points out, Britain's defense planners have rightly been \n     praised for their proposed creation of a Joint Rapid \n     Reaction Force, built around two new aircraft carriers. \n     The JRFF is intended to enable Britain to intervene \n     swiftly and in force around the globe, and it is doubtless \n     especially welcome to the Pentagon and the State \n     Department as both potential military assistance and \n     political cover. But the absence of a missile-defense \n     system covering Britain may render the force largely \n     useless. ``The reality,'' says the study group's report, \n     ``is that in the absence of protection the crisis might \n     literally come to us as the result of dispatching our \n     forces to the crisis and, that being so, no decision to \n     deploy those forces could be made.'' And if that is true \n     for Britain, which, like France, still retains a culture \n     of military patriotism, how much more likely it is that \n     largely debellicized nations like Germany and Belgium will \n     shrink from military actions that entail such heavy risks. \n     If Saddam Hussein had had long-range ballistic missiles \n     capable of hitting Berlin, Paris, and London in 1990, how \n     many European nations would have taken part in the Gulf \n     War?\n       The implications of this for Europe are very serious. If no \n     Western power deploys missile defense, which is what the \n     Europeans now seem to want, then within a short time every \n     NATO member will be a potential target of nuclear, chemical, \n     or biological attack. Yet if only the U.S. has such a system, \n     that might lead to rogue states' threatening to strike at \n     European targets in retaliation for purely American military \n     interventions. In either event, Europeans would be hostages--\n     and the present system of international relations that rests \n     ultimately on the West's willingness to use force would \n     gradually unravel. The logical solution would seem to be an \n     American-led worldwide system of missile defense organized \n     and deployed, at least in part, through NATO.\n       Why do the Europeans not agitate for this? In part, no \n     doubt, the explanation is intellectual inflexibility. They \n     have been assuring the Americans for so long now, that ``Star \n     Wars'' is a pipe dream that they cannot easily bring \n     themselves to see that it has become a strategic necessity. \n     And since one thread of French foreign policy in recent years \n     has been to restrain what it sees as the overwhelming \n     ``hyper-power'' of the U.S., Paris instinctively opposes \n     anything that buttresses it. The unspoken objection to a \n     missile-defense system is that it would work.\n       The Europeans' spoken, or admitted, objections are another \n     matter. One is that the continent's governments, especially \n     the Germans, have made arms control an unquestionable \n     desideratum of foreign policy. They are accordingly very \n     reluctant to endorse a policy that requires the rewriting or \n     abandonment of the ABM treaty. It would ease their \n     consciences if the Russians could be induced to go along with \n     any such renegotiation. But the Clinton administration called \n     off negotiations with Moscow on missile-defense cooperation \n     in its first term, and at present it seems to see Mr. Putin \n     as its ally against Congress on the issue. Both the Russians \n     and (therefore) the Germans can probably be won over by a \n     sufficiently determined president and a few sweeteners. But \n     that probably requires a new man in the White House.\n       The other big problem is the nexus of money and the \n     European Security and Defense Policy. The ESDP is a non-\n     solution to a non-existent problem. It has no military value, \n     but has the potential to divide the NATO alliance. In their \n     zeal for Euro-integration, the Europeans have committed \n     themselves to it, and the Americans, not wishing to confirm \n     the French stereotype of a hegemonic Uncle Sam, have \n     grudgingly gone along. Useless though it is, the ESDP will \n     cost money at a time when the Europeans have very little to \n     spare--indeed, the budgetary rules of the Maastricht treaty \n     actually prevent their increasing defense expenditure. So \n     there is great reluctance to consider any other program, in \n     particular anything as costly as a NATO missile defense, even \n     though, unlike the ESDP, it would actually provide Europe \n     with more defense.\n       Of course, there are hopeful signs. Realization of their \n     vulnerability is finally beginning to dawn on the British--\n     notably on defense secretary Geoff Hoon. Because the U.S. \n     wants to use British facilities such as the Fylingdales Early \n     Warning Station in its own system, London sees the prospect \n     of Anglo-American cooperation in return for military \n     contracts and a share of the anti-missile umbrella. And much \n     would change in NATO, as it did in 1981, if the next \n     president proved to be a determined advocate of missile \n     defense. After all, the Europeans have not been the only \n     skeptics. Missile defense has had to contend with a hostile \n     White House since 1993.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of the Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, who is necessarily absent, I submit his budget statement and \nscoring table on S. 2593, the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  I support S. 2593, the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year \n2001.

They have been an integral part of the everyday \nproceedings of the U.S. Senate and without their hard work and \ndedication this deliberative body would not be able to complete our \nwork in a timely manner. Throughout the year young men and women come \nto Washington, D.C. from all parts of the nation to serve a vital role \nas Pages in the U.S. Senate. During the spring and fall these high \nschool students attend the Page School in the early mornings and \ncontinue their day as U.S. Senate Pages often working long days and \ninto the night. I must say, this group of Pages was of the highest \ncaliber and are among the best youth our Nation has to offer. At this \ntime, I would like to commend them for their service and enter their \nnames in the Record.\n\n       Shannon Coe, Ashley Burnett, Kelly Morgan, Shannon \n     Montague, Emily Schlect, Loki Gale Tobin, Kyle Brown, Misty \n     Lebatard, Clinton Lee Johnson Jr., Chase Dubay, Benton \n     Keatley, Anjel Jefferson, Nicole Tailleart, Rebecca Manning, \n     Jean-Paul Isabelle, Andriea Aden, Seema Mittal, James Dolan, \n     Nathaniel Haefs, Hannah Pierson-Compeau, Jay Oliphant, \n     Allison Conley, Megan Gilbert.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/09/senate-section/article/S4921-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MANDATING DISCLOSURE BY SECTION 527 ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, I commend Senators Lieberman, McCain, \nFeingold, Daschle and Levin for all of their hard work on the issue of \nSection 527 organizations. This latest mutation in fundraising is just \nanother example of the failure of our existing campaign finance laws.\n  Hopefully, the passage of our amendment yesterday, which mandates \ndisclosure by Section 527 organizations, will close yet another legal \nloophole being exploited by clever campaign fundraisers. This amendment \nshould make unregulated and unlimited contributions to these so-called \nSection 527 committees much less attractive. Although donors will be \nable to continue to make as many tax-deductible contributions as they \nwant, they will no longer be able to do so in absolute secrecy.\n  These Section 527 organizations, named after a section of the tax \ncode, skirt existing campaign finance laws by carefully avoiding the \nendorsement of any particular candidate. This convoluted reasoning \nproceeds as follows: if a Section 527 committee does not endorse a \nparticular candidate, then it is not engaged in political activity; if \nit is not engaged in political activity, then there is no requirement \nfor it to disclose who has contributed money to the committee; since it \nis not engaged in political activity, it can run unlimited issue ads \nwithout obeying existing campaign finance laws regarding disclosure.\n  We all know from past experience that it is just a matter of time \nbefore enormous amounts of campaign cash are funneled through more and \nmore of these secret organizations. The amendment which passed \nyesterday, which I was pleased to cosponsor, will force Section 527 \norganizations to emerge from the shadows. They will be required to \ndisclose their existence to the IRS, file publicly available tax \nreturns, make public reports specifying annual expenditures over $500, \nand identify those making contributions of $200 or more a year to the \norganization.\n  Although disclosure is only part of the solution, the passage of this \namendment ensures that the public understands who these committees are, \nwho gives them their money, and how they spend that money. I was \npleased to give it my support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/09/senate-section/article/S4921-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ACCESS TO INNOVATION FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I think we all recognize that the Medicare \nProgram is outdated. The bill introduced by the Senator from Washington \nwould modernize Medicare's coverage to include new biotechnology \ninnovations. Currently, the Medicare program covers physician-\nadministered therapies that are given in an office by infusion or \ninjection, but not those that are injected by a patient or a caregiver \nat home. Biotechnology has brought us new innovative biologics that are \nmade with large proteins that are so unlike other drugs that they must \nbe formulated as injectables. Science has allowed us to make many of \nthese new products in the form of simple injections that do not have to \nbe given by a health care professional in a clinical setting.\n  The bill I have cosponsored today would bring Medicare up to date \nwith these developments by ensuring that new biological therapies are \navailable to Medicare beneficiaries. It just does not make sense to \ncontinue Medicare's bias toward treatments that are more expensive and \nless convenient for patients.\n  I would like to add one point about the bill's cost. We do not know \nyet what the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] will determine the \nestimated cost of this change in Medicare policy will be. I understand \nthe cosponsors of this legislation have requested an estimate from CBO. \nAn analysis by the Lewin Group found that this legislation would not \nresult in increasing the cost to the Medicare program. This finding is \nnot surprising given that the bill would reduce certain costs, such as \nphysician office visits and other expensive services, which would no \nlonger be needed. I am hopeful that the CBO will reach the same \nconclusion. While it is important to modernize Medicare, it is equally \nimportant that we do so in a way that does not weaken the financial \nstrength of the program.\n  I commend Senator Gorton for his leadership on this legislation. It \nrepresents the kind of constructive reform that is needed in the \nMedicare program; reform that would advance and modernize Medicare \nwithout imposing additional costs to the program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/09/senate-section/article/S4921-5", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL VALMORO III\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ndistinguished career of an outstanding American, Mr. Michael Valmoro of \nMahwah, New Jersey. Serving his community as a teacher of English, \nworld literature and the works of William Shakespeare at Teaneck High \nSchool for the past thirty-eight years, he is one of the longest \nserving teachers in the history of the New Jersey school system. That \ntremendous achievement alone is worthy of praise. However, his \ncommitment to his students by opening their young minds to the world's \ngreat literature and the genius of William Shakespeare has made him a \nrespected educator and pillar of the community.\n  Cicero once professed, ``What nobler employment, or more valuable to \nthe state, than that of the man who instructs the rising generation.'' \nIt is clear that Mr. Valmoro has taken Cicero's wisdom to heart during \nthe course of the last four decades, as he has enlightened and inspired \nthe thousands of students fortunate enough to have passed through his \nclassroom.\n  Whether he was teaching his students to express themselves through \ncreative writing, introducing them to the tragedy of ``Romeo and \nJuliet'' or reveling in the simple joy found in one of Shakespeare's \nsonnets, Mr. Valmoro approached each of his lessons with the wisdom and \nperspective of a scholar and the unbridled enthusiasm of an eager \nstudent.\n  In one of the scenes of ``King Lear,'' the titular monarch asks his \naudience, ``Who is it who can tell me who I am?'' This question often \npresents itself to an individual upon the twilight of their career. If \nthe outpouring of accolades, fond reminiscence and affection are any \nindication, the answer to this probing question for Mr. Valmoro is, an \nexcellent teacher, a trusted mentor, a lover of great literature and an \ninspiration to his colleagues, students and family.\n  Throughout his distinguished tenure, Mr. Valmoro has exemplified the \nideals which the American people value in their educators. It is with \nmy most sincere congratulations and respect that I recognize him today \nin the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/09/senate-section/article/S4922-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4922]]\n                IN RECOGNITION OF GEORGE ABRAHAM THAMPY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT.

The \n     Board may delegate to the Administrator (as defined in \n     section ____05) the authority to approve loan guarantees of \n     up to $20,000,000. To the extent the Administrator is \n     delegated such authority, the Administrator shall comply with \n     the terms of this title applicable to the Board.\n       (d) Requirements and Criteria Applicable to Approval.--\n       (1) In general.--The Board shall utilize the underwriting \n     criteria developed under subsection (g), and any relevant \n     information provided by the departments and agencies with \n     which the Board consults under section ____03, to determine \n     which loans may be eligible for a loan guarantee under this \n     title.\n       (2) Prerequisites.--In addition to meeting the underwriting \n     criteria under paragraph (1), a loan may not be guaranteed \n     under this title unless--\n       (A) the loan is made to finance the acquisition, \n     improvement, enhancement, construction, deployment, launch, \n     or rehabilitation of the means by which local television \n     broadcast signals, and related signals (including high-speed \n     Internet access and National Weather Service warnings), will \n     be delivered to an unserved area or underserved area;\n       (B) the proceeds of the loan will not be used for operating \n     expenses;\n       (C) the proposed project, as determined by the Board in \n     consultation with the National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration, is not likely to have a \n     substantial adverse impact on competition that outweighs the \n     benefits of improving access to the signals of a local \n     television station in an unserved area or underserved area;\n       (D)(i) the loan (including Other Debt, as defined in \n     subsection (f)(2)(B))--\n       (I) is provided by any entity engaged in the business of \n     commercial lending--\n\n       (aa) if the loan is made in accordance with loan-to-one-\n     borrower and affiliate transaction restrictions to which the \n     entity is subject under applicable law; or\n       (bb) if item (aa) does not apply, the loan is made only to \n     a borrower that is not an affiliate of the entity and only if \n     the amount of the loan and all outstanding loans by that \n     entity to that borrower and any of its affiliates does not \n     exceed 10 percent of the net equity of the entity; or\n\n       (II) is provided by a nonprofit corporation, including the \n     National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, \n     engaged primarily in commercial lending, if the Board \n     determines that such nonprofit corporation has one or more \n     issues of outstanding long-term debt that is rated within the \n     highest 3 rating categories of a nationally recognized \n     statistical rating organization, and, if the Board determines \n     that the making of the loan by such nonprofit corporation \n     will cause a decline in the debt rating mentioned above, the \n     Board at its discretion may disapprove the loan guarantee on \n     this basis;\n       (ii)(I) no loan (including Other Debt as defined in \n     subsection (f)(2)(B)) may be made for purposes of this Act by \n     a governmental entity or affiliate thereof, or by the Federal \n     Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, or any institution \n     supervised by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \n     Oversight, the Federal Housing Finance Board, or any \n     affiliate of such entities;\n       (II) any loan (including Other Debt as defined in \n     subsection (f)(2)(B)) must have terms, in the judgment of the \n     Board, that are consistent in material respects with the \n     terms of similar obligations in the private capital market;\n       (III) for purposes of clause (i)(I)(bb), the term ``net \n     equity'' means the value of the total assets of the entity, \n     less the total liabilities of the entity, as recorded under \n     generally accepted accounting principles for the fiscal \n     quarter ended immediately prior to the date on which the \n     subject loan is approved;\n       (E) repayment of the loan is required to be made within a \n     term of the lesser of--\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\n       (i) 25 years from the date of the execution of the loan; or\n       (ii) the economically useful life, as determined by the \n     Board or in consultation with persons or entities deemed \n     appropriate by the Board, of the primary assets to be used in \n     the delivery of the signals concerned; and\n       (F) the loan meets any additional criteria developed under \n     subsection (g).\n       (3) Protection of united states financial interests.--The \n     Board may not approve the guarantee of a loan under this \n     title unless--\n       (A) the Board has been given documentation, assurances, and \n     access to information, persons, and entities necessary, as \n     determined by the Board, to address issues relevant to the \n     review of the loan by the Board for purposes of this title; \n     and\n       (B) the Board makes a determination in writing that--\n       (i) to the best of its knowledge upon due inquiry, the \n     assets, facilities, or equipment covered by the loan will be \n     utilized economically and efficiently;\n       (ii) the terms, conditions, security, and schedule and \n     amount of repayments of principal and the payment of interest \n     with respect to the loan protect the financial interests of \n     the United States and are reasonable;\n       (iii) to the extent possible, the value of collateral \n     provided by an applicant is at least equal to the unpaid \n     balance of the loan amount covered by the loan guarantee (the \n     ``Amount'' for purposes of this clause); and if the value of \n     collateral provided by an applicant is less than the Amount, \n     the additional required collateral is provided by any \n     affiliate of the applicant; and if the combined value of \n     collateral provided by an applicant and any affiliate is not \n     at least equal to the Amount, the collateral from such \n     affiliate represents all of such affiliate's assets;\n       (iv) all necessary and required regulatory and other \n     approvals, spectrum rights, and delivery permissions have \n     been received for the loan, the project under the loan, and \n     the Other Debt, if any, under subsection (f)(2)(B);\n       (v) the loan would not be available on reasonable terms and \n     conditions without a loan guarantee under this title; and\n       (vi) repayment of the loan can reasonably be expected.\n       (e) Considerations.--\n       (1) Type of market.--\n       (A) Priority considerations.--To the maximum extent \n     practicable, the Board shall give priority in the approval of \n     loan guarantees under this title in the following order: \n     First, to projects that will serve the greatest number of \n     households in unserved areas and the number of States \n     (including noncontiguous States); and second, to projects \n     that will serve the greatest number of households in \n     underserved areas. In each instance, the Board shall consider \n     the project's efficiency in providing service given the area \n     to be served.\n       (B) Additional considerations.--To the maximum extent \n     practicable, the Board should give additional consideration \n     to projects which also provide related signals (including \n     high-speed Internet access and National Weather Service \n     warnings).\n       (C) Prohibition.--The Board may not approve a loan \n     guarantee under this title for a project that is designed \n     primarily to serve 1 or more of the 40 most populated \n     designated market areas (as that term is defined in section \n     122(j) of title 17, United States Code).\n       (2) Other considerations.--The Board shall consider other \n     factors, which shall include projects that would--\n       (A) offer a separate tier of local broadcast signals, but \n     for applicable Federal, State, or local laws or regulations;\n       (B) provide lower projected costs to consumers of such \n     separate tier; and\n       (C) enable the delivery of local broadcast signals \n     consistent with the purpose of this title by a means \n     reasonably compatible with existing systems or devices \n     predominantly in use.\n       (f) Guarantee Limits.--\n       (1) Limitation on aggregate value of loans.--The aggregate \n     value of all loans for which loan guarantees are issued under \n     this title (including the unguaranteed portion of loans \n     issued under paragraph (2)(A)) and Other Debt under paragraph \n     (2)(B) may not exceed $1,250,000,000.\n       (2) Guarantee level.--A loan guarantee issued under this \n     title--\n       (A) may not exceed an amount equal to 80 percent of a loan \n     meeting in its entirety the requirements of subsection \n     (d)(2)(A). If only a portion of a loan meets the requirements \n     of that subsection, the Board shall determine that percentage \n     of the loan meeting such requirements (the ``applicable \n     portion'') and may issue a loan guarantee in an amount not \n     exceeding 80 percent of the applicable portion; or\n       (B) may, as to a loan meeting in its entirety the \n     requirements of subsection (d)(2)(A), cover the amount of \n     such loan only if that loan is for an amount not exceeding 80 \n     percent of the total debt financing for the project, and \n     other debt financing (also meeting in its entirety the \n     requirements of subsection (d)(2)(A)) from the same source \n     for a total amount not less than 20 percent of the total debt \n     financing for the project (``Other Debt'') has been approved.\n       (g) Underwriting Criteria.--Within the period provided for \n     under subsection (b)(1), the Board shall, in consultation \n     with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and \n     an independent public accounting firm, develop underwriting \n     criteria relating to the guarantee of loans that are \n     consistent with the purpose of this title, including \n     appropriate collateral and cash flow levels for loans \n     guaranteed under this Act, and such other matters as the \n     Board considers appropriate.\n       (h) Credit Risk Premiums.--\n       (1) Establishment and acceptance.--The Board may establish \n     and approve the acceptance of credit risk premiums with \n     respect to a loan guarantee under this title in order to \n     cover the cost, as determined under section 504(b)(1) of the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, of the loan guarantee. To \n     the extent that appropriations of budget authority are \n     insufficient to cover the cost, as so determined, of a loan \n     guarantee under this title, credit risk premiums shall be \n     accepted from a non-Federal source under this subsection on \n     behalf of the applicant for the loan guarantee.\n       (2) Credit risk premium amount.--\n       (A) In general.--The Board shall determine the amount of \n     any credit risk premium to be accepted with respect to a loan \n     guarantee under this title on the basis of--\n       (i) the financial and economic circumstances of the \n     applicant for the loan guarantee, including the amount of \n     collateral offered;\n       (ii) the proposed schedule of loan disbursements;\n       (iii) the business plans of the applicant for providing \n     service;\n       (iv) any financial commitment from a broadcast signal \n     provider; and\n       (v) the concurrence of the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget as to the amount of the credit risk \n     premium.\n       (B) Proportionality.--To the extent that appropriations of \n     budget authority are sufficient to cover the cost, as \n     determined under section 504(b)(1) of the Federal Credit \n     Reform Act of 1990, of loan guarantees under this title, the \n     credit risk premium with respect to each loan guarantee shall \n     be reduced proportionately.\n       (C) Payment of premiums.--Credit risk premiums under this \n     subsection shall be paid to an account (the ``Escrow \n     Account'') established in the Treasury which shall accrue \n     interest and such interest shall be retained by the account, \n     subject to subparagraph (D).\n       (D) Deductions from escrow account.--If a default occurs \n     with respect to any loan guaranteed under this title and the \n     default is not cured in accordance with the terms of the \n     underlying loan or loan guarantee agreement, the \n     Administrator, in accordance with subsections (h) and (i) of \n     section ____05, shall liquidate, or shall cause to be \n     liquidated, all assets collateralizing such loan as to which \n     it has a lien or security interest. Any shortfall between the \n     proceeds of the liquidation net of costs and expenses \n     relating to the liquidation, and the guarantee amount paid \n     pursuant to this title shall be deducted from funds in the \n     Escrow Account and credited to the Administrator for payment \n     of such shortfall. At such time as determined under \n     subsection (d)(2)(E) when all loans guaranteed under this \n     title have been repaid or otherwise satisfied in accordance \n     with this title and the regulations promulgated hereunder, \n     remaining funds in the Escrow Account, if any, shall be \n     refunded, on a pro rata basis, to applicants whose loans \n     guaranteed under this title were not in default, or where any \n     default was cured in accordance with the terms of the \n     underlying loan or loan guarantee agreement.\n       (i) Judicial Review.--The decision of the Board to approve \n     or disapprove the making of a loan guarantee under this title \n     shall not be subject to judicial review.\n\n     SEC. ____05.

Mr. President, 10 years ago, I met with an extraordinary \ngroup of people in the basement of a home in suburban Maryland, just \noutside Washington, DC. They came from all kinds of backgrounds and \nfields, but they were united by one common desire, and that was to try \nto prevent fetal alcohol syndrome and help children and families who \nare living with its consequences.\n  The other night, I saw some of those same people again at a reception \ncelebrating the 10th anniversary of NOFAS, the National Organization \nfor Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.\n  Born in that suburban Maryland basement 10 years ago, NOFAS is now \nthe world's leading clearinghouse for information on fetal alcohol \nsyndrome and fetal alcohol effects. I am proud to say that my wife and \nI serve on its board of directors.\n  At the reception the other night, I was asked to say a few words \nabout why I support NOFAS. I could have cited its pivotal role in the \nsignificant advances in our understanding of fetal alcohol syndrome and \nfetal alcohol effect. Ten years ago, we knew very little about fetal \nalcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects, its only slightly milder \nversion. Today, we know that as many as 40,000 children are born each \nyear in this country with FAS and other alcohol-related conditions, \ncosting Americans more than $3 billion a year in direct health care \nexpenses.\n  We know that fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading known cause of \nmental retardation among children. We know that FAS and FAE are both \n100 percent preventable when pregnant women abstain from alcohol. And \nwe know now that there is no safe level of alcohol use during \npregnancy. That is progress, and it is possible we still would not know \nthese things today were it not for 10 years of diligent and dedicated \nwork by the National Organization for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Instead, \nI talked about two other reasons that I support NOFAS. Those reasons \nare Karli Schrider and Lucy Klene. If you ever drop by the NOFAS office \nin Washington on a Friday afternoon, there is a good chance you will \nrun into Karli. She volunteers at NOFAS every Friday stuffing \ninformation packets. It is one of her many volunteer jobs.\n  Twenty-eight years ago, when Karli's mother, Kathy, was pregnant with \nKarli, it was not uncommon for expectant mothers to be told to ``drink \na beer a day for a fat, healthy baby.'' Women who were in danger of \nmiscarrying were sometimes hospitalized and given alcohol intravenously \nfor 5 or 6 hours in the mistaken belief it would prevent miscarriage. \nBack then, it never crossed Kathy's mind that her occasional glasses of \nwine might be harming her unborn child. Besides, just the year before, \nKathy had had another baby who was perfectly healthy, and she drank \nduring that pregnancy, too. The first time Karli was misdiagnosed, she \nwas an infant. A doctor attributed her developmental delays to chronic \near infections.\n  When he was 4 years old, a psychologist offered another explanation \nfor Karli's difficulties. He said she was\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\nbeing ``willfully disobedient.'' When Karli was 8, a team of \nspecialists misdiagnosed her again with cerebral palsy. Eight years \nlater, when Karli was 16, Kathy was training to be a substance abuse \ncounselor. As part of her training, she attended a conference on crack \nbabies. Sitting in the audience, she was stunned. Every characteristic \nof crack babies the lecturer described, Karli had. But Kathy had never \nused crack. She tracked down the few studies that had been done at that \ntime on the effects of alcohol on fetuses. Again, she saw the same list \nof symptoms.\n\n  Years later, researchers would announce that most of the symptoms \nthey originally thought were the result of fetal exposure to crack were \nactually the result of fetal alcohol exposure, and that alcohol is much \nmore devastating to fetuses than crack or any other drug. That was 11 \nyears ago, before NOFAS was born. Learning the real cause of Karli's \nspecial challenges has not erased those challenges. FAS and FAE are \nlifelong conditions.\n  But knowing the truth has enabled Kathy--and others in Karli's life \nto focus less on Karli's deficits, and more on her strengths. One of \nthose strengths is Karli's extraordinary kindness and empathy. In \naddition to her volunteer work at NOFAS, Karli also volunteers to help \npeople with cerebral palsy and the elderly. Two years ago, she was \nnamed one of America's ``Thousand Points of Life'' by former President \nBush. She is an inspiration to everyone who meets her, and one of the \nreasons I believe so deeply in the work NOFAS does.\n  Another reason I believe in NOFAS is because of a pint-sized little \ngirl named Lucy Klene. Lucy is 4 years old. She spent the first two \nyears of her life in an orphanage in Russia. When she was 2, she was \nadopted by Stephan and Lydia Klene, of Herndon, VA. The Klenes also \nadopted a son from Russia, Paul, who is 3 years old and has no apparent \nfetal alcohol effects. Within a month after bringing Lucy and Paul \nhome, Stephan and Lydia began to suspect that Lucy had special \nchallenges. Over the next 16 months, Lucy was evaluated eight times by \npediatricians and other specialists. Not one of them recognized the \nsymptoms of Lucy's fetal alcohol effects. Finally, scouring the \nInternet, Stephan stumbled on the truth. He and Lydia took their \nresearch to Lucy's pediatrician, who read it and confirmed their hunch.\n  Today, Lucy is a talented little gymnast who attends special \neducation preschool. While it is still too early to know for sure, her \ndoctor and parents think there is a good chance she will be able to \nlive an independent and productive life when she grows up. Together, \nKarli and Lucy illustrate some of the progress that has been made in \nthe 10 years since NOFAS was born. We still have a long way to go. \nToday children with FAS and FAE are being diagnosed earlier. That means \nthey are getting help earlier, which means they have a better chance at \nfull and productive lives.\n  It took Karli's family 16 years to get a correct diagnosis. It took \nLucy's family 16 months. That is progress. Eleven years ago, when Karli \nwas diagnosed, there was very little research on the effects of alcohol \non fetuses. Ten years later, Lucy's father was able to find an enormous \namount of information on the Internet. Slowly but surely, the studies \nare being done and the information is reaching the people who need it. \nThat is real progress. When Karli was diagnosed, there were few, if \nany, people Kathy could turn to for support and advice. Today, Stephan \nand Lydia attend a NOFAS support group for parents of children with FAS \nand FAE, and they know they are not alone. That, too, is progress.\n  At the reception the other night, we celebrated an incredible \nmilestone, the 10th anniversary of NOFAS. But next Thursday, June 15, \nwill mark another milestone. At the urging of Stephan and Lydia, in \nFairfax, VA, the school district will hold its first ever meeting to \nhelp preschool teachers recognize FAS and FAE and help children and \nfamilies living with this challenge each and every day. And NOFAS will \nconduct the training. That is real progress.\n  I hope everyone today will recognize how fortunate we are--those of \nus lucky enough to be born healthy, those of us lucky enough to be born \nwithout fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effect.\n  I hope everyone will congratulate those who have worked so diligently \nover the course of the last 10 years to make NOFAS what it is today, \nand to recognize NOFAS for the difference they are making in the lives \nof Karli and Lucy and hundreds of thousands of others who live with the \nchallenges of FAS and FAE, and for millions of babies who have been \nborn healthy these last 10 years because of NOFAS. May their next 10 \nyears be even more remarkable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/09/senate-section/article/S4929-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4929-S4930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE HOUSE THE SENATE BUILT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today the Senate has resolved to embark \nupon a unique partnership with Habitat for Humanity International. That \nis what I want to speak about this morning. In honor of National \nHomeownership Week, which concludes tomorrow, the Senate will resolve \ntoday to lend its support and its elbow grease to a project we call \n``The House the Senate Built.''\n  The idea of this project is to bring Members of the Senate, their \nstaffs, local Habitat affiliates, volunteers, and sponsors together to \nbuild simple and decent, affordable housing for low-income families in \nall 50 States and the District of Columbia, and to do this by the end \nof 2001.\n  The project will begin with a ``model build'' right here in \nWashington, DC, slated to begin before National Homeownership Week in \n2001. Following this event, Habitat for Humanity International will \nlink Senators with local Habitat affiliates in their respective States. \nThe Senators will then work with these local affiliates to build at \nleast one Habitat house in their States during 2001.\n  So we are going to have 51 houses built by the Senate before the end \nof 2001.\n  For over 24 years, Habitat for Humanity International has been at the \nforefront of turning the American dream of owning a home into a \nreality. Founded by Millard Fuller in 1976, Habitat for Humanity is an \necumenical Christian housing organization to eliminate poverty housing, \nend homelessness worldwide, and make a decent shelter a matter of \nconscience and action.\n  Since its inception, Habitat has built over 80,000 homes that have \nhoused over 400,000 people worldwide. This September, Habitat will \nbuild its 100,000th home, and they seek to build another 100,000 by \n2005. So they started 24 years ago. By September they will have built \ntheir first 100,000. In the next 5 years, they hope and anticipate \nbuilding their next 100,000 homes.\n  I have talked personally and visited a number of times with Millard \nFuller. I have had him out to Kansas and hosted him there. He is quite \na dynamic individual. He has a great heart and wants to see people \naround the world living in good housing. And he is getting there, one \nhome at a time, but they are building up fast.\n  Habitat for Humanity relies solely on volunteer labor to build their \nhomes. The remarkable success of Habitat is in large part attributed to \nthe tireless efforts of its founder, Millard Fuller, to continually \nbring new building partners on board.\n  Over the years, Millard has enlisted the services of foreign \nAmbassadors, former Presidents--President Carter probably being the \nmost noteworthy and most frequent builder--and even the House of \nRepresentatives has helped to aid in building homes at various sites \nacross the country. This year, Millard Fuller has turned to the Senate \nto build some houses.\n  I ran into Millard as I was waiting to catch my flight back home at \nthe airport in Kathmandu, Nepal, this past January. Sitting there in a \nsmall waiting room, thousands of miles away from home, Millard shared \nwith me the vision he had for bringing the Senate together with Habitat \nfor Humanity International.\n  He was in Nepal, building houses and announcing a program there, but \nat the same time he was also thinking, what could he do to build some \nthrough the Senate? That is where we discussed this program.\n  The ``House the Senate Built'' project that was born out of this \nvision\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\nwill undoubtedly be a successful one. We will build the houses. I think \nwe will build a lot more than 51 houses. That is our target. Benjamin \nFranklin once wrote: ``Well done is better than well said.'' I think \nthat may particularly apply to the Senate. We talk frequently about \nthings. Here is a chance for us to do something about homeownership.\n  I think it is going to be a great project for us to be able to put \npeople in homes. I can come to the floor today in the middle of \nNational Homeownership Week and tell you that we should be committed to \nend homelessness across the country and eliminate poverty housing, but \ninstead of telling you that, I would rather show you. I would rather \npick up a hammer and demonstrate my commitment to affordable housing, \nnail by nail.\n  I am proud to come to the floor today and discuss this important \ninitiative. This Senate is saying that words of support are not enough. \nNothing less than the sweat of our brows will do in expressing how \ncommitted the Senate is in making the American dream of homeownership a \ntrue reality.\n  I thank the Chair and hope we are going to be able to adopt this \nresolution yet today.

Mr. President, I would like to let my colleagues know \nabout a woman who, this morning, is working at the post office in Knox, \nND. Knox, ND, is a little town of 42 people, but it is big enough to \nhave a post office.\n  Just recently, the postmaster of the Knox, ND, post office, a woman \nnamed Vivian Seter, retired. Upon Vivian's retirement at age 73, Maggie \nMiller took over the job.\n  Now maybe my colleagues are thinking there is nothing unusual in \nthat. But Maggie is 83 years old, and she just took over the running of \nthe post office in Knox from her 73-year-old friend Vivian.\n  The post office has cut its hours a bit since Maggie took over, so it \nis open now from 8:30 until 10:30 a.m. In fact, in about 10 minutes \nfrom now, central time in Knox, ND, Maggie will be hanging it up for \nthe day. But for now, at age 83, after working 62 years in the postal \nsystem, Maggie has assumed the reins of the Knox Post Office.\n  The reason I mention this today is that I have talked a lot over the \nyears about rural values. There is something quite remarkable and \nunique about life in the small towns of rural America. I represent a \nwonderful State, North Dakota, with a lot of small communities. Knox, \nND, is one of them.\n  There are also a lot of hard-working, remarkable people in these \nsmall towns, and Maggie Miller is one of them. Again, she has been \nworking for the postal system for 62 years, and I read in the newspaper \nthat the postmaster from Rolla, ND, had to come\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\ntrain her for her new position. Vivian, the retiring postmaster, joked: \nShe has only been doing this 62 years, so she needs a little training.\n  The article I read about her said that last year Maggie, who was age \n82 at the time, bowled a 204. Then she broke her wrist and has had to \ntake the summer off. But Maggie being Maggie, she vows to make a \ncomeback to her bowling league.\n  When I saw this story in the paper, I just had to call Maggie. When \nshe answered the phone, I said: Maggie, this is Byron Dorgan calling \nfrom Washington, DC. I wanted to tell you that it is wonderful that you \nare stepping in as postmaster at age 83. Maggie said: Tell me another \none. I said: No, Maggie, it really is Byron Dorgan. And she said: I bet \nit is.\n  So Maggie, if you happen to be watching this debate in Congress, I \nreally did call you. I say congratulations. You have a lot of spunk. I \nam proud of all the things you have done and of the values that you \nrepresent of folks in small towns helping each other and working \ntogether. I know the post office in many small towns is the hub of the \ncommunity, and I am confident you will serve Knox well.\n  Congratulations to Maggie and to the town of Knox.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/09/senate-section/article/S4931-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4931-S4932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SANCTIONS ON FOOD AND MEDICINE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will speak for a few moments about the \nissue of the sanctions on food and medicine that exist in this country \nwith respect to other countries.\n  I have a chart that describes what has happened to our family \nfarmers. I represent a State with a lot of wheat growers. This chart \nshows what has happened to the price of wheat. As my colleagues can \nsee, it has collapsed. Over a period of a few years, the price of wheat \nhas just flat collapsed. I guess it is because the grain markets have \ndetermined that the food our family farmers produce does not have much \nvalue.\n  So our farmers, at a time when their prices have collapsed, are \nstruggling mightily. They have a very difficult time trying to deal \nwith collapsed prices. Yet all their expenses continue to increase. \nThey have a difficult time understanding what is happening in the world \nrelative to their prices and to people around the world who need what \nthey produce.\n  This is a picture that is in stark contrast to the graph that shows a \ncollapse in the price of wheat. This is a picture of hunger. This \npicture is all too typical in some parts of the world. Starvation, \ndeprivation, desperate hunger, hundreds of millions of people go to bed \nwith an ache in their belly because they didn't have enough to eat. \nMillions and millions of children don't have enough to eat. Every eight \nseconds, one child dies because of hunger and hunger-related causes. \nYet a family farmer who plows the ground in the spring and tends to the \ncrop, and is lucky enough to get a crop off in the fall, takes that \nload of wheat to the elevator only to be told by the grain trade: The \nfood you have produced doesn't have value.\n  Farmers wonder if so many people in the world are so hungry, if so \nmany live in starvation, and suffer from deprivation, and go to bed \nhungry, why is it that the food we produce in such abundant quantity in \nthis country has no value?\n\n  As we talk about this disconnection--indeed, it is a disconnection of \nwhat we produce and what the world so desperately needs and the hunger \nthat exists around the rest of the world, and then for our producers to \nbe told that what they have produced doesn't have value--we have a \npolicy in the United States that says: There are certain countries in \nthis world whose behavior is such that we want to impose an economic \nembargo. Included in that embargo, we, as a country, want to prohibit \nthe sale of food and medicine to those other countries. That is current \npolicy. In fact, almost 11 percent of the wheat export market in the \nworld has been off limits to our family farmers because of sanctions \nthat we have applied against other countries.\n  North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and others have been told, the United States \nof America will not move grain and medicine to these countries because \nthey are behaving outside the norm of international behavior and \ntherefore, we impose sanctions. Those sanctions include food and \nmedicine. That is wrong-headed public policy, and it should never have \nhappened in the first place. It is a bipartisan mistake by \nadministrations over the years that have included food and medicine in \nthe economic sanctions. We should never include food and medicine in \nsanctions we impose against other governments. We should never use food \nas a weapon. We should never include medicine as a part of a sanction--\nto use medicine as a weapon. We ought to decide now that we are going \nto change that policy.\n  A bipartisan group of us, myself in the Appropriations Committee, \njoined by Senator Slade Gorton from the State of Washington, with the \nsupport of Senator Ashcroft, Senator Dodd, and a group of others, have \noffered an amendment in the Appropriations Committee to say: No more; \nlet us abolish all sanctions on food and medicine shipments everywhere \nin the world. It passed. It is in the Agriculture appropriations bill \nthat will come to the floor of the Senate.\n  That is not new. We passed it last year as well, by 70 votes in the \nSenate. Because of one issue, it got hijacked by some legislative \nleaders and did not become law. They are planning to hijack it again.\n  The issue is Cuba. We have legislative leaders who say Cuba is a \ndifferent story. We must maintain sanctions against the shipment of \nfood and medicine to Cuba. They want to retain the entire embargo with \nCuba. But the 40 years of embargo has failed.\n  The question is--when you have an experiment, a laboratory \nexperiment, and this is a real experiment, a real laboratory, for 40 \nyears you have an embargo against Cuba and it doesn't work--who will be \nthe first to stand up and say: This does not work; maybe we ought to do \nsomething else?\n  We are not talking about the entire embargo with respect to Cuba. We \nare just talking about the issue of food and medicine and the sanctions \nthat now apply to shipments of food and medicine to Cuba. The \nlegislative leaders are intending to hijack this position once again. \nOur intent to repeal that sanction is going to be hijacked once again, \nunless we find a way to stop it.\n  The Washington Post today wrote an editorial, ``Food for Cuba.'' They \nmake the point that there is no justification for having sanctions on \nfood and medicine for Cuba, and there is no justification. It is \ninteresting that the debate over normal trade relations with China \nproduces all these folks who come to the floor of the House and Senate \nand say: We must engage with China. Engaging with a Communist nation \nwill inevitably move that nation in a more constructive direction. More \ntrade and more direction towards open markets will inevitably improve \nthings in a country such as China.\n\n  If that is the case, why is it not the case with Cuba, also a \nCommunist country? Why is it the case that engagement with China is \nproductive in moving them towards better human rights and towards a \nmore constructive direction, but it is not the case in Cuba? The answer \nis the current embargo that exists with Cuba makes no sense at all. \nSanctions against the shipments of food and medicine, not only to Cuba \nbut to the other sanctioned countries in the world, is not moral \npolicy. It is not moral for this country, in my judgment, to use food \nand medicine as part of sanctions. It is wrong.\n  I started by talking about farmers. Yes. I have an interest to try to \nmake sure farmers have the opportunity to serve markets. Those who \nsupport Freedom to Farm. I don't; I don't think it has worked. We need \nto ask the same question with respect to markets. If you say the \nFreedom to Farm approach is something that is important for farmers, \nwhat about the freedom to sell? Freedom to Farm--what about the freedom \nto sell? Farmers are told they have the freedom to farm. What about the \nfreedom to sell their products to Cuba, or the freedom to sell their \nwheat to Iran, or the freedom to sell their wheat to Libya?\n  If we have in the coming weeks the kind of chicanery that went on \nlast year to hijack this policy, to hijack those Republicans and \nDemocrats who say we must end these sanctions on the shipment of food \nand medicine to all countries--and, yes, including Cuba--if\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\nthey intend to hijack that again through legislative chicanery, they \nare going to have a whole load on their hands, because they did it last \nyear and they were successful, but they are not going to do it twice.\n  If there is an up-or-down vote on this to eliminate the sanctions on \nfood and medicine with respect to all of these countries, including \nCuba--there were 70 votes in the Senate last year, and there was a \nmajority in the House. By an overwhelming margin Republicans and \nDemocrats in the Congress believed that we ought to eliminate sanctions \non food and medicine shipments. The only conceivable way they can \ndetour our effort is to prevent a vote in the House and to try to strip \nout the provision that the Senate Appropriations Committee put in when \nthat bill comes to the floor of the Senate.\n  I serve notice to all who think about these issues that it is not \ngoing to happen the way it happened last year. You might have the \nmuscle and you might have the cards up your sleeve to try to derail \nthis once again. But it is going to cost in terms of the way this place \nworks.\n  We have a clear, large majority in the House and the Senate on the \nside of the American farmer, who believe they ought to have the freedom \nto sell in these markets; on the side of those who say this policy of \nusing food as a weapon is fundamentally immoral; on the side of doing \nthe right thing with Cuba and yes, other countries; consistent with \nwhat we described and talked about with respect to China. We have a \nlarge majority in the House and the Senate to do the sensible thing \nthis year.\n  I am not prepared to step aside and quietly go away on this issue. If \nleaders do to us what they are suggesting in the papers, they will try \nto do to us what they did last year successfully through legislative \nslight of hand.\n  Our farmers deserve better than that. Hungry people around the world \ndeserve to look at this country and understand that this country will \nnever, never ever impose sanctions on food and medicine.\n  This country in its zeal and desire to take aim at a dictator hits \nhungry people, hits poor people, and hits sick people. We are not \nhurting dictators. Does anybody here believe that Fidel Castro has ever \nmissed a meal because we have an embargo or sanction on food and \nmedicine? Does anybody here ever think that Saddam Hussein has missed \ndinner because we have not sent food to Iraq? We haven't hurt \ndictators. All we have done is hurt sick people, poor people, and \nhungry people around the world with this foolish policy. And, at the \nsame time, we have hurt our farmers here at home.\n  This must stop. It must stop this year. And it must not be a \nhalfhearted notion of putting on the brakes halfway and saying we will \neliminate the sanctions with respect to these couple of countries but \nwe can't do it with respect to Cuba. Nonsense. It must be done across \nthe board, and it must be done this year.\n  Those, as I have said, who think they are going to hijack this policy \nare in for a long, hot summer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for the action \nthat was just taken.\n  This is truly one of the highlights of my Senate career. The \nnomination that was read individually was my college roommate. I roomed \nwith him for 3 years at George Washington University where he was \nstriving to become a career Ambassador for the United States of \nAmerica. I watched him work and struggle and exceed all expectations. \nHe is extremely brilliant and has been able to get the kind of career \nthat he wanted.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming, who is presiding, for the rapid \naction that he took to have the hearing held on this nomination.\n  I thank the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms, for the \nexpeditious work that he did with the full committee to get this name \nbrought before the Senate.\n  We have a truly dedicated career officer who will be serving us in \nAustralia. I know him very well. I canoed with him in the swamps of \nGeorgia.\n  I watched his career and his travels. Most of my travels around the \nworld have been through his eyes, as he has been located in different \npositions beginning with Katmandu, Nepal.\n  I think we owe a lot of thanks not only to him but to his family, and \nhis wife Peggy, who has gone with him on these travels. They served \nwell as ambassadors for our country.\n  When he had a break, he came back to the United States and served in \nthe State Department. I was often able to see him in Washington. I \nwatched him as he was liaison for the Defense Department, liaison for \nthe State Department with Senator Kennedy, and in a number of other \npositions.\n  He and I have daughters who are the same age. We have sons who are \nthe same age. His son, Ed, is married to the daughter of the couple who \nintroduced my wife and I. How did a Wyoming girl meet somebody out \nhere? They met at my swearing-in ceremony. The two dads were part of my \nwedding. And I was there to see their children's marriages in Wyoming.\n  Skip is a fraternity brother of mine and is actually the only brother \nthat I have.\n  With this action taken today, the United States will be well served \nin Australia. This is the correct action, the best action, and this is \nthe best representation we can get.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their support in getting this \nimportant nomination approved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/09/senate-section/article/S4933-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AUTHORIZATION OF TESTIMONY BY SENATE EMPLOYEE\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, when President Kennedy announced a trade \nembargo on Cuba in 1961, the consensus in Washington was that stifling \nthe Cuban economy would lead to internal unrest and ultimately depose \nthe anti-American president, Fidel Castro. Since that time, Congress \nhas tightened the screws on Cuba to include food and medicine in the \nembargo and to put pressure on other countries not to trade with Cuba. \nWe have made it more difficult to lift the embargo by requiring a two-\nthirds vote by Congress and we have passed a law that says no \ngovernment involving Fidel Castro or his brother will be acceptable to \nthe U.S., even if they were chosen in Democratic elections. Through it \nall, our\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\nmain nemesis, Fidel Castro, has survived. In fact, he is strong as \never. To gain a better understanding of this issue, I recently led a \ngroup of Arkansas farmers to Havana to see firsthand the impact of our \npolicy and the potential opportunities that exist should this policy be \nchanged. I entered Havana focused on Cuba's potential as a new trade \nmarket for Arkansas agriculture producers. I left Havana with a new \nunderstanding of the embargo's effects on the people of Cuba. I \nreturned from Cuba more confident than ever that the U.S. embargo on \nCuba must be lifted. The three most compelling reasons for my stance on \nthis issue are: (1) the fact that we should engage countries, not \nisolate them in order to move them forward and help them to gain \npotential; (2) the overall effect on the American economy that losing \nthe trade with Cuba has had; and (3) the humanitarian impact on the \nCuban people.\n  This was my first trip to Cuba and it was extremely worthwhile. I \nfound the country and its people impressive and possessing great \npotential. The architecture in downtown Havana was charming, however, \nit struck me that someone had turned the lights out 40 years ago and no \none has thought to flip the switch back on. The gorgeous architecture \nwas crumbling along with the people. The physical decay of the cities, \nbuildings, and infrastructure is readily apparent. This obvious \neconomic and physical decline has not, however, led to an uprising of \nCuban citizens demanding for a more democratic government based on \ncapitalistic principles. It has been four decades since the embargo was \nenforced for political reasons. Times have clearly changed. The Soviet \nUnion no longer aids Cuban efforts to challenge U.S. interests in \nCentral America and elsewhere. The Soviet Union does not even exist.\n  The Cold War has been over for 10 years and the U.S. has normal trade \nrelations with all of the countries of the former Eastern bloc. Yet we \ncontinue to ostracize Cuba. U.S. defense analysts even maintain that \nCuba does not pose a security threat to our country at the turn of the \ncentury. Is Cuba an ideal nation? Absolutely not. But there are other \ncountries that we trade with and maintain normal diplomatic relations \nwith whose governments are not democratically elected; where full \nrespect for internationally recognized human rights is lacking; where \nthere is little or no tolerance for political dissent; or where private \nenterprise is largely illegal.\n  The first of these countries that comes to mind is China. Prior to \nthe Memorial Day recess the House of Representatives voted to grant \nPermanent Normal Relations (PNTR) status to the Republic of China. The \nSenate will likely vote on this matter soon. On this separate but \nrelated issue let me be clear. I look forward to the China PNTR debate \nand urge my colleagues to join me in support of expanding our trading \nopportunities. I hope that we can pass PNTR with China as quickly as \npossible with no amendments so that President Clinton can sign this \nlandmark legislation into law. As I have watched the China PNTR debate \nrage in Washington during recent weeks, I am struck by the common theme \nthat we, as a nation, can influence a country's actions much more by \nengaging them in trade and communication than we ever could by ignoring \nand isolating them.\n  I've held to this belief for quite some time in regard to China as \nwell as Cuba. China is the largest Communist country in the world. The \nU.S. has annually granted China its most-favored-nation status and will \nlikely approve Permanent Normal Trade Relations in the coming months. \nOur treatment of Cuba should be no different. It is true that China has \nmade various overtures and taken some positive steps as their \nacceptance into the WTO is being considered. China has allowed for a \nlimited amount of private enterprise to exist. And recently, China \npurchased goods from the U.S. as a good faith gesture that they will \nlive up to the commitments negotiated in the WTO accession agreement. \nMany who oppose trade with Cuba ask, ``Why are we not holding Cuba to \nthe same standard? Why don't we require them to privatize certain \nbusiness entities or purchase some commodities as a good faith \ngesture?'' The option to purchase U.S. goods is not available to Cuba, \nas it is to China, due to laws that we have passed in this very \ninstitution. Their hands are tied.\n  Yet Cuba is taking steps on its own regarding private \nindustry. Recent progress has been made in the form of joint ventures \nto facilitate the tourism industry in Cuba. For instance, the hotel we \nstayed in was a joint venture with the Dutch. Of course the government \nis still participating, but it is an example of private capital coming \nin from another source and affecting the people's way of life. The \npeople working at those hotels receive tips from tourists that put them \nway above the daily wage of average Cubans. Steps made in these \ndirections can only foster and plant positive seeds for change. We can \nalso expect the rapidly and advancing technology of the Internet to \nhelp open doors to Cuba. Just as Chinese dissidents communicate today \nover the Internet in spite of attempts by the Communists to stop them, \nI can anticipate a day when the Cuban people do the same thing.\n\n  The farmers of Cuba are incapable of producing enough to sustain the \n11 million inhabitants of the Caribbean island. Therefore, food must be \nimported. Our allies are already meeting that need and trading with \nCuba. Rice is coming into Cuba from Asia, soybeans from Brazil, while \nour farmers endure some of the worst prices they have seen in decades.\n  We have put ourselves in a position where we are hurting our own \neconomy and the backbone of our nation, the America farmer. By denying \nour farmers access to additional markets, like Cuba, we are ignoring a \npledge that was made with the passage of the 1996 Farm Bill to open \nmarkets, the necessary markets our farmers need. Promises regarding \nenhanced trading opportunities and the free market abounded with \npassage of the so-called Freedom to Farm Act. Yet, the recently passed \nCaribbean/Africa Trade bill was the first trade bill Congress has \npassed in six years. We have failed to grant the President Fast Track \nAuthority and essentially guaranteed the failure of our nation's \nfarmers by granting them the ability to produce as much as they are \ncapable while denying them access to sufficient markets to move their \ngoods. For the American farmer the combination of this nation's Ag and \nforeign trade policies is a no-win situation.\n  For soybeans alone, opening up trade with Cuba could mean a $60 \nmillion market. In Arkansas, we could ship 400,000 tons of rice right \ndown the Mississippi River, through the Gulf of Mexico to the Cuban \npeople. Food products would be a phone call and a couple of days away. \nInstead, the Cuban people are left paying higher prices for a lower \nquality product that takes weeks, sometimes months, to arrive in their \nports.\n  Rice is a staple of the Cuban diet and we know how to grow it in \nArkansas. Arkansas is consistently the top U.S. producer of rice. \nExports are extremely important to the rice industry. Last year, the \nrice industry exported to more than 100 countries. Trade and trade \npolicy, therefore, are critical to the continued success of the \nindustry.\n  At the time that the U.S. Government imposed sanctions on trade with \nCuba, it was not only our largest export market for rice, but it took \nmore than one-half of our total rice exports. Cubans know good American \nrice, and they want it. The embargo dealt a major blow to the rice \nindustry, particularly growers in the South who grow long grain rice, \nwhich is the rice of preference in Cuba. The only impact the embargo \nhas had on Cuba is on its middle- to low-income citizens. We are \nhurting the Cuban people much more than the Cuban government or Cuban \nelite. Due to the high prices the government is forced to pay, less \nfood is available for distribution. U.S. humanitarian organizations are \nprevented from providing food to starving children due solely to the \nexistence of the embargo.\n  While in Cuba, I met with opponents of the Castro regime who have \nbeen persecuted for attempting to highlight the disparate human rights \ntreatment in Cuba. These dissidents believe that the embargo gives the \nCuban government an excuse for what is wrong with the country. Our \nembargo provides Cuban officials with an excuse for the sorry state of \nthe economy and the challenges the country faces. If we lift\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\nthe embargo, we expose the Cuban people to many of the problems of \ntheir own government. Right now the Cuban people are only getting one \nside of the story, and they are not blaming their government or Fidel \nCastro for their troubles, because Fidel Castro is using the U.S. \nGovernment as the excuse for those problems.\n  I understand there are colleagues in this body whom I deeply respect \nwho also disagree with me on this issue. I agree that should the U.S. \nlift its embargo on Cuba, Fidel Castro will probably declare victory \nover what he calls his imperialist oppressor to his north. But the real \ntruth which is undeniably is that under current policy absolutely no \none wins.\n  As a farmer's daughter, I am not so concerned about the short-term \nimplications of who can claim victory after 40 years of economic \nisolation. I believe that the long-term benefits of engagement with \nCuba offer economic benefit to Americans; opportunities for democratic \ninfluences inside Cuba and better living conditions for the Cuban \npeople. Each of these goals strike me as fundamental principles of our \nunique, American democracy. Lifting the 40-year embargo on Cuba is the \nright thing to do. I hope we do it sooner than later.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/09/senate-section/article/S4935-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 12, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
