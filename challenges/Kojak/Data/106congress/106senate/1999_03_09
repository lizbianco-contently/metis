Mr. President, I want to take just a moment of the \nSenate's time to share with our family in the Senate a rather sad \noccasion that has taken place. Last evening, at about 7:15, after we \nhad recessed, I had a call from our friend and colleague from the State \nof Washington, Senator Murray, the principal proponent of our smaller \nclass size amendment, who told me that her father-in-law had passed \naway yesterday. She had been on the floor all day. She returned after a \nvery full day here on the floor leading us in this discussion on the \nquestion of smaller class size to learn that her father-in-law, Albert \nMurray, at the age of 80, had passed on. He had been a small business \nman for many years. He lived in Seattle and was very much involved in \nthe community in a range of different activities to ensure that that\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\ncommunity was going to be a better community.\n  The Murray family is a very close-knit family. They are an extended \nfamily. I had the opportunity to meet many of them at the time Senator \nMurray was initially sworn in here to the U.S. Senate.\n  She left last evening to return to the State of Washington to be with \nmembers of the family. I know all of us send our thoughts and prayers \nto Senator Murray, her husband Rob, and the entire Murray family. We \nare thinking about her and are mindful of her loss.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself such time that I might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/09/senate-section/article/S2442-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2442-S2448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we will vote again on whether to \nend this debate on education--prematurely, I believe--or do our part to \nhelp communities meet critical educational needs. After a very limited \n2-day debate on education last week, the majority leader filed cloture \nto end debate on the bill. The next day he filed the same cloture \nmotion to force a second vote on whether to end the debate. The first \ncloture motion was defeated yesterday; the second cloture motion will \nbe defeated today. I believe we should stop playing procedural games \nand vote on amendments that are critical to communities across the \nNation.\n  Republican intentions are clear. They do not want a debate on \neducation. They do not want a vote on the critical educational issues \nfacing the Nation's communities: reducing class size, recruiting more \nteachers, expanding afterschool programs, bringing technology into the \nclassroom, reducing dropout rates, modernizing school buildings. And \nthere is a shared responsibility in all of these areas between the \nlocal communities, the States, and the Federal government as well. \nParents and communities have a central concern about ensuring that \ntheir children are going to be adequately trained as they move towards \nthe new century.\n  We have an opportunity to do something about it, and we have, as we \nhave demonstrated over the course of this debate, compelling evidence \nthat each of these particular programs can really make a difference in \nchildren's achievement and growth, scholastically, in their local \ncommunities. No bill on the Senate calendar right now concerns more \nimportant issues than education.\n  These issues are important and timely. We start off this session with \na very thin calendar. We have the time and we have the ability, as we \nhave said on a number of different occasions. Under the leadership of \nSenator Daschle on this side of the aisle, we are prepared to agree to \na small number of amendments with strict time limits that could ensure \na speedy conclusion to those amendments, even, probably, during the day \ntoday. We can all work together to reach a bipartisan consensus on \neducation now, because the Nation's schools and children cannot.\n  Some Republicans insist that they won't agree now to any amendments \nwhich affect the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but that \nposition is untenable. The pending Ed-Flex bill directly affects the \nlargest ESEA program, title I. It also affects a number of the other \nprograms included in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--the \nEducation Technology, the Eisenhower Professional Development, and the \nSafe and Drug Free Schools programs. Yet we are now considering Ed-Flex \nlong before it is ready for action.\n  We should also be able to consider other vital education issues, too. \nEd-Flex is a good idea, because it gives States more flexibility in \nimplementing Federal programs. It makes them accountable for how well \nFederal aid is used to improve the schools. It goes back to the \ninitiative of our good friend from the State of Oregon, Senator \nHatfield. I joined him in offering the initial Ed-Flex in 1994. I \noffered it as an amendment to Goals 2000, to permit another group of \nStates to do so. I know this program. I support this program.\n  We have strong support for the Ed-Flex concept on this side of the \naisle as well as the other side of the aisle. We want to make sure, \nwhen we provide scarce resources, that the local communities, when they \nget the scarce resources, are able to show how the changes in the \neducation programs will enhance student achievement. That is what we \nare interested in. Families are interested, local communities are, \nStates are; we should be as well. We are trying to give the assurance \nto families across the country that accountability would be a part of \nEd-Flex.\n  Ed-Flex, as I mentioned, is a good idea, but flexibility and \naccountability mean little if we do not give communities the support \nthey need to implement school reform strategies that work. If you take \nthe time to read the General Accounting Office review of Ed-Flex, what \nsprings out at you is what the GAO report stated was the greatest \ndesire for the local communities. What they asked for was additional \nfunding for education programs. That makes sense. Second, they wanted \nto know if there were other opportunities to enhance academic \nachievement. Third, they were looking for help and assistance in how to \nrun their schools more efficiently and effectively.\n  Those are pretty reasonable ideas and ones that I think all of us can \nunderstand. That is what they were looking for, and we are attempting \nto try to assist with these other ideas that different Members have \ntalked about over the period of the past few days to try to help the \nlocal communities.\n  Last year, with broad bipartisan support, the Congress made a \nsubstantial investment in improving the Nation's public schools. We \nincreased funding for IDEA by $500 million. We increased funding for \nafterschool programs by $160 million. We increased funding for title I \nby $300 million. And we made a $1.2 billion investment in reducing \nclass size in the early grades. Those were done with bipartisan \nsupport, including the commitment to reduce class size, the amendment \nthat Senator Murray has championed in the Senate not only this year but \nlast year as well.\n  Much more remains to be done. Good ideas to improve education deserve \nour strong support. We need to do more to help communities hire \nadditional teachers and reduce class size. We need to support State \nefforts to raise academic standards and support communities and \nteachers who are helping children meet those standards. We need to \nmodernize school buildings and repair crumbling facilities. We had the \nGAO report which estimated it will cost $120 billion just to bring \nclassrooms across this country up to standards. Many communities in \nurban and in rural areas just cannot afford to take on that particular \nchallenge themselves. We have ideas about how we can assist local \ncommunities, not with a handout, but to help them ease the kinds of \nfinancial pressures on that local community in order to bring their \nschool buildings and classrooms up to speed.\n  That is a very important concept, partly because without doing so it \nis more difficult for the children to learn. We find even in the city \nof Boston that when the temperature goes down to 15 to 20 degrees, 15 \nschools close down because their heating systems are not adequate. \nAutomatically, 15 schools close down. There is an effort being made in \nthe local community--the greatest increase in a school budget in terms \nof education, I think, of any major urban area in the country--but \nstill it is taking time.\n\n  We can help in this area. It is not only important in terms of the \nphysical facility, it is important in the message we send to the \nchildren. Every parent, when they see their child go off in the \nmorning, is talking to that child about paying attention during the \ncourse of the day, working hard, doing his or her homework, getting \nextra help and assistance if it is needed. Every parent is to instill \nin them the value and the importance of education. But if the child \nwalks into a classroom and it is dilapidated and not functioning or \ndoes not have an electronic system to hook up the various new kinds of \ntechnology, we are sending a very powerful, very simple message to \nthose children. The parents may be talking about the value and \nimportance of education, but we, as a society, are not prepared to put \nthe resources into it to ensure that those children will go to a first-\nrate school. That is the message, and that is powerful.\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\n  That is happening every single day in communities all across this \ncountry--certainly in many of the older communities and in many of the \npoorer rural communities across this country--where we do not have the \nkind of facilities that all of us would hope we might have for the \nchildren of this country. It is a very important message, and we are \nattempting to do something about it. We are not going to answer the \nwhole problem, but we are going to offer a helping hand for local \ncommunities. Trying to provide some help and assistance in terms of \nschool construction makes a good deal of sense.\n  Much more remains to be done. Good ideas to improve education deserve \nour strong support. We need to do more to help communities hire \nadditional teachers, reduce class size, support State efforts to raise \nacademic standards, and support communities and teachers who are \nhelping children to meet those standards.\n  We talk about content standards. An increasing number of States have \nadopted content or performance standards. That is very important, so \nthat parents will know what their children are learning and how they \nare doing. We need to end social promotion, but, when we do that, we \nare going to make sure there will be the kinds of support facilities \nout there for children who have not been able to keep up, to keep them \nfrom falling further behind.\n  We have different examples of where that is taking place--in Chicago, \nwhere children who are falling behind are getting extra assistance \nduring the schoolday, or even after school, or over the course of the \nweekend, or during vacations, or during the summer--maintaining high \nstandards for children, but also trying to get assistance for those \nchildren who need it. It makes sense. That is what we are trying to \nbring attention to.\n  We need to modernize the buildings, as I mentioned. We need to expand \nthe afterschool programs--for the 7 or 8 million children between the \nages of 8 or 9 and 14 who go home in the afternoon to empty houses, who \nmay spend their time watching television, if the parents are fortunate, \nor otherwise involved in antisocial behavior, if they are not--to try \nto develop programs that are going to work with the schools or with \nnonprofits.\n  We have different ways of approaching this, modest amounts of \nresources in the President's budget to try to do so. We can encourage \nthose children to be involved in afterschool programs, to enhance their \nacademic ability and achievement and perhaps give those children a \nchance to spend some quality time with their parents. Rather than the \nparents coming home, finding the child has been watching television, \nand saying, ``Go up to your room to do your homework,'' parents can \nprovide the kind of climate and atmosphere which is going to be \nprofamily.\n  This is a profamily issue, Mr. President. We have seen the amount of \nsuccess that it has. Last year, when we had $40 million in afterschool \nprograms, we had $500 million in applications. That is from the local \ncommunities. What we are doing now is trying to build that up to cover \nmore than a million children, and that will send a ripple all across \nthis country to develop after school programs. We do not intend to do \nall that is required in terms of after school, but we can demonstrate, \nby the success of these programs, how they have impacted children and \nfamilies to build the kind of local support for the enhanced programs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, I say to the Senator.\n  I am so pleased he is talking about afterschool programs. I am so \ndisappointed at this point we cannot offer our amendment which would, \nin fact, accommodate, as the Senator pointed out, more than a million \nchildren in afterschool quality programs.\n  I ask the Senator if he was aware of the relationship to the crime \nissue, juvenile crime, that we have been told by the FBI that the \nhighest incidents of crime occur at 3 o'clock. And we have tremendous \nsupport for this afterschool amendment from the police athletic leagues \nall across this country and the police officers because when you have \nquality afterschool programs, it not only improves the education of \nchildren--and they do much better as they have done in afterschool \nprograms throughout California--but also the police athletic leagues \ntell me they see a 75-percent reduction in crimes. So I ask the Senator \nif he could comment on the impact these afterschool programs have on \nreducing juvenile crime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. Perhaps the Senator \nwants to put in the Record the excellent letter that has been sent to \nall of us from some 450 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, and \nleaders of police organizations in strong support of your amendment for \nthe after school program. It reviews what has been happening in local \ncommunities to demonstrate their reasons for their strong support. Just \nas the Senator has mentioned, it has had an important and significant \npositive impact on reducing juvenile crime.\n  I can tell you in Boston, MA, we went 2\\1/2\\ years without a youth \nhomicide--virtually unheard of for any major city of this country. And \nif you talk to Paul Evans, who is our police chief up there, the first \nthing he will talk to you about are the after school programs. He will \ntalk about other programs in terms of trying to penetrate gangs, and he \nwill talk about working with teachers and social service offices in \nterms of identifying the real trouble makers, and a variety of \ndifferent other efforts, but he will lead off his list with the after \nschool programs. It is just as the Senator has stated. This has an \nimportant, positive impact in reducing juvenile crime.\n  We are talking about preventing antisocial behavior, whether it is in \nterms of crime, or more dangerous kinds of activity, namely juvenile \nviolence. This is very important.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague for speaking out on these issues \ntoday. And, yes, I ask unanimous consent the letter Senator Kennedy \nmentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   Fight Crime\n\n                                                Invest in Kids\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 1999.\n     Re: Anti-Crime Amendment to Educational Flexibility \n         Partnership Act.\n       Dear Senator: As an organization of 450 police chiefs, \n     sheriffs, prosecutors, leaders of police organizations, and \n     crime victims, we urge that you co-sponsor and support \n     Senator Boxer's After School Education and Anti-Crime \n     Amendment, which would boost authorization funding levels for \n     the 21st Century Community Learning Centers after-school \n     programs, as you consider the Education Flexibility \n     Partnership Act of 1999 (S. 280).\n       FBI data show that in the hour after the school bell rings, \n     juvenile crime suddenly triples. The peak hours for violent \n     juvenile crime are from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., and more than \n     half of all such crime occurs between 3:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. \n     These are also the peak hours for unmarried teens to engage \n     in sexual activity, and being unsupervised in the afternoon \n     doubles the risk that teen will drink alcohol, smoke \n     cigarettes, or use drugs.\n       Quality after-school, weekend and summer programs for \n     children and youth can cut crime dramatically--by offering \n     school-age kids a safe haven from negative influences, and \n     providing constructive activities that teach them not only \n     the skills they need to succeed, but also values like \n     responsibility, hard work, and respect and concern for \n     others. For example: high school freshmen boys randomly \n     selected from welfare households to participate in the \n     Quantum Opportunities after-school program were only one \n     sixth as likely to be convicted of a crime during their high \n     school years as boys in the control group. Together, the boys \n     and girls who participated in the program were 50% more \n     likely to graduate from high school on time, and two-and-a \n     half times more likely to attend post-secondary schooling. \n     The program produced three dollars in benefits for every \n     dollar spent.\n       When a Canadian public housing project intensively \n     recruited youngsters to participate in an after-school skills \n     development program, juvenile arrests among its teen \n     residents declined by 75%, while they were going up 67% among \n     the residents of a nearby comparison housing project. The \n     program saved the government more than twice its cost.\n       When the Baltimore Police Department opened an after-school \n     program in one high-crime neighborhood, kids' risk of \n     becoming crime victims was cut nearly in half.\n       That's why, in addition to our 450 law enforcement members, \n     law enforcement organizations nationwide have called on \n     public officials to provide for America's children and teens \n     after-school programs that offer recreation, academic support \n     and community service experience. Among the organizations \n     which have passed such resolutions are the National Sheriffs \n     Association; the Major\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\n     Cities [Chiefs] organization (composed of the police chiefs \n     from North America's 52 largest cities); the Police Executive \n     Research Forum (made up of police chiefs, sheriffs, and other \n     law enforcement officials who together serve over 100 million \n     Americans); the National District Attorneys Association; and \n     such state law enforcement groups as the California District \n     Attorneys Association; and such state law enforcement groups \n     as the California District Attorneys Association, the \n     Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police and the Illinois \n     States Attorneys Association; the Texas Police Chiefs \n     Association, the Arizona Sheriffs and Prosecutors \n     Association, the Maine Chiefs and Maine Sheriffs \n     Associations, and the Rhode Island Police Chief's \n     Association.\n       Despite clear evidence that quality after-school programs \n     have a dramatic crime prevention impact and actually save \n     taxpayer dollars, we are serving only a small portion of the \n     children and youth who need these programs. More than 7 \n     million children under twelve years old and millions more \n     between twelve and eighteen years old, now spend their after-\n     school hours unsupervised and vulnerable to the negative \n     influences of gangs, drugs, and crime.\n       Senator Boxer's After-school Education and Anti-Crime \n     Amendment would be a step forward in meeting our nation's \n     need for more after-school programs. We therefore urge the \n     Senate to adopt this amendment.\n       If we can be of further assistance as you consider S. 280, \n     and other crime-prevention issues, please feel free to call \n     on us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Sanford A. Newman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do want to thank the police athletic leagues for \ngetting involved in this. I want to ask my friend this question, \nbecause he is our leader on education. He was the former chair of the \nEducation Committee, now the ranking member.\n  I seem confused in trying to understand the majority leader's \ndecision here not to allow these amendments to be offered. And I read \nsomewhere that he said he looked forward to this debate when we began \nand he said, let's have those amendments, and we will vote them up or \ndown. Can my friend explain to me why on Earth, when we have a \nsituation here where the No. 1 issue in America today is our children \nand their education, the majority leader will not allow us to have an \nup-or-down vote on 100,000 teachers, on expanding afterschool programs, \non the myriad of issues that we all know we need to address, the No. 1 \nissue today? Does my friend understand this change of heart? And can he \nexplain to me what the rationale is for filibustering our amendments, \nfor not allowing us to be heard by placing a gag rule on the Senate? \nDoes he have an explanation?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I say to the Senator, let me respond in this way. I had \nplaced in the Record the statement by our majority leader at the \nNational Governors' Conference just at the end of February where he \nsaid:\n\n       Now when we bring the education issues to the floor . . . \n     there will be some amendments and some disagreements, but--\n     and the leadership meeting that we had yesterday afternoon, I \n     said, ``That's great. Let's go to the Senate floor, let's \n     take days, let's take a week, let's take two weeks if it's \n     necessary. Let's talk about education.''\n\n  Here we had effectively, on Friday afternoon of last week, debate, \nbut because of parliamentary means the opportunity for amending the \nlegislation was closed out. Yesterday--yesterday --as the Senator might \nhave heard, we could not call off quorum calls in order to amend the \nbill or to bring up an amendment. We were effectively told that unless \nit was cleared it with the majority, they were not going to permit \namendments to be offered. Fortunately, we were at least able to find a \nway to try and get a vote on the Murray amendment, which we will vote \non tomorrow.\n  Then we were, of course, absolutely mystified as to why the \nleadership included in the Ed-Flex this very complex bank reform \nlegislation that has absolutely nothing to do with education--\nabsolutely nothing. They added that and refused to permit an orderly \nprocess of consideration of amendments on which, as the Senator from \nCalifornia and others have pointed out, we would be willing to enter \ninto a reasonable time limit.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, has an amendment that \nhas been passed with strong Republican support in the past. He \nindicated he would be willing to have one-half hour of debate, 15 \nminutes to a side. Other Senators have been willing to do so as well. \nSenator Murray was willing to do so, so we could move this process \nalong, not that we should not have at least a fair opportunity to \npermit some of our colleagues to be able to express their own views, \nboth for and against. But the Senator is quite right. We are \neffectively being told that even though the legislation is technically \nbefore the Senate, that we are closed out from having the opportunity \nto offer amendments and have the Senate dispose of those amendments, \nand that is obviously troublesome.\n  It works, as the Senator knows, in a strange way. We have had a \ndeadlock for these past days, but there is nothing that is going to \npreclude Senator Murray from offering her amendment on some other piece \nof legislation. That is what, evidently, some of our people here must \nunderstand--that you just cannot do it at this place in the Senate \ncalendar. You might be able to squeeze it out in the last few days of a \nsession, but you cannot do it at this time.\n  We are going to see these amendments at one time or other, and I \nimagine earlier rather than later. So it has always seemed to me to \nmake the most sense to do it in a responsible way, and that is in \ndebating this with an underlying amendment on education rather than \ntrying to work the process to have an amendment on a different item.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend would continue to yield to me, I came over \nhere not to seek time on my own, I say to my friend, but really to \nengage him in a conversation, because I think the American people are \ncompletely confused. I know I am confused. I see an Ed-Flex bill coming \nover here. It is a good bill. The Senator supports it. I support it. \nBut as we have said before, it is a thin bill. It does not go to the \nheart and soul of what we need to be doing--more teachers in the \nclassroom, afterschool care for our children, dropout prevention.\n  I will tell you why I am confused. I read that our majority leader, \nSenator Lott, was with our Presiding Officer in his State. They had an \nexcellent townhall meeting on education, and they talked about \neducation a lot. They talked about it a lot. They talked about how it \nwas a priority for the Republican Party. Well, talk is cheap.\n  I would like to know, what are we going to do? And we have an \nopportunity here, because there is an education bill on the floor, to \nlet the majority of the Senate work its will; allow us to vote up or \ndown. The Senator is completely correct. On afterschool, I offered a 1-\nhour timeframe and an up-or-down vote after that--1 hour. That is all. \nWe are not trying to tie up the Senate. And further, my friend reminded \nme, which I had forgotten, there is a banking amendment on this bill.\n  I am confused here, I say to my friend, and continue to be confused, \nthat we have this bill on the floor that deals with education. The \nmajority leader says he doesn't want it amended by any education \namendments but he allows an amendment to go through that deals with the \nbanking system. Members can only come to one conclusion, and that is \nthat the Republicans like to talk about education but when it comes \ndown to doing something to help our children, they are missing in \naction, regardless of town hall meetings.\n  I am glad that the Senator from Massachusetts, the ranking member on \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, has taken this \ntime to explain what is going on to the American people, because you \ncan't fool them.\n  I think what is interesting, as my friend has pointed out, we are not \ngoing to go away. Senator Murray, who isn't with us this morning \nbecause she had a tragic death in her family, Senator Murray is not \ngoing to go away. She and the Senator from Massachusetts were on their \nfeet Friday, they were on their feet yesterday, they tried in vain to \nget a vote on the 100,000 teachers. She is not going to go away. The \nSenator from Massachusetts isn't going to go away. This Senator isn't \ngoing to go away. Why not have an agreement to bring up these issues \nand vote on them?\n  There is only one thing I can say, and that is that the majority \nleader does not support these amendments, he does not support 100,000 \nteachers in school, he does not support afterschool, he does not \nsupport dropout prevention. Otherwise, I can't imagine why he would use \nthe heavyhanded tactics.\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\n  I yield back to my friend to continue to enlighten us on where we \nstand and how he sees the rest of the year going when we start off with \nsuch a gag rule on such an important measure.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator, if I might just raise some conclusions that \nhave been reached by this independent evaluation of title I that is \ndirectly relevant to the issue which the Senator wanted to address. \nThis is the final report of ``National Assessment'' of title I. It just \ncame out last week. In the summary, it points out: ``Recent research on \neffective schools has found that using extended time learning in \nreading and mathematics''--this is the afterschool model; not all \nafterschool models, but many of the afterschool models. More so, now, I \nthink, as a result of this excellent report.\n  And it talks about the recent study of schools in Maryland:\n\n       Researchers found that the most successful schools were \n     seeing constant academic gains as a result of the extended \n     day programs.\n\n  This is just what the Senator is talking about. This is the \n``National Assessment.''\n  I mentioned before, there is $500 million in requests. We have an \nimportant increase in the President's budget paid for. The Senator is \njust trying to get the authorization so the communities will know this \nprogram is alive and well and going to be continued over the period of \ntime. That could be done in a very short order.\n  If there are those here opposed to it, why not express your views and \nthen vote in opposition to it? Effectively, the good Senator is being \ndenied at least any opportunity to be able to advance that--advance it, \nlet the Senate finally vote on it--being denied that in spite of the \nfact that in this excellent review about what has been successful and \nwhat has not been, this is right on point to the Senator's initiative, \nand that, I think, is one of the reasons we are very frustrated.\n\n  We take a Banking Committee bill. Here we are on education. The \ntiming was set by the majority leader and the majority. They are the \nones who set the agenda. They are the ones who called up this bill.\n  Now we find out they are effectively foreclosing or have foreclosed. \nWe are still hopeful that the Senator would be able to offer the \namendment.\n  While the Senator is here, I just mention the kind of support we have \non the class size amendment. We will have an opportunity to vote on \nthat cloture tomorrow. Various groups have supported that, including \nthe National Parent Teacher Association, the National School Boards \nAssociation, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople, the Council of Chief State School Officers, the American \nAssociation of School Administrators, the Council of Great City \nSchools, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the \nNational Association of State Directors of Special Education.\n  That is interesting, special education; we heard a great deal about \nthe importance of special education. Here is the association that is \nthe primary spokesman for special education, and they are talking about \nthe importance of this, and for very good reason. We have to fund \nboth--that is our position--the IDEA and also this program for having \nsmaller class sizes and having a well-trained teacher in every \nclassroom. When we have the teacher quality, the well-trained teacher, \nthey can identify early in their development the children who are going \nto have the special needs. If they are spending time with them in \nreading, they can find out whether that child needs the other kind of \nattention. Then you can locate and identify these needs much earlier, \nand we also can find out if they can provide that help and assistance \nto them, for example, in literacy. It may very well reduce or eliminate \nthe need for special education.\n  There is support from this association in terms of school \nconstruction. They find out that the children with disabilities will \nbenefit from buildings with appropriate physical access to buildings, \nbuildings that are well equipped to handle modern technologies which so \nmany with disabilities need to get a good education. And they find out \nthat the afterschool programs, including Children With Disabilities, \nStay Off the Street, Out of Trouble, help them get the academic help \nthey need and desire.\n  That is what we are saying. Help all the children. We are also \nhelping those with special needs. We are committed to trying to get \nadditional funding in the area of special needs.\n  I remind our colleagues that under the constitutions of the States, \nthe States have the responsibility for educating every child. We set as \na goal that we would pick up 40 percent. I am strongly committed toward \ndoing so. We will have an opportunity before too long to offer \namendments to move us in that direction. We hope we will get as much \nsupport on that issue when we offer those amendments as we have had in \nterms of an opposition to trying to do the kind of things that the \nSenator from California has identified.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think it is an important point the Senator makes, that \nwhen you have smaller class sizes you can give special attention to the \nchildren who need it. The Senator makes a very interesting point. \nPerhaps some of these children who now need to be pulled out of those \nclasses because they are so large would be able to be served in smaller \nclassrooms.\n  I had a very interesting conversation with a woman who sat next to me \non an airplane back to California on Friday who works for the Pentagon. \nShe was so excited about the fact that the military has just decided to \nundertake a project to lower classroom sizes.\n  I ask my friend if he had heard about that. Their goal now in the \nearly grades is to have 1 teacher for every 18 children. Now, this is \nthe military, the U.S. military. These are schools that are run by the \nmilitary.\n  I say to my friend, if our children whose parents are in the military \ncan benefit from smaller class sizes--because the military is so smart, \nthey understand it works--why should we deny our children in the public \nschools the same opportunity for smaller class sizes?\n  Does my friend see in this an irony that the majority leader and the \nRepublicans who join us in being very strong supporters of strong \ndefense, in giving the military what they need so there can be a \nquality of life for their kids, that they would undertake such a \nprogram? Yet, we would be gagged. Maybe my friend is right; maybe we \nwill be able to go to the amendment. If we don't go to the amendment, \ndoesn't the Senator see an irony here that the Pentagon will have 18 \nkids--15 to 18 --in a classroom, supported by the Congress, and yet we \nsee this opposition for the other children who happen to not be in \nmilitary families?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator makes a good point. Not that that is always \nthe best practice, but certainly in this case it is. Secondly, for \nexample, child care programs in the military versus non-military \nprograms, are quantitatively better because, very interestingly, the \namendment that we adopted for child care for the military was actually \nthe one that came out of our Labor and Human Resources Committee and \nhad protections and guarantees in terms of quality and training for the \npersonnel who are going to work with those children.\n  When we had it on the floor of the Senate, it was effectively \nundermined, in terms of those protections, in an attempt to get it \npassed.\n  Now they will go on out and ask, ``Why are the military ones \nbetter?'' It is very plain and simple. You can look at the history of \nthe support of those programs here. At the time they called the roll, \n94 to 6 we were prepared to give protections, because it was an add-on \nfor the protection of the military--94 to 6. I remember it very \nclearly, because I offered the amendment.\n  When Senator Dodd, who is a real leader in these children's programs, \nbattled to develop programs for needy working families on this, it was \nsignificantly undermined.\n  The military understands smaller class sizes, as they do child care, \nand they are moving in that direction because they are able to do so.\n  A final point I will mention to the Senator on the importance of \nthis, because we heard a great deal yesterday about how can we do this \nand not give attention to IDEA, is included in the Record--I will check \nthe Record and, if not, will include it here--an excellent study that \nwas done by ``School Business Affairs'' on education. In this\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\nreview, the study shows the benefits of reduced class size. I will read \nthis:\n\n       Research has shown that some elements of schooling are \n     changed positively by using reasonably sized classes in \n     grades K-3.\n       Table 1 suggests some potentially cost-saving items that \n     can be factored into plans to adjust [to smaller] class \n     sizes.\n\n  It talks about reduced retention in grade, improved student behavior, \nreduced remediation so more students are on a grade level and special \nservices may be more clearly targeted to needy students, and, finally, \nearlier identification of barriers to learning that may be remedied \nimmediately, offering later savings in special education costs.\n  I hope, and maybe it is hoping for too much, that we can avoid \npitting children against children, but rather to try to move along \ntogether. The central issue that we are focused on is smaller class \nsize. We have additional amendments. The Senator from California has \none to deal with afterschool programs. Senator Harkin has one with \nregard to school construction. Senators Reid and Bingaman have one with \nregard to dropouts. Senator Dodd also has afterschool programs. There \nare others--Senator Feinstein and Senator Dorgan have amendments, and \nmy colleague Senator Kerry has one as well.\n  We are, nonetheless, prepared to reduce the number of amendments we \noffer and enter into a reasonable time limit so that we can at least \nmake some important progress. I think most families who are watching \nthis would say, ``Why aren't they doing business? Why are we watching \nSenators talk about this. They have, effectively, uncontroverted \ndocumentation of support for the initiatives they are talking about. \nWhy aren't they going ahead?''\n  And our response is that we can't go ahead because these barriers \nhave been placed in our way.\n  That is fundamentally wrong. As the good Senator has pointed out, we \nare not going to let these barriers stand in our way.\n  I thank the Senator from California for all of her help.\n  Mr. President, I am told that we will have a number of our colleagues \ncoming over to address these issues. We have the next 15 minutes, and \nthen we will come back to address these issues later in the day, \nstarting at 2:15.\n  I wanted to point out in our opening comments and statements this \nmorning the importance, again, of reduction of class size.\n\n  Let me mention some of the rather interesting results of reduction of \nclass size. The documented research--what parents and teachers have \nalways known intuitively--shows that the smaller classes enhance \nstudent achievement.\n  The most effective overall presentation that was made on this was the \nexcellent presentation by Senator Murray who has been a schoolteacher \nherself, has taught in these classes and can speak eloquently and \nknowledgeably about what it is like to be in a classroom with 30 \nchildren versus a classroom of 17 or 18 children. She has been on a \nschool board for a number of years, dealing with educational policy, \nand she has the vantage point of bringing both of these experiences to \nthis issue.\n  I have observed Senator Murray now for some 6\\1/2\\ years. I do not \nthink any of us have seen a more impassioned, knowledgeable, informed \nperson speak on the subject of class size as Senator Murray. I know she \nwill continue to fight for this, and I am absolutely convinced that we \nwill eventually accept the Murray proposal and, by doing so, give the \ninformation to the local school districts that the commitments that we \nmade last year for increasing the number of teachers is going to be \ncontinued for the next 6 years.\n  The President has put the funding for that program into his budget. \nAll we need now is the authorization, and the reason we need the \nauthorization now, as Senator Murray points out, is because school \nboards need to know whether they can count on the continued financial \nsupport for next year and the year following and on into the future to \ngo out and hire new teachers. The local school boards are wondering \nwhether they ought to take the chance of moving ahead or if it is just \ngoing to be a 1-year experience.\n  That is a very reasonable issue, and school boards all across the \ncountry are in contact with us asking for clear guidance. For those who \ncome to the floor and say, ``We want to rely on local controls, we want \nto help and assist those in the local communities,'' this is the way to \ndo it.\n  Let's send a very clear message to those at the local school level \nthat this is a program that is going to continue for the next 6 years. \nYou can be sure that we are behind it. That is what the Murray \namendment does, and that is why it is so timely and so important that \nwe put that on the Ed-Flex legislation.\n  Mr. President, let's just look at some of the examples of the studies \non smaller classrooms. Let's take this Project STAR that studied 7,000 \nstudents in 80 schools in Tennessee. Students in small classes \nperformed better than students in large classes in each grade from \nkindergarten through third grade. Followup studies showed that the \ngains lasted through at least eighth grade, and the gains were larger \nfor minority students.\n  In Wisconsin, the Student Guarantee in Education Program is helping \nto reduce class size in grades K through 3 in low-income communities. \nThe study found students in the smaller classes have significantly \ngreater improvements in reading, math, and language tests than students \nin larger classes.\n  In Flint, MI, efforts over the last 3 years to reduce class size in \ngrades K through 3 produced a 44-percent increase in reading scores and \nan 18-percent increase in math scores. Mr. President, this is what is \nhappening out there in school districts. I don't know how much more \ninformation we need. School district after school district that has \nmoved towards smaller class size is finding these extraordinary \nresults. We are being denied now the opportunity to say, ``Look, we \nnotice these results. We hear what you are saying. It does make an \nimportant difference. We have the resources at this time to move ahead \nin a national effort to try to get the smaller classrooms.'' That is \nwhat this debate is about, and we are denied the opportunity to do so.\n\n  Listen to this. As I mentioned, in Flint, MI, over the last 3 years \nthe smaller class in K through 3 produced a 44-percent increase in \nreading scores, and an 18-percent increase in the math scores.\n  Before we get into the expanded reading program we passed at the end \nof the last year--not that that in and of itself is going to solve all \nof the problems--what we have done in the last 3 years is encouraged \nthe universities which have Work-Study Programs to ensure that many of \nthe young people who are attending our colleges all across the country \nare going to move towards working and tutoring students as part of \ntheir Work-Study.\n  I am proud that Massachusetts has better than half of its colleges \ndoing so.\n  I urge our colleagues in this body to meet with the presidents of \nuniversities in their states and encourage the presidents of the \nuniversities to get their universities and their schools involved in \nthat reading program. Massachusetts and California are the two top \nStates. Sixty percent of our colleges are doing it. We are committed to \ntrying to get it up to 100 percent. There is no reason that kind of \nassistance cannot go to these students with the Work-Study Programs so \nthat reading can be held to a higher standard.\n  But getting back to the subject, that is the importance of grades K \nthrough 3, we have extraordinary academic achievements in reading, \nwhich is the key to all knowledge, and math, and they are due in large \npart to a reduction in class size.\n  I have other examples, and I will make sure there is time remaining \nto speak to the Senate about those. But I can tell you that we have \ninstance after instance after instance where the smaller class size has \nresulted in dramatic and significant and important academic achievement \nand academic progress for students. And it is a national tragedy that \nwe are not embarked on a program to help local communities and States \nto embark on such a program. Some can do it locally, and they are doing \nit. We commend them. The States are doing it. But we ought to have a \npartnership to do what we know can make a significant improvement in \nchildren's academic performance and success, and we are being closed \nout of the opportunity to do that here today. We have $11 billion\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\nout there which can make a direct difference, and we are being denied \nthe opportunity to do so. That is fundamentally wrong.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois what time he might consume.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business and to support the \nefforts by Senators Kennedy, Murray, and so many others to finally \nbring to this Senate floor a vote on education.\n  We have been in session for almost 2 months now. A great deal of that \ntime was spent on the impeachment trial with the promise that when it \nended, we would come together and consider issues important to this \ncountry. And I think all of us took heart in that promise by the \nleadership. Yet, when this debate comes to the floor on the first \neducation bill of the 106th Congress in the U.S. Senate, we are finding \nefforts by the Republican leadership to limit the debate. When Senator \nKennedy comes to the floor with Senator Patty Murray of the State of \nWashington and asks only for the opportunity for the Senate to vote on \nseveral key educational issues, I am sorry to say the Republican \nleadership has used every procedural device to stop the Senate from \nvoting on education.\n  What does that say about the 106th Congress and what we hope to \nachieve? I hope Republican Senators feel, as those do on this side of \nthe aisle, that reducing classroom size gives kids a better chance. My \nwife and I have taken three kids to school--taken them as they started \nin kindergarten through the grades. Can you believe for a moment we \nwould have felt encouraged if we walked in and they said, ``You have a \nchoice here. There is one classroom with 30 kids and one teacher, \nanother with 18 kids and one teacher. We are going to put your child in \nthe larger classroom with 30 kids. That is OK, isn't it?'' You would \nsay, ``Wait a minute. My son or my daughter has a better chance with \nmore personal attention.''\n  That is what is behind the proposal for 100,000 new teachers--to \nreduce classroom size so that more personal attention can be given to \neach student. There may be some Republicans and maybe even some \nDemocrats who would disagree with that premise and argue that larger \nclassrooms are better for kids. Let them vote that way. Let them cast \nthat vote that way. But to stop us procedurally from even coming to \nthis vote on President Clinton's initiative for 100,000 more teachers \ndoes a disservice to the kids and families across America and doesn't \nspeak well of the agenda for the 106th Congress.\n  Another item being considered, and one I hope we vote on, is the \nquestion of making sure we have enough classrooms and that we are going \nto, in fact, have smaller class sizes. As I travel around my home State \nof Illinois, superintendents, teachers, and parents said, ``Great. \nSmaller classrooms make a lot of sense. We think our kids have a better \nchance.'' But we are going to need more classrooms, obviously.\n  So one of the proposals that is before us which Senator Kennedy is \npushing for is to have help for the school districts across America to \nbuild more buildings. Unfortunately, that, too, has been stopped.\n  Imagine, if you will, that the Republican leadership does not want us \nto vote on whether or not to help school districts build more \nclassrooms, modernize classrooms, make certain they have the technology \nnecessary for the 21st century, even to make certain there are safer \nclassrooms for our kids. What possible item on the agenda is more \nimportant than education? Yet, as the 106th Congress begins, we got off \nto a slow start because of the impeachment, and now we have come to a \ngrinding halt on education. If we cannot achieve a bipartisan consensus \non the basics of education, it doesn't speak well for the prospects of \nthis Congress. I hope Senator Kennedy, Senator Murray, and many others \nprevail. They are going to try to ask the Senate to come together on a \nbipartisan basis and really put their votes where their campaign \nrhetoric has been--commitment to education.\n  That is what it is all about. Let me speak for a moment to another \nissue which has been brought up, and it is a very valid issue.\n  Many Republicans argue today and in the last week's debate that we \nshould put more Federal money into school districts to help them pay \nfor disabled children. I have been to these schools. I have many times \nseen one teacher per student. I know it is very expensive education. I \nknow some kids are sent off by school districts to better opportunities \nin other States. And that, too, can be very expensive. So the \nRepublican majority has suggested we should put more money into special \neducation from the Federal level. I hope it is clear that most \nDemocrats agree with the Republicans on that; and that, if we are going \nto focus the surplus on education, this is a valid investment. But make \nno mistake; we have faced this vote before.\n  Take a look here. On April 23rd of last year when we offered an \namendment to the Coverdell bill on the so-called parent and student \nsavings accounts, an amendment which said take the money and put it \ninto special education, only four Republicans joined us in that vote. \nThey said, no; it is more important that we have vouchers for private \nschools than we take care of disabled children in public schools. So, \nby a vote of 50 to 4, the Republicans said no; don't put the money in \nspecial education. Now they argue today that it is the most important \npriority, the highest priority above all.\n  I sincerely hope we can return to this debate on the floor in an \nhonest and bipartisan fashion.\n  I don't know why Senator Kennedy stands here alone on the issue of \nclassroom size. I don't know why Senator Murray stands here alone on \nthe issue of increasing the number of classrooms and the safety of our \nschool buildings.\n  This truly is bipartisan. So many of us who go to the campaign stump \nand speak about education now have a chance to put our votes where our \npromises have been.\n  I sincerely hope that the Republican leadership will think twice \nabout this--that we have an opportunity here to get the 106th Congress \noff to a positive start. The 105th Congress was a do-nothing Congress. \nIt achieved little or nothing, and the American people in the last \nelection in 1998 made it clear that they rejected that approach. Now we \nhave a chance to do something on education on a bipartisan basis if the \nRepublican majority will stop throwing these procedural roadblocks in \nour path.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of time in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 30 seconds \nremaining--under the control of the Senator from Massachusetts. Then \nthe next hour is under the control of the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remaining time to my colleague from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes \nas if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am wondering if there would be an \nopportunity, after the completion of this period, for an additional 10 \nminutes in morning business by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This period will end at 12:30, which is the \ntime for recess.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I suggest something to the Senator, if the \nPresiding Officer will yield. We generally close down at 12:30. The \nSenator from Tennessee has an hour, and if it fits into the Senator's \nschedule, I would ask that we do not recess; we postpone the recess \nfrom 12:30 to 12:45 to permit the Senator to speak.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If that is agreeable to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will need someone to fill in for \nhim.\n  The Senator from Wyoming objects.\n  Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\n  The Senator from Tennessee now has 1 hour.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/09/senate-section/article/S2448-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2448-S2453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the next 60 minutes we will be \naddressing our children's education, which is a continuation of the \ndebate that we brought to the floor last week. Although the debate has \nranged from the initial presentation of the bill to various amendments, \nit is the underlying bill that I would like to spend a few moments \ndiscussing.\n  The Ed-Flex bill is a simple bill, a straightforward bill, and a \nbipartisan bill. It was brought to the Senate floor last week in order \nto pass it through the Senate, have it pass through the House of \nRepresentatives, have it sent to the President of the United States, \nand signed so that all 50 States would be able to take advantage of a \nprogram on which we have a 5-year history, that has been demonstrated \nto work, that was initially applied in six States, and then another six \nStates. There are 38 States such as Tennessee that do not have access \nto an Ed-Flex program.\n  Ed-Flex is a program which basically says that individual schools and \nschool districts and communities would be able to obtain waivers to be \nable to meet very specific education goals to educate their children, \nbut they can do it in a way that is free of the Washington bureaucratic \nregulations, the excessive redtape which we hear again and again is \nshackling the hands of our schools and our teachers who are working so \nhard to educate our children, to prepare them for a future full of \nopportunities, to prepare them for that next millennium which we all \ntalk about in such glowing terms. Yet we recognize that in spite of \ngiving the system a lot of money, in spite of progress in structure, we \nare failing our children. We are not preparing them for that next \nmillennium.\n  So now is the time to pay attention to what people are telling us, to \nwhat parents are telling us, what principals are telling us, what \nteachers are telling us. We need to respect the needs of the local \ncommunities, because each community is different, rather than thinking \nin this body that we can decide if you put more teachers there, you are \ngoing to do better without telling them what the quality of that \nteacher might be or telling them that you need just another computer, \nand if we put that computer in your classroom, your students will do \nbetter.\n  No, we should listen to the schools that say let us take those same \nresources--we know what it takes to educate our children--let us carry \nout our type of program free of the bureaucracy, free of this \nadministrative burden. And that is what Ed-Flex is all about. This \nparticular bill costs nothing.\n  We have heard of a number of well-intended programs talked about this \nmorning and introduced as amendments, really loading down our bill, but \nthey cost $200 million here, $500 million here, $1 billion here, $6 \nbillion here, $12 billion over 6 years.\n  We should have that debate at some point because we know that we are \nnot educating our children nearly as well as we should, and we need to \ndebate resources. And we most appropriately are doing that in the \ncommittee structure right now where we are looking at all of the \nelementary and secondary education programs through the reauthorization \nprocess. We have heard repeatedly that we should not just add one more \nprogram to the already more than 250 programs with which we have been \ntrying to educate our children. We hear too often: Let's add this \nprogram and that will take care of our problems today.\n  Well, it sounds good and it makes good sound bites and it may even \npoll well, but it is absurd to think that one program is going to solve \nour education problems. So let's start with the basics. The Ed-Flex \nbill includes flexibility at the local level, gets rid of Washington \nredtape, provides strong accountability provisions built in at the \nlocal level, at the State level, and at the Federal level. For \ninstance, performance standards and content standards are built into \nour Ed-Flex bill, as well as issues at the State level such as \ncorrective action and technical assistance, and accountability is built \nin at the State level and at the Federal level. In fact, the Secretary \nof the Department of Education can at any time terminate a waiver.\n  Ed-Flex means greater local control for education decisions, has no \ncost to taxpayers, and is supported by all 50 Governors. Just 20 \nminutes ago I was talking to a Governor, and I basically said here we \nare, in Washington. We have a bill that is supported by every Governor \nin the United States of America. If we are allowed--and we are going to \ntry again with the cloture vote today--to bring this bill to the floor \nfor a vote, I bet you it will pass 99 to 1. That is how good the bill \nis. Yet, because of political posturing, because of polls, because of \nan agenda that someone else has, some have come to the floor of the \nSenate and are holding the bill hostage.\n  When I mentioned the Ed-Flex bill while traveling across Tennessee \nSaturday and Sunday talking to parents--I was in three high schools--\nparents basically said, what is going on in Washington, DC? I thought \nnow was the time for nonpartisanship, for coming together, for \nbipartisanship. I thought you had finished the gridlock that we have \nseen in Washington. ``We expect more out of you, Senator Frist.'' And I \nsaid, ``Yes, I will go back, and I will do my very best.'' Yet, I come \nback and again its gridlock.\n  Our bill very simply means education flexibility. It costs nothing, \nit has bipartisan support, and provides flexibility and accountability. \nEverything else you have heard about over the last few years is a new \nprogram, costing billions of dollars--silver bullets. People say, \n``That's what we need because it sounds good. I go home and I talk to \nparents. They don't know what education flexibility is all about. But I \ntell them about adding quantity, adding numbers of teachers, and they \nlisten. Well, that is the whole point. We need to do what is right. We \ndon't need to do just what sounds good because what sounds good doesn't \nwork. For the last 30 years we have done what sounds good, but without \nany improvement whatsoever.\n  We need Ed-Flex. We have to forget this gridlock. In the next 45 \nminutes or so, that will be our discussion.\n  I see that my distinguished colleague from the great State of Florida \nhas arrived, and I would like to yield 10 minutes to my colleague.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for yielding. I will not use that much \ntime. I thank the Senator for the leadership he has provided on this \nlegislation.\n  It was really not my intention to speak on this bill because I was \nunder the impression that this bill had great bipartisan support, that \nwe would bring this to the floor after coming out of committee, and it \nwould breeze through the Senate. This is a piece of legislation that is \nsupposedly--supposedly--supported by everybody.\n  I am pleased to speak in favor of the Ed-Flex bill. Our children will \nthrive when State and local communities are given the freedom to craft \ntheir education plans according to the unique education needs of their \nchildren. Local schools do more when Washington bureaucracies do less. \nThat is what this bill does.\n  We are beginning the second week of consideration of this bill. We \nhave been forced to file three cloture motions on what may be the most \npopular, most bipartisan legislation we will consider this Congress. I \nfear this may set the tone for the remainder of the 106th Congress, \nwhere consideration of any bill will be filibustered by the Democrats \nand drive partisanship to new heights.\n\n  As I implied a moment ago, I am in some ways confused by what is \nhappening. I do not understand how a bill that supposedly is supported \nby an overwhelming number of Members on both sides of the aisle has \nbeen caught up in this constant and continuous effort to amend the \nbill.\n  I think the actions we have seen during this past week, and what we \nare anticipating through the balance of this week, raise the question \nabout those who have cosponsored the bill and who say they are in \nsupport of it. I question whether they truly support the idea of Ed-\nFlex, which is to allow State and local communities to have more \ncontrol over how dollars are spent. I think there is a ruse underway \nhere. I think our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to \nclaim that they support the idea of giving local communities\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\nand States more authority and more flexibility in how to spend their \ndollars, yet they come out here and offer amendment after amendment on \nthis bill, knowing full well--and I ask the Senator from Tennessee if \nthis is not the case--knowing full well the majority leader has said to \nthem there will be other opportunities to offer these amendments on \nother education bills when they come forward. Is that an accurate \nstatement?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would love the opportunity to respond to \nthat, because that is exactly right. It is crystal clear that these are \nimportant issues in all of these amendments, all of which are so well \nintended, all of which sound so good. The point is, as we speak, right \nnow in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the \nlarge bill in which all resources going into kindergarten through 12th \ngrade is being addressed, the committee is looking at how effective \nthey are, how they interrelate to each other--because right now we have \n180 or 190 or 200 programs, all in K-12 education, all with their own \nlittle bureaucracies, all well-intended, but with huge overlap, huge \nduplication, huge waste. Again the goals are very good, but we have a \nprocess to look at all of those.\n  That is ongoing as we speak. Hearings are going on right now in that \nparticular committee on every one of these issues. That is the \nappropriate forum, not to bring them to the floor, especially when they \ncost $12 and $15 billion. And now is our opportunity, now, to pass that \nsingle, straightforward, education flexibility, no-cost, demonstrated-\nthat-it-works, bipartisan-supported bill, and that is where the \ngridlock is.\n  Mr. MACK. As I said a minute ago, I really am serious now in raising \nquestions about the sincerity of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who purport that they are in favor of Ed-Flex but, yet, want \nto bog this piece of legislation down with a whole series of amendments \nthey know are controversial.\n  There is nothing wrong with us dealing with controversial amendments \nand controversial issues. We do that throughout our entire political \ncareers. The question is the timing of it. The question is the \napproach. I am, again, dismayed by the attitude that is being projected \nhere. I, again, question sincerity.\n  Recently, we went through a 5- or 6-week period at the beginning of \nthis new Congress with a very contentious issue dealing with the \nimpeachment trial. But each side made a sincere effort to work with the \nother, and as a result I think we did a credible job. I think most \npeople in the country think we did a credible job. Yet, on this the \nsecond piece of legislation we are considering, we are being forced to \noffer cloture motion after cloture motion after cloture motion--three \nso far. There should be no question in anyone's mind that the intention \nhere, I believe, is now to kill this piece of legislation because it \ngoes against their political interests. It goes against their \nphilosophy.\n  In all honesty, the differences in the approach about education in \nAmerica is clear. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nconvinced the only way to improve education in America is to have a \nlarger group of wiser bureaucrats in Washington make a determination \nabout how resources ought to be allocated and what regulations ought to \ncome down from Washington in order to solve this problem.\n\n  We have a totally different view. We think if we give this money to \nthe States and the local communities, they can make better decisions \nabout what their top spending priority is. In some local school \ndistricts that is school buildings. In other school districts that is \nschool books. In others, that is teachers. We ought to allow them to \nmake those decisions. We should not stand in their way.\n  Again, I came here to raise these points with respect to the process, \nas much as anything else. I remind everyone that, in the last Congress, \nthere were 69 cloture motions that were filed--69 cloture motions. And \nhere we are again battling along party lines about a bill that we were \ntold might pass with 100 votes. I have serious reservations now whether \nthat is going to happen. I think the actions of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are very clear. They are now trying to kill the \nidea of allowing States and local communities to have more flexibility.\n  Again, I appreciate the work and the effort of the Senator from \nTennessee on this issue. He has provided great leadership and I \nappreciate the opportunity and the time he has given me.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida because \nhe really has hit the nail right on the head. We have a bill, Ed-Flex, \nwith flexibility, with accountability, with broad support among the \nAmerican people. That bill will help the American children, No. 1.\n  No. 2, we have Members on the opposite side of the aisle who \nrecognize they can kill this bill. They can kill this bill. They cannot \nvote for cloture and therefore effectively filibuster this bill, but at \nthe same time, hide the fact that is actually hurting our children. We \nhear, again, of all these well-intentioned programs. ``Oh, if we can \npass those, we can help our children.'' Let's recognize the facts. By \nkilling this bill, by filibustering this bill, they are preventing \nsomething which is demonstrated to work for our children from being \ndelivered to our children right now.\n  Delaying tactics will put it off for a couple of years. Yes, it will \neventually pass, but why not give our children something today? Why \ndeny them that? Because of gridlock? Because they want to define an \nagenda or they want to take the President's agenda and bring it to the \nfloor? It is hurting the children. We need Ed-Flex. We cannot tolerate \ngridlock.\n  I see my distinguished colleague from Georgia is on the floor. I \nwould like to turn to him. Let me just briefly quote from a letter from \nthe Democratic Governors' Association from 2 weeks ago, February 22, \n1999, just to demonstrate the broad support and how what is happening \non the other side, the obstruction, doesn't represent what the \nDemocratic Governors tell us. They say:\n\n       Democratic Governors strongly support this effort to vest \n     state officials with more control over the coordination of \n     federal and state regulatory and statutory authority in \n     exchange for requiring more local school accountability.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Most importantly, S. 280 [which is our bill, the underlying \n     bill here] maintains the careful balance needed between \n     flexibility and accountability.\n\n  They end by saying:\n\n       S. 280 [that's the Ed-Flex bill] is common-sense \n     legislation that we believe deserves immediate consideration. \n     We hope, therefore, that you will join in supporting its \n     prompt enactment.\n  This is a letter to the U.S. Senate from the Democratic Governors' \nAssociation supporting ``prompt enactment,'' yet we see this \nobstructionist filibustering going on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first I acknowledge the Senator from \nTennessee, the Senator from Vermont, the Senator from Oregon, Senators \nFrist, Jeffords and Wyden, for the extensive work they have been about \ntrying to address this enormous issue in America. The data that we are \nreceiving is striking to me, particularly in grades kindergarten \nthrough high school, about failed reading skills, last in math, last in \nscience among the industrialized nations. America knows this. You can \nask any community what is the No. 1 issue in the country today, and \nthey will tell you we have trouble in our school systems. We are not \neffectively equipping all of our citizens with the ability to \nparticipate in this society. If that is allowed to continue, it will \nhave the effect of crippling the United States in the new century.\n  I have often said, to the extent that any citizen is denied \nfundamental educational skills, we have abrogated their ability to be \nfull citizens and to enjoy the benefits of American citizenship. An \nuneducated people will not be a free people. By allowing so many of our \nstudents to come through the system and to have missed the mark, we are \nin danger of creating for the first time in America a cast system. This \nnever existed in America.\n  There is vast mobility in our population--people coming up the \neconomic\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\nladder; people coming down. It is not static. We will change that, if \nwe turn our heads away from allowing hundreds of thousands of our \ncitizens to come through the educational system without being equipped \nto be a full participating citizen. That is why I was proud to be a \ncosponsor of this piece of legislation, the Education Flexibility Act, \nwhich has already proven itself in 12 States. This legislation expands \nwhat is working. We need those things that are working out there.\n  I do not believe I have ever in my career in the U.S. Senate seen a \npiece of legislation that has the approval of every Governor in the \nUnited States. I do not believe I have ever seen that happen before. \nEvery Democrat Governor has signed a letter of endorsement for this \npiece of legislation; every Republican Governor has signed. How many \ntimes? It has never happened.\n  In the face of that, we are on day 7, holding reform legislation that \nhas been proven to work, supported by every Governor, we are holding it \nhostage. We are holding all those students who can benefit from this \nhostage. They are last on the list. We have to serve some other agenda, \nsome bureaucracy, some status quo. They come first. Just let those \nstudents sit out there with those miserable scores. Go ahead and let 30 \nand 40 percent of our students come to college unable to effectively \nread; go ahead and let the States spend millions upon millions of \ndollars to retrain them to see if they cannot somehow salvage a college \neducation and career. So what? Just put the old fist down, dig your \nheels in and leave everything the way it is.\n  This reminds me of the struggle for welfare reform. You didn't have \nto be a rocket scientist to understand that program was in deep \ntrouble. It was costing America trillions of dollars, and it was \nproducing dependent, not independent, citizens. It was stunting the \nfuture of millions of Americans. Yet, it took a massive struggle, year \nafter year, same crowd, I might point out. Just leave things the way \nthey are; go ahead and let those folks lose their opportunity and their \nlives. Do not give them a chance to be full participatory citizens.\n  It finally got done, and millions of Americans have learned the \nAmerican way. They have jobs. They are getting off welfare rolls by the \nthousands in every State.\n  So here we have another picture. We have an education system that is \nproducing very troubling results. The Senator who is now presiding and \nhis colleague come forward with a very clean, simple idea to try to \nhelp the States, which manage education, set better priorities, make \nthe money be more effective, get in there and try to turn this around. \nWhat does turning around mean? It means you are saving the future for \nsome child. You are giving them their chance. This kind of resistance \nis saying, OK go ahead and let them be strangled and choked down. That \nis OK. How can anybody in this Capital City accept the status quo? It \nis beyond me.\n  As you have said over and over, Mr. President, this bill, simple, \nclean, is about removing handcuffs and shackles and letting Governors \nand State legislatures and school boards get in there and get those \nresources to what the priorities are--in other words, reducing the \noverhead. You have said many times, and I agree completely, the Federal \nGovernment makes about 6 to 7 percent of the funding available for \nelementary education, but 50 percent of the overhead and administrative \nregulations are directly tied to that. Twenty-five thousand employees \nacross America are required to administer that slim piece of the \npuzzle. Your bill gets at that, begins reducing that overhead and that \nwaste, and diverting the attention of those teachers away from the kids \nto some regulatory system.\n  The amendments being talked about, bandied around town, miss the \nwhole point. This is about reducing the overhead and putting more of \nthe resources in the classroom.\n  Let me read from the genesis of one of these amendments desired to \nchange your bill. It is called ``Applications.'' It is a section about \nhow to apply under one of these amendments.\n\n       Applications Required: If any State chooses not to \n     participate in the program under this Act, or fails to submit \n     an approvable application . . .\n       Applications Required: The State educational agency of each \n     State desiring to receive an allotment under this Act shall \n     submit an application to the Secretary at such time, in such \n     form, and containing such information as the Secretary may \n     require.\n\n  That is the Secretary in Washington, not in Wyoming, not in Georgia, \nnot in Tennessee. It is the person in Washington.\n\n       Contents: Each application shall include (1) the State's \n     goals for using funds under this Act to reduce average class \n     sizes in regular classrooms in grades 1 through 3, \n     including--(A) a description of current class sizes in \n     regular classrooms in the local educational agencies of the \n     State; (B) a description of the State's plan for using funds \n     under this Act to reduce the average class size in regular \n     classrooms in those grades; and (C) the class-size goals in \n     regular classrooms the State intends to reach and a \n     justification of the goals; (2) a description of the State's \n     educational agency's plan for allocating program funds within \n     the State, including--(A) an estimate of the impact of these \n     allocations on class sizes in the individual local. . . .\n\n  You get the point, Mr. President. This is going in the opposite \ndirection. This misses the point. This is saying that the 50-percent \nburden, the 25,000 employees we have out there to try to regulate the \ncolor of the classroom, how tall it will be and the size of a chair, \nthey want to do more of that. They want more administrative burdens. \nThey want more strings.\n  This is a classic division. This is a group of people who are \nconducting an obstructionist filibuster to block what every Governor \nand a vast majority of the American people have concluded is needed: \nThat there is too much regulatory burden; it locks down the system and \ndoes not allow the system to set proper priorities. And it infers, Mr. \nPresident, that that Governor, those legislators, that community, \naren't smart enough to figure out what they need to do and it requires \na Washington wizard wonk in the bowels of one of these buildings over \nhere to tell them what they need to do. That is what this division is \nall about.\n  This legislation envisions that these local communities, the \nGovernors of our States, have a sense of the problems there and they \nneed to be given the room to go about solving them. We have done this \non a pilot basis in 12 States, and it is working. It is working. This \nlegislation opens it up so that all the States --and you come back to \nthe point, it is absolutely unprecedented, Mr. President, that every \nGovernor, of both parties, would document and send to the Congress a \nletter that says: ``Do this. We all agree.''\n  In the face of that bipartisan support, and in the face of that \nmagnificent requirement and urgency, what are we facing here in the \nU.S. Senate on something that is totally agreed to? A filibuster, of \nall things. A filibuster. And you can only conclude--as we fought our \nway through welfare reform and as we fought our way through education \nreform last year, the commitment to the status quo, the inconceivable \nability to turn away from the absolutely proven facts about what is \nhappening in kindergarten through high school, with all that data--the \nfact that those kids are not getting the mark does not matter, it is \njust too bad, tough luck, because we are going to defend the \nestablishment, the bureaucracy, the status quo. They are first; the \nkids are last.\n  Those Governors did not sign this letter at some willy-nilly picnic. \nThey are on the ground, and they know what is happening. It is a \nfrightening thing because if we leave this unchecked, we are going to \nhave a very, very large population that cannot work in our system. And \nthat is going to create havoc for our country, not to mention their \ncondition or what you have done to that person. You have left them \nwithout the tools to take care of themselves and their new families and \ntheir communities. Mr. President, that is unconscionable policy, to \nturn and walk away from that. It is hard for me to believe.\n  So I have to say, I have not been here all that long, but I have to \ntell you that this particular filibuster is onerous because of who the \nbeneficiaries are of your work. They are children, they are American \nchildren. They need help, and they need it now. And this is not the way \nthey should be treated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\n  I particularly thank the Presiding Officer and congratulate him for \nbringing this education flexibility bill to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, where it should have been passed rapidly. It came out of \ncommittee 17-1. That is bipartisan. The Presiding Officer worked hard \nand found the common ground for education.\n  All during the trial, we talked about the need to get on with the \ncountry's business; and we did. We met mornings, up to the time of the \ntrial, in committee meetings; and we passed bills out of committee. In \nfact, we passed more bills out of committee than passed the Senate in \nthe entire first year I was here. We did the work of the country. We \nfound common ground. We had a promise that common ground would be the \nway of the Senate for these next 2 years. Where did the common ground \ngo? Seventeen to one; that is common ground.\n\n  I hear expressions that we want to do things for education. Well, at \nthis moment I know that for the Democrats education is merely a \nsmokescreen, flash-in-the-pan politics. The Republicans are insisting \non a politics of performance; the Democrats are utilizing a politics of \nthe polls. The Republicans insist on promises kept; the Democrats \ninsist on promises made, politics as usual. That is what gives politics \na bad name: Promising things you do not intend to deliver on.\n  We have been talking about paying for the promises we have already \nmade. That is what IDEA is about. That is what we had extensive \ndiscussion about in the U.S. Senate last year when we figured out how \nspecial ed could be handled for this Nation. And we did find common \nground. We also had this same sort of thing on the floor where, after \nthe common ground, there were all kinds of wedge issues that were \nthrown in that did not have the detail done, that did not have the \ncommittee meetings held, that did not have the substance to follow \nthrough. Those were added and added and added, not successfully, but \ntaking up the time of the Senate.\n  We finally got IDEA passed, funding of special education. In that, \nthough, we did not follow all the promises that were made. We provided \n7 percent of the funding, not 40 percent of the funding for special \neducation. But that does not mean we did not tell the States what to \ndo. We did. We said: ``States, you've got to put up the rest of that. \nWe are just making promises.'' But we said that every time there was an \nopportunity for additional funding, that additional funding would go to \nspecial education until we got it funded. Right now we are following up \non those promises.\n  People here are saying there is a lot of money that can be spent on \neducation. And we are saying, OK, if there is a lot of money--and we \nare not agreeing that there is a lot of money--if there is a lot of \nmoney, fund what we promised first. School funding is one of the most \nimportant issues facing Wyoming and every other State. We are debating \neducation flexibility, the Ed-Flex bill. This gives States more \nflexibility to use Federal money where the States and local districts \nneed it most. State governments, local school boards, teachers and, \nyes, even the parents and kids need to be involved in setting the \nagenda for education. It should not be the Federal Government \ndesignating where every dollar is spent.\n  You get the impression, from the discussion we are having here, that \nthe Federal Government is the answer to education. Let me tell you what \nthe Federal Government does. The Federal Government provides 7 percent \nof local school funding. You would think we were the answer. We are a \npiddling little 7 percent, because we have said: ``States, we've given \nyou the mechanism to fund education. We want you to fund education. We \ninsist that you fund education to provide education for every single \nkid, and there's a court system you can put that in if you don't think \nyour kids are getting an equal break.'' And it is being utilized.\n  The Federal Government only provides 7 percent of local funding, but \nwe provide 50 percent of the paperwork. In order to get that 7 percent \nmoney, you are going to do 50 percent of your paperwork for the Federal \nGovernment. That paperwork burden requires the equivalent of 25,000 \nfull-time people who work on paper, not on students. It takes six times \nas many employees to administer a Federal dollar as it does a State \ndollar. I want to tell you, paperwork won't teach kids.\n\n  I have a daughter who is a seventh grade English teacher. She is a \ndedicated teacher. She earned her master's degree while she was \nteaching by going to classes evenings and weekends so she could do a \nbetter job with her kids. She understands class size. It fluctuates \nfrom year to year and from how many people move into her part of the \ncity. She also understands IDEA funding and the way it will affect her \njob and the way it will affect kids in her classrooms. She understands \nthat is something that has been debated and the details have been \nfilled in.\n  It is not like this idea of 100,000 new teachers, which sounds good. \nIt is that flash-in-the-pan politics, the politics of promises. It \ndoesn't have the details behind it. I suspect that every teacher out \nthere in the classroom--including my daughter--when they find out that \nbill prohibits that money from being used for an increase in wages for \nthem or even an increase in benefits, they would be livid. We have an \nobligation to the teachers who are already teaching out there, the ones \nwho are doing a good job, the ones who in some instances have too big a \nclass size. But their amendment prohibits them from getting a break.\n  That is because we haven't had committee hearings on it. We just went \nright to the politics of the polls. We just went out there and said to \nthe American people, we have studied the polls, we know you would like \nmore teachers in the classroom, we know you would like to have your \nkids in smaller classes, and we will promise that. Now, we won't \ndeliver it, but we will promise it.\n  That is not how the Republicans here work. It was my understanding \nthat we were going to have some common ground. And we found the common \nground. I was encouraged. But I am not encouraged anymore. I watched \nthe President crisscross the United States while we were having this \ntrial. He crisscrossed the United States promising money: a billion \nhere--nothing as small as a million--a billion here, a billion there, \n$4 billion there. I listened to his State of the Union Message while \nthe trial was going on. My daughter called me the next day. She said, \n``I had a kid show up to class today who had a couple of questions \nabout the President's State of the Union Message. He brought the \nfigures on the percentages that were used in the speech and he wanted \nto know if those didn't add up to 128 percent of the surplus?'' I tell \nyou, the kid is good in math. The kid is good in listening.\n  Yes, promises were made crisscrossing this country, promises that \ncan't be kept, promises that the American people have said take care of \nSocial Security, balance the budget, pay down the debt if you can, and \nif there is anything left over at all, give it back to us. But it is \nmuch fancier to put in the press that we are going to give away more \nmoney. It sounds great to have 100,000 new teachers in the classroom.\n  One of the Members on the other side of the aisle recognized this \nmorning that they have a second issue--that is more classrooms. He even \npointed out why that was an issue. It is because if you put 100,000 \nteachers in there, you no longer have classroom space for the kids. It \ntakes years of planning to be able to provide what they are talking \nabout doing in a flash-in-the-pan moment for the press.\n  That is not good business. That is not good legislation. That is not \nhow we ought to be operating.\n  At the beginning I gave the Senator from Tennessee the credit for \nthis bill. Now, there are some Democrat cosponsors on this. There are a \nlot of them. But at the moment I am not giving them any credit. They \nare the ones who voted against cloture as though cloture stopped \neverything. Cloture ends our debate in 30 hours, 30 hours of talking \nabout this important bill. That is a lot of time. Now it isn't time to \ndemagog everything in the papers. It isn't time to do the flash-in-the-\npan, promises-made politics about which we have been hearing. And it \nwould wind up with a vote at the end where we would see if we were \nreally in favor of education flexibility, less paperwork, so that \nteachers can spend more time in the classroom.\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\n  I now think that they do not want that kind of a vote. They would \nrather make promises.\n  The bill that we have before the Senate is extremely important. There \nare a lot of things in it that will actually improve the capability of \nthe present teachers in the classroom. It won't restrict their pay. It \nwon't keep them from getting additional benefits. But it will be funded \nbecause it doesn't require any funding. That is why we object to some \nof these measures being put on this bill at this moment.\n  Yes, it is an opportunity to make the press. No, it is not the \nappropriate place to make the press. The more appropriate place is to \nhave the hearings, fill in the details, get the agreement on the common \nground. The more appropriate place might be appropriations. But just in \ncase appropriations doesn't come up--oh, yeah, that is a requirement; \nwe have to cover appropriations--at any rate, even if it weren't to \ncome up, there is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is \nabout funding. That is about elementary schools and secondary schools \nand how many teachers there are. Sounds like a more appropriate place \nto me. Sounds like the place where we ought to work for common ground \ninstead of bringing it up without a hearing, bringing it up without the \ndetails pasted in.\n\n  There is a lot of demagoging going on here about amendments. There \nhave been some 15 amendments. I have heard that we may have to debate \nall of them. Of the 15, 10 require new money, 2 or more will force new \nmandates on the States--more paperwork for that piddling little 7 \npercent money that the States get, something that guts flexibility, \nwhich is the intent of this bill.\n  The others are amendments to elementary and secondary education that \nare not appropriate on this bill. This bill isn't part of elementary \nand secondary education. It never was. We passed this bill last year \nwith the President's support without all of those extraneous programs. \nLet me repeat: We had the President's support on the exact bill last \nyear. Now the President says, If you don't add a bunch of these flash-\nin-the-pan politics for me, this additional spending, I will have to \nveto your bill.\n  I am a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. I am glad to debate those new authorizations in that \ncommittee. I will not support authorizing these very expensive mandates \non this bill. It doesn't make any sense to me, for example, to put a \n$1.4 billion mandate onto States and locals to hire new teachers \nwithout the details. One of those details is what happens when the \nFederal Government doesn't provide continuing funding. That is what we \ndo with these flash-in-the-pan politics. We fund them for a while. We \nget the benefit of the press on them, and then we dump them like a hot \npotato because we can't afford them. Where does that leave the school \ndistrict that hired that teacher, reduced the class size, promised \nthose parents they would have a smaller class size? It puts them behind \nagain with another mandate to fund the project that had some temptation \nfor them when it was money being offered.\n  Let me ask another question. The way we work Federal legislation and \nregulations and paperwork, when it is recognized that we cannot afford \nthat teacher who they have been given, who gets laid off, the Federal \nhire or the local hire? This bill is about local folks. This amendment \nis about Federal rules and regulations.\n  That is why the underlying bill is such good medicine. It is a good \ndose of common sense for a system beleaguered by Washington fever. It \ndoesn't offer any new programs. It doesn't offer billions of dollars to \nhire a bunch of consultants. It offers a new format for innovation. \nThat is it. The format is flexibility so States and locals can improve \ntheir schools.\n  Every Member of this body should support this bill. If it ever comes \nto a vote, I am sure they will support this bill. Or at least I was \nsure. But when you have cosponsors who don't even vote for cloture that \nwould allow another 30 hours to debate the bill, I am not sure. I know \nour States will thank us for this bill, our schools will thank us for \nit, most importantly, our kids will thank us for doing it. It is time \nto put away the promises made--the politics of the poll, the politics \nas usual--and do some promises kept.\n  This bill is a promise made. It is a promise that can be done. It is \nthe common ground that was talked about during the trial. It is time to \nfind that common ground.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the \ntime.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come back to \nthe floor to talk about Ed-Flex and the importance of that measure for \nthe good education of our kids, and that is what we ought to be talking \nabout.\n  We heard a lot of posturing. Everybody thinks the ideas that come out \nof Washington are great. Frankly, listening to some of the ideas, I \nthink those are good ideas. If we were a great big United States school \nboard, if we were making the decisions, if we had the responsibility \nand the authority of making decisions for educating our kids, these \nmight be ideas we would adopt. In any event, they are good ideas to be \ntalking about.\n  There is a real disconnect, and that is what the Ed-Flex measure \nbegins to address. I sincerely hope that our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will let us have a vote on this very, very important \nbill. We need to move on. There are a lot more things we need to do in \neducation beyond this.\n  I am going to have a very radical proposal to get the Federal \nGovernment strings off local education all the way. But I think Ed-Flex \nis a good bipartisan start, and it builds on a successful example that \nhas been tried in 12 States. It is working. It is working because it \ngives the flexibility to local school districts to decide how they wish \nto use the money.\n  The people in the local schools--the school board members, the \nteachers, the administrators, the parents--know the names of the kids. \nThey know Joe and Sally and Harry and Willie and Thelma and the kids \nwho are being educated in that school district. They know what their \nchallenges are. Some of the good ideas we have in Washington may not \nwork in a particular school district. It may not be the right recipe. \nWho better to make the decision than the people who know the children, \nwho know their potential, who know their problems?\n  I have found in meetings with educators and parents in every section \nof this State--in the metropolitan areas, in the urban schools, in the \nsuburban schools, in the rural schools, in the big school districts and \nthe small school districts--that there is one theme that has become a \nrecurring and a growing crescendo. It is: The Federal camel's nose is \nunder the education tent, and it is not doing good things. It is taking \ntime away from the task of educating the kids. When a teacher has to \nspend hours writing a grant or a principal has to spend time to figure \nout if they are doing things the way the bureaucrats in Washington want \nthem, he or she is not worrying about what is good for educating Sally \nor Tommy or Ralph or Cheryl or the kids who are actually getting \neducated.\n  I am very fortunate, my son is finishing up high school. We watched \nduring his education; we wanted to know what was going on in the \nclassroom, how was he working with his teacher. We as parents knew \nthat. The people who run the local schools know that, but those coming \nup with great ideas in Washington have no idea of the names of the kids \nor what their problems are.\n  I thought maybe it would help my colleagues if I shared a few of the \nstories we are getting from schools in our State. These are smaller \nschools. It does not matter what the size of the school is, the child \nwho is in that school is just as important whether she or he is in a \nmajor metropolitan school district or in a small rural district.\n\n  Here is a letter from the superintendent of the Bismarck R-V School \nDistrict. In part it says:\n\n       . . . In our small school of 700 students, we receive less \n     than $15,000 in the combination of Title II, Title IV and \n     Title VI funds. The restrictions on these funds make them \n     very difficult to deal with for such a small amount of \n     dollars. Some years we consider not using them, simply \n     because the time and effort are not worth the small amount we \n     receive. Removal of some or all of the restrictions would \n     allow us to use the funding to better meet the needs of our \n     school instead of spending the funds in the very restrictive \n     designated areas of Federal funding.\n\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\n\n  Signed, Donald E. Francis, Superintendent, Bismarck R-V Schools.\n  North Mercer District R-3 Public Schools:\n\n       . . . As the system now works we are overwhelmed by federal \n     and state forms and regulations. We also sacrifice many \n     dollars to support federal and state bureaucracies that \n     compound the forms, rules and regulations.\n       We encountered one program this school year with in excess \n     of 150 pages of instructions. We would like to bring dollar, \n     services and equipment directly to children for their \n     educational benefit.\n\n  And one more. The Webb City School District R-7:\n\n       . . . Those of us who have spent a career in education have \n     repeatedly experienced the jubilation of anticipation that \n     arose from promises made by the Federal Government toward \n     education. Unfortunately, however, excitement was then always \n     tempered by the reality of the red tape that accompanied the \n     promise. As the result, frustration was generally the only \n     product forthcoming.\n\n  Signed, Ronald Lankford, Superintendent of Schools, Webb City School \nDistrict R-7.\n  Mr. President, that is just a very small sample of the kind of \nresponse we are getting from our schools. I challenge any one of you \nhere, any one of our colleagues, to go home and ask the educators who \nhave the job--it is a wonderful opportunity, it is the most important \njob that we have in this country--of educating our students: Are the \n763 different Federal education programs we have right now improving \neducation? I get an overwhelming no. We have to worry about the \nWashington bureaucracy rather than the needs of the kids in our \nclassrooms.\n  This reality has been recognized. The Nation's Governors--Democrat, \nRepublican, and Independent--50 to 0, said, ``We want to expand Ed-\nFlex; we want the opportunity in all of the schools in this country to \nget rid of and cut away some of the bureaucracy and some of the redtape \nand put that money directly back to education.''\n  There is bipartisan support for this bill. The bill has been \nsupported by the President, by the Secretary of Education, both of whom \nwere former Governors. I am a former Governor. I served with both of \nthem, and we know the importance of education. But the decisions on how \nwe spend the last dollar of Federal aid are not best made here, they \nare best made at the local school district level.\n  I really hope we can move forward and get this money directly to the \nschools, giving them the flexibility to use those funds where they are \nmost needed. I urge our colleagues to allow us to do so and pass this \nbill and go on to the many other important issues involving education \nthat we will be facing later this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the \ntime.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the \nsenior Senator from Missouri. He speaks so clearly about the \nfrustration that exists at local levels today of decisionmaking for \neducation, in that sometimes what might work in New York City just does \nnot seem to fit down on the farm or near the farm in Missouri or in a \nrural school district of Idaho, and that is the reason for a \ndemonstration program of 12 States. That is why we have determined that \na greater amount of flexibility is necessary in the area of education.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why Democrats want to block \nthis bipartisan bill in the name of education. There is adequate time \nto debate other issues in education. I hope they will work with us. \nComing out of the impeachment process I thought we were going to get a \nbipartisan environment from which to move the Nation's business \nforward. The Nation, I hope, is listening today. The Nation's business \nis education. And it isn't moving forward. It isn't moving forward not \nbecause of Republicans but because of some folks on the other side of \nthe aisle who think their agenda of larger Federal involvement and \ngreater Federal control is an approach to educate our young people. Let \nthe parents, the educators and the school boards decide.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Kennedy/Murray class size amendment. As we know, Mr. President, \neducation is serious concern for people across the country, and I am \npleased to see an education bill as one of the first priorities in this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, last year Congress provided a one-time appropriation \nin the omnibus budget bill to hire approximately 30,000 new teachers \nacross the country. The Kennedy/Murray amendment we are considering \ntoday authorizes a continuation of this effort for the next 6 years. \nThis sends the signal to local school districts that Congress \nunderstands the importance of smaller classes and is committed to \nfunding for class size reduction. This amendment takes a positive step \ntoward helping school districts reduce class size as part of an overall \neffort to improve education and ensure that our children have the best \nchance to excel and reach their full potential.\n  As my own state of Wisconsin can attest--smaller classes make a \ndifference in student's lives. Wisconsin's Student Achievement \nGuarantee in Education or SAGE program, now in its third year, \ncontinues to be a model for the nation in how to implement successfull \neducation reforms in our public schools by reducting public school \nclass size in the earliest grades. I am very proud that Wisconsin's \nSAGE program is leading the charge to reduce public school class size \nacross the nation, and pleased that this amendment will help keep SAGE \nthriving in Wisconsin.\n  The recently released second year SAGE evaluation again empirically \ndemonstrates what we instinctively know; students in smaller classes \nget more attention from teachers and teachers with fewer students have \nmore time and energy to devote to each child. Specifically, the first \nand second year evaluations confirm the achievements of SAGE students \nin all tested areas: mathematics, reading and language arts. The report \nshows total scores for SAGE students were significantly higher than \nthose students at comparison schools.\n  The evidence shows that teachers in small classes can provide \nstudents with more individualized attention, spend more time on \ninstruction and less on other tasks and cover more material more \neffectively. Again, Mr. President, SAGE has shown conclusively that the \nsignificance of small class size should not be underestimated and \ncannot be ignored.\n  Class size should be at the forefront of the education agenda because \nthere is a great national purpose in helping local schools reduce class \nsize for children in the earliest grades. I would like to state Mr. \nPresident my strong belief that education should remain solidly a state \nand local function. However, I believe the federal government can have \na constructive role supporting local efforts. Kennedy/Murray class size \nproposal is a perfect example.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reach across the \naisle to ensure that education is a top priority in the 160th Congress. \nI look forward to working in a bipartisan manner to reach consensus on \nthese important issues to ensure that our children receive the highest \nquality education possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/09/senate-section/article/S2453-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE 1998 TRADE POLICY AGENDA AND 1997 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE \n      TRADE AGREEMENTS PROGRAM--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 13\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 163 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 \nU.S.C. 2213), I transmit herewith the 1999 Trade Policy Agenda and the \n1998 Annual Report on the Trade Agreements Program.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Feingold to \nintroduce the ``Dairy Promotion Fairness Act.'' This measure will \nfurther our nation's dairy marketing board's efforts to promote the \nconsumption of healthy dairy products produced by family dairy farms \nand to fund research critical to the development of new dairy products.\n  This effort is needed as a matter of fairness to our nation's dairy \nfarmers. When enacted, our legislation will require that all dairy \nproducers whose products are sold in the United States contribute to \nthe promotional effort. Currently, domestic producers of dairy products \nlike cheese, butter, and yogurt, all pay a promotional fee to help \npromote the dairy products produced in this country. Importers do not \npay this fee.\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\n  I was extremely surprised to find out that dairy producers can import \nthese goods into the United States and not contribute to the \npromotional sales efforts sponsored by our domestic industry. This \nchange will require those selling incoming products to contribute the \nsame assessment as the domestic dairy farmers do.\n  This bill supports the dairy marketing board's efforts to educate \nconsumers on the nutritional value of dairy products. It also treats \nour farmers fairly--by asking them not to bear the entire financial \nburden for a promotional program that benefits importers and domestic \nproducers alike. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 567\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of legislation \nintroduced by the senior Senator from my home State of Wisconsin. \nToday, Senator Kohl has introduced a measure important not only to \nWisconsin's dairy farmers but to dairy farmers all over the country.\n  The National Dairy Promotion and Research Program collects roughly \n$225 million every year from American dairy farmers, who each pay a \nmandatory 15 cents into the program for every 100 pounds of milk they \nproduce. This program is designed to promote dairy products to \nconsumers and to conduct research relating to milk processing and \nmarketing.\n  While 15 cents may appear to be a small amount of money, multiplied \nby all the millions of pounds of milk marketed in this country, it adds \nup to thousands of dollars each year for the average domestic producer. \nGiven the magnitude of this program, it is critical that Congress take \nseriously the concerns producers have about the way their promotion \nprogram is run. This legislation addresses one of the most important of \nthose concerns: importers reap the same promotional benefits as their \nU.S. counterparts, yet they don't pay a dime into the program.\n  The National Dairy Promotion and Research Board conducts generic \npromotion and general product research. Domestic farmers and importers \nalike benefit from these actions. This bill, Mr. President, provides \nequity to domestic producers who have been footing the bill for this \npromotion program all by themselves for over 10 years.\n  The Dairy Promotion Fairness Act requires that all dairy product \nimporters contribute to the Dairy Promotion Program at the same rate as \ndomestic dairy farmers. This is not an unusual proposal, Mr. President. \nMany of our largest generic promotion programs for other commodities \nalready assess importers for their fair share of the program, including \nprograms for pork, beef, and cotton.\n  This legislation is particularly important in light of the 1994 \npassage of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). GATT has \nboosted imports of dairy products in the past several years. A dairy \npromotion assessment on importers would also be allowed under GATT \nsince our own milk producers are already paying the same assessment.\n  We have put our own producers at a competitive disadvantage for far \ntoo long. It's high time importers paid for their fair share of this \nprogram. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to end \nthe subsidization of foreign farmers on the backs of our own.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 568. A bill to allow the Department of the Interior and the \nDepartment of Agriculture to establish a fee system for commercial \nfilming activities in a site or resource under their jurisdictions; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\nlegislation to establish a fee system for commercial filming activities\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich would allow the Department of the Interior and the Department of \nAgriculture to charge a fee when commercial filming activities take \nplace on public lands in their jurisdiction. This legislation is \nanother important part of our efforts to preserve and protect the \npristine beauty of our national parks and other public lands. A similar \nversion of this legislation was included in S. 1693, the Vision 2020, \nNational Parks Restoration Act, when that bill passed the Senate. \nUnfortunately, the language was removed from that bill when it passed \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The purpose of this measure is very simple. When commercial film \ncompanies use our nation's public lands, they should pay for that \nprivilege. Our nation's parks and other lands provide an outstanding \nbackdrop for the commercial film industry and we should ensure that \nthese areas are not negatively impacted by that use.\n  This legislation is not designed as a ``bash Hollywood'' bill. I want \nto comment the commercial film industry for their efforts to work with \nme and other members of Congress to find a reasonable solution to this \nmatter. Although there are those in the industry who do not want to pay \nfor the use of these lands, by and large the film industry is willing \nto pay a fee for filming on public lands as long as it is reasonable, \nunderstandable and fair. I believe the bill I am introducing today \nmeets all of those criteria.\n  Let me take a few moments to outline this measure. The legislation\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\nwould authorize both the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of \nAgriculture to charge a reasonable fee for commercial filming \nactivities on federal lands in their jurisdiction. The fee will be \nbased on a number of criteria including; the number of days the filming \ntakes place within the areas, the size of the film crew and the amount \nand type of equipment used. The agencies would also be directed to \nrecover any costs incurred as a result of filming activities such as \nadministrative and personnel costs. All of the fees charged for film \nactivities would stay at the site where they are collected.\n  We have also included language in this bill to address the issue of \nstill photography on public lands. As we worked to craft the parks bill \nlast year, we heard from a large number of still photographers who were \nworried about the impact this legislation would have on them. In order \nto address those concerns, we have included language in our bill \nexempting still photography unless the agency determines that this \nactivity will disrupt the public's use and enjoyment of the resource. I \nbelieve this is a fair way to address this question.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to establish a film fee system on \nour nation's public lands that is sensible and understandable. Once \nagain, I want to stress that this bill is not designed to punish the \nfilm industry. Instead, this measure will benefit both the public and \nthe film industry by establishing simple and understandable system for \noperating on federal lands. Establishing a sound fee system for filming \non public lands can be a ``win-win'' for the public and the film \nindustry and I hope the Senate will take quick action on this important \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Grams):\n  S. 569. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \ncertain farm rental income from net earnings from self-employment if \nthe taxpayer enters into a lease agreement relating to such income; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   The Farm Independence Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Conrad and \nGrams of Minnesota, I am introducing a bill to exempt certain farm \nrental income from the self-employment tax.\n  The self-employment tax has been applied equally to farmers and other \nbusiness people for the last 40 years. Our bill would ensure equality \nin the future. It states that farm landlords should be treated the same \nas small business people and other commercial landlords, and they \nshould not have to pay self-employment tax on cash rent income.\n  The current law is drafted to ensure that self-employment tax applies \nto income from labor or employment. Farm landlords were only taxed when \nthey participated in the operation of the farm. Income from cash rent \nrepresents the value of ownership or equity in land, not labor or \nemployment. Therefore, the self-employment tax should not apply to \nincome from cash rent. Yet, this is not they way that the Internal \nRevenue Service drafted its technical advice memorandum on this matter. \nThis has resulted in farmers and retired farmers now paying a 15.3 \npercent self-employment tax on cash rent.\n  The IRS has gone too far. The law should be what people have counted \non for 40 years. Unless there is an act of Congress, history should be \nrespected. The test of time will prove that the taxpayer was right and \nthat the IRS was wrong, particularly now that there is a difference \nbetween the farm and city sector. Therefore, we are introducing this \nbill so that farmers and retired farmers will not be singled out \nunfairly by the IRS.\n  Specifically, this legislation would remove the code's ambiguity and \nrecapture its original intent. The legislation would clarify that when \nthe IRS is applying the self-employment tax to cash rent farm leases, \nit would limit its applicability to the lease agreement. This is not an \nexpansion of the law of taxpayers. Rather, it would limit the anti \ntaxpayer expansion initiated by the Internal Revenue Service. The tax \nlaw does not require cash rent landlords in cities to pay the self-\nemployment tax. Indeed cash rent farm landlords are the only ones \nrequired to pay the tax. This is due to a 40-year-old exception that \nallowed the retired farmers of the late 1950's to become vested in the \nSocial Security system.\n  The law originally imposed the tax on farm landlords only when their \nlease agreements with the renters required them to participate in the \noperation of the farm and in the farming of the land.\n  Forty years later, the IRS has expanded the application of self-\nemployment tax for farmland owners. The tax court told the IRS that in \none particular instant they could look beyond the lease agreement. On \nthis very limited authority, the IRS has expanded one tax court case \ninto national tax policy.\n  Our legislation will bring fairness between farmer landlords and \nurban landlords. It will clarify that the IRS should examine only the \nlease agreement. It would preserve the pre-1996 status quo. It would \npreserve the historical self-employment tax treatment of farm rental \nagreements, equating them with landlords in small businesses and \ncommercial properties. The 1957 tax law was designed to benefit retired \nfarmers of that generation so they would qualify for Social Security.\n  Congress does not intend that farm owners be treated differently from \nother real estate owners, other than they have been historically. We \nneed clarity provided in our legislation in order to turn back an \nimproper, unilateral, and targeted IRS expansion of settled tax law.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in addressing this unfair position \ntaken by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 569\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1, SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Farm Independence Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMale High School's Championship Football team in Louisville, Kentucky \non the occasion of their annual awards banquet.\n  The Male High School Bulldogs have long held a reputation for \nexcellence in Kentucky and throughout the nation. With the leadership \nof The Bluegrass State's finest high school football coach, Bobby \nRedman, it's no wonder the team has gone so far. It is clear to \nplayers, parents, coaches and students alike when they see Bobby on the \nfield with his team that his heart and soul are rooted in Bulldogs \nfootball. Bobby's marked dedication to his team and his school are \nadmirable, and I'm certain my feelings are shared by the entire Male \nfamily.\n  Tonight I congratulate you, the Male High School football team, on \nyour commitment to excellence both on the field and in the classroom, \nand thank you for working so hard to continue giving high school \nfootball in Louisville an honorable name. Players become great because \nof their hard work and commitment to themselves and their team. You \nhave each spent countless hours before and after school lifting \nweights, memorizing plays, and practicing and preparing for games. You \nhave each spent Friday afternoons at pep rallys getting ready for \nevening games, felt the stress of wanting to play your best and win, \nand experienced the emotional high as you finally rush the field. You \nhave dedicated your high school careers to Male and to its football \nteam, and my colleagues and I commend you.\n  Not only is Male High School known for their powerhouse of a football \nteam, most recently leading the Bulldogs to victory as 1998-99 4-A \nState Champions, but they also are known for their commitment to \nacademic success. Male has been recognized as a National Exemplary \nSchool twice in recent years by the United States Department of \nEducation, and has received the Flag of Excellence by the State of \nKentucky for consistently high academic achievement. Ninety percent of \nMale graduates continue their education at colleges and universities, \nand many of them receive partial or full scholarships to attend. It is \ncommendable that students so profoundly talented on the football field \nare also concerned about their academic achievements.\n  I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Male High School \nfootball players and coaches have left will continue on, and will \nencourage and inspire others toward that same goal. On behalf of myself \nand my colleagues, thank you for your contribution to the Louisville \ncommunity, the State of Kentucky, and to our great nation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/09/senate-section/article/S2459-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n                     30TH ANNIVERSARY OF WTOP RADIO\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate one \nof our local news outlets, WTOP Radio, on their 30th anniversary. \nThirty years ago, on March 9, 1969, WTOP began its news broadcasts. \nToday, WTOP has become a vital source of news and information in the \nnation's capital. Along the way, Dave McConnell, WTOP's congressional \ncorrespondent, has become a familiar voice to Washington residents and \none of our nation's most respected journalists.\n  America's Constitution is unique and special in the responsibility it \nhas bestowed on our nation's press corps--in print, on TV, and on the \nradio. With our revered First Amendment, the nation gives reporters the \nawesome responsibility to help communicate the needs of the nation and \nreport on the day-to-day governmental events that affect all Americans. \nIn return, we hope those reporters recognize that responsibility and \ncarefully tend their role as stewards of public information.\n  WTOP has taken that responsibility seriously and sought to provide \nhigh-quality, timely information for residents in the greater \nWashington area. For thirty years, WTOP has covered the news as it \nhappened--in Washington and around the world. From the War on Poverty \nto the War in Iraq, WTOP's reporting has kept millions of \nWashingtonians informed. They have tracked legislation that affects \nresidents in Virginia, the District of Columbia, and Maryland, and \nhelped bring perspective to issues facing the nation.\n  As important, WTOP provides a critical service to local residents in \nalerting them to breaking local stories. In addition to their \ncomprehensive news coverage, they have warned residents of dangerous \nweather, alerted commuters to traffic snarls, and celebrated sports \nvictories of our Orioles, Ravens, and Redskins. WTOP's committed staff \nare part of the daily lives of countless Washingtonians who listen as \nthey brush their teeth, drive to and from work, or cook the evening \nmeal. My constituents in Maryland's DC suburbs rely on them to get \ninformation they need to know to stay informed, stay healthy, and stay \ntuned.\n  I commend the WTOP family and its listeners on 30 years of service to \nthe greater Washington area and welcome 30 more years. Our nation's \ncapital, and our nation, are proud of their work and appreciative of \ntheir commitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/09/senate-section/article/S2459-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR.

As a \nsmall business owner, he has set an outstanding example of quality, \nproduction, and leadership. These business qualities have been \nreflected in his extensive community and charitable activities.\n  Mr. DeRossi began working at DeRossi & Son Company in Vineland, New \nJersey in 1960 under his father, Dominick and his grandfather, Angelo. \nFrom them, Mr. DeRossi learned all aspects of the clothing business. \nToday, DeRossi is seen as a premier clothing supplier of military dress \ncoats for the US Defense Department. Under Mr. DeRossi, who currently \nserves as president, the company has received numerous awards. Most \nrecently, DeRossi received the United States Small Business \nAdministration ``Administrator's Award for Excellence,'' as well as the \nDefense Supply Center's Small Business contractor of the year award.\n  Mr. DeRossi has put the same enthusiasm and energy into his community \nand charitable work as he has put into his business. He has dedicated \ncountless hours of service to such commendable causes as the United \nWay, the YMCA, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer \nAssociation, the March of Dimes, the 4H Club, and Muscular Dystrophy. \nHe has sat on the Boards of such community organizations as the Urban \nEnterprise Zone, Ellison School, the University of Medicine and \nDentistry of New Jersey, and the Vineland Chamber of Commerce.\n  On the eve of his receipt of this award, Mr. DeRossi deserves to be \nrecognized for his outstanding services to both the business community \nand his community of Vineland, New Jersey. He is an exemplary \nbusinessman, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to show my \nappreciation for all he has accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/09/senate-section/article/S2459-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote scheduled to occur at 4 p.m. today occur instead at 2:45 and that \nthe time between now and 2:45 be equally divided between the chairman \nand the ranking member of the committee.\n  I further ask that immediately following the vote the Senate stand in \nadjournment until 12 noon on Wednesday, and that the routine requests \nthrough the morning hour be agreed to, the morning hour be deemed to \nhave expired, and the Senate proceed for 1 hour of debate to be equally \ndivided between the chairman and ranking minority member of the \ncommittee relative to the cloture votes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at 1 p.m. on Wednesday the \nSenate proceed to the cloture vote with respect to the Kennedy motion \nregarding class size, and the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be \nwaived. I also ask that immediately following that vote, if not \ninvoked, the Senate proceed to a cloture vote relative to the Lott \namendment regarding IDEA and choice.\n  Finally, I remind all Senators that under the provisions of rule \nXXII, all second-degree amendments must be filed by 12 noon on \nWednesday, March 10, in order to qualify postcloture.\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\n  Before the Chair rules, I just want to advise the Members that the \npurpose here is that staff and others be able to avoid what may be a \nvery difficult afternoon rush hour with the snow coming down. And \nindications are it is probably going to increase even more. But we do \nwant to have this cloture vote, so we will have 30 minutes equally \ndivided for debate and then the vote, and then we will be back up with \nthis very important bipartisan education flexibility bill on Wednesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are going to have \n15 minutes a side. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. \nThere will be 30 minutes equally divided between now and 2:45.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in just half an hour the Senate will vote \non the second cloture motion to terminate debate on the Ed-Flex bill, \nand then tomorrow we will have two more cloture votes. It is our \nposition that these cloture votes are completely unnecessary--what we \nwould like to be doing here this afternoon and in the course of \ntomorrow is voting on education policy.\n  We were given assurances by the majority leader at the annual \nNational Governors Association Conference that we would have the debate \nfor 1 or 2 weeks. Now the minority leader has proposed limiting our \nside to just five different amendments, and we would be glad to have a \nnumber of amendments on the other side. We are glad to enter into time \nlimits. There is no reason we cannot end the whole education debate \ntomorrow.\n  We have no assurance--none--from the majority leader, none from the \nchairman of the Health and Education Committee, that we will have \nanother vehicle before the end of this year to debate education. This \nmay very well be the only opportunity that we have. Why not have a \nreasonable time to debate and discuss the issues that are before the \nSenate in education, primarily the issue of class size reduction from \ngrades K to 3, which is enormously important and very successful in \nterms of enhancing student performance. What about the afterschool \nprograms? What about enhancing the effort to terminate school dropouts? \nThe range of different, important policy issues--all we want to be able \nto do is debate them. We are being denied that by the majority.\n  That is part of our frustration. We believe the discussion on \neducation is one of the most important debates that we will have. We \nare here, ready to debate. We were here last week on Friday and were \nclosed out. We were here on Monday and are here Tuesday and continue to \nbe closed out from being able to consider these amendments. That is the \nwrong policy.\n  Parents do not understand why we cannot debate it. Various \norganizations representing teachers, parents, school boards, and local \ncommunities are all pleading to the U.S. Senate to go ahead and have \nthe debate on these issues.\n  There is widespread approval for continuing Federal support for \nreducing class size nationwide. This initiative is supported by the \nNational Parent Teacher Association, the National School Boards \nAssociation, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople, the Council of Chief State School Officers, the American \nAssociation of School Administrators, the Council of Great City \nSchools, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the \nNational Association of State Directors of Special Education, the \nNational Education Association, the International Reading Association, \nthe American Federation of Teachers, and the National Association of \nSchool Psychologists.\n  These groups are all saying please, go ahead with this debate. Go \nahead and have the votes on these matters. We will abide by whatever \nthe Senate does, but do not close us out.\n  Mr. President, that is what is happening here this afternoon. I hope \nwe will not have the cloture vote to close it out. I am still hopeful \nsomehow at this late hour we will be able to work out a process so we \ncan consider the educational amendments which families all over this \ncountry want us to consider.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are on the right subject. The question \nhere is education. But in this great deliberative body, as it is \ncalled, we have some who do not want us to debate the principles of \neducation and ideas that exist, here in the Chamber of the Senate.\n  Let me show a graph, if I might. It will be hard for people to see \nthis, but it describes where we are. We have an education bill on the \nfloor of the Senate. To that education bill is offered an amendment by \nSenator Gramm, an amendment to the Gramm amendment by Senator Jeffords, \nthen a Jeffords substitute, then a Bingaman amendment, and then the \nLott substitute. Then we come in with the Kennedy motion to recommit in \norder to do the class size amendment. Then we have a Lott amendment to \nthat, followed by a Lott amendment to the Lott amendment.\n  What does all that mean? It is a legislative way of plugging up this \nsystem so nothing can happen unless those who run the place want it to \nhappen. It is a legislative mechanism to prevent debate and action on \nthe ideas that we have about education.\n  What are those ideas? The bill on the floor is called Ed-Flex. That \nis an idea about flexibility. There are other ideas--one we debated \nlast year, reducing class size K-3; 100,000 new teachers who reduce \nclass size, because kids learn better when they are in classes of 15 \nthan if they are in classes of 30 kids. That is common sense. That is \nan idea, the Kennedy-Murray amendment.\n  School construction--repairing and renovating and building schools \nwhere we have schools in disrepair. I have talked at length about \nschools that are in disrepair; classrooms with sewer gas coming up into \nthe classrooms and kids have to be removed; classrooms that are unsafe. \nI have talked at length about those issues here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Afterschool programs is another idea. An idea I want to offer, an \namendment I want to offer that I am prevented from offering by this \nplugging system here in the legislative assembly is a school report \ncard. Every 6 or 9 weeks all across this country parents get report \ncards about how their kids are doing. How is the school performing, \nhowever? What about how is the school doing? What does it mean if your \nkid gets the best grades in the worst school? What does that mean? How \ndoes your school do compared to other schools? How does your State do \ncompared to other States? What are you getting for hundreds of billions \nof dollars we are spending to educate our kids? How about grading our \nschools? I want to offer that amendment. I want that grading system to \nbe a system that every parent in every corner of this country can \nunderstand and recognize and use.\n  Mr. President, I graduated in a high school class of nine. We didn't \nhave particularly advanced mathematics courses, but I know enough about \nwhat is going on from that kind of education to understand what is \ngoing on here on the floor of the Senate. We have an education bill on \nthe floor of the Senate. A number of us have amendments we want to \noffer to that bill, have a debate, and have votes on our amendments. \nThose who run this place say no, it is not how we are going to operate. \nIt is our ideas or no ideas. It is our agenda or no agenda. It is a \nvote on our bill or on our amendments, or no votes.\n  That is not the way this place ought to operate. Education is a \npriority and should be a priority in the legislative agenda of this \nSenate. But it ought not be a narrow agenda that says we will only \nconsider a piece of legislation called Ed-Flex and then prevent \neveryone else from offering their amendments.\n  I heard a speaker yesterday say about this class size amendment, that \nis the Senate wanting to run the local school districts. Nonsense. Let \nme read a comment from a Republican last year when we passed a piece of \nlegislation that called for some additional teachers. Congressman \nGoodling, a Republican, said, ``This is a real victory for the \nRepublican Congress, but more importantly, it is a huge win for local\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\neducators and parents who are fed up with Washington mandates.''\n  So I hear somebody stand up over there yesterday and say what we are \ntrying to do somehow is to run the local school systems--absolute \nnonsense. It is nonsense, as indicated by Mr. Goodling, a Republican, \nwho last year said this is good public policy; this is policy everybody \nought to support.\n  In fact, this is Republican policy, he said. Now it appears we cannot \neven get a vote on it. So I urge the majority leader and others to \nbring a piece of legislation to the floor, open it up, let's have a \ndebate, let's offer amendments--let's get the best of what everyone has \nto offer here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we approach the vote to invoke cloture on \nS. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1998, I wish to \nexpress my dismay with the procedural battle evoked by this \nlegislation. We have now spent close to three full days on this bill, \nbut the Senate has expended most of its time and energy on procedural \ntactics intended to preclude one party or the other from debating those \ntopics of utmost importance to them. I find this greatly disturbing. \nEducation is a serious topic which deserves the substantive attention \nof this body. It merits an in-depth examination from a multitude of \nlevels and angles so that our nation's children can someday reap the \nfull benefit of a well-rounded learning experience. With so many \npriority items to discuss and debate in this Congress, there is, of \ncourse, great difficulty with accommodating and balancing the wishes of \n100 Senators, but I hope that we could come to an understanding by \nwhich Republicans and Democrats alike could use this opportunity to \nfurther discuss and debate education policy. People all across the \nUnited States from California to Maine tell us that education is their \ntop priority. Obviously there are concerns. Can we not set aside our \ndifferences and use this opportunity to help address the many problems \nfacing our nation's education system?\n  As part of this debate on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act \nof 1998, I would like to take some time to discuss the issue of \neducation accountability, a topic which has received much attention \nfrom my colleagues during these past few days. I am pleased to note \nthat greater accountability has been built into this legislation to \nensure that states granted this so-called Ed-Flex status are held to \nhigher standards of accountability in exchange for increased \nflexibility at the state level. I am, however, reluctant to support the \nnotion of expanding this Ed-Flex designation nationwide, given the \nlimited performance results from the twelve demonstration states and \nthe lack of accountability data on which a state or school currently \nreports. Perhaps, before embarking on this mission of handing over \ngreater authority to states to waive federal education requirements, we \nshould consider the somewhat startling fact that more than sixty \npercent of parents have never seen an individual report card on the \nperformance of their area school.\n  I find it ironic that, in an age where a wealth of information \nabounds about any imaginable field, precious little information exists \nabout the performance of our nation's schools. Mr. President, I bring \nto the attention of the Senate a recent publication by Education Week \nand A-Plus Communications, entitled ``Reporting Results,'' that \ndiscusses this new buzzword of 1999. While I find encouraging the fact, \nas reported in Education Week, that thirty-six states are expected to \nissue school accountability data or ``report cards'' this year, that \npractice, it seems to me, should be undertaken by all fifty states.\n  Furthermore, of the thirty-six states that will have report cards in \n1999, only thirteen states ensure that the report cards actually get \nsent home to parents and few include all the information that parents \nreport that they actually want to see most. Moreover, the information \non these report cards rarely finds its way to the community at large, \nwhich has an interest in the education of its young people. I am \nbaffled by this phenomenon! Why go through the process of creating such \na document for it to end up as yet another soiled piece of paper in the \ngarbage can? And without this kind of documentation from schools, \nshould we really be proceeding with the expansion of Ed-Flex authority \nto waive certain federal education requirements without significant \nknowledge of how our nation's schools are performing in the first \nplace?\n  Of all the decisions in life that a parent has to make, the decision \nabout where to send a child to school is one of the most difficult and \nimportant. I find it unbelievable to think that parents often, for the \nlack of better information, rely upon word-of-mouth to make such \nimportant decisions. Where are the numbers on student achievement, test \nscores, teacher certification, and graduation rates? Parents need to \nhave this information before them as a key resource for making an \ninformed decision.\n  I feel for parents who, despite their best efforts to learn about the \nquality of their local schools, cross their fingers as they send their \nchildren off each day in the hope that their children will be spending \nthose hours in an enriching and safe environment. I find it terribly \ndisconcerting that the quality of our schools in different corners of \nthe same community can differ so dramatically as to force families to \nmove from neighborhood to neighborhood on the trail of the best \nschools. I find it sad that so many families have felt compelled to \ngive up on public schools in favor of private schools or home \nschooling.\n  Mr. President, I believe that greater education accountability is the \nkey to unlocking this trend burdening so many families today. With more \ninformation, and I am talking about the real stuff--test scores, \nteacher qualifications, graduation rates, tracking of students from \ngrade school into college and after--parents will have substantive data \nat their fingertips to truly determine what is in the best interest of \ntheir child and their family as a whole. Perhaps, at the same time, \nthis could provide a better framework for gauging how Ed-Flex is \nimpacting student achievement levels and enhancing teacher preparation.\n  Competition is at the heart of creating better schools for the \nnation. During this debate, my colleagues will raise the important \nissues of school construction, class-size reduction, and others of \ngreat concern to the American people, but I believe that fostering a \ncompetitive environment among schools is perhaps one of the more simple \nand effective ways of improving our nation's schools for the 21st \ncentury.\n  By forcing schools to annually report on performance data, such as \ntest scores and other quantitative measures, teacher qualifications, \nand safety indicators, parents will have a framework for weighing one \nschool against another, and communities will have data they need to \nforce improvements in their school systems. As Education Week pointed \nout in its report, so many of the report cards that actually make their \nway into a parents' hands are difficult to read, with extraneous \ninformation of little benefit to educators and parents. Mr. President, \nthere needs to be uniformity in gathering key data that parents are \nseeking and a model that all parents can follow. Holding schools \naccountable for the students they are producing and the teachers they \nhave chosen, while making this information readily available to \nparents, will turn up the heat on schools, and apply much long-needed \npressure to those at the helm to up the ante on teacher qualifications \nand curriculum requirements.\n  But test scores and other achievement data will mean little to \nparents if we continue upon this so-called trend of ``teaching to the \ntest.'' What good will come of teaching students skills simply to ace a \nstandardized test? Mr. President, if we hope to produce well-rounded \nstudents prepared for the challenges ahead in today's workforce, a \nstandardized test should not drive the curriculum. Life is not multiple \nchoice. Life is an essay, to be written well or poorly by educated \nstudents.\n  Education accountability is a serious issue which has been left \nbehind for many years at the expense of our nation's parents and \neducators. It is time to examine the necessity for reporting data both \nas part of this Ed-Flex legislation and at the local level in the form \nof school report cards. I look forward to working with the Health, \nEducation,\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\nLabor, and Pensions Committee in ensuring that our nation begins to \nnavigate this challenging territory.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing my \nconcern about the gridlock we find ourselves in here on this bill. Let \nme, first of all, commend the majority leader and majority for bringing \nup an education bill. I think most Americans feel that this is one of \nthe most important issues for us to be addressing. So I want to begin \nthese brief remarks by commending the majority for bringing up an \neducation bill.\n  The regrettable part is that having now brought up this matter of the \nso-called Ed-Flex bill, we are now being deprived of the opportunity to \ndiscuss a number of critical issues which affect the quality of \neducation in the country. We are not suggesting here that this be an \nunlimited debate with countless amendments. There are just several very \nkey and important issues the American public would like to have us help \naddress.\n  One is class size. Most Americans know if a teacher has too many \nstudents, not only can the teacher not teach, the students do not \nlearn. This is not any great leap of logic to understand this. Too many \nof our classes are too big. We know that. One of the proposals we would \nlike to raise in the context of this education bill is that amendment. \nYou could vote it down, if you would like. But I do not think this \ninstitution, or the American public, ought to be deprived of having the \nSenate of the United States debate an amendment that would assist \nreducing the size of classes in America. That ought not be denied the \nAmerican people. Yet under this present sort of Rubik's Cube we have \ncreated here legislatively, we cannot even get to that amendment.\n  Americans would like to see us address the issue of afterschool \nprograms. It is a major problem. Parents worry about where their \nchildren are between the hours of 3 and 6 o'clock. It is a major \nproblem. We may disagree over how best to achieve the results of having \na good afterschool program. But here we are unable to debate it, \nbefuddling the American public. For the life of me, it is hard to \nexplain why when we have an education bill before the U.S. Senate, we \ncannot even bring up an amendment and discuss and debate and vote on an \namendment. An amendment that would simply offer an idea and a plan on \nhow we might alleviate this growing concern among Americans about what \nhappens to their children after school hours when they are not at home, \nwhen parents cannot provide for their needs and are concerned about the \ntrouble they can get into, the difficulties they can encounter. That \nought not be a great leap of logic to expect us to be able to discuss \nin this context of an education bill that the majority has brought up.\n  Americans would like to see us address the issue of the condition of \nour classrooms, our school buildings. This morning, I met with some of \nour mayors down from the State of Connecticut. One of the issues raised \nby one of those mayors is that the school buildings in his town are \nmore than 40 or 50 years old. They need new buildings. Now, they are \nwilling to participate in the cost of that. But they would like to see \nsome of the dollars they send to Washington come back to help improve \nthe quality of these classrooms and these buildings. I do not think \nthat ought to be too difficult. If the majority doesn't agree with \nthat, doesn't think that is a priority, vote against the amendment, but \ndo not deprive us of raising it, debating it and voting on it. That is \nnot too much to ask.\n\n  Again, I commend the majority. They have said this is an important \nissue; education is critical. We are bringing up the education bill. \nHow ironic that having brought up this bill, they now deprive us from \nraising three or four amendments that we think would contribute to the \nwell-being of the educational system of this country. We cannot even \ndiscuss, debate, and vote on them.\n  I had hoped that we could do better on one of the first actions of \nthis Congress, having gone through the difficulty of this impeachment \nproceeding, and get back to the issues that affect the American public. \nWe took an awful lot of time on the issue of impeachment. Now, the \npublic, our constituents, would like to see us spend some time on their \nissues, the things they worry about every day. When you bring up an \neducation bill and then deprive us of the right to debate, discuss, and \nvote on critical issues that they think are important, they wonder what \nwe are doing, what our agenda is--a Rubik's Cube of parliamentary \nmaneuvering or actually addressing these underlying and critical \nquestions that the American people care about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield whatever time is remaining----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, until someone shows \nup on the other side, that Senator Bingaman be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you very much. I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Nevada for yielding me some time.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the sentiments that were just expressed \nby the Senator from Connecticut about his frustration about not being \nable to vote on some of the crucial issues that relate to education in \nthis country.\n  I wanted to particularly draw attention to this issue of the Dropout \nPrevention Act that I offered last week, along with my colleague from \nNevada, Senator Reid. This is legislation which is not new to the U.S. \nSenate. It is legislation that passed in the last year. There were 74 \nvotes in favor of this Dropout Prevention Act. What we are trying to do \nnow is get this same legislation, identical legislation considered as \npart of this Ed-Flex package of legislation. We think that will be good \nfor the American people. We think it would advance the handling of this \nvery important issue. Otherwise, we will be put off for perhaps a year, \nperhaps 18 months into the new year. I believe very strongly that we \nought to go ahead and deal with this.\n  In my State, when I go around my State and say what is the No. 1 \nconcern that people have about education----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico will suspend his \nremarks. The time has expired on the minority side. By unanimous \nconsent, it was extended until someone came to the majority side. The \nChair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am sorry to interrupt, but it is our \ntime.\n  Today marks the fifth day of discussion by the Senate on the \nEducation Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. We have spent time \ndiscussing several education issues that are important to debate, but \ndo not necessarily pertain to the underlying bill.\n  The Education Flexibility Partnership Act, which has overwhelming \nsupport on both sides of the aisle--all the Governors in the Nation; \nthe President supports it; everybody supports it--what is it? The \nSecretary of Education gives a State some authority to determine \nwhether some schools may be granted waivers pertaining to certain \nrequirements for the purpose of enhancing services to students through \nflexibility and real accountability.\n\n  It is important to note that States cannot waive any requirements \npertaining to health and safety, civil rights, maintenance of effort, \ncomparability of service, equitable participation of students and \nprofessional staff in private schools, parental participation and \ninvolvement, and the distribution of funds to State or local agencies.\n  Currently, 12 States have ed flexibility authority. Through Ed-Flex, \nthese 12 States have been better able to coordinate programs which \ncreate a seamless education delivery system that benefits both teachers \nand students.\n  During the first day of debate, I offered a managers' package which \ncontained various accountability provisions which we worked out through \na bipartisan agreement. Those provisions and additional accountability \nprovisions which were added last Thursday\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\nwill improve school and student performance, which should be the \nmission of every education initiative. I will remind my colleagues that \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act is up for review this year. \nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the foundation for most \nof the Federal programs that assist students and teachers in our \nelementary and secondary schools, and it accounts for $15 billion in \nFederal spending, excluding IDEA--that is, special ed money and \nvocational education.\n  We are currently engaged in the hearing process. One of the first \nhearings we held regarding this legislation looked at various education \nproposals offered by Members of this body. I look forward to working \nwith all of my colleagues as we draft the first Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of the 21st century. We only do that once every \n5 years. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the most \nimportant education legislation we will consider this year. There are a \nnumber of good ideas being discussed which deserve a thorough review. \nThat is what these amendments are about. They deserve a thorough review \nbefore we leap off prematurely, ahead of the committee process, to put \nthe President's programs, which have not been reviewed, in place \nwithout thorough hearing and understanding.\n  It is for this reason that we should not be debating many of the \namendments that have arisen in the Ed-Flex debate. We should be \ndebating these proposals in conjunction with the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. Last year, as I pointed out earlier, we passed \n10 education bills, all out of the committee, by either unanimous or \nclose to unanimous votes, because we worked in committee to work the \nmatters out, like we should, and not to do it on the floor before any \nhearing.\n  I urge my colleagues not to short circuit the process of offering \nmajor elementary and secondary education initiatives on Ed-Flex. The \nEducation Flexibility Partnership Act is not designed to be the sole \nresponse by the Federal Government to improving school and student \nperformance. However, Ed-Flex does give States the ability to augment \neducation services for students and teachers.\n  I also point out that the amendment that I have is perfectly \nconsistent with this policy. What it says is, okay, we appropriated \nlast year $1.2 billion for a program--and this was decided in the back \nhalls of the Capitol somewhere; I was not present--that we should take \nthe President's 100,000 teachers, put the first year in effect. We are \nsaying, wait a minute, we haven't had any review of that, but we will \ndo this. We will let the local governments for this year decide whether \nthey would prefer to have it, not knowing what is going to happen in \nthe future, until we work it out in the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  We would like to give them the flexibility at the local level to \ndetermine as to whether or not they would prefer this year to use that \nmoney to augment their special education funds or whether they want to \nstart off on a course, which may not be followed, to start hiring new \nteachers. I point out, there are a lot of questions about a bill which \ngets you on the route to new teachers. If you have 100,000 new \nteachers, you need 100,000 new rooms. If you have 100,000 new teachers \nand you do not know where the funds are going to come from in the \nfuture, how are you going to pay for it? These are all important \nquestions to be answered when that bill gets into final shape, if it \ndoes get into final shape.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can make progress. I urge my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, we are at a point where we can either vote \nthis out and get on with other business or we can just spend the rest \nof the year in this kind of a debate and inability to act together.\n  I am proud of our committee. We have worked so many things out in a \nbipartisan manner. And to think that we could get stalled and find \nourselves without the ability to pass a simple bill which merely gives \nflexibility to the States--I do not understand how we could go forward \nwith that kind of process. We have important bills coming up. We have \nhealth care bills, we have all sorts of bills out of my committee, \nextremely important bills, and we are getting off to a rough start here \nby the inflexibility of the minority.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator would yield for a brief question.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to also have the Senator yield \nto me for a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Just briefly I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the courtesy.\n  One of the difficulties we have is being able to offer amendments. \nAnd the Senator seemed to suggest at some other point education issues \nwill be brought to the floor with an open opportunity for people to \noffer a series of ideas and amendments. Is the Senator speaking for the \nmajority leader on that? Because we have had great difficulty in \nobtaining that status on the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. So far I have had no problem with the majority leader, \nand I do not expect we will. This committee had worked together very \nwell last year, and I expect we will this year.\n  I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  The underlying bill is the Ed-Flex bill, which is a bill that I and \nSenator Wyden introduced in a bipartisan way, supported by all 50 \nGovernors, a straightforward bill which strips away Washington redtape, \nwhich empowers our teachers to teach instead of filling out paperwork. \nSeven percent of the Federal money is coming down with over 50 percent \nof the Government regulations there. Strip it away so that they can \nreally teach, accomplish the objectives we set out for them, meet the \nstandards of accountability, and we will be able to innovate, offer \nsome creativity.\n  This bill all of a sudden has taken off, and we are having \ninnumerable amendments placed on it, and most of them are huge new \nprograms, new spending, all of which has an appropriate forum to be \naddressed. I just hope, for the American people, that we are not in a \ngridlock here. The fact that we are going to be voting on cloture in \nabout 2 or 3 minutes demonstrates there is gridlock here. Let's help \nour American children, let's help the American people, by passing this \nbill, voting on it, Ed-Flex, not all these new spending programs.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes are remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, the chairman of the \ncommittee and Senator Frist, who is the author of this bill, in stating \nthat I find it really disheartening that the Members on the other side \nhave decided to use this bill, which was bipartisanly supported, was \nsupported by the President, in order to make political points, not \nsubstantive points.\n  The amendments which the other side is offering on this bill are not \nappropriate to this bill. They basically represent amendments which \naccomplish obfuscation and delay of what is a very good bill. The \nunderlying bill will give local communities flexibility in how they \ndeal with Federal regulations.\n  I understand that that is anathema to some people on the other side \nof the aisle. I understand that some people on the other side of the \naisle would like to have the ability to regulate and control and direct \nand have the input into how the day-to-day education should occur in \nour school systems. That happens to be their philosophy. They want to \ncentralize decisions here in Washington. We want to take decisions and \ngive them back to communities.\n  Their reason for opposing this bill, by throwing out all these \namendments, isn't that they actually think these amendments are \nsubstantively going to go anywhere. It is because they want to make a \npolitical statement, and because they want to slow down a bill which is \na good idea and which releases the local school districts from the huge \nweight of Federal regulation. It really is unjustified. It contradicts \nthe purposes which the President has already subscribed to in saying \nthat he supported this bill.\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\n  So when the American public asks the questions, ``Why don't we have \nmore flexibility at the local level? Why do we get stuck with all these \nFederal regulations?'' the answer is very simple. Look to the \nDemocratic membership of this Congress. They are the ones who are \nslowing up a bill which would give the communities flexibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the chairman of the committee, the \nmanager of the bill, yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Before the Senate conducts the cloture vote and then \nadjourns for the day, it is my intention to file another cloture motion \nwith respect to amendment No. 37, as modified, the Lott IDEA, special \neducation/choice amendment.\n  I still hold out hope that during the session tomorrow Senators will \nbe able to agree to a small, limited number of amendments remaining to \nthe pending education flexibility bill and that our Democratic \ncolleagues will then allow the Senate to conduct a passage vote on this \nvery important bill, which has broad support, which would give the rest \nof the country, along with 12 other States, this flexibility to allow \nthe paperwork, bureaucracy, to be waived so we could get the education \nmoney to the schools, to the children, where it really belongs. I hate \nto see this delay taking place on this broad bipartisan bill. In the \nevent that such an agreement cannot be reached, I feel the need to file \nanother cloture motion.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on amendment No. 37 to Calendar No. 12, S. 280, the \nEducation Flexibility Partnership Bill:\n         Trent Lott, Judd Gregg, Sam Brownback, Jeff Sessions, \n           Paul Coverdell, Bill Frist, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Chuck \n           Hagel, James M.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \ncloture vote, if necessary, will occur on Thursday of this week.\n\n\n                            Call of the Roll\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under \nrule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I belief, Mr. President, we are ready for the vote.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nRule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on amendment No. 31 to Calendar No. 12, S. 280, the \neducation flexibility partnership bill:\n         Trent Lott, Jim Jeffords, John H.
