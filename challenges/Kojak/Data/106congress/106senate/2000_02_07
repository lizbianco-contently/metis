Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking \nabout two very important issues, one of which will come before the \nSenate later on this year, and that is the trade agreement with China \nwhich has just been negotiated. We call that permanent normal trading \nrelations. The other subject is the WTO, which is an ongoing situation \non which we probably will not take any action--at least negative \naction--this year, but it is something we always have to consider \nbecause every day and every hour there are certain decisions and \ndiscussions going on at the World Trade Organization that affect the \nU.S. economy.\n  On China and the permanent trade relations vote we are going to have, \nit is very important that we do this right and do it soon but not do it \nbefore we have all the information we need. It is also important to get \nChina into the World Trade Organization.\n  We do not vote on China going into the World Trade Organization as a \nSenate, but it seems to me it is very necessary that we establish China \nwith permanent normal trading relations with the United States in order \nto set the stage for China to be in the WTO.\n  This is the first time China has agreed to submit itself to \ninternational trade disciplines. That, in and of itself, is a very \nhistoric and important development. Clearly, China acts in its own \nnational interest and, of course, the United States should act in its \nown national interest. That is why I say it is most important to our \nnational interest to agree to rules by which we can conduct more open \ncommerce with China. Common sense dictates that it is a win-win \nsituation for the United States since we have few restrictions on \nimports of China's products into the United States. Basically, it is a \nno-brainer, as far as I am concerned, to accept their lowering barriers \nto our exports to that 1-billion-people Nation.\n\n  As far as the issue of human rights and national security--and they \nalways come up when we discuss this issue with China--I believe the \nUnited States\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\nis big enough, the United States is strong enough, we are sophisticated \nenough, and we are smart enough to serve more than one vital national \ninterest at the same time.\n  In other words, we can be concerned about human rights, we obviously \nhave to be concerned about our national security because no other \nnation will be, but we can also be concerned about our commerce with \nother countries, particularly the biggest country in the world, a \ncountry that has reduced, through this agreement, barriers for our \ngoods to go to their country; in other words, setting the stage for a \nmore level playing field because we already let a lot of Chinese goods \ninto this country. There are very few restrictions.\n  We can take our commerce into mind, we can take human rights and \nnational security into mind, and we do not have to compromise. We can \nand must have a national security policy that protects our vital \nsecurity interests. When there is a breakdown that threatens our \nsecurity, we must and will fix it. We can and must speak out for the \noppressed who cannot speak for themselves, and we can and must advance \nour interests in open markets and trade liberalization.\n  We can and must do all these things at the same time. We can do this \nbecause trade, in and of itself, has so many different dimensions. \nThrough trade, we export more than goods. We export more than \nmanufactured products and services. When we have people-to-people \nrelations that come about through commerce, we export part of our \nvalues, part of what makes America great: our American values. We also \nexport, it seems, part of our society. That is why we must engage China \ncommercially.\n\n  While I would like to see the Senate vote to approve permanent \ntrading relations for China as soon as possible, the timing of this \nvote is not entirely in the Senate's hands.\n  First, China has to complete its remaining bilateral negotiations, \nespecially with the European Union. The European Union may conclude a \nbilateral deal with China later this month. But some tough issues still \nremain between those two giants. So it is not clear when these \nbilateral talks will end.\n  If China finishes its negotiations with the European Union, China \nstill has to conclude negotiations with 10 other trading partners, as \nwell as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n  Second, we have to complete work on the protocols that provide the \nunderpinnings for the United States-China agreement that was signed \nlast November and which is the basis for permanent normal trading \nrelations between the United States and China. Several challenging \nprotocol issues remain to be resolved.\n  In my view, we can only have the permanent normal trading relations \nvote after all these steps in the process are completed. Senators, \nincluding this Senator, of course, will want to carefully review--in \nfact we have the responsibility to make sure we carefully review--the \nresults of the protocol working party, which may be held in March, and \ncarefully look at all the details before we schedule the permanent \nnormal trading relations vote.\n  As far as the Senate action on normal trading relations is concerned, \nI expect that every aspect of the agreement be transparent. That means \neverything besides the protocols--meaning the written protocols, \nincluding side letters, oral or even wink-of-the-eye understandings--\nmust be put on the table before the Senate so that each of the 100 \nSenators are aware of them. That is what I mean when I say \ntransparency.\n  As Senators, we cannot make the same mistake we made with the \nCanadian Free Trade Agreement, of being oblivious to the side letter, \nthe agreement contents of which have been unfair to our wheat farmers \never since. Senators never knew about that until about 5 or 6 years \nafter the Canadian Free Trade Agreement was voted on by the Senate. \nThat is why, when it comes to normal trading relations with China--and \nit is very important we approve that agreement--everything has to be on \nthe table.\n  On the issue of the World Trade Organization, the most shocking thing \nthat happened in Seattle--apart from the riots and the mindless \ndestruction--was that there was no consensus to move forward. No agenda \nwas agreed to. This lack of consensus is especially shocking when you \nconsider how much trade has helped bring unprecedented prosperity not \nonly to the United States but around the world.\n  In 1947, when this all started with the first round of multilateral \ntrade negotiations--that was called the Geneva Round--the total world \nvalue of trade was only $50 billion. Today, it is $7 trillion. It is \nhard to think of a moment in history when such prosperity has been \ngenerated in such a short period of time.\n  But despite this huge increase in our collective wealth, the world's \ntrade ministers in Seattle could not reach agreement over how to keep \nthis great economic engine going and create even more prosperity that \nwill naturally result not just to the United States but to everybody in \nthe world through freer trade. It does not take a rocket scientist to \nunderstand how much greater our national wealth is because of freer \ntrade. Common sense dictates that we should continue down this path.\n\n  The mandated negotiations on agriculture and services, the so-called \nbuilding agenda, are now underway in Geneva. We may even have a special \nagricultural negotiation process to continue the agricultural portions \nof the talks. But I do not think we will see any quick agreement on the \nitems that were left on the table in Seattle or even on the question of \nwhether to restart the negotiations on drafting a ministerial \ndeclaration.\n  Instead, I think we will see, in Geneva, a period of quiet \nconsultation and consensus building. Considering the disaster that took \nplace in Seattle, maybe it is easy to conclude that we do need a period \nof quiet consultation, and particularly consensus building, because \nnothing happens in the WTO except by consensus. So if everybody worries \nabout America's interests being compromised at the WTO, just remember, \nit is done by consensus. If the United States does not agree to it, it \nwill not get done.\n  Seattle, of course, was a huge shock to the World Trade Organization \nand the process. We must try to restore mutual confidence among all the \nparties. The negotiators will need some time, perhaps even a few \nmonths, to refine their positions after the start of consultations.\n  In summary, I see the next few weeks and months in Geneva as a period \nwhere we try to restore faith in the World Trade Organization and in \neach other and try to rebuild the groundwork for the process of \nestablishing a consensus on trade. Progress may be incremental, but I \nbelieve we can achieve it.\n  When it comes right down to it, rebuilding this confidence is not \njust a job for the WTO or just for our negotiators; it is a challenge \nwe will have to address in the Senate, particularly in the Finance \nCommittee and in my trade subcommittee.\n  How can we get there? I believe there is one way. We must make a \nmoral case for free trade. We must do a better job of making the case \nthat free trade has helped us keep the peace, that free trade has \nbrought freedom and prosperity to millions, that it has helped families \nand nations attain new levels of economic progress. I believe it is up \nto Congress to help make the moral case for free trade. The future of \nour international trading system may depend upon how well we do it. I \nintend to address this topic of the moral case for free trade many \ntimes this year. It may be one of the most important things we do this \nyear in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I notice there are no other Members who have come to \nspeak, so I ask unanimous consent to continue on my time in morning \nbusiness to address another issue. I ask unanimous consent for 15 \nminutes at the most.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ndiscuss the recent farmer assistance package outlined in the \nPresident's budget proposal. It is often the case that these proposals \nare complicated and difficult\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\nto explain. But this proposal can actually be explained with one word. \nThat word is ``awful.'' The administration's proposal is simply an \nawful idea.\n  I am not one to usually criticize anybody who brings ideas to the \ntable that in any way will assist American farmers, but in this \ninstance I believe I must call it what it really is--an awful proposal. \nIn fact, I am embarrassed by the administration's proposals. I can \nthink of all the Democratic Senators who have been on this floor over \nthe last year--the last 12 months--who have chastised Republicans for \nnot doing enough to help farmers, and doing it in the right way, being \nembarrassed by the paltry sum of money the President has included and, \nmore importantly, the complicated formula by which they arrive at this \nassistance.\n  Just recently, we had the Vice President in Iowa stumping for \npolitical support in the famous Iowa caucuses. He told my fellow \nfarmers he supports a ``sound, sensible farm policy.'' Those are his \nwords. If this is what the administration means by ``sensible,'' they \nshould have saved the effort put into this meaningless gesture and left \nit to individuals who actually know what is going on in rural Iowa and \nrural America.\n  While our Nation has enjoyed one of the longest periods of economic \ngrowth in our history, the agricultural industry has not fared as well \nin recent years. Just last year, prices of all kinds of livestock and \ngrain commodities were at their lowest levels since the 1970s, and the \noutlook for next year is mixed at best. According to the Food and \nAgricultural Policy Research Institute located at Iowa State \nUniversity, prices for corn are expected to hover around $2 a bushel \nthis year and soybean prices will average near $4.50 a bushel. Prices \nhave improved somewhat from last year but not significantly, and \nobviously it is still, at these prices, a losing proposition; in other \nwords, a nonprofitable situation for farmers.\n  Last year, we in the Congress provided $8.7 billion in economic \nrelief and disaster payments, simply keeping our promise we made to the \nfarmers of America under the 1996 farm program of having an adequate \nsafety net for farmers. We were just keeping our promise with that $8.7 \nbillion. That was divided into three or four different parts. The \nlargest part was the Market Loss Assistance Program payments, and these \nalone were $5.5 billion.\n  The administration's proposal is for $600 million compared to that \n$5.5 billion. It obviously believes that payments to farmers under the \nsupplemental income assistance program will satisfy rural America's \nneeds in this year of continuing low prices. The proposal definitely \nshows me and should show every farmer that the administration does not \nreally care what happens to the family farmer. I could speak for hours \nabout its shortcomings, but let me try to boil it down to three major \npoints. Democratic Senators, speaking on the floor of this body last \nweek, condemned this same proposal. I say this so people won't consider \nthis a partisan shot. I associate myself with the remarks of some of \nthose Senators who considered this to be a paltry and complicated \napproach to helping farmers and the Congress keep its promise to the \nAmerican farmers made under the 1996 bill, that we would maintain a \nsafety net for our farmers.\n  On the administration's approach, first, it attempts to establish a \ncountercyclical program. The proposal seemingly is based on a system \nthat pays out when the per acre national gross revenue for a crop falls \nbelow a set percentage of the 5-year average of the crop's per acre \nnational gross revenue. The significant shortcoming of the \nadministration proposal is that a program based on national revenue \nwill not capture all regional disasters.\n  As an example from my own State of Iowa, everybody remembers the 500-\nyear flood of 1993. It was a disastrous year for the vast majority of \nmy State. Experts described this 500-year flood as something that is \nnever going to occur again. But production throughout the rest of the \nNation during the time that it was ruined in Iowa was strong enough \nthat, under the President's proposal, no payment would have been made \nto Iowans in need of assistance. Iowans would have been left with \nabsolutely no assistance in the midst of one of the worst natural \ndisasters in decades.\n  I also draw awareness to the administration's belief that this grand \nplan assists small- and medium-sized producers. It does harm to these \nclasses of farmers who, particularly, the other side of the aisle \nthinks we ought to have so much concern for--and we ought to have. The \nfact that their administration doesn't give concern to the small- or \nmedium-sized farmer in their plan ought to be an embarrassment to my \nDemocrat colleagues.\n\n  Well, if the payment was actually triggered and the farmer wasn't \ndrawing more than a $30,000 Agricultural Market Transition payment, the \nindividual would be subject to the $30,000 combined payment cap. This \nmeans that the sum of regular AMTA payments plus the payments under the \nsupplemental income assistance program could not exceed $30,000. In my \nopinion, this program actually hurts the small farmer and mortally \nwounds the medium-sized farmer. If we want to guarantee the failure of \nthe medium-sized farmer in the Nation, the farmer who is big enough \nthat he doesn't have time to have nonfarm income but not big enough to \nweather all the natural disasters that one can have or 3 years of low \nprices, the President's program is the best way to accomplish the \nfailure of the medium-sized farmer in our Nation.\n  It is simple math that brings me to this point. A farmer with a corn \nbase of 600 acres would receive an AMTA payment of approximately \n$19,800 this year. But if the market crashed and he qualified for the \nmaximum amount of assistance under the administration's proposal, he \nwould only receive an additional $10,200. Regardless of how much money \na farmer has lost, the most he could hope to receive is $10,200.\n  In comparison, the same farmer would have received $19,000 in \neconomic assistance last year due to the Market Loss Assistance payment \nCongress voted late last year. The administration's approach is $9,600 \nless for that farmer than he could have received under Congress' \napproach last year. If we were to revisit historic lows this summer, \nwhich could trigger the SIAP-type payment that the President is \nproposing, the small- and medium-sized producers could not receive more \nthan that $30,000 cap. Due to this cap, the administration's approach \nultimately limits potential assistance to small- and medium-sized \nproducers.\n  Some people might think I am comparing apples and oranges when I talk \nabout the two packages, but in the end, the important factor is how \nmuch aid are we willing to provide to the farmer. The administration \nhas said that assistance wouldn't be paid to the largest producers. But \nat the end of the day, it is not just the larger growers who will be \nleft out in the cold, it is going to be pretty darn cold for everyone \nin the middle and chilly for the smaller producers as well.\n  This proposal reminds me of what a number of Iowa pork producers \ncalled the ``4-H'' payments. Remember SHOP 1 and SHOP 2 payments to the \npork producers last year? Those payments didn't amount to much either. \nThe administration billed that as a significant measure to help pork \nproducers facing abysmal prices, a 60-year low in hog prices last year. \nYet today the number of pork producers has dropped by 3,000, since we \nexperienced these historic lows.\n  Ultimately, the largest producers will still have $40,000 due to the \nAMTA cap, and the smaller guys will have a $30,000 cap, a $10,000 bonus \nto the larger farmer the President says he does not want to help, \ncompared to what the small- and medium-sized farmer gets. Does it \nreally matter what the assistance is called? Was that the \nadministration's goal, of hurting the smaller and medium-sized farmers?\n  My final point is this: Who is the administration really then trying \nto help? It is true that farmers with 450 acres or less in corn base \ncould possibly double their AMTA payment. That is the same approach \nCongress used last year under the administration's proposal. In fact, \nthis is probably a great deal for all those producers with 100 acres or \nless. But the fact is that a person who is farming 450 acres or less is \nprobably, to make ends meet, also engaged in some occupation other than \nfarming.\n\n  I am not saying that most farmers don't have jobs off the farm. In \ntoday's\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\neconomy, more and more farmers are taking jobs off the farm just to \nhelp pay the bills. But as I see it, the medium-sized producer, the \nproducers with 500 to 1,000 acres, are almost entirely dependent upon \nthe profitability of their crops. If they don't receive much-needed \nassistance, they are probably going to have a hard time staying on the \nfarm, and the administration's proposal does almost nothing to help \nthese individuals.\n  Now, as I indicated earlier, this is by no means a complete list of \nall the problems with the administration's approach, but these are a \nfew of the issues that I expect Congress will have to consider. The \nfact is that if the administration really wants to help farmers, it \nwill immediately announce it will block any efforts to waive the Clean \nAir Act's oxygenated requirements by the Environmental Protection \nAgency. If the President would do just this, ethanol can replace MTBE, \nwhich is poisoning the ground water now, and it would increase farm \nincome by $1 billion per year--it would do it from the marketplace, not \nfrom the Federal Treasury--and create 13,000 new jobs in America in the \nprocess.\n  The Senate may not be able to unilaterally agree upon exactly what \nshould be done to assist family farmers this year, but I think we can \nprobably agree that the administration's proposal is off base and, most \nfrankly, out of touch with real America. It does not accomplish the \ngoals that they want to accomplish of saving the small and medium-sized \nfarmers and not helping the well-off farmer.\n  So I look forward to working with my constituents, various \nagricultural groups, commodity groups, and my colleagues in Congress to \ngive family farmers the economic security that they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I have made a commitment that I would \ncome to the floor every day to speak about the Capitol Hill police but \nalso about the public. Again, I want to repeat what I have said the \nlast couple of days. As did many of my colleagues, I went to the \nservice for officers Chestnut and Gibson. It was an unbelievably \nhorrible and painful time--first of all, for their families. I do \nbelieve, at that time and since then, we made a commitment for our \npolice officers, and for that matter for the public, that we would do \neverything we possibly could--albeit nothing is 100-percent effective--\nto make sure such a tragedy would never happen again.\n  I have come to the floor several times to point out that at too many \nposts, or at least at some times at some of our posts, we only have one \nofficer. When you have lots of people coming in and you have one \nofficer, if, God forbid, you have somebody who is deranged, that \nofficer is in real peril and so is the public.\n  I know we have made the commitment over and over again to have two \nofficers at every post. I am not pretending to be the expert as to all \nthe budgets, where the money has been spent, but I know this: We can do \nbetter by the Capitol Hill police officers, and we should. We can do \nbetter by the public. Whatever it takes, we need to honor our \ncommitment and we need to make sure we have the necessary resources so \nwe have two officers at these posts.\n  There are many other issues. I am not going to get involved in these \nother issues because I am not the expert. I know what I have observed. \nI know the police officers with whom I have talked.

Mr. President, in this coming session--which is going to \nbe relatively short, as it always is on election years, but \nparticularly this year--we have to focus if we intend to accomplish \nthings. I hope we do. As is often the case in election years, there are \ntimes when people are more interested in creating the issue than they \nare in resolving the issue. I think we will see a considerable amount \nof that, of course, going out towards the Presidential election and \ntrying to find the issues the party will be for--which is all part of \nthe system. But I am hopeful we can concentrate and focus on the issues \nthat we think are most important.\n  We have had some experience, unfortunately in the last several weeks, \nand certainly even last year, that quite often the minority chose to \nbring up issues they knew would not be resolved but brought them up \ncontinuously to diffuse the issues on which we have been working. In \nthis body, that is easy. One person very readily can hold up things, \nunless we can get 60 votes to do something different.\n  In any event, I am hopeful that will not be the case. We are going to \nfocus on some things that we have decided upon. This will be more \nrefined as time goes on, but certainly education will be one. The issue \nof education, of course, is not whether we try to improve it, but how \nwe fund those improvements. I do not believe that we should have one-\nsize-fits-all regulations that come from some bureaucracy in \nWashington. We should distribute our education funding in a manner that \nallows the States and local school boards to make those decisions.\n  Certainly the needs in Pinedale, WY, are going to be different than \nin Philadelphia. That is as it should be. We need to allow for this \ntype of flexibility.\n  Another area that we will be focusing on is health care. We did some \nwork last year on strengthening Medicare, doing something particularly \nin rural areas so outpatient care can be better financed. We intend to \ncontinue to do that, at the same time doing whatever is necessary to \nensure Medicare continues to provide the benefits it is designed to \nprovide.\n  Certainly one of the issues that will be difficult and controversial, \nyet I think most people want to do something about, is providing the \nopportunity for everyone to have pharmaceuticals available if they \ncannot afford them; hopefully to protect the programs we have now, to \nencourage and in fact assist people who now get their own \nsupplementals, but be able to help those people who are not able to do \nthat.\n  Social Security will continue to be an area of great concern. We have \nmade some progress in not spending Social Security money in the \noperational budget. However, that is not all that is necessary. If the \nyoung people who will start making Social Security payments at their \nfirst job can expect some benefits 30, 40, 50 years from now, then \nthings will have to be done differently. Obviously, we have \nalternatives. We can increase taxes--but not many people are for that. \nSocial Security payments are one of the highest taxes\n\n[[Page S349]]\n\nmany people pay in the United States. We could reduce benefits--again, \nthere is not much support for that. Or we could, indeed, increase the \nreturn on the money that is in a trust. We think that is an excellent \nidea, to provide individual accounts so at least a portion of the money \nthat is in the fund would belong to you and belong to me. I suspect \npeople over 50 or so would not see any difference, but younger people \nwould have an account that would be theirs and, indeed, could be \ninvested in equities for a much better return.\n  So, along with reducing the debt, those are some of the things, with \nwhich we will be involved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S349-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S349-S355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN CONTROL\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, unfortunately, one of the issues that \ncontinues to show up and seems to have nine lives--or more than nine, \nis the matter of gun control. We have seen it every session a number of \ntimes. I am sure we will see it again. I think it is something about \nwhich we ought to talk. I believe most people have come to the \nconclusion that the passage of additional laws is not going to make a \ngreat deal of difference in the behavior of criminals. Sadly, law \nabiding citizens who are exercising their constitutional rights are the \nones who will be impacted by additional gun control laws. But it would \nnot affect those who do not intend to abide by the law. Therefore, the \nidea of additional laws certainly is questionable.\n  In my mind, it is not the direction we ought to take. Fortunately, I \nthink the majority of people in this country also believed the passage \nof new laws is not the solution. We need to enforce the numerous gun \nlaws that are on the books.\n  Thankfully for our country, the President has not been able to carry \nout his continuing agenda of wanting more and more gun laws. But, \nregrettably, he has not been able to make enforcement more effective. \nMore laws are not going to keep those who are willing to break the law \nfrom doing things illegally. Stronger enforcement of existing laws is \nthe answer. The administration, however, has not presented such a \nprogram. Certainly, we need to move in that direction.\n  When tragedies occur, as they did in Colorado and a number of other \nplaces, of course all of us wonder what we can do to ensure that these \ntragedies do not happen again. The first impulse in a legislative body \nis to pass more laws.\n  Unfortunately, that is often the most political thing to do. But the \nfact of the matter is, in almost every instance numerous gun laws were \nbroken when these terrible acts were committed. One might say, what \nadvantage is there in passing more? Indeed, what we ought to be doing \nis talking about enforcement.\n  As many of you know, the administration has been busy developing new \ngun control initiatives and additional laws--everything from \nthreatening gun manufacturers with Federal lawsuits to mandatory \nlicensing of new handgun purchases. Currently, there are 26 \nmunicipalities that have filed lawsuits against the gun industry, and \nthey are shown on this chart. These lawsuits seek to make gun \nmanufacturers liable for the criminal misuse of firearms. Interestingly \nenough, three cases have been thrown out by judges in Cincinnati, OH, \nBridgeport, CT, and Miami-Dade County, FL.\n  These cases are interesting. For instance these judges noted:\n\n       . . . the City's complaint is an improper attempt to have \n     this Court substitute its judgment for that of the \n     legislature[.] Only the legislature has the power to engage \n     in the type of regulation. . . .\n\n  The city of Cincinnati.\n\n       The plaintiffs have no statutory of common law basis to \n     recoup their expenditures. . . .\n\n  The city of Bridgeport.\n\n       . . . the Plaintiffs have not directed this Court to any \n     statute or case that would allow a city or county to proceed \n     against a group of manufacturers. . . .\n\n  Miami-Dade County, FL.\n  The courts have pointed out municipal lawsuits are not the answer. \nInterestingly enough, the President has announced the Justice \nDepartment will pursue a similar lawsuit against the gun manufacturers \non behalf of HUD. Basically, the Federal Government is trying to \npressure gun manufacturers into settling their current cases.\n  Once again, the action highlights the President's failure to pass gun \ncontrol legislation. Instead of bringing forth legislation, he is \nseeking to go through the judiciary to do what he has been unable to \naccomplish in Congress.\n  This next graph shows the results of a poll taken recently by CNN and \nUSA Today. It was conducted between December 9 and 12 of last year. Let \nme read it:\n\n       As you may know, the U.S. Justice Department is considering \n     filing a lawsuit against the gun manufacture industry seeking \n     to recover the costs associated with gun-related crimes. The \n     companies that manufacture guns in the U.S. have stated the \n     charges have no merit. Which side do you agree with more in \n     this dispute: the Justice Department (or) the gun \n     manufacturers?\n\n  The result was, those who agreed with the lawsuit by Justice were 28 \npercent, and those who agreed the lawsuit had little merit were 67 \npercent. I really believe this poll reflects how American's feel about \na government lawsuit against the gun industry.\n  In the President's State of the Union address he spoke about the idea \nof having individual states regulate the sale of handguns by requiring \na photo ID and documentation of the successful completion of a safety \ncourse--just to purchase a handgun. This is clearly another attempt by \nthe President to tighten gun laws on law-abiding citizens. Of course, \ncriminals do not register their guns. Enforcement, however, is how we \nget guns out of the hands of the criminals. Republicans have continued \nto support law enforcement efforts.\n  Project Exile, for example, which has been put into place around the \ncountry, has dropped the murder rate in Richmond, Virginia by 30 \npercent each year that it has been in place.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton cannot say the same for his gun \ncontrol efforts. This is a graph of ATF gun referrals, prosecutions, \nand convictions in 1992 and 1998. Between 1992 and 1998 ATF referrals \nfor prosecution went down by 5,500 or 44 percent; prosecutions have \ndropped 40 percent; and, finally, convictions have dropped 31 percent.\n\n  This graph shows just how tough the administration has been since \n1992 regarding the enforcement of existing federal gun laws.\n  Last year, I asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct an \naudit of the National Instant Check System (NICS). The system was put \nin place in November 1998 as phase 2 of the Brady Act. I asked the GAO \nfor an audit to see if, indeed, it is operating as Congress intended it \nto. I am confident when the report is released--and it has not yet been \nreleased but will be very soon--we will have results that show the NICS \nhas not been as effective as we hoped it would be.\n  Lastly, since last November, there have been numerous news articles \nfrom around the country that highlight the publics disfavor with \nattempts by the President to add more gun control laws. I want to take \na minute to highlight a couple of these. One is titled, it is the \n``Wrong Approach,'' by the Cheyenne Tribune Eagle, which suggests:\n\n       Since the President has been unable to ban individuals from \n     owning guns, Mr. Clinton has decided to do an end run around \n     the Constitution.\n\n  That is the point of view of that particular paper.\n  Another is titled, ``Gun Deaths, Injuries on Decline.'' This article \nspeaks about a government study which shows that gun deaths have \ndeclined since the late 1960's.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print these articles in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Cheyenne Tribune Eagle, Dec. 16, 1999]\n\n      Wrong Approach--Federal Lawsuit Ignores Rights of Gun Makers\n\n       Once again, President Bill Clinton, our national \n     embarrassment, is showing utter contempt for our Constitution \n     as well as for the basic rights of the individual and the \n     concept of freedom.\n       Since he has been unable to ban individuals from owning \n     guns, Mr. Clinton has decided to do an end-run around the \n     Constitution by threatening to sue gun manufacturers. Mr. \n     Clinton is exactly the type of despotic leader the Framers \n     had in mind when they wrote the Second Amendment.\n       As Thomas Jefferson said, ``The strongest reason for the \n     people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a \n     last resort, to\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\n     protect themselves against tyranny in government.''\n       But Mr. Clinton and his elk, meaning the liberals in \n     Congress and all who would idly sit back and allow government \n     to infringe upon a right our framers declared ``shall not be \n     infringed,'' are guilty of abridging our freedoms, \n     endangering our lives and threatening the future of the very \n     government they were elected to preserve.\n       Mr. Clinton has failed to get Congress to completely ignore \n     the Constitution and ban guns so now he has decided to turn \n     to the courts to get his way.\n       He said his administration would sue the gun manufacturers, \n     much in the same fashion as the administration sued the \n     tobacco industry, in order to force the private companies to \n     bend to Mr. Clinton's will and his socialistic and erroneous \n     world view.\n       The president's dubious claim is that the industry's \n     marketing and manufacturing methods are responsible for \n     violent crime at the nation's 3,000 public-housing \n     authorities.\n       What Clinton fails to comprehend is that government is \n     mostly responsible for the conditions that breed violent \n     crime in public housing.\n       If Mr. Clinton wishes to end violence in public-housing \n     complexes, he should end public housing. It is a drain on \n     society and ultimately harms the individuals government \n     purports to help. Besides, government has no Constitutional \n     authority to offer public housing.\n       Another government action that leads to unnecessary \n     violence is its war on drugs. Prohibiting individuals the \n     freedom to pursue drug use is also not authorized by the \n     Constitution. The decriminalization of drugs would have the \n     end result of lessening the burden on our prison system and \n     dramatically reducing violence, much like the repeal of the \n     prohibition against alcohol.\n       Ultimately, however, the criminal is the one to blame for \n     his actions. Just because a person uses a gun while \n     committing a crime is no reason to blame gun manufacturers. \n     That is tantamount to blaming automakers for every car \n     accident or burger joints for every heart attack.\n       Mr. Clinton knows he can cripple the gun makers by suing \n     them. Just the cost of defending against a government lawsuit \n     can be cost prohibitive. In effect, it is government banning \n     guns by economically destroying the makers in what can only \n     be termed thuggery. Already 24 cities, including Cincinnati \n     and Cleveland, and two states have filed lawsuits against gun \n     makers.\n       Hearings are expected to begin in January. We will be \n     watching this one closely.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 19, 1999]\n\n  Gun Deaths, Injuries on Decline--1997 Fatalities Were Lowest Since \n                        '60s; Many Reasons Cited\n\n       Atlanta, Nov. 18.--Gun deaths in the United States dropped \n     21 percent between 1993 and 1997 to the lowest level in more \n     than 30 years, and firearm-related injuries fell 41 percent, \n     the government reported yesterday.\n       Experts cited such reasons as tougher gun control laws, a \n     booming economy, better police work and gun safety courses.\n       The study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     looked at all gunshot wounds reported at emergency rooms, \n     whether they were intentional, accidental or self-inflicted.\n       The number of fatalities dropped from 39,595--15.4 gun \n     deaths per 100,000 people--in 1993, to 32,436--12.1 per \n     100,000--in 1997.\n       The rate ``is the lowest it's been since the mid-'60s,'' \n     said J. Lee Annest, a CDC statistician. ``This progress is \n     really encouraging and really says that joint prevention \n     efforts of public health officials, legislators and law \n     enforcement should continue.''\n       The drop was not unexpected: Homicide rates in the 1990s \n     have fallen to levels not seen since the 1960s, and about \n     two-thirds of all homicides are committed with guns. But the \n     latest figures also include suicides and accidental deaths.\n       Moreover, nonfatal shootings fell from 104,390 to 64,207 in \n     the same period, or from 40.5 per 100,000 to 24.0.\n       Jim Manown, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, \n     said the numbers prove that more gun laws are not needed, \n     only that the laws on the books need to be enforced.\n       ``It is a fact that this substantial drop in gun violence \n     directly correlated to a big increase in gun enforcement by \n     police,'' said Lawrence W. Sherman, a University of \n     Pennsylvania professor who has studied gun policy. ``Police \n     were not treating guns in a preventive sense prior to 1993 \n     and now they are.''\n       Some experts also credit a strong economy that has helped \n     reduce overall crime rates and suicide attempts. Margaret A. \n     Zahn, a North Carolina State University criminology \n     professor, said prosperity has also allowed governments to \n     spend more on services that prevent gun violence, such as \n     domestic violence shelters and youth recreation programs.\n       The CDC also listed such possible factors as an aging \n     population, increased gun safety measures and the waning of \n     the crack trade.\n       Gun control advocates said they are encouraged, but pointed \n     out that even so, an average of 265 people a day were shot in \n     1997.\n       ``People shouldn't be satisfied,'' said Nancy Hwa, \n     spokeswoman for Handgun Control and the Center to Prevent \n     Handgun Violence. ``Everybody is still at risk, and the \n     presence of guns should still be a major concern.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 12, 2000]\n\n                 Don't Democrats Believe in Democracy?\n\n                          (By Robert B. Reich)\n\n       If I had my way there would be laws restricting cigarettes \n     and handguns. But Congress won't even pass halfway measures. \n     Cigarette companies have admitted they produce death sticks, \n     yet Congress won't lift a finger to stub them out. Teenage \n     boys continue to shoot up high schools, yet Congress won't \n     pass stricter gun controls. The politically potent cigarette \n     and gun industries have got what they wanted: no action. \n     Almost makes you lose faith in democracy, doesn't it?\n       Apparently that's exactly what's happened to the Clinton \n     administration. Fed up with trying to move legislation, the \n     White House is launching lawsuits to succeed where \n     legislation failed. The strategy may work, but at the cost of \n     making our frail democracy even weaker.\n       The Justice Department is going after the tobacco companies \n     with a law designed to fight mobsters--the 1970 Racketeer \n     Influenced and Corrupt Organizations chapter of the Organized \n     Crime Control Act. Justice alleges that the tobacco companies \n     violated RICO by conspiring to create an illegal enterprise. \n     They did this by agreeing to a ``concerted public-relations \n     campaign'' to deny any link between smoking and disease, \n     suppress internal research and engage in 116 ``racketeering \n     acts'' of mail and wire fraud, which included advertisements \n     and press releases the companies knew to be false.\n       A few weeks ago, the administration announced another large \n     lawsuit, this one against America's gun manufacturers, \n     Justice couldn't argue that the gun makers had conspired to \n     mislead the public about the danger of their products, so it \n     decided against using RICO in favor of offering ``legal \n     advice'' to public housing authorities organized under the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, who are suing \n     the gun makers on behalf of their three million tenants. The \n     basis of this case is strict liability and negligence. The \n     gun makers allegedly sold defective products, or products \n     they knew or should have known would harm people.\n       Both of these legal grounds--the mobster-like conspiracy of \n     cigarette manufacturers to mislead the public, and the \n     defective aspects of guns or the negligence of their \n     manufacturers--are stretches, to say the least. If any \n     agreement to mislead any segment of the public is a \n     ``conspiracy'' under RICO, then America's entire advertising \n     industry is in deep trouble, not to mention health-\n     maintenance organizations, the legal profession, automobile \n     dealers and the Pentagon. And if every product that might \n     result in death or serious injury is ``defective,'' you might \n     as well say good-bye to liquor and beer, fatty foods and \n     sharp cooking utensils.\n       These two novel legal theories give the administration \n     extraordinary discretion to decide who's misleading the \n     public and whose products are defective. You might approve \n     the outcomes in these two cases, but they establish \n     precedents for other cases you might find wildly unjust.\n       Worse, no judge will ever scrutinize these theories. The \n     administration has no intention of seeing these lawsuits \n     through to final verdicts. The goal of both efforts is to \n     threaten the industries with such large penalties that \n     they'll agree to a deal--for the cigarette makers, to pay a \n     large amount of money to the Federal Government, coupled \n     perhaps with a steep increase in the price of a pack of \n     cigarettes: and for the gun makers, to limit bulk purchases \n     and put more safety devices on guns. In announcing the \n     lawsuit against the gun makers HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo \n     assured the press that the whole effort was just a bargaining \n     ploy: ``If all parties act in good faith we'll stay at the \n     negotiating table.''\n       But the biggest problem is that these lawsuits are end runs \n     around the democratic process. We used to be a nation of \n     laws, but this new strategy presents novel means of \n     legislating--within settlement negotiations of large civil \n     lawsuits initiated by the executive branch. This is faux \n     legislation, which sacrifices democracy to the discretion of \n     administration officials operating in secrecy.\n       It's one thing for cities and states to go to court (big \n     tobacco has already agreed to pay the states $246 billion to \n     settle state Medicaid suits, and 28 cities along with New \n     York state and Connecticut are now suing the gun \n     manufacturers); it's quite another for the feds to bring to \n     bear the entire weight of the nation. New York state isn't \n     exactly a pushover, but its attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, \n     says the federal lawsuit will finally pressure gun makers to \n     settle. New York's lawsuit is a small dagger, he says. ``the \n     feds' is a meat ax.''\n       The feds' meat ax may be a good way to get an industry to \n     shape up, but it's a bad way to get democracy to shape up. \n     Yes, American politics is rotting. Special-interest money is \n     oozing over Capitol Hill. The makers of cigarettes and guns \n     have enormous clout in Washington, and they are bribing our \n     elected representatives to turn their backs on these \n     problems.\n       But the way to fix everything isn't to turn our backs on \n     the democratic process and pursue litigation; as the \n     administration is doing. It's to campaign for people who \n     promise to take action against cigarettes and guns, and \n     against the re-election of House and Senate members who \n     won't. And to fight like hell for campaign finance reform. In\n\n[[Page S351]]\n\n     short, the answer is to make democracy work better, not to \n     give up on it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 22, 1999]\n\n         Liberals Have Second Thoughts on the Second Amendment\n\n                           (By Collin Levey)\n\n       It's the year of Littleton, ``smart guns'' and city \n     lawsuits against gun makers. So where are the law professors \n     speaking up for gun control? In the past few years, many of \n     the premier constitutional experts of the left have come to a \n     shocking conclusion: The Second Amendment must be taken \n     seriously.\n       Back in 1989, the University of Tennessee's Sanford \n     Levinson became something of a maverick by writing an article \n     in the Yale Law Journal called ``The Embarrassing Second \n     Amendment,'' in which he maintained that the amendment \n     guaranteed an individual right to own guns. Mr. Levinson's \n     argument flew in the face of the interpretation that had \n     prevailed since a 1939 Supreme Court ruling, which held that \n     the amendment's reference to a ``well-regulated militia'' \n     meant it only guaranteed a ``collective'' right to bear arms.\n       Until recently, few legal scholars had done much research \n     on the Second Amendment. ``One came up knowing it was a \n     collective right--not because we learned about it in law \n     school, but because we read the occasional op-ed,'' says Dan \n     Polsby of Virginia's George Mason Law School. ``Sandy \n     Levinson made it respectable to think that heterodoxy might \n     be possible.''\n       The most prominent of the converts is Harvard's Laurence \n     Tribe, once touted as a potential Supreme Court appointee in \n     a Democratic administration. Mr. Tribe surprised many of his \n     fellow liberals when the latest edition of his widely used \n     textbook, ``American Constitutional Law,'' appeared this \n     year. Previous versions had virtually ignored the Second \n     Amendment. The new one gives it a full work-up--and comes \n     down on the side of Mr. Levinson.\n       Mr. Tribe believes the right to bear arms is limited, \n     subject to ``reasonable regulation in the interest of public \n     safety,'' as he and Yale Law Professor Akhil Reed Amar wrote \n     in the New York Times last month. But Mr. Tribe has written \n     that people on both sides of the policy divide face an \n     ``inescapable tension . . . between the reading of the Second \n     Amendment that would advance the policies they favor and the \n     reading of the Second Amendment to which intellectual \n     honesty, and their own theories of Constitutional \n     interpretation, would drive them.''\n       Journalist Daniel Lazare, a liberal gun-control advocate, \n     acknowledges the tension, writing in Harper's: ``The truth \n     about the Second Amendment is something that liberals cannot \n     bear to admit: The right wing is right.'' Mr. Lazare argues \n     for amending the Constitution to repeal the Second Amendment.\n       What accounts for the change in Second Amendment \n     interpretation? One of the catalysts has been a recently \n     unearthed series of clues to the Framers' intentions. These \n     include early drafts of the amendment penned by James Madison \n     in 1789. In his original version he made ``The right of the \n     people'' the first clause, indicating his belief that it is \n     the right of the people to keep and bear arms that makes a \n     well-regulated militia possible. State constitutions of the \n     era confirm this interpretation: Pennsylvania accorded its \n     citizens the ``right to bear arms for the defense of \n     themselves and the state.''\n       In a letter to English Whig John Cartwright, Thomas \n     Jefferson wrote that ``the constitutions of most of our \n     states assert, that all power is inherent in the people; . . \n     . that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed.'' \n     These cross-Atlantic discussions are important, since the \n     Framers were distinguishing the right of Americans to bear \n     arms from English law's treatment of the question. Joyce Lee \n     Malcolm, a professor at Bentley College, has examined the \n     Second Amendment in light of English law. She concludes that \n     the Colonists had intended to adopt basic ideas of English \n     governance but to strengthen the people's rights. A right to \n     ``keep and bear'' was seen as a bulwark against oppressive \n     government.\n       Other scholars have found supporting evidence in the 14th \n     Amendment, which bars states, in addition to the federal \n     government, from restricting certain rights of citizens. \n     According to Robert Cottrell of George Washington University, \n     in the aftermath of slavery, with no real police presence, \n     this protection was critical to preventing the monopoly of \n     guns from resting in the hands of white officials, many of \n     whom moonlighted in white hoods. The 14th Amendment has been \n     a powerful force in constitutional law, playing a key role in \n     the development of free-speech jurisprudence.\n       ``The emaciated condition of the Second Amendment now is \n     very similar to the condition of the First Amendment in \n     1908,'' says Duke University Law professor William Van \n     Alstyne. In the aftermath of World War I, Supreme Court \n     Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis began \n     writing dissents in favor of a broader reading of the First \n     Amendment. But not until the 1930s did courts begin adopting \n     their arguments.\n       The new reading of the Second Amendment may get a hearing \n     if a gun control case, Emerson v. Texas, makes it to the \n     Supreme Court. In a divorce proceeding, Timothy Joe Emerson \n     was issued what's been called a ``y'all be civil'' \n     restraining order--routine in Texas divorce cases. Unknown to \n     him, one provision barred him from possessing a gun. When he \n     took his 9mm Beretta out of a desk drawer during an argument \n     with his wife, he was charged with violation of a federal gun \n     control law.\n       U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings ruled that the order \n     violated Mr. Emerson's Second Amendment rights. As Mr. Polsby \n     puts it, ``If you're simply attaching a firearms forfeiture \n     to a person who has no such designation as a dangerous \n     person, that's not acceptable if the Second Amendment means \n     anything.''\n       The state of Texas has appealed to the Fifth U.S. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. If that court's ruling makes it to the \n     Supreme Court, it would be the first gun-control case heard \n     by the justices since 1939's U.S. v. Miller, which set the \n     precedent for the collective-right interpretation. In that \n     case, the Supreme Court held that a bootlegger was rightly \n     convicted of transporting a sawed-off shotgun across state \n     lines, on the grounds that the weapon had no legitimate use \n     in a militia.\n       Today, two Supreme Court justices have suggested interest \n     in a reading of the Second Amendment as guaranteeing an \n     individual right. Clarence Thomas has noted the law-review \n     articles piling up on the side of an expanded interpretation, \n     suggesting it may be time to reconsider Miller. And Antonin \n     Scalia, in a decision on an unrelated matter, referred to `` \n     `the people' protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the \n     First and Second Amendments.''\n       ``As a liberal and a humanist,'' Prof. Tribe says today, \n     ``people thought I was betraying them by saying that the \n     Second Amendment is part of the Constitution.'' But, he adds, \n     ``what is being knocked away now is a phony pillar and a \n     mirage.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 29, 1999]\n\nATF Firearms Prosecution Referrals Drop--Study Says Criminal Cases Have \n               Fallen Since 1992, But Picked Up Last Year\n\n                           (By Edward Walsh)\n\n       There has been a steady decline during the Clinton \n     administration in the number of weapons-related criminal \n     cases that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) \n     has turned over to federal prosecutors for legal action \n     according to a new study made public yesterday.\n       The study by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse \n     (TRAC) at Syracuse University, which analyzes law enforcement \n     data, said the number of ATF referrals to federal prosecutors \n     has dropped by 44 percent since 1992, when there were 9,885 \n     referrals. Last year, the agency charged with enforcing \n     federal firearms laws referred 5,510 cases to federal \n     prosecutors, according to TRAC. Most ATF referrals to federal \n     prosecutors involve alleged weapons offenses.\n       It also said that until last year there has been a matching \n     decline in the number of federal prosecutions of ATF weapons \n     cases, which fell from 4,108 in 1992 to 2,165 in 1997. But in \n     1998, that trend was reversed with the prosecution of 2,710 \n     ATF weapons cases, a 25 percent increase over the previous \n     year, the report said.\n       The TRAC researchers, who analyzed data from the Justice \n     Department, the Office of Personnel Management and ATF, said \n     one reason there may be fewer criminal referrals is that \n     ATF's work force is smaller now than it was earlier in the \n     decade. The agency's total force has declined by 8 percent \n     since 1992 and there has been an even sharper drop of 14 \n     percent in the number of its criminal investigators. ATF had \n     2,072 criminal investigators in 1992 and 1,779 last year, \n     according to the report.\n       The findings are likely to fuel the gun control debate in \n     Congress, where opponents, such as the National Rifle \n     Association, argue that there is no need for new gun control \n     laws and that the administration should concentrate on \n     enforcing existing laws.\n       Administration officials did not dispute the trend toward \n     fewer federal prosecutions, but said part of this was due to \n     a decision by ATF to concentrate more of its resources on \n     complex investigations of major gun traffickers and less on \n     individual firearms law violations.\n       A Justice Department spokeswoman, who declined to be \n     identified, also disputed the accuracy of some of the numbers \n     in the TRAC report. The report said that in 1998 there were \n     2,528 federal prosecutions under two frequently used federal \n     firearms laws, but Justice Department records show that 5,876 \n     defendants were prosecuted under those laws that year, she \n     said.\n       She said the number of federal firearms violators who have \n     received sentences of more than five years in prison has \n     increased by more than 25 percent since 1992, reflecting \n     ATF's decision to focus more on gun traffickers.\n       ``There is a decline in those [firearms] charges, but it is \n     not as dramatic as portrayed here, the spokeswoman said.\n       ``The number of low-end federal offenders is down because \n     the ATF is strapped for resources and made a conscious \n     decision to focus on traffickers and because the states are \n     doing a better job so we don't have to do those cases.''\n       An ATF spokeswoman, who also did not want her name used, \n     said the agency experienced a 20 percent reduction in field \n     agents between 1993 and 1997, losing some of its most \n     experienced agents to retirement. ATF is now aggressively \n     hiring agents, she said,\n\n[[Page S352]]\n\n     but it will take time to train them and get them in the \n     field.\n       The ATF spokeswoman also said that statistics on \n     prosecutions do not reflect all of the agency's activities, \n     which in the 1990s have included major investigations of the \n     bombings of the World Trade Center in New York and the \n     federal building in Oklahoma City.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I believe all of us want to find a better \nsolution to illegal gun use. We intend to do that. People in my State \nbelieve more laws are not the answer, that, indeed, the enforcement of \ngun laws is the answer. We are pleased to see that the administration \nhas finally added increased funding for the enforcement of existing gun \nlaws--something we have been talking about over the last 7 years. The \ndollars alone, however, will not do it. There has to be some oversight. \nWe have to make sure there is an effective use of law enforcement.\n  Mr. President, I yield time to my friend from Idaho.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the Senator from Wyoming controls the time. I \nwonder if, after the Senator from Idaho speaks for 5 or 10 minutes, the \nSenator will be willing to give me 5 or 10 minutes on a separate \nsubject.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will it be possible to let Senator Smith speak for a \ncouple of minutes and then Senator Gregg can wind up our hour? Mr. \nPresident, will that be all right?\n  Mr. GREGG. That will be fine.\n  Mr. THOMAS. That way, we will hear from the Senator from Idaho, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Before the Senator from Idaho begins, has the \nSenator from Wyoming propounded a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Idaho be \nallowed to speak and then the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, \nand then the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Gregg from New Hampshire being the \nthird speaker.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I simply ask the Senator \nfrom Wyoming if I may be reserved 10 minutes within that timeframe.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Craig \nThomas, for coming to the floor today once again to shape and clarify \nsome of these issues that are going to be front and center before this \nCongress and this Senate over the coming months as we deal with \nPresidential initiatives, Presidential budgets, and some of the issues \nthat are going to be, by fall and November, election-time issues.\n  Last week, I took issue with the President's State of the Union \nAddress in a broad sense as it related to the budget and some of the \ninitiatives he propounded within the State of the Union. Today, I will \nfocus, as my colleague from Wyoming has focused, on the element in the \nPresident's speech dealing with guns and gun violence.\n  Last November, the Centers for Disease Control reported 34,000 \nAmericans die every year from firearm injuries. If there is good news \nto be found in that terrible statistic, it is that the number has \ndeclined every year for the last 4 years. It is fewer than the 43,000 \nAmericans who die every year from motor vehicle accidents. And yet when \nwe have some of our colleagues on the floor pounding their podiums and \nsaying how terrible it is--and it is terrible--they forget to put it in \nrelation to other kinds of accidents and/or intentional acts that \nproduce deaths among the American citizenry.\n  That figure of 34,000 is far less than the 44,000 to 98,000 patients \nwho die every year by medical error. That is right. I am talking about \nerrors made in the delivery of medicine. It is estimated that 44,000 to \n98,000 patients die every year by medical error--that is a statistic \nwhich comes from the Institute of Medicine--and yet somehow when such a \ntragedy happens, it does not make the headline in the paper; it simply \nmakes the obituary page.\n  When we consider there are over 200 million privately owned guns in \nthe United States, we cannot escape the conclusion that the \noverwhelming majority of America's 80 million gun owners are peaceful \nand extremely responsible and using their constitutional rights in a \nresponsible-citizen way. There are 80 million gun owners and 200 \nmillion privately owned guns in America.\n  We in the Government are charged with the responsibility of seeing \nthat guns are used appropriately within the Constitution. That is, in \npart, our job. It is an American right and responsibility of all \nAmericans, should they wish to exercise it. We are here to deal with \nthose who use guns to intimidate, to steal, to rape, to murder. That is \nwhat the Government is for. That is our job, not to restrict or control \nthe right of the free citizen in the exercise of his or her \nconstitutional right, but to go at those who do the opposite, who use \nthe right in the wrong way--to steal, to rape, or to murder. This duty \ncomes before any other matter that we would want or should want to \nconsider on the issue of guns.\n  We know when the Government takes this responsibility seriously, we \nsave lives. You can come to the floor and pass all of the politically \ndriven bills that you want to, but if they are not enforced or not \nenforceable, then it is a political statement, not a responsible act of \nour Government.\n\n  In Richmond, VA, a Republican initiative called Project Exile has \nstepped up and prosecuted the gun-toting criminals and cut the murder \nrate by 30 percent every year since it was enacted in 1997. That is in \nRichmond, VA. In fact, it is said in Richmond that a man walked into a \n7-Eleven with a baseball bat to rob it. They caught him. They said: Why \ndidn't you use a gun? He said: You get locked up if you use a gun.\n  Isn't it amazing that the criminal element of our society will read \nand respond to the effective and targeted enforcement of a law? As a \nresult of that, in a city that was plagued by what any person would \njudge as a high rate of crime and murder, it has dropped that \nprecipitously, since the targeted direction of law enforcement not only \nto arrest but to prosecute and lock up those who misuse their gun \nrights.\n  How does the administration address the duty to the American people? \nOver the past 7 years, the Clinton-Gore administration has cut the \nATF's pursuit of criminals who use guns by nearly half. The number of \nprosecutions fell by nearly as much, and the number of gun-toting \ncriminals convicted fell by one-third. This isn't an NRA statistic; \nthis is an independent Syracuse University statistic. It is objective \nby every politician's measurement.\n  This is how it profiles on a chart. Last year, in this Chamber, Vice \nPresident Al Gore cast the tiebreaking vote in favor of interfering \nwith peaceful, law-abiding, responsible gun ownership--not criminals, \nbut responsible citizens exercising their right to go out and buy a \nfirearm for their personal ownership and possibly for their personal \nprotection.\n  It was quite a moment for the Vice President. There he sat in that \nchair, the image of leadership. He was able to tell Americans how \nconcerned he was about gun violence because he had cast the tiebreaking \nvote to impose greater restrictions on law-abiding Americans.\n  But I wonder, when this administration was gutting the enforcement of \nlaws against gun violence, was the Vice President casting his vote \nthen? No. Here is the Vice President's record, right here on this \nchart. This is where he and the President took over the law enforcement \nresponsibilities of the Justice Department of this country.\n  Look what happened during the Reagan and the Bush years--aggressive \nefforts to go at the criminals; arrests went up; crime began to go \ndown.\n  Here the Clinton-Gore administration backed off. They cut budgets. \nYou know the rest of the story. When this administration was letting \nviolent criminals off, I have a simple question to ask: Where was Al?\n  How many gun-toting criminals would be locked up today if the \nClinton-Gore administration had merely kept pace with the Reagan-Bush \nadministration's record portrayed on this chart? I would like to hear \nthe Vice President answer this question to American mothers. It is the \nright question to ask. It is a response that all deserve.\n\n[[Page S353]]\n\n  But there is more disturbing evidence that this administration does \nnot take seriously its duty in law enforcement.\n  The national instant check system is designed to immediately notify \nthe FBI if a criminal is trying to purchase a gun. I support that. \nEvery Senator supports the ability of someone going into a licensed \nfirearm dealer to buy a firearm immediately being checked, just like \nswiping your credit card through a machine at any retail outlet in \nAmerica and instantly finding whether you have credit on your card so \nyou can make that purchase.\n\n  We want the same kind of response when it comes to the purchase of a \ngun. We are nearly there. We have nudged, we have pushed, we have \ncajoled this administration and their Justice Department until they \nhave finally done it--although they dragged their feet progressively \nover the last 8 years.\n  According to a staff report of the Senate Judiciary Committee, since \nNovember of 1998, this Republican initiative, started here on this \nfloor--the instant check system background check--has stopped over \n100,000 criminals from purchasing guns. That represents an enormous \nnumber of bad actors who need to be put back in jail. How many have the \nadministration put back in jail? To my knowledge, none.\n  You heard the President in the well of the House in the State of the \nUnion Address talk about all of these criminals detected and stopped \nfrom buying a gun. If a criminal walks into a hardware store or a gun \nshop and attempts to buy a gun over the counter from a licensed firearm \ndealer, and his background is checked, and he is a felon with a record, \nhe has violated a law. He is in violation of the law. Yet the ATF has \nreferred only one-fifth of 1 percent of these criminals acting \nillegally to the Justice Department for prosecution.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry. You can talk all you want about guns, but \nyour actions show you don't care. You only want the politics of it.\n  Last year, this Congress said: No. We do not want the politics of it. \nWe will not take that effort. We want substance. The administration \nclaims it has increased the referral of firearms cases back to the \nStates for prosecution. But that is the same as letting a criminal off \nthe hook.\n  That is not an accusation of the States. These are Federal firearms \nviolations. They deserve Federal prosecution. State prosecutors have \nfewer resources than Federal prosecutors, and State firearm convictions \nresult in shorter sentences. Moreover, with a budget that grew 65 \npercent from 1992 to 1998, I am sorry, Janet Reno, we gave you the \nmoney; you didn't do the job. That growth in budget was the Justice \nDepartment.\n\n  The Clinton-Gore administration even lets convicted felons off the \nhook. Last September, we came to the floor to speak about it. This \nPresident, with his Executive power, granted clemency to 12 terrorists \nconvicted of 36 counts of violating Federal firearms laws. I am amazed \nat you, Bill Clinton, that you can stand on the floor of the U.S. House \nof Representatives and, with a straight face, talk about firearms \ncontrol, when you turned loose convicted felons, convicted of firearms \nviolations.\n  As recently as last year, the President said he would spend not more \nthan $5 million on the programs such as Project Exile, the kind I just \noutlined used in Richmond, VA. We asked for $50 million. The President \nlargely got his way. The final figure was about $7 million. Sorry, Mr. \nPresident. Last year at this time you didn't deserve credit for any of \nit. Now you have stepped up. Now you are saying you want $280 million \nto hire new investigators and prosecutors, both at the Federal and the \nState level. I ask you why, Mr. President? I think I know the answer. \nIt is polling well. You went out and asked the question of the American \npeople about law enforcement, something every Senator knows about, and \nit polled well. It got in the State of the Union.\n  It is far from clear that inadequate funding is the problem. The drop \nin prosecutions we have seen under this administration cannot be \nexplained entirely by staff levels. The ATF observers at Syracuse \nUniversity attest, ``other unknown forces or policies changes are \napparently at work.'' Many observers believe the administration already \nhas the resources it needs to increase as dramatically as they want the \nprosecutions necessary.\n  I ask unanimous consent to continue for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. One other issue I think is important: The President did \nsomething the other night that is the most radical expression on gun \ncontrol by any President in the history of this country--I think that \nis worth repeating--the most radical proposal on gun control by any \nPresident in the history of this country. Here is what he said:\n\n       Every state in this country already requires . . . \n     automobile drivers to have a license. I think they ought to \n     do the same thing for handgun purchases.\n\n  Mr. President, it is obvious you don't understand.\n  What the President failed to grasp is that no State requires a \nlicense to purchase a car. If you want to have it hauled home to your \nranch out in Wyoming and you stay on your ranch and you never get off \non the public road, you, Senator Craig Thomas, do not need a license to \nown a car. You need a license to drive a car on a public right of way, \non a public road. States do not require a license to drive a car except \non public roads. That is the whole point the President made. The \naverage American scratches his head and says, yes, license cars, \nlicense guns. But the President said you had to have a license to buy a \ngun, a direct statement of violation of the second amendment of our \nConstitution.\n  I can understand why Americans are frustrated, but I doubt the \nPresident has had a driver's license, maybe a valid one, in a long \nwhile. He has not needed one. I doubt he has ever waited in line at the \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles to get a license or to take the test in a \nlong while. So if the President wants to license handguns like cars, \nthen he is talking about issuing licenses to take a firearm out in \npublic because it would be against the Constitution to require a \nlicense to buy one, so he must be talking about taking a license out to \ntake a gun out in public. Well, we already do that. It is called \nconcealed carry permits. Thirty States already say you can get a \nlicense to carry a gun in public, and it is called a concealed carry. \nThe State of Vermont doesn't require a license at all.\n  I regret to inform you, President Bill Clinton, that what you are \ntalking about is something I don't think you understand. No State \nrequires a person to have a driver's license to purchase a car, nor \nshould this Federal Government ever require a free citizen in our \ncountry the need to have a license to purchase a gun.\n  Mr. President, are you then talking about a national concealed carry \nlaw? That is probably a pretty good idea. For those who want to carry \nin public, you could say you have to have a certain safety record and \nsafety standard and experience and all of those kinds of things if you \nwant--not to own, now, but to carry openly in public. I think that is \nwhat the President is not talking about at all.\n  My time is up and there are a good many other facts to be dealt with. \nIn States that have concealed carry, crime drops; when the criminal \nelement knows that the citizen out there is armed for his or her self-\nprotection, for the protection of their private property and their \npersonal rights and their person itself.\n  Extensive study has also shown that when states begin issuing \nconcealed carry permits, murders drop by about 8 percent, rapes fall by \n5 percent and aggravated assaults drop by 7 percent.\n  Moreover, as economist John Lott notes, states that began issuing \nnondiscretionary permits between 1977 and 1992 ``virtually eliminated \nmass public shootings after four or five years.''\n  Why does crime fall when citizens' right to bear arms is protected? \nBecause there is nothing a criminal fears more than a citizen who can \ndefend himself.\n  The President's comments were, of course, a plug for the Vice \nPresident, who has been talking for some time about regulating guns \nlike cars.\n  I wonder if that's really what either of them wants. In the words of \nsecond amendment scholar David Kopel, ``if Gore follows through on his \npromise to treat guns like cars, he will oversee the most massive \ndecontrol of firearms in\n\n[[Page S354]]\n\nAmerica since 1868, when the 14th Amendment abolished Southern states' \nBlack Codes, which prohibited freedmen from owning guns.''\n  Preserving and strengthening the second amendment would suit most \nAmericans just fine. I hope that's really what the President and Vice \nPresident want. But I suspect it isn't. And I worry that if word gets \nout, some poor White House speechwriter is going to lose his job.\n  These are issues we will debate at length on the floor of the Senate \nover the coming months. I thought it was important to come to the floor \nto begin to understand, to begin to explain so the American people can \nmore clearly understand the kind of irrational approach this \nadministration is currently proposing and certainly the less than \nlegitimate record they have in the area of law enforcement when it \ncomes to the use of a firearm.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming for taking out this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nWyoming for yielding me the time, and I thank him for his leadership in \ndefense of the second amendment, as well as my colleague from the State \nof Idaho, who has been a long-time advocate of the second amendment.\n  I regret I have to stand up here again with my colleagues and defend \nthe second amendment because we should not have to do that. I am \nhonored to do it, but it is one of our amendments. It is No. 2 in the \nConstitution.\n  I find myself wondering why so many of our colleagues come here over \nand over again to try to take second amendment rights away. The right \nto keep and bear arms is one of the most fundamental rights we possess. \nYou can't pick and choose which amendment you support in the \nConstitution, nor should you pick and choose what paragraph you support \nin the Constitution. If it is in the Constitution, we ought to abide by \nit and honor it.\n  The framers knew it, and that is why they placed the second amendment \nright up there at No. 2 in the Bill of Rights. They did not want the \nFederal Government to interfere with this basic right. It was part of \nthe Bill of Rights for the people, and it was No. 2.\n  I get a kick out of listening to so many of our colleagues on the \nother side of the issue who, in their eloquence, can knock the second \namendment down. It is interesting, though, when we hear from the folks \nwho were actually on the scene when the second amendment was written, \nfolks such as Samuel Adams, who said:\n\n       Among the natural rights of the colonists are these--first, \n     the right to life; secondly to liberty; thirdly to property; \n     together with the right to defend them in the best manner \n     they can.\n\n  Basically talking about the right to bear arms. John Adams:\n\n       Arms in the hands of the citizens may be used at individual \n     discretion for the defense of the country, the overthrow of \n     tyranny or private self-defense.\n\n  These are the founders. Patrick Henry:\n\n       Guard with jealous attention the public liberty . . . The \n     great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able \n     may have a gun.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson:\n\n       The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to \n     keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect \n     themselves against tyranny in government.\n\n  This is important business we are talking about. This was a basic \nright. Noah Webster:\n\n       Before a standing army can rule, the people must be \n     disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The \n     Supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust by the sword \n     because the whole of the people are armed, and constitute a \n     force superior to any band of regular troops.\n\n  Richard Henry Lee:\n\n       To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of \n     the people always possess arms.\n\n  With all due respect to my colleagues who speak on this issue in \nopposition to the second amendment, I don't think they are as eloquent \nor as knowledgeable, and I know they weren't there. These guys knew \nwhat they were talking about because they wrote it. So let's not talk \nabout revisiting the Constitution and being politically correct and \nchanging things we can't change.\n  These are the giants in history, the people who were there on the \nscene. Yet, in the past year or so on this floor, I and many of my \ncolleagues hear over and over again: gun control, gun control, gun \ncontrol. Some of it is enacted, which infringes on the second amendment \nof millions of law-abiding Americans. You cannot trample on the \nConstitution of the United States and stand up there and take that oath \nand say you are going to defend it. It is simply inconsistent.\n  Despite what history and the second amendment tell us, some keep \ntrying to come up with new and inventive ways to subvert that \nConstitution. I don't hear any of these people coming down and saying \nwe are going to eliminate the first amendment, but I do hear them \nsaying we ought to eliminate the second amendment.\n  The gun control provisions in the juvenile justice bill that were \nspurred on by the tragedy at Columbine used that tragedy, frankly. \nThere were already 20,000 existing gun laws when that happened, but the \nkillings were not stopped. Do we think more gun laws are going to stop \nsomething such as that from happening?\n  There was a recent amendment to stop gun manufacturers from declaring \nbankruptcy. Down the line they come, time after time again, singling \nout one legal product for discrimination: guns. No other lawful \nindustry is treated so unfairly. Fortunately, my colleagues voted \noverwhelmingly to reject that amendment.\n  The Clinton administration said it will file a Federal lawsuit \nagainst gun manufacturers. Here is an article from the Washington \nPost--it is interesting coming from the Washington Post--reporting how \ntwo State courts dismissed lawsuits against gun manufacturers. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, December 1999]\n\n         Firearms Makers Win Dismissal of Lawsuits in 2 States\n\n       In back-to-back victories for the firearms industry, judges \n     in two states have dismissed lawsuits against gun \n     manufacturers and dealers.\n       A state judge in Florida tossed out a suit by Miami-Dade \n     County yesterday, three days after a Connecticut state judge \n     dismissed a similar lawsuit brought by the mayor and city of \n     Bridgeport.\n       The two lawsuits mirror other suits filed by municipalities \n     that allege that guns have created a public nuisance, \n     threatening residents' health and safety, and that gun \n     manufacturers, like polluters, should have to pay for the \n     cleanup.\n       But in their separate decisions, the judges in Connecticut \n     and Florida reached the same conclusion: The governments lack \n     legal standing to sue.\n       ``The plaintiffs have no statutory or common-law basis to \n     recoup their expenditures,'' ruled the judge in Bridgeport. \n     ``Public nuisance does not apply to the design, manufacture, \n     and distribution of a lawful product,'' said the Florida \n     judge.\n       The mayors of Bridgeport and of Miami-Dade County sued the \n     firearms industry, claiming negligence, product liability and \n     public nuisance. Those mayors said that the industry was \n     responsible for the illegal flow of handguns into their \n     areas.\n       The mayors want to recover gun violence costs for police, \n     fire and emergency services. Bridgeport further sued to \n     recover money lost from depressed property values and \n     businesses that moved out of the city.\n       Bridgeport and Miami-Dade are among 29 cities and \n     counties--including Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles--\n     suing more than two dozen gun makers. In October, an Ohio \n     judge threw out a similar lawsuit filed by the city of \n     Cincinnati.\n       In one setback for the firearms industry, a state court \n     judge in Georgia earlier had ruled that Atlanta could pursue \n     its negligence claims against gun makers.\n       Last week, President Clinton said his administration is \n     thinking about filing a federal lawsuit on behalf of the 3 \n     million people living in public housing. Clinton's move was \n     an attempt to force the industry into negotiations to settle \n     the municipalities' lawsuits.\n       Anne Kimball, a Chicago lawyer representing Smith & Wesson \n     Corp. and other gun makers, said the judges saw that the \n     actions of criminals cannot be controlled by the firearms \n     industry. ``There is no quarrel that everyone is concerned \n     about violence . . . The question is what to do about it. But \n     these lawsuits are wrong,'' she said.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. They are basically saying they are going \nto throw these suits out. That is the gist of it. They are not \nconstitutional. The courts recognize that. The judges said they were \ncompletely lacking any legal basis.\n  Now the President wants to license and register all guns, like \nautomobiles, as my colleague from Idaho referred to.\n\n[[Page S355]]\n\nThe last time I checked, there wasn't a constitutional right to drive. \nDoes anybody know about that? I don't think they knew what a car was \nwhen the Constitution was written. There is no comparison between the \ntwo issues. I never heard anything from the Founding Fathers about the \nright to wagons or horses during that time. I never heard Patrick Henry \nsay: Give me mobility or give me death. He said: Give me liberty or \ngive me death. That is because driving a car is a privilege, not a \nright. It is a privilege. Gun owners would love to have guns treated as \ncars, with no background checks, no waiting periods, no age limit; it \nmight be a good thing.\n  Tyranny isn't always obvious. It isn't always about killing and \ncommunism and all that. Tyranny can be much more subtle, piecemeal, \ngradual--like violating our oath of office and voting against our \nconstitutional rights. It happens all the time in this place. History \nwill judge us for it; it will judge us on the basis of how many times \nwe stood here after having taken the oath of office and then having \nignored that oath.\n  The second amendment guarantees that the right to keep and bear arms \nshall not be infringed. If you are for gun control--and you have a \nright to be--then you are against the Constitution of the United \nStates. Change the amendment if you think you can do it. But don't keep \npassing gun control legislation time after time after time. That is \nwhat we are doing in these proposals and laws. We are doing it quietly, \nwithout violence, and with an air of respectability, which is what \ntroubles me--as if it is right to do it here because it is on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  We are violating the constitutional rights of millions of law-abiding \nAmerican citizens across the country, and any way you slice it that is \nstill tyranny. That is why I am proud to stand here, as I have done \nmany times--and I will do it every day, if I have to, until the last \nday I am in the Senate--in defense of the second amendment. I am \npleased and proud to support the second amendment.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, the other Senator from New Hampshire will \nbe here shortly. I thank my friends for talking about the issue. I \nthink it is one that is clearly important to many of us. It is \nconstitutional. It is right. It is something we all support. It is \nsomething, however, we don't want to constantly have before us as each \nnew issue comes up. This can be brought up as an amendment or as a way \nof stalling going on to other things. I appreciate very much the \nopportunity to do this.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S355-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to S. 1052 for opening statements only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the legislation before the Senate will \nextend the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for 1 year after the date \nof enactment of the legislation.\n  To minimize adverse effects on the local economy, a number of \ntransition provisions have been incorporated in the legislation, \nincluding funding for technical assistance to diversify and strengthen \nthe local economy of those islands. The transition period will end \nDecember 31, 2009, but the special provisions for employment--\nemployment-based visas--may be extended for legitimate businesses in \nthe tourism industry for not to exceed two 5-year periods and for a \nsingle 5-year period for other legitimate business.\n  I think it is reasonable to question how this situation arose. The \nMarianas was one district of the old United States Nation's Trust \nTerritory of the Pacific islands, and the United States was the \nadministrating authority. The residents of the Marianas wanted them to \nbecome a U.S. territory and obtain local government and U.S. \ncitizenship similar to the neighboring island of Guam. Guam is the \nsouthern most of the Mariana Islands and was acquired from Spain back \nin 1898. The United States and local officials in the Marianas \nnegotiated a covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands in political union with the United States. That \nincluded all the islands, with the exception of Guam; specifically, \nSaipan, Tinian, and Rota.\n  That covenant was approved overwhelmingly in a local United Nations-\nobserved plebiscite and then by this Congress in 1976. The early \nnegotiations assumed the trusteeship would terminate for the Marianas. \nThe agreement was approved and assumed the full extension of Federal \nimmigration laws at the same time the United States sovereignty was \nextended to the area. When negotiations on other portions of the trust \nterritory stalled and the United States decided not to seek piecemeal \ntermination of the trusteeship, the Marianas justifiably wanted as much \nof the covenant implemented under the trusteeship as possible. The \nagreement was to implement these provisions of the covenant that were \nconsistent with the continued status of the area under the trusteeship \nand defer those provisions that were tied to U.S. sovereignty. One of \nthese provisions was Federal immigration law. That is what we are \ndealing with today.\n  It was abundantly clear the United States could extend those laws as \nsoon as the trusteeship was terminated. The report accompanying the \njoint resolution of approval noted only that we hoped we could include \nan ``adequate protective provision'' to deal with the concern in the \nMarianas that their islands could be overrun with immigration.\n  Had we acted in 1986 to extend Federal immigration laws, we wouldn't \nbe here today. The Marianas economy would not be so captive to the use \nof temporary contract workers and many of the abuses of workers would \nnot have occurred. On the other hand, the level of prosperity on the \nislands might not be the same.\n  What has happened in the Marianas? When the covenant was negotiated, \nall parties assumed economic development would occur around tourism and \nanticipated Department of Defense basing in Tinian and Saipan. That \nfollowed the pattern in Guam. Tourism did develop; the military \nactivities did not.\n  Others, however, noticed the unique combination of authorities and \nmoved in to try and take advantage. Because the Marianas had control of \nimmigration, it could set its own minimum\n\n[[Page S359]]\n\nwage and had the ability to import goods into the U.S. Customs \nterritory without duty and labeled that it had been made in the United \nStates, foreign garment operations--especially those from China--sought \nto locate in the Marianas.\n\n  The difficulty of a small island population trying to effectively \nadminister a comprehensive immigration system also led to other abuses \nin those taking advantage of the situation. Exploiters induced people \nin Bangladesh to pay enormous amounts of money to go to the Marianas \nwhere there were jobs. Other aliens arrived; some of them were not \npaid. Many alien workers were abused. The Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources heard testimony from a young lady who had been \nbrought to Saipan as a minor, forced to perform in a club, and was used \nfor prostitution. The Federal Government has brought a prosecution in \nthat instance on several counts, including trafficking in human beings. \nThis was occurring under the U.S. flag, and supposedly with the \nprotections all U.S. citizens enjoy under our Constitution.\n  I have a series of charts I will discuss in detail but in deference \nto my good friend, Senator Bingaman from New Mexico, the ranking member \nof the committee, I defer to him, and then perhaps he can defer back to \nme. I yield to my good friend and ranking member from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman, Senator \nMurkowski, yielding.\n  First, I compliment him and, of course, Senator Akaka, who is the \nmoving force behind this legislation on the Democratic side. I think \nthis legislation, S. 1052, is a very important and overdue piece of \nlegislation.\n  I know both Senator Akaka and Senator Murkowski have worked \ntirelessly and persistently to bring these issues to our attention. I \ncompliment them on that. I will give a short statement, and then \nSenator Akaka will be managing the bill on the Democratic side. I am \nsure he has much more information to provide on the legislation.\n  Both Senator Murkowski and Senator Akaka traveled to the Commonwealth \nof the Northern Mariana Islands and witnessed the problems there \nfirsthand. I am very glad to join them as a cosponsor on this important \npiece of legislation. Our committee held several hearings over the \nyears and established a record concerning the very serious problems \nthat exist in the CNMI. Moreover, three successive administrations from \nboth parties, beginning with the Reagan administration, have expressed \nconcerns about the situation in the CNMI. Many problems have been \nidentified, and they have been discussed over many years.\n  However, clearly the central problem relates to this immigration \nissue. S. 1052 only addresses immigration. This bill represents a \nmodest step toward implementing the reforms that are long overdue. The \ncurrent immigration system, administered by the local government, is \ninconsistent with longstanding U.S. immigration policy in several \nrespects. Let me just detail some of that.\n  U.S. policy, first of all, does not allow the importation of \ntemporary workers for permanent jobs. Second, it allows people coming \ninto the United States for permanent jobs to have the opportunity to \nbecome participating members of society, including the right to vote \nand to be eligible for citizenship. Local CNMI immigration law not only \nallows large-scale use of temporary alien workers for permanent jobs, \nit also prohibits temporary alien workers from settling permanently in \nthe CNMI and becoming U.S. citizens.\n  The most disturbing result of the CNMI's current immigration system \nis the documented, consistent and even increasing human rights abuses \nwhich these alien workers suffer. Moreover, despite promises of the \nAmerican dream, alien laborers coming to CNMI often sign contracts \nwaiving rights and freedoms guaranteed to U.S. workers. These include \nthe right to change employers, the right to participate in religious \nand political activities, and in some cases even the right to marriage.\n  This bill before us is not a controversial bill. It should not be a \ncontroversial bill. It was reported from the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee by a voice vote with no dissenting opinions \nexpressed. Last Congress, the committee reported a similar bill. In \norder to address concerns by the local CNMI government that the bill \nwill adversely affect their economy, the bill also contains many \nspecial provisions. Among these special provisions is one that requires \nthe Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor to provide \nfinancial and technical assistance to help them diversify their economy \nand train local workers.\n  I hope the Senate will act quickly and pass this bill. I again \ncompliment Senator Akaka and Senator Murkowski for their leadership on \nthis important matter.\n  I yield the floor. I know at some point Senator Akaka wishes to speak \nto the matter as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague, \nthe ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, the Senator from New Mexico, for his comments and for his \nsupport.\n  This legislation was reported unanimously by the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources. S. 1052, as reported by the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, will extend the provisions of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \none year after the date of enactment of the legislation. To minimize \nadverse effects on the local economy, a number of transition provisions \nhave been incorporated in the legislation. The transition period will \nend on December 31, 2009, but the special provisions for employment \nbased visas may be extended for legitimate businesses in the tourism \nindustry for not to exceed two five-year periods and for a single five-\nyear period for other legitimate businesses.\n  This legislation is the result of several years work by the \nCommittee, including a visit that I made to the Northern Marianas in \nFebruary 1996. I was accompanied by Senator Akaka, who has cosponsored \nthis legislation and was also a cosponsor of legislation that I \nintroduced in the last Congress. This is bipartisan legislation that is \nlong overdue. The administration would prefer a far more draconian \napproach with a minimum of transition and little economic or training \nassistance to the Northern Marianas. The Marianas, on the other hand, \nwould prefer that we did nothing. I don't think that either approach is \nresponsible.\n  There are legitimate concerns by some in the Northern Marianas over \nwhat the effect of this legislation may be. We have tried to address \nthose concerns, as I will describe later. For example, one of the ways \nthat the Northern Marianas has tried to deal with the concern over \nalien workers remaining for indefinite periods without any political \nrights is to limit the time that any worker can remain in the Marianas. \nOne effect of that approach, however, is to frustrate the ability of \nemployers to recruit, train, and hire personnel. From experience, I can \ntestify that the last thing any employer wants to do is commit \nresources to training individuals only to have them leave for other \nemployment. It is far worse when the government says that your most \nvaluable employees must not only leave your employ, but must also leave \nthe country. Lynn Knight, the new president of the Saipan Chamber of \nCommerce, noted that she had one employee who had been with her firm \nfor several years and would have to leave. Another skilled professional \ncould remain since he was a U.S. citizen. Similar situations are likely \nin other businesses, and I would expect especially in the tourism \nindustry. To deal with that problem, the committee has included a \nspecial provision (the new section 6(j) to the Covenant Act) that \nprovides a one-time grandfather provision for long-term employees in \nlegitimate businesses. The provision would allow employers to sponsor \ncurrent employees who had been employed for five years. If the alien is \notherwise eligible for admission to the United States, that employee \nmay be granted an immigrant visa or have his status adjusted to a \nperson lawfully admitted for permanent residence without regard to any \nnumerical limitations in the Immigration Act.\n  I mention this one provision to illustrate that the committee has \ntried its best to deal with any legitimate concerns with the \nlegislation and, as in\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\nthe case of Ms. Knight, problems with the current local laws. \nUnfortunately, obtaining specific comments and recommendations has not \nbeen the easiest task before the committee. While the Governor has been \nforthright, the tactics taken by others has been more to obstruct the \nlegislation than to provide useful comments and suggestions. The \nGovernor has lowered the tone of the debate on this issue, although his \nexample has not been followed by others.\n  I would refer my colleagues to the report of the committee on this \nlegislation for a detailed history on how we arrived at this situation \nwhere the United States does not control the terms of entry to its \nshores, what that exemption turned into, and how we have dealt with \nlegitimate concerns about the long overdue extension of federal \nlegislation.\n  In brief, however, in 1976, Congress approved a Covenant to Establish \na Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with \nthe United States (PL 94-241). The Covenant formed the basis for the \ntermination of the United Nations Trusteeship with respect to the \nNorthern Mariana Islands. Termination occurred in 1986 for the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and for the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Prior to \ntermination, those provisions of the Covenant that were consistent with \ncontinued status of the area as part of the Trust Territory were made \napplicable by the U.S. as Administering Authority. Other provisions \n(such as the extension of U.S. sovereignty) were not made applicable. \nAmong those laws was the Immigration Act. Had the United States \nsought piece-meal termination of the trusteeship, as some advocated at \nthe time, or if agreement with the other districts had not proved so \nelusive, the immigration laws of the United States would have been \nextended to the Northern Marianas as they applied to Guam. We would not \nbe here today.\n\n  The Covenant permitted a unique system in the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands under which the local government controlled \nimmigration and minimum wage levels and also had the benefit of duty \nand quota free entry of manufactured goods under the provisions of \nGeneral Note 3(a) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules. My colleagues \nshould be aware that these provisions are not subject to mutual consent \nand can be modified or repealed by the Congress. The section-by-section \nanalysis of the committee report on the Covenant provides in part:\n\n       Section 503.--This section deals with certain laws of the \n     United States which are not now applicable to the Northern \n     Mariana Islands and provides that they will remain \n     inapplicable except in the manner and to the extent that they \n     are made applicable by specific legislation enacted after the \n     termination of the Trusteeship. These laws are:\n       The Immigration and Naturalization Laws (subsection (a)). \n     The reason this provision is included is to cope with the \n     problems which unrestricted immigration may impose upon small \n     island communities. Congress is aware of those problems. . . \n     . It may well be that these problems will have been solved by \n     the time of the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement and \n     that the Immigration and Nationality Act containing adequate \n     protective provisions can then be introduced to the Northern \n     Mariana Islands. . . .\n\n  Until termination of the trusteeship, the United States possessed and \nexercised plenary power, including control over entry into the area. \nThe committee anticipated that by the termination of the Trusteeship, \nthe federal government would have found some way of preventing a large \ninflux of persons into the Marianas, recognizing the constitutional \nlimitations on restrictions on travel, and that we would extend federal \nimmigration laws when we extended United States sovereignty over the \narea. We neglected to do so.\n  Upon termination of the trusteeship, the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands became a territory of the United States and its \nresidents became United States citizens. What transpired thereafter, \nhowever, was precisely what we sought to prevent. Because we had not \nenacted legislation extending federal immigration laws, however, \npersons were free to enter the Northern Marianas under local law. \nAlthough the population of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands was only 15,000 people in 1976 when the Covenant was approved, \nthe population (July, 1999) is now estimated at 79,429. The rapid \nincrease in population coincides with the assumption of immigration \ncontrol by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. According \nto the most recent statistical survey by the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, in 1980, 78 percent of the Commonwealth of \nthe Northern Mariana Islands population were U.S. citizens. That figure \nhad declined to less than 47 percent by 1990 and by 1991, the \npercentage on Saipan, where most of the population resides, the figure \nwas 42 percent.\n  The majority of the population resides on Saipan, which is the \neconomic and government center of the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands. The most recent statistics (March 1999) from the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands estimate the population of \nSaipan at 71,790. U.S. citizens are estimated at 30,154 of whom 24,710 \nare Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands born. There are 41,636 \naliens of whom about 4,000 are from the freely associated states. By \ncontrast, in 1980, non-U.S. citizen residents for the entire Northern \nMarianas totaled only 3,753 of whom 1,593 were citizens of the freely \nassociated states and only 2,160 came from outside Micronesia. There is \nalso a significant population of illegal aliens with estimates ranging \nfrom 3,000 to as high as 7,000 illegal aliens.\n  Whatever the number, with the exception of those from Micronesia, \nnone of these almost 40,000 persons entered under United States law and \nnone has any of the rights of persons who legally enter the \nUnited States to work or reside.\n\n  Repeated allegations of violations of applicable federal laws \nrelating to worker health and safety, concerns with respect to \nimmigration problems, including the admission of undesirable aliens, \nand reports of worker abuse, especially in the domestic and garment \nworker sectors, led to the inclusion of a $7 million set aside in \nappropriations in 1994 to support federal agency presence in the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and increased enforcement \nof federal laws.\n  During the 104th Congress, the Senate passed S. 638, legislation \nreported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and supported \nby the administration. Concern over the effectiveness of the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands immigration laws and \nreports of the entry of organized criminal elements from Japan and \nChina led the committee to include a provision to require the \nCommonwealth ``to cooperate in the identification and, if necessary, \nexclusion or deportation from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands of persons who represent security or law enforcement risks to \nthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or the United \nStates.'' (Sec. 4 of S. 638) No action was taken by the House.\n  In February, 1996, I visited the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands with Senator Akaka and met with local and federal officials. In \naddition, we inspected a garment factory and met with Bangladeshi \nsecurity guards who had not been paid and who were living in \nsubstandard conditions. As a result of the meetings and continued \nexpressions of concern over conditions, the committee held an oversight \nhearing on June 26, 1996. We were assured that conditions would \nimprove.\n  The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform conducted a site visit to \nthe Northern Marianas in July 1997 and issued a report which in general \nsupported extension of immigration laws. The report found problems in \nthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands ``ranging from \nbureaucratic inefficiencies to labor abuses to an unsustainable \neconomic, social and political system that is antithetical to most \nAmerican values'' but ``a willingness on the part of some Commonwealth \nof the Northern Mariana Islands officials and business leaders to \naddress the various problems''.\n  The report found that:\n  The Department of Labor and Immigration ``does not have the capacity, \nnor is it likely to develop one, to prescreen applicants for entry \nprior to their arrival on Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \nterritory.'' This leads to the situation of the Bangladeshi workers who \narrive and find there is no work as well as to the entry of those with \ncriminal or other disqualifying records. Federal law enforcement \nofficials are mentioned as\n\n[[Page S361]]\n\nnot providing information to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands due to concerns over security and corruption.\n  The levels of immigration led to dependence on government employment \nor benefits for U.S. residents (since cheap foreign labor was available \neven for specialized trades such as accountants, doctors, and managers) \nand younger residents having to leave to find work. The report also \nnoted that those on welfare could still hire domestics.\n  The economy is unsustainable because there will be no advantage for \nthe garment industry when the multi-fibre agreement comes into force in \n2005. My colleagues should note that the perception that the garment \nindustry presence in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \nis temporary is also shared by others. In September 1997, the Bank of \nHawaii concluded that the presence of the garment industry was a result \nof ``a unique and temporary comparative economic advantage'' and that \nthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands should begin to plan \nfor a ``transition to an exclusively tourism-driven economy''. The Bank \nof Hawaii repeated that conclusion in its October, 1999 report.\n  Foreign workers are exploited with retaliation against protestors, \nfailure of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands government \nto prosecute, unreliable bonding companies, exorbitant recruitment \nfees, suppression of basic freedoms, and flagrant abuses of household \nworkers, agricultural workers, and bar girls.\n  The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has entered into \nagreements with the Philippines and China over State objections dealing \nwith trade and immigration.\n\n  The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has no asylum policy \nor procedure placing the U.S. in violation of international \nobligations.\n  The temporary guest worker for permanent jobs creates major policy \nproblems as well as creating a two class system where the majority of \nworkers are denied political and social rights. In the U.S. proper, \nsuch workers would be admitted for residence and could become citizens. \nWorse, the children of these workers are U.S. citizens. The children of \nforeign mothers now account for 16 percent of U.S. citizens.\n  The presence of a large alien population in the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands is not simply a matter of local concern. \nAlthough temporary workers admitted into the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands may not enter the United States and their \npresence in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands does not \nconstitute residence for the purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship, \nthat is not true for their children. Persons born in the Commonwealth \nof the Northern Mariana Islands obtain U.S. citizenship by birth and \neventually will be able to bring their immediate families into the \nUnited States. There is an increasing number of births to non-citizen \nmothers. In 1985, of 675 births, 260 were to non-citizen mothers. While \nthe number of U.S. citizen mothers remained relatively constant, the \nnumber of non-citizen mothers increased to 581 by 1990, 701 in 1991, \n859 in 1992, and continued around 900-1000 with the exception of 1,409 \nin 1996. For that year, total births were 1,890 with the percentage of \nU.S. citizen mothers at 25 percent. While some of the presumed non-\ncitizen mothers are likely to be married to Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands residents, others are not, and all entered \noutside of federal immigration laws. The result is that there is an \nincreasing number of persons obtaining U.S. citizenship outside the \nboundaries of U.S. immigration and naturalization laws. There are also \nincidental effects on various federal programs, such as education, that \nthe children and their immediate relatives will be eligible for.\n  To the extent that the current Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands immigration system results in structural unemployment among \nresident U.S. citizens, there are also effects on federal programs \nproviding assistance to the poor. In addition, in recent years, the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has doubled its public \nsector employment to absorb local workers. Public sector wages now \nrepresent the largest component of the local budget. Unless the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands takes action to develop or \nopen private sector employment for U.S. residents, it will have a \ndifficult time reducing its workforce. The recent downturn in the Asian \neconomy has hit the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands hard \nand the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is facing a \nsignificant deficit without the ability to trim its workforce. If \nlayoffs are inevitable, it is likely that local and federal assistance \ncosts will escalate.\n  Concerns have also arisen over the use of the Northern Marianas for \nimportation and transhipment of drugs. The June 17 Marianas Variety \nreported the Finance Department's Division of Customs to have \nconfiscated over $2.5 million of crystal methamphetamine in 1998 with \nan increasing number of drug arrests. A related concern raised by the \nadministration has been the ability of the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands to exclude individuals, especially members of organized \ncrime from Japan and China. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands does not have a data base to screen immigrants, and \naccomplishes most of its screening on arrival. The federal government, \nhowever, for those countries that require visas, does its screening in \nthe foreign country. Federal law enforcement agencies have cited \nsecurity concerns as a major impediment to sharing information with the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands government.\n  Mr. President, this is a situation that should never have been \nallowed to occur. This is not a matter of local self-government. The \ncontrol of borders and the conditions for entry, work, residence, and \ncitizenship in the United States are federal matters. No one should \never have expected the Northern Marianas to replicate the resources and \ncapability of the federal government, and in fact we did not. As our \ncommittee noted in its report on the Covenant, by the time the \nTrusteeship ended, we anticipated that federal immigration laws would \nbe extended. We didn't do that and permitted this situation to occur. \nWith the exception of American Samoa, the federal government conducts \nthose activities throughout the United States. We have allowed the \ncreation of a country within a country where the majority of the \nworkforce are denied political and civil rights.\n  Neither do I accept the argument that economic development is \ninconsistent with the application of federal immigration laws. With the \nexception of American Samoa, all other areas of the United States are \nunder federal immigration law. I can assure my colleagues that the \nconstraints on economic development in Alaska are not found in federal \nimmigration law. Neither has federal immigration law been an impediment \nto the development of economies in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, or \nGuam. If those areas are not fully to the levels of Stateside \neconomies, they are nonetheless all self-supporting without the need \nfor annual appropriations for government support. The Northern Marianas \nhas a tourism industry and the opportunity for it to expand. There are \nother opportunities that should be explored, and this legislation \ncontains provisions to assist the Commonwealth government in exploring \nthose options.\n  Comments have been made that this legislation will destroy the \ngarment industry. That is simply not true unless the industry is \nadverse to having workers who either are or could become United States \ncitizens. In addition, even the Governor in his testimony said that the \ngarment industry in Saipan was temporary and that they needed to begin \nto transit to a new economy. The Bank of Hawaii has twice cautioned \nthat the peculiar circumstances that provide an economic advantage in \nthe Marianas will disappear shortly. As the Governor stated, we need to \nbegin the transition now. This legislation will have only a minor \neffect on the garment industry. The legislation does not go into effect \nfor a year. All contract workers on island can remain for two years or \nthe length of their contract, whichever is less. There is a program to \nprovide permits for temporary alien workers that will gradually be \nreduced and eliminated by December 31, 2009. All of this extends\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\nwell past the time that every legitimate analysis of the Marianas \neconomy indicates that the garment industry will have relocated or \nseverely contracted.\n  Mr. President, I will list some of the changes that we made in this \nlegislation to address concerns over the effect of the imposition of \nfederal immigration laws. I have already mentioned the special \ngrandfather provision included as a result of Lynn Knight's concern \nover the status of current employees. These concerns were raised by the \nChamber of Commerce or the representatives of the Commonwealth \ngovernment--the Governor, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of \nthe House, and the Resident Representative.\n  The legislation limited post-transition relief to only the hotel \nindustry. That has been expanded to include not only legitimate \nbusinesses throughout the tourism industry, but all other legitimate \nbusinesses in the Commonwealth;\n  A new statement of policy to guide implementation has been inserted \nthat makes clear that the transition from a non-resident contract \nworker program is to be orderly and that potential adverse effects are \nto be minimized;\n  An explicit recognition of local self-government has been added \ntogether with more detailed requirements for consultation with local \nofficials and consideration of their views as well as a straightforward \nstatement that fundamental policy decisions regarding the direction and \npace of economic development and growth will be made by local officials \nand not dictated by the federal government;\n  Although the legislation limits the ability of the Attorney General \nto provide additional extension of the temporary worker program to two \nfive-year periods for legitimate businesses in the tourism industry and \nfor a single five-year period for other legitimate businesses, it also \nrequires the Attorney General to notify the Congress of the reasons for \nthe extension and whether we should consider providing additional \nauthority for further extensions;\n  A detailed technical assistance program is included to assist in the \ntransition and to broaden and strengthen the local economy. In addition \nto existing authorities and programs, the Secretary of Commerce is \nprovided $200,000 in matching grants to assist in the development and \nimplementation of a process to diversify and strengthen the local \neconomy. The Secretary is to consult not only with local officials, but \nalso with local businesses and regional banks and other experts. The \nSecretary of Labor is provided an additional $300,000 in matching \ngrants to provide technical and other support for the training, \nrecruitment, and hiring of persons authorized to work in the United \nStates to fill jobs in the Commonwealth. In addition to local officials \nand businesses, the Secretary is to work with the College of the \nNorthern Marianas and the Secretary of Commerce.\n  A specific requirement has been included for the federal government \nto promote the Northern Marianas as a tourist destination.\n  Numerous technical and other changes have been made in response to \nthe comments that we received, mainly to ensure full and complete \nconsultation with local officials as this legislation is implemented.\n  I want the record to reflect that I believe that this Governor has \nattempted to deal with the allegations of worker abuse that have \noccurred in the Northern Marianas. I think the garment industry has \nalso acted to improve conditions and practices, at least to minimum \nfederal requirement. After all, that is an industry that shipped over \n$1 billion worth of garments into the United States customs territory \nlast year. By virtue of the exemption from tariffs, they avoided over \n$200 million in tariffs. Cleaning up conditions is a minor price to pay \nfor that subsidy. Not all problems, however, are capable of resolution. \nThe system where workers are on temporary contract and subject to \ndeportation creates a climate where abuse can occur. Since the workers \nhave no right to remain in the Marianas, their ability to complain is \nlimited. If they have significant recruitment or other fees to repay, \nthey are effectively indentured.\n  The ability of the Northern Marianas government to respond is also \nlimited. In response to the exploitation of workers from Bangladesh who \npaid large recruitment fees for non-existent jobs, the Marianas could \nonly ban the importation of workers from that area for those jobs. The \nexploiters simply moved to Nepal. When the Governor tried to limit \nworkers from China to deal with repatriation problems, however, those \nindustries relying on easy access to those workers quickly brought \nenough pressure to reverse the decision. Efforts to limit the number of \nalien workers become more and more difficult as the Marianas government \nbecomes increasingly dependent on those businesses importing those \nworkers for the revenues to provide jobs in the public sector.\n  Asking the Northern Marianas government to assume and adequately \nimplement and enforce an immigration program within the framework of \nfederal policy is simply setting them up. A central element of federal \npolicy is that permanent jobs are to be filled by permanent workers--\npersons who may live and reside in the United States, and in the case \nof aliens, who have the ability to eventually become citizens and full \nmembers of the political, social, and economic community. The Marianas \ndoes not have that ability. If they allow foreign workers to remain \nindefinitely, local businesses--such as Lynn Knight's--will prosper. \nHowever the workers will not obtain civil and political rights. They \nmay not become United States citizens and they can not enter any other \npart of the United States. They are trapped. If the Marianas responds, \nas it did, to limit the length of stay for those workers, then \nbusinesses suffer because they can not retain trained workers and the \nworkers themselves suffer.\n  This is a situation that should never have been allowed to occur. We \nallowed it to happen, partially through a misplaced idea that we were \nenhancing local self-government. We now need to act to formally bring \nthe Northern Marianas under the federal system as a part of the United \nStates. We need to let them devote their resources to local concerns \nrather than having then attempt to replicate federal responsibilities. \nWe need to make the transition as smooth as possible and we need to act \nto strengthen and diversify the local economy. This legislation as \nreported unanimously from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nwill do that. It should be enacted promptly.\n  Mr. President, the effort we are about to proceed with today is a \nresult of a recognition that, indeed, there simply has to be a change \nin the immigration situation with regard to Saipan and the other \nislands of the Mariana Islands as a consequence of an effort that began \nmany years ago to encourage development. But clearly the situation ran \naway with itself over a period of time when the immigration system just \ngot beyond the management capability of the islands.\n  I have had an opportunity to work with Senator Akaka on this \nlegislation. I know how sensitive he is because a good deal of his \nconstituency extends a little further out than the Hawaiian Islands \ninto the CNMI. My constituency in Alaska does not quite extend that \nfar. Nevertheless, as chairman of the committee, I have the \nresponsibility to try to bring about corrective action. Through the \nefforts of Senator Akaka and his staff and with the help of Senator \nBingaman and the professional staff of the committee, I think we have \nbeen able to achieve that in this legislation.\n  With the concurrence of Senator Akaka, I will proceed with the \ncharts. Senator Akaka is very prominent in some of the charts we are \ngoing to be presenting. In some cases I assume he has not seen these \npictures yet. I am not suggesting either one of us is particularly \nphotogenic, but we have living proof we were there on the ground and \nsaw the situation as it really does exist.\n  The first chart I am going to show is a little bit of what has \nhappened over a period of time in the CNMI. It is a chart of population \nby citizenship.\n  On the chart, the lower area is the growth in the number of U.S. \ncitizens. That is in blue. You will see back in 1980 it was somewhere \nin the area of 14,000 or thereabouts. In the upper area is the growth \nin the number of aliens. Those aliens are primarily Chinese\n\n[[Page S363]]\n\nwomen coming in and working in the garment business. They come in under \na contract for 2 or 3 years. Their living conditions leave a little bit \nto be desired, but I will go into that a little later.\n  I do want my colleagues to understand, though, that as we look at the \ndifference in the number of U.S. citizens over a period of time from \n1980 to 1999, the growth of that group is relatively modest. But if we \nlook, from 1980 to 1999, at the growth in the number of non-U.S. \ncitizens, we see phenomenal growth. That is a result of these workers \ncoming in and working in sweatshops in a way we would certainly not \nallow anywhere in the United States.\n  The population of the Mariana Islands, as I indicated, was about \n15,000 in 1976 when the covenant was approved. As of July 1999, that \nfigure has now risen to close to 80,000, as the chart shows.\n  In 1978, 78 percent of the population were U.S. citizens. By 1990, \nthat figure went down to 47 percent. By 1999, in Saipan where most of \nthe population resides, that figure was down to 42 percent.\n  With the exception of about 4,000 residents from the freely \nassociated states in Micronesia, there were over 41,000 aliens who \nentered this portion of the United States outside of our conventional \nFederal immigration laws because the immigration laws were controlled \nby the island.\n  In February of 1996, Senator Akaka and I, accompanied by a very \noutstanding group of our professional staff who are with me today, went \nto visit the islands. Let me give you a little report on what we found. \nWe were not looking for a situation that suggested the immigration was \nout of control. But in our visit there, and in followup on reports, we \ndid find worker abuse and other problems associated with immigration \nand labor.\n  We had an extensive and productive series of meetings during our \nbrief visit. We had an opportunity to meet with the Governor. We were \nbriefed by his various departments on how they were attempting to deal \nwith this situation. We met with law enforcement officials and \nrepresentatives from the Department of Labor and other agencies. We met \nwith Federal District Court Judge Munson, a very capable Federal judge, \nand the U.S. attorneys for the area. We met with the leadership of the \nlegislature. We met with various groups, including the Chamber of \nCommerce and others.\n  We also visited around the island. We visited garment factories. We \nmet with the workers who heard we were on the island and wanted to \nconvey their concern. Without notice, we met with some of the \nBangladeshi security guards. Let me show you what we saw.\n  Here we are, actually visiting one of the garment factories.\n  A picture cannot capture the atmosphere, but my colleagues can get \nsome idea of the work. This is a pile of red, what we call gaucho \nsports shirts. There is quite a pile of them. On the next table, there \nis another pile. It goes right on down the line.\n  These women, virtually without exception, are young women who have \ncome over from China on a contract working at these sewing machines and \nputting these garments together. These are the general types of working \nconditions and the building.\n  Behind this working area is their living quarters. The living \nquarters are pretty rough. We went into some of them. There are four to \nsix women in one room. The beds look like little more than an enlarged \nchildren's crib. On the other hand, one has to wonder what kind of \nconditions they would ordinarily be living in in China. One has to bear \nthat in mind.\n  This gentleman in red--a different color T-shirt than the pile of \nshirts--is Senator Akaka. I am wearing a blue T-shirt. We were going \nthrough this factory.\n  Notice that many of the women do not look up from their machines or \neven look at strangers, which surprised us. I assume they were told to \nwork, keep their heads down, and mind their own business. Nevertheless, \nthis gives some idea of what is inside one of the garment factories.\n  There is a barbed wire fence around the barracks where the women \nlive. It is certainly fair to say we would not want to live in those \nconditions. It was hot. There was air circulating.\n  I have another picture. Obviously, I had a big dinner that day, so I \nwill not reflect at any great length on that. These are the shirts that \nare going into various markets in the United States. The extraordinary \nthing I found is that right at the factory where the garments are put \ntogether, not only are the price tags put on but the encoded tag one \nfinds on the garment at sale is put on. When we looked at these labels, \nwe saw the May Company, we saw Hecht's, and a number of noted \ncommercial department stores in the United States.\n  We found they had a red dot on the other sale items on the garments \nmade in Saipan. Not only are they tagged with the price and the store \nto which they are going, but this label says ``Made in America,'' and \nthese are made in America because, clearly, Saipan is a territory of \nthe United States. They go in duty free.\n  Also, these are young women, and this has certain consequences for \nboth the Mariana Islands and the U.S. Federal Government which I am \ngoing to mention shortly.\n  What has attracted this industry, of course, is the availability of \nworkers who come from China on a 3-year contract, and they work very \nhard. It is a piecemeal-type work. As a consequence, when their turn is \nto leave, why, there are others who are waiting to come in under \ncontract as well.\n  We tried to find out terms and conditions under which they were \nhired, but that is pretty difficult to do. There are those in China who \nrecruit, if you will, and what they get paid to buy a Chinese woman who \nwants to come over and work is anybody's guess. There seems to be an \nunlimited supply as these women go back and, in many cases, of course, \nthey have saved a good deal of the money they have made; others perhaps \nare not so lucky. In any event, we saw other exceptions that were not \nquite as pleasant.\n  This is a picture of Senator Akaka and me in front of what really was \na hovel. This is behind one of the major hotels, the Hyatt hotel. There \nwere a series of shacks. This is a gentleman from Bangladesh. He was \nhired to be a security guard. We found an area where there was no \nwater, no sewer, no electricity. They were heating inside on a kerosene \nstove. The concern he had is he had not been paid. He had been given \nchecks by his employer, and those checks had been returned for \nnonsufficient funds. He had three checks.\n\n  He said: What am I to do? I work, I am paid, but the checks are no \ngood. I go to the Federal Government representatives on the island, and \nthey are so burdened down with requests such as this that they can't do \nanything for me; I don't have enough money to go back to my country. \nWhat am I to do?\n  These are people who, obviously, thought they were given an \nopportunity for a better lifestyle. Clearly, once they arrived there, \nthey found themselves helpless.\n  This is the exception, not the rule. But there are enough of the \nexceptions to suggest there is little means for these people to seek \nrelief, to go to their employer, and get paid: Run the check through \nagain next week and maybe there will be money to cover. That is a \npretty tough set of circumstances under the American flag.\n  I refer to another chart on the makeup of the CNMI population by \ncitizenship. If one looks closely at the chart and the growth of \npopulations in the Mariana Islands, one will note the growth rate for \nU.S. citizens began to rise in roughly 1990. The blue bar is U.S. \ncitizens, and the red bar is the growth of non-U.S. citizens.\n  There is a ready explanation. If my colleagues will recall, many of \nthe alien contract workers are young women. I have another chart, and \nthis is a chart on infant births. Again, if one looks at the blue from \n1985 to 1998, one sees the births by mothers' nationality. The blue \nrepresents U.S. citizens and the red is non-U.S. citizens. In 1985, of \n675 live births, 260 were to noncitizen mothers. While the number of \ncitizen mothers remains fairly consistent, the number of noncitizen \nmothers rose to 581 in 1990, 701 in 1991, 859 in 1992, and then \ncontinues around 900 to 1,000 thereafter. The exception was 1996 when \nthere were 1,409 recorded live births to noncitizen mothers. Fully 75 \npercent of all births were to noncitizen mothers.\n\n[[Page S364]]\n\n  One might ask: Why are you spending so much time on this statistic? \nFor those who thought these alien contract workers were only temporary \nand only presented a challenge for the Northern Mariana Islands, \nreconsider for a moment because every one of these children is a U.S. \ncitizen because that child was born in the United States. As a \nconsequence, at some point in time, undoubtedly, they will come to the \nUnited States--either stay in the Mariana Islands or go back to China \nwith the mother and then reenter the United States at a later time \nbecause that child is a U.S. citizen.\n  That is a significant obligation that the United States picks up when \nit allows this type of immigration--young women coming into these \nsweatshops, working for a couple of years, and many of them becoming \npregnant and those children becoming U.S. citizens. Some of the women \nare likely married to U.S. citizens.\n  We do not know the circumstances of all, except for one fact, and \nthat fact is that each of them entered on to U.S. soil outside of our \nimmigration system. They did not come through our immigration system, \nbut they became U.S. citizens anyway.\n  I have another chart, and this is a chart of employment by private \nand public sectors. I think it is important that we recognize what we \nare looking at.\n\n  What has this economic boom that has occurred on the islands and \naccess to alien workers at low wages really meant? One thing it has \nmeant is a steady growth in employment.\n  I think this chart is illuminating. As you can see, in the public \nsector, virtually all the jobs have gone to U.S. citizens. This is the \npublic sector in blue. What is the public sector? The public sector is \ngovernment. That is where the U.S. citizens have found their jobs.\n  Many of the aliens are in the medical and health field. But most of \nthe private-sector jobs go to the aliens. The aliens, of course, are \nshown on the chart in red as non-U.S. citizens. That is where the \ngrowth has been in the private sector.\n  You probably would not be surprised to know there is a significant \ndifference in wages.\n  The July 1999 data I have from the Marianas Department of Commerce \nprovides mean-wage data for various sectors of the local economy.\n  For nondurable goods manufacturing, mean wages were about $2.51 per \nhour in 1980, $2.94 in 1990, and $2.33 in 1995.\n  For the same period, in restaurants, mean wages were $2.17 in 1980, \n$3.84 in 1990, and $3.80 in 1995.\n  For the public sector, however, mean wages were $4.03 in 1980, $9.20 \nin 1990, and $11.81 in 1995.\n  You can see the variance, where the higher wages are in the public \nsector. What has happened is that the public sector has been forced to \nexpand to provide jobs for local residents and increase the level of \nwages.\n  The Governor, when we were over there, noted, and in his testimony \nlater expressed, he was trying to trim the level of government but that \nit was difficult.\n  Salaries and related expenses consume over half the budget of the \nMarianas. They have a carryover deficit of about $70 million, I might \nadd. Even with the growth of the private sector to absorb local \nresidents seeking employment, it is simply not enough.\n  Let's look at Saipan's unemployment rate by citizenship. This chart \nshows the unemployment rate by citizenship from 1980. Again, the blue \nrepresents U.S. citizens. The red represents non-U.S. citizens. As you \ncan see, in 1980, after approval of the covenant but before the \ntrusteeship ended and the Marianas fully took over immigration, the \nunemployment rate for U.S. citizens was 3 percent.\n  By 1990, as immigration began to accelerate and businesses found you \ncould hire foreign labor on short-term contracts, the rate climbed to \n5.5 percent. By 1995, even with the significant expansion of the public \nsector, the rate soared to 13.3 percent.\n  As you may recall, the use of alien workers was also rising. Now we \nhave 12.6 percent unemployment.\n  I do not know how the Governor plans to trim the public-sector \nworkforce with that level of unemployment for U.S. citizens, but we \nwish him well. I know he is very serious about trying to deal with \nunemployment and the size of the government. This is one of the \nresults, however, of the current immigration system.\n  What Senator Akaka and I are proposing is legislation that is \nbipartisan. It has the support of the administration. As Senator \nBingaman noted, it was reported out of the committee unanimously. We \nattempted to address every legitimate concern that the Governor, the \nResident Representative, the Speaker of the House, and the President of \nthe Senate from the Marianas raised.\n\n  We also met with the business community and other leaders. \nThroughout, the general approach was to simply oppose the legislation. \nAs a consequence, what we have done is try to make changes to deal with \nconcerns that were raised by those I have mentioned.\n  Let me briefly go through some of the changes that are in the \ncommittee amendment.\n  First is the grandfathering for existing long-term workers.\n  One criticism of the current situation in the Marianas is that \nworkers can remain for extended periods--in effect, workers in \npermanent jobs--and therefore they have no political or civil rights.\n  Unlike the United States, the Marianas cannot provide for workers to \neventually become citizens and enter the community. To respond to that \ncomplaint, the Marianas have enacted laws to require all aliens to \nleave the Commonwealth after a certain timeframe.\n  One effect of that approach, however, is to frustrate the ability of \nthe employers to recruit, train, and hire personnel. From my \nexperience, I can personally testify that the last thing any employer \nwants to do is commit resources to training individuals only to have \nthem leave for other employment. It is far worse when the Government \nsays your most valuable employees not only must leave your employ but \nmust also leave the country as well.\n  The president of the Saipan Chamber of Commerce, Lynn Knight, noted \nthat she had one employee who had been with her firm for several years \nand would have to leave while another skilled professional could remain \nsince he was a U.S. citizen. Similar situations are likely in other \nbusinesses, and I would expect especially in the tourism industry.\n  To deal with that problem, the committee has included a special \nprovision--this is the new section 6(j) to the Covenant Act--that \nprovides a one-time grandfather provision for long-term employees in \nlegitimate businesses. The provision would allow employers to sponsor \ncurrent employees who have been employed for 5 years or more.\n  If the alien is otherwise eligible for admission to the United \nStates, that employee may be granted an immigrant visa or have his \nstatus adjusted to a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence \nwithout regard to any numerical limitations in the Immigration Act.\n  This provision would ensure that for those businesses that have long-\nterm employees and want to retain them, this legislation would mean \nnothing more than their employees would obtain green cards and be \nauthorized to work in the United States. I thank the chamber and Ms. \nKnight for highlighting this situation because I think this provision \nwill go a long way to ease the transition for legitimate businesses.\n  Briefly, I will list some of the other changes Senator Akaka and I \nmade through the hearing process to try to address and accommodate the \nlocal concerns of the people there. One is that the legislation limited \nposttransition relief to only the hotel industry. That has been \nexpanded to include not only legitimate businesses throughout the \ntourism industry but all other legitimate businesses in the \nCommonwealth as well.\n  Further, a new statement of policy to guide implementation has been \ninserted that makes clear that the transition from a nonresident \ncontract worker program is to be orderly and that potential adverse \neffects are to be minimized.\n  An explicit recognition of local self-government has been added \ntogether with more detailed requirements for consultation with local \nofficials and consideration of their views.\n\n[[Page S365]]\n\n  We have included a straightforward statement, at the request of the \nGovernor, that fundamental policy decisions regarding the direction and \npace of economic development and growth will be made by local officials \nand not dictated by the Federal Government.\n  Although the legislation limits the ability of the Attorney General \nto provide additional extension of the temporary worker program to two \n5-year periods for legitimate businesses in the tourism industry and \nfor a single 5-year period for other legitimate businesses, it also \nrequires the Attorney General to notify the Congress of the reasons for \nthe extension and whether we should consider providing additional \nauthority for further extensions.\n  A detailed technical assistance program is included to assist in the \ntransaction and to broaden and strengthen the local economy.\n  In addition to existing authorities and programs, the Secretary of \nCommerce is provided $200,000 in matching grants to assist in the \ndevelopment and implementation of a process to diversify and strengthen \nthe local economy. The Secretary is to consult not only with local \nofficials but also with local businesses, regional banks, and other \nexperts. Now the Secretary of Labor is involved. He is to provide an \nadditional $300,000 in matching grants to provide technical and other \nsupport for the training, recruitment, and hiring of persons authorized \nto work in the United States to fill jobs in the Commonwealth. In \naddition to local officials and businesses, the Secretary is to work \nwith the College of the Northern Marianas and the Secretary of \nCommerce.\n  A specific requirement has been included for the Federal Government \nto promote the Northern Marianas as a tourist destination. The resident \nrepresentative, Juan Babauta, was very forceful in advocating the need \nfor assistance to diversify and strengthen the local economy and \nprovide training for the workers even absent the legislation. Although \nhe and other officials oppose the legislation, I thank him and the \nothers for their concerns. I think they are well founded, and we have \nsought to try and deal with them.\n  I am not going to go into all the reasons why this legislation is \nneeded. I think they were fully laid out in the committee hearings and \nin our committee report. I do not ever want to see a situation where I \nhave to convene a closed hearing and hear from a young lady who is \nforced to endure what this particular young lady, coming over from \nChina, was forced to endure. The price of local control over Federal \nfunctions should not be measured in lost childhood and innocence.\n  I am not fully happy with how determined Federal law enforcement \npersonnel are, but I am encouraged by the inclusion of funding in their \nbudgets for the first time because they have been working under \nextraordinary circumstances of inadequate funds.\n  The General Counsel for the INS testified in strong support of this \nlegislation. I appreciate the technical assistance of their personnel \nand the provisions and material they have provided us.\n\n  It is probably appropriate to conclude with a few comments on the \nposition of some in the opposition, including control over borders and \nthe conditions to enter the United States, work and reside, and become \na citizen. Some suggest these are matters of Federal, not local, law. \nWell, this is not a matter of local self-government. In fact, by \nrequiring the Marianas to develop and implement an immigration system, \nwe diverted important resources they could have dedicated to important \nmatters of local concern, and seriously harmed local self-government.\n  Neither do I nor others believe the Marianas cannot have a healthy \nand diversified economy under Federal immigration laws. They certainly \ncan. The islands of the Marianas have the physical and human resources \nfor tourism, as well as the geographic location for other activities \nand businesses. We have provided in this bill the training and other \nassistance we think the Marianas will need.\n  Yes, there will be some changes, but in the long run, they will be \nfor the better for all the residents of the Marianas, and we will not \nhave under the U.S. flag the sweatshop conditions that exist there \ntoday. The only losers will be those who made their fortunes by \nexploiting the situation and exploiting the workers from China who live \nin conditions that are absolutely unsuitable and unacceptable under the \nAmerican flag. It is not a healthy economy when employment is 13 \npercent for local residents, and the only job opportunities seem to be \nin the area of local government. The current system is denying \nopportunities to the youth of the Marianas and will force them to leave \nhome for Guam or other areas to obtain work.\n  In conclusion, I particularly and personally thank Senator Akaka, who \nhas been such a strong advocate of reform and has patiently worked with \nus to make this a better bill. I urge my colleagues to adopt the \ncommittee amendment and the legislation. Again, I recognize my good \nfriend Senator Akaka, who is prepared to make an opening statement at \nthis time.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to our chairman, \nSenator Murkowski, for all he has done. He has given an extraordinary \nand accurate and descriptive report of our visit to CNMI. I will follow \nwith some remarks.\n  At this time, I yield to my friend from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, \nfor his remarks, to be recognized after he has concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today because I share the concern \nof many of my colleagues about the situation in the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands. I especially thank my colleagues from Alaska \nand Hawaii for their leadership, and I am very glad this legislation is \nbefore us. Allegations of human trafficking, grossly sub-standard \nworking conditions, deceitful recruitment practices, even indentured \nservitude, must be taken seriously--particularly when these practices \nare alleged to occur on American soil.\n\n  I also rise to highlight some very relevant issues about which I am \ndeeply concerned. As we consider the case of the CNMI, we must \nrecognize that there are other examples of this kind of international \nexploitation, and that such practices often find their roots in \norganized crime syndicates that span boundaries, and patterns of \ncorruption that cross borders.\n  In fact, according to a report issued by the nongovernmental \norganization, the Global Survival Network, on the situation in the \nCNMI,\n\n       . . . organized crime groups from the People's Republic of \n     China, South Asia, and Japan reap large profits from human \n     trafficking. Chinese provincial government agencies \n     reportedly collude with Chinese traffickers by pocketing a \n     percentage of passport fees paid by Chinese immigrants. \n     Chinese criminal groups have moved part of their operations \n     to the CNMI, where they operate significant gambling and \n     money-lending operations. Japanese organized crime groups \n     also operate in Saipan, where they control a large part of \n     the sex tourism sector.\n\n  Let this be a wake-up call for all of us--international crime is an \nincreasingly disturbing problem, and it is not something that happens \nonly in other parts of the world. This is an issue that I intend to \nwork on in the months ahead.\n  According to NGO estimates, between 1 million and 2 million women are \ntrafficked each year for the purposes of forced prostitution, many of \nthem from Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In \n1998, the FBI indicated that, of the Russian crime cases they had \ninvestigated abroad, 55 percent involved fraud, 22 percent money \nlaundering, and the rest murder, extortion, and the smuggling of \npeople, arms, and drugs. These kinds of activities are global \nphenomenon, and the United States is not immune to these forces.\n  Members of this body are all too familiar with the role of Colombian \nand Nigerian criminal organizations in the drug trade that casts a \nshadow over virtually every American community today--including my own \nhometown.\n  We have all been alarmed by last year's revelations about the \nlaundering of Russian money through U.S. banks. Recent reports indicate \nthat Poland is overwhelmed in its efforts to combat money laundering \nschemes--many of which have an international component.\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\n  In fact, some 170 Polish gangs have ties with criminal groups abroad. \nToo often, money-laundering schemes entail the buying-off of corrupt \nofficials, creating a cycle of complicity that undermines the rule of \nlaw, stability, and the very legitimacy of government itself.\n  Few would dispute the fact that corruption played a role in the Asian \nfinancial crisis of 1997 and 1998, or that it hampers political, \nsocial, and economic development throughout a region that I care deeply \nabout--sub-Saharan Africa, a region where international crime and \ncorruption often go hand-in-hand. The GAO has reported that Americans \nlose up to $2 billion per year to African-based white collar crime \nsyndicates. In Angola and Sierra Leone, corruption fuels the trade in \nillicit diamonds, which in turn finances brutally violent conflicts. \nThere can be no doubt that international crime and corruption are \ncritical security issues and economic issues--but there can also be no \ndoubt that they are human rights issues, and social development issues \nas well.\n  These patterns will increasingly have an impact on the lives of \nAmericans in this new century, and the manner in which we respond will \ndetermine, in part, the degree to which all people of all nations can \nachieve a better life in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I intend to look more closely at these trends in \ninternational crime and corruption in the months ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I thank my friend from the State of \nWisconsin for his statement. I also thank him for saying what he felt \nabout the CNMI.\n  I express my gratitude to the majority leader for scheduling this \nbill today and also the Democratic leader for supporting it. I look \nforward to working out this bill with my friend, the chairman, Senator \nMurkowski.\n  As we begin today's debate, I want to express my sincere thanks to \nthe leadership of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for \ntheir commitment to CNMI immigration reform. The Senator from Alaska, \nChairman Murkowski, and the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, \nunderstand that a great injustice is taking place far from the Nation's \nCapitol. That is why they have brought this legislation to the Senate \nfloor. Their efforts prove that they live by the words of one of our \nSenate titans, Daniel Webster, who proclaimed justice the ``great \ninterest of man on earth.''\n  Perhaps some Senators, and many viewers who are watching these \nproceedings in the gallery or on television, are wondering, ``Why is \nthe United States Senate--that great deliberative body in the world's \nstrongest democracy--taking time from its busy schedule to debate \nlegislation that affects a distant island community with a population \nof only 70,000 people?'' You might ask, ``Why don't we work on other \nimportant legislation, such as nuclear waste policy, judicial \nnominations, or health care for our armed forces?''\n  The answer to these questions is that conditions in the Commonwealth \nof the Northern Mariana are an affront to democratic values. The answer \nis that the CNMI immigration system has sparked international protests \nfrom our Pacific allies.\n  Immigration in the Commonwealth violates fundamental standards of \nmorality and human decency. That's why we must pass the reform measure \npending in the Senate.\n  Chairman Murkowski is a longstanding champion of CNMI immigration \nreform.\n  He is the only Senator in recent memory to visit the Commonwealth, \nwhere he witnessed the profound problems caused by their local \nimmigration law.\n  I doubt that many of my colleagues know very much about the CNMI, a \nU.S. Island territory located 1,500 miles south of Tokyo.\n  Those Senators who are familiar with the territory have probably read \nthe growing number of articles on the immigration and labor abuse in \nthe Commonwealth. Yet only Chairman Murkowski has visited the islands \nto get a first-hand understanding of their problems. I joined him on \nhis tour of the CNMI in February of 1996.\n  The statement that was made by the chairman on what we saw there, as \nI said, is accurate and very descriptive. It was a shame to see that a \npart of the United States is living under those conditions.\n  The legislation before us won't correct all of the Commonwealth's \nproblems, but it will address the most significant concern, immigration \nabuse. Chairman Murkowski is a man of the Pacific who understands the \nneed to have an immigration policy that reflects America values.\n  The states we represent, Alaska and Hawaii, are closest to our \nPacific neighbors, and we recognize the need to respond to problems \nthat generate strong protests from other Pacific nations. I am honored \nto join him as a cosponsor of S. 1052, legislation to reform \nimmigration abuses in the CNMI.\n  When the CNMI became a U.S. commonwealth in 1976, Congress granted it \nlocal control over immigration at the request of island leaders. This \nmeans that the Immigration and Nationality Act does not apply in the \nCNMI. We now know this decision was a great mistake.\n  Using its immigration authority, the Commonwealth has created a \nplantation economy that relies upon wholesale importation of low-paid, \nshort-term indentured workers. Indentured servitude, a practice \noutlawed in the United States over 100 years ago, had resurfaced in the \nCNMI.\n  Foreign workers pay up to $7,000 to employers or middlemen for the \nright to a job in the CNMI. When they finally reach the Commonwealth, \nthey are assigned to tedious, low paying work for long hours with \nlittle or no time off. At night they are locked in prison-like \nbarracks.\n  If they complain, they are subject to immediate deportation at the \nwhim of their employer.\n  Some arrive in the islands only to find that they were victims of an \nemployment scam. There are no jobs waiting for them, and no way to work \noff their bondage debt.\n  Concern about the CNMI's longstanding immigration problems has \nhistorically been bipartisan. In fact, officials in the Reagan \nadministration first sounded the alarm about the run-away immigration \npolicies that the Commonwealth adopted.\n  The administration of every President in the past 16 years--the \nReagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations--has consistently criticized \nthe Commonwealth's immigration policy.\n  Bipartisan studies have also condemned CNMI Immigration.\n  The Commission on Immigration Reform called the CNMI system of \nimmigration and indentured labor ``antithetical to American values.'' \nAccording to the Commission, no democratic society has an immigration \npolicy like the CNMI.\n  The closest equivalent is Kuwait, where foreign workers constitute a \nmajority of the workforce and suffer harsh and discriminatory treatment \nby the citizen population.\n  For this reason, the CNMI has also become an international \nembarrassment for the United States.\n  We have received complaints from the Philippines, Nepal, Sri Lanka, \nand Bangladesh about immigration abuse and the treatment of workers. \nThey failure of the Commonwealth to reform its immigration system has \nseriously tarnished our image in the region.\n  Concerns about the CNMI are not new. Perhaps we should be criticized \nfor not acting sooner. Yet, despite a 14-year effort by the Reagan, \nBush, and Clinton administrations to persuade the CNMI to correct \nimmigration problems, the problems persist.\n  After 14 years of waiting for the Commonwealth to implement reform, \nit is time for Congress to act. Statistics on Commonwealth immigration \nprovide compelling evidence of the need for reform.\n  Twenty years ago, the CNMI had a population of 15,000 citizens and \n2,000 alien workers.\n  Today, the citizen population stands at 28,000, but the alien worker \npopulation has mushroomed to 42,000. That's a 2,000 percent increase.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service reports that the CNMI has \nno reliable records of aliens entering the Commonwealth, how long they \nremain, and when, if ever, they depart. One CNMI official testified \nthat they have\n\n[[Page S367]]\n\n``no effective control'' over immigration in their islands.\n  The CNMI shares the American flag, but it does not share our \nimmigration system. When the Commonwealth became a territory of the \nUnited States, we allowed them to write their own immigration laws.\n  After twenty years of experience, the CNMI immigration experiment has \nfailed.\n  Conditions in the CNMI prompt the question whether the U.S. should \noperate a unified immigration system, or whether a U.S. territory \nshould be allowed to establish laws in conflict with national \nimmigration policy.\n  Common sense tells us that a unified system is the only answer. If \nPuerto Rico, or Hawaii, or Arizona, or Oklahoma could write their own \nimmigration laws--and give work visas to foreigners--our national \nimmigration system would be in chaos.\n  America is one country. We need a uniform immigration system, not one \nsystem for the 50 states and another system for one of our territories.\n  I don't represent the CNMI, but the Commonwealth is Hawaii's \nbackyard. I speak as a friend and neighbor when I say that this policy \ncannot continue. The CNMI system of indentured immigrant labor is \nmorally wrong, and violates basic democratic principles.\n  We hope that our colleagues will hear our voices and will join us in \npassing S. 1052.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been a long-time critic of the \nNavy's F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet program. For years, I have come to the \nfloor to highlight this program's shortcomings, and I have offered \nbills to kill the program and amendments to try to achieve greater \nscrutiny over the program. Sometimes my colleagues have agreed with me, \nand more often than not, they have not on this particular issue. I \nunderstand that, in all probability, the Super Hornet program will get \nits final green light this spring, and it will go into full-rate \nproduction.\n  However, I will continue to fight for responsible defense spending \nand continue to try to enlighten my colleagues about this inferior, \nunnecessary, and expensive program.\n  With that in mind, I have asked Secretary Cohen to delay his \nproduction decision until he reviews a GAO audit of the Super Hornet \nprogram's Operational Evaluation.\n  I will read an opinion-editorial by Lieutenant Colonel Jay Stout, a \nhighly-regarded, active duty Marine fighter pilot of the F/A-18C, and \ncombat veteran. The Virginian-Pilot published his opinions this past \nDecember.\n  Rear Admiral J.B. Nathman, the Navy's director of air warfare, wrote \nthe requisite, tired response, with a little personal invective thrown \nin.\n  A subsequent piece by James Stevenson, a well-known aviation writer, \nrebuts each of Admiral Nathman's arguments. I will read Stevenson's \nletter, as well.\n  I will read the article by Mr. Stout, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat two other articles, plus a December 13, 1999, article from \nBusiness Week be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The first article is Mr. Stout's piece from the \nVirginian-Pilot entitled, ``The Navy's Super Fighter Is A Super \nFailure.''\n  The article reads as follows:\n\n       I am a fighter pilot. I love fighter aircraft. But even \n     though my service--I am a Marine--doesn't have a dog in the \n     fight, it is difficult to watch the grotesquerie that is the \n     procurement of the Navy's new strike-fighter, the F/A-18 E/F \n     Super Hornet.\n       Billed as the Navy's strike-fighter of the future, the F/A-\n     18 E/F is instead an expensive failure--a travesty of \n     subterfuge and poor leadership. Intended to overcome any \n     potential adversaries during the next 20 years, the aircraft \n     is instead outperformed by a number of already operational \n     aircraft--including the fighter it is scheduled to replace, \n     the original F/A-18 Hornet.\n       The Super Hornet concept was spawned in 1992, in part, as a \n     replacement for the 30 year-old A-6 Intruder medium bomber. \n     Though it had provided yeoman service since the early 1960s, \n     the A-6 was aging and on its way to retirement by the end of \n     the Gulf War in 1991. The Navy earlier tried to develop a \n     replacement during the 1980s--the A-12--but bungled the \n     project so badly that the whole mess was scrapped in 1991. \n     The A-12 fiasco cost the taxpayers $5 billion and cost the \n     Navy what little reputation it had as a service that could \n     wisely spend taxpayer dollars.\n       Nevertheless, the requirement for an A-6 replacement \n     remains. Without an aircraft with a longer range and greater \n     payload than the current F/A-18, the Navy lost much of its \n     offensive punch. Consequently it turned to the original F/A-\n     18--a combat-proven performer, but a short-ranged light \n     bomber when compared to the A-6. Still stinging from the A-12 \n     debacle, the Navy tried to ``put one over'' on Congress by \n     passing off a completely redesigned aircraft--the Super \n     Hornet--as simply a modification of the original Hornet.\n       The obfuscation worked. Many in Congress were fooled into \n     believing that the new aircraft was just what the Navy told \n     them it was--a modified Hornet. In fact, the new airplane is \n     much larger--built that way to carry more fuel and bombs--is \n     much different aerodynamically, has new engines and engine \n     intakes and a completely reworked internal structure. In \n     short, the Super Hornet and the original Hornet are two \n     completely different aircraft despite their similar \n     appearance.\n       Though the deception worked, the new aircraft--the Super \n     Hornet--does not. Because it was never prototyped--at the \n     Navy's insistence--its faults were not evident until \n     production aircraft rolled out of the factory. Among the \n     problems the aircraft experienced was the publicized \n     phenomenon of ``wing drop''--a spurious, uncommanded roll, \n     which occurred in the heart of the aircraft's performance \n     envelope. After a great deal of negative press, the Super \n     Hornet team devised a ``band-aid'' fix that mitigated the \n     problem at the expense of performance tradeoffs in other \n     regimes of flight. Regardless, the redesigned wing is a \n     mish-mash of aerodynamic compromises which does nothing \n     well. And the Super Hornet's wing drop problem is minor \n     compared to other shortfalls. First, the aircraft is \n     slow--slower than most fighters fielded since the early \n     1960s. In that one of the most oft-uttered maxims of the \n     fighter pilot fraternity is that ``Speed is Life,'' this \n     deficiency is alarming.\n       But the Super Hornet's wheezing performance against the \n     speed clock isn't its only flaw. If speed is indeed life, \n     then maneuverability is the reason that life is worth living \n     for the fighter pilot. In a dog fight, superior \n     maneuverability allows a pilot to bring his weapons to bear \n     against the enemy. With its heavy, aerodynamically \n     compromised airframe, and inadequate engines, the Super \n     Hornet won't win many dogfights. Indeed, it can be \n     outmaneuvered by nearly every front-line fighter fielded \n     today.\n       ``But the Super Hornet isn't just a fighter,'' its \n     proponents will counter. ``It is a bomber as well.'' True, \n     the new aircraft carries more bombs than the current F/A-18--\n     but not dramatically more, or dramatically further. The \n     engineering can be studied, but the laws of physics don't \n     change for anyone--certainly not the Navy. From the \n     beginning, the aircraft was incapable of doing what the Navy \n     wanted. And they knew it.\n       The Navy doesn't appear to be worried about the performance \n     shortfalls of the Super Hornet. The aircraft is supposed to \n     be so full of technological wizardry that the enemy will be \n     overwhelmed by its superior weapons. That is the same \n     argument that was used prior to the Vietnam War. This logic \n     fell flat when our large, expensive fighters--the most \n     sophisticated in the world--started falling to peasants \n     flying simple aircraft designed during the Korean conflict.\n       Further drawing into question the Navy's position that \n     flight performance is secondary to the technological \n     sophistication of the aircraft, are the Air Forces' \n     specifications for its new--albeit expensive--fighter, the F-\n     22. The Air Force has ensured that the F-22 has top-notch \n     flight performance, as well as a weapons suite second to \n     none. It truly has no rivals in the foreseeable future.\n       The Super Hornet's shortcomings have been borne out \n     anecdotally. There are numerous stories, but one episode sums \n     it up nicely. Said one crew member who flew a standard Hornet \n     alongside new Super Hornets: ``We outran them, we out-flew \n     them, and we ran them out of gas. I was embarrassed for those \n     pilots.'' These shortcomings are tacitly acknowledged around \n     the fleet where the aircraft is referred to as the ``Super-\n     Slow Hornet.''\n       What about the rank-and-file Navy fliers? What are they \n     told when they question the Super Hornet's shortcomings? The \n     standard reply is, ``Climb aboard, sit down, and shut up. \n     This is our fighter, and you're going to make it work.'' Can \n     there be any wondering at the widespread disgust with the \n     Navy's\n\n[[Page S368]]\n\n     leadership and the hemorrhaging exodus of its fliers?\n       Unfortunately, much of the damage has been done. Billions \n     of dollars have been spent on the Super Hornet that could \n     have been spent on maintaining or upgrading the Navy's \n     current fleet of aircraft. Instead, unacceptable numbers of \n     aircraft are sidelined for want of money to buy spare parts. \n     Paradoxically, much of what the Navy wanted in the Super \n     Hornet could have been obtained, at a fraction of the cost, \n     by upgrading the current aircraft--what the Navy said it was \n     going to do at the beginning of this mess.\n       Our military's aircraft acquisition program cannot afford \n     all the proposed acquisitions. Some hard decisions will have \n     to be made. The Super Hornet decision, at a savings of \n     billions of dollars, should be an easy one.\n\n  Again, what I have just been reading for several minutes is an op-ed \nfrom Lt. Col. Jay Stout, somebody who actually knows this airplane \nwell.\n  Now I would like to read a brief letter that rebuts Admiral Nathman's \nletter, which was in response to Lt. Col. Jay Stout's piece.\n  In his response to Lt. Col. Jay Stout's Dec. 15 op-ed criticism of \nthe F-18E Super Hornet, Rear Adm. John Nathman accused Stout (letter, \nDec. 23) of ``unfounded assertions.''\n  What this letter then says is:\n\n       Nathman claimed that the F-18E has completed ``the most \n     rigorous and scrutinized process of procurement, acquisition \n     and evaluation in recent Department of Defense and naval \n     history.'' On the contrary, the F-18E was initially rejected \n     by the Navy and only rushed into the budget at the last \n     minute when the A-12 was canceled.\n       In the fall of 1990, the Navy re-examined its requirements \n     for a deep strike aircraft. It dismissed the F-18E as \n     unacceptable in both range and stealth. As to stealth, it \n     concluded that ordnance hanging under the F-18E would provide \n     too good a target on radar.\n       When then Defense Secretary Richard Cheney canceled the A-\n     12, the Navy pushed the F-18E onto center stage, ignoring \n     regulations that required a new design number for ``major \n     design changes within the same mission category.'' Instead, \n     the Navy gave the new aircraft a new series letter, to make \n     this new aircraft appear as a mere modification. The Navy did \n     this to avoid approximately 25 specific oversight steps.\n       In so doing, the Navy insured that the F-18E would avoid, \n     from its inception, the ``scrutinized process of procurement, \n     acquisition and evaluation,'' about which Nathman wrote.\n       The Navy's attempt to minimize oversight extended to the \n     Congress. The Navy flight test director, in October 1996 and \n     March 1997, issued two F-18E deficiency reports. In spite of \n     these reports, the Chief of Naval Operations wrote four \n     months later to the chairman of the Senate National Security \n     Committee as follows:\n       The F/A-18 E/F has flawlessly progressed through every \n     required milestone to include operational requirements, \n     mission needs, cost and threat analysis, and engine \n     development . . . Testing results have clearly exceeded all \n     specific performance parameters.\n       Rear Adm. Nathman states that the F-18E has 40 percent more \n     range. Such a statement is misleading. In 1993, the Navy \n     admitted that under the same conditions and weapons loads, \n     the promised range of the F-18E was between 15 and 19 percent \n     less than the original F-18A specification.\n       It remains for Nathman to provide evidence that the F-18E's \n     performance is now greater than its 1993 promise.\n       Finally, Nathman complained that Stout wrote his article \n     ``without checking some readily available factual \n     information.'' From what we have seen, even those charged \n     with oversight--our congressmen--cannot obtain ``readily \n     available factual information.'' Stout got his information \n     from sources that are more reliable than the CNO's \n     communication with Congress.\n       If Stout had continued his investigation, he would have \n     learned that far from pushing ``current technology to its \n     limit,'' the Navy will give future naval aviation--for twice \n     the program unit cost--an airplane that, below 20,000 feet \n     with pylons on, cannot fly supersonic. There is some question \n     as to whether this fact is included within the ``readily \n     available'' information of which Nathman spoke.\n\n  Madam President, that is the response of James Stevenson to the \nNavy's letter questioning Lt. Col. Jay Stout's comments. I offer these \nas evidence that we are about to embark on an F/A-18E and F airplane \nthat, frankly, after having been looked at for several years, at best \nis not better than the current plane, and probably is worse, and is \nenormously more expensive than continuing with the FA-18C and D plane.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Virginian-Pilot, Dec. 23, 1999]\n\n        Look at the Facts: The Navy's New Hornet Is Super Indeed\n\n                     (By Rear Admiral J.B. Nathman)\n\n       It is healthy to bring opposing views forward in open and \n     honest discussion. Unfortunately, this was not the case in a \n     Dec. 15 op-ed column on the F-18E/F Super Hornet. (``The \n     Navy's super fighter is a super failure''). This article was \n     apparently written without checking some readily available \n     factual information.\n       As the one responsible for establishing naval aviation \n     requirements, I can set the record straight with regard to \n     the performance and warfighting capabilities of the Super \n     Hornet. I would also like to speak for the thousands of \n     individuals, both military and civilian, whose efforts were \n     involved in bringing the Super Hornet's warfighting \n     capability to our Naval Air Force.\n       The F-18E/F Super Hornet has just completed the most \n     rigorous and scrutinized process of procurement, acquisition \n     and evaluation in recent Department of Defense and naval \n     history. Going into the final evaluation process, the Super \n     Hornet met or exceeded every established performance \n     milestone. The Super Hornet was designed from Day One to be a \n     decisive strike-fighter, equipped to handle the threats and \n     win in today's environment and for the foreseeable future.\n       Achieving this goal required years of planning and pushed \n     current technology to its limits to obtain the most combat \n     ``bang for the buck'' for the US Navy and American taxpayer. \n     As compared to the current model F-18, proven enhancements \n     include:\n       40 percent increase in mission combat radius.\n       50 percent increase in combat on-station time.\n       Three times the carrier recovery payload--safer carrier \n     operations for our pilots.\n       Improved survivability, lethality and greater penetration \n     into the enemy's battle space.\n       Growth potential for future combat enhancements and mission \n     requirements.\n       In today's environment, the calculus of combat \n     effectiveness is much more than just speed. With its superb \n     combat maneuverability, radar and weapons systems, impressive \n     suite of electronic countermeasures, ability to withstand \n     greater combat damage and increased fuel capacity, the Super \n     Hornet is not only more survivable but three to five times \n     more combat effective than any other naval aircraft in the \n     inventory.\n       The author's unfounded assertions with regard to \n     performance are simply not borne out by the facts and do not \n     reflect the performance of the combat-ready Super Hornet.\n       Naval Aviation has made tough but sound choices with the \n     Super Hornet program. Some trade-offs are inevitable and \n     appropriate, particularly in an austere defense budget \n     climate, but this aircraft answers the Navy's needs.\n       The F/A-18E/F is an outstanding investment for the American \n     taxpayer and will serve as a model for future Navy programs \n     and procurement. The Super Hornet is being delivered on time, \n     on budget and is at the heart of naval aviation's ability to \n     fight and win in the 21st Century.\n       In the final analysis, hard fact--not innuendo, anecdote or \n     rumor--will establish the operational supremacy of this \n     aircraft. By every measure, Boeing and the Navy's new Hornet \n     are indeed super. The aircraft is in great shape as it \n     completes final evaluation.\n       Because the Virginian-Pilot is read by thousands of men and \n     women in the naval aviation community, both active-duty and \n     retired, I felt it was my responsibility to respond to a \n     column riddled with inaccuracies.\n\n                  [From Business Week, Dec. 13, 1999]\n\n   The (Not So) Super Hornet--Why the Navy Is Spending Billions on a \n   Fighter Jet With Flaws That Costs Twice as Much as Its Predecessor\n\n                            (By Stan Crock)\n\n       Pentagon analyst Frnaklin C. Spinney remembers the \n     conversation with crystal clarity. Over dinner with a Marine \n     flier in late 1991, talk turned to Navy plans for a new \n     version of the F-18 Hornet. Earlier in the year, the Pentagon \n     had killed the new A-12 bomber. Other Navy planes were \n     decades old. And the service thought existing F/A-18s \n     couldn't fly long-range missions. To fill carrier decks, the \n     Navy decided to rely on an upgrade of the F-18 used by the \n     fabled Blue Angels. ``We've got to have this even if it \n     doesn't work,'' the pilot confided.\n       How prophetic. On Nov. 16, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet \n     finished operational-evaluation flights, the last step before \n     full production, set for this spring. And Congress in \n     September approved a five-year, $9 billion authorization for \n     the fighter-attack aircraft, which will cost $47 billion \n     through 2010. But by many accounts, the $53 million-a-copy \n     plane is only slightly better than its predecessor, the F/A-\n     18C/D (table, page 136), which costs half as much. And the E/\n     F's flying performance ``is almost unambiguously a step \n     backward,'' says Spinney.\n       As a debate rages on Capitol Hill over thee Pentagon's \n     ambitious plans to buy three new aircraft for an astounding \n     $340 billion over the next three decades, Boeing Co.'s Super \n     Hornet has managed to fly under the radar with political, if \n     not technological, stealth. The saga of how it has done so \n     shows just how hard it will be to kill off any of the three: \n     the Super Hornet, the Air Force's F-22 Raptor, and the Joint \n     Strike Fighter. The ingredients of the F/A-18E/F's tale \n     include a Navy anxious not to cede missions to the Air Force, \n     an ailing defense contractor, and lawmakers looking to \n     preserve defense jobs.\n       The Pentagon and Boeing staunchly defend the program. The \n     E/F won a Pentagon award in 1996 for excellence in \n     engineering and development. And supporters note it's on \n     schedule and under budget. Says Patrick J. Finneran, Boeing's \n     F-18 czar: ``This thing gets gold stars.''\n       The General Accounting Office, Congress' watchdog agency, \n     begs to differ. It noted in\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\n     a June, 1999, report that as full production neared, the \n     plane had 84 deficiencies, including radar that couldn't tell \n     the direction of oncoming threats. It recommended--in vain--\n     that Congress reject a multiyear commitment to the program. \n     Critics say one reason for the Super Hornet's woes is that \n     the Navy dubbed the E/F a modification of its C/D \n     predecessor. That was true even though the E/F has a \n     different wing, fuselage, and engine, and is 25% heavier. \n     About 85% of the wing and airframe components are different \n     from those of the F/A-18C/D, according to an analysis by the \n     Cato Institute, a conservative think tank. All of this led \n     some experts to say it's a new aircraft.\n       Reeling. But a new plane would have been harder to sell to \n     Congress and wouldn't have been exempt from some lengthy \n     procurement requirements. Most important, St. Louis-based \n     McDonnell Douglas Corp., the F-18's builder, would not have \n     been guaranteed the work. At the time, McDonnell Douglas, \n     which Boeing acquired in 1997, was reeling from cost overruns \n     on other programs and the A-12's termination.\n       The shorter procurement process for a modification meant \n     McDonnell Douglas didn't have to build a prototype to help \n     iron our kinks. The risks from this approach became apparent \n     in March, 1996, during the Super Hornet's seventh test \n     flight. The plane suddenly started to roll as it approached \n     supersonic speed. A blue-ribbon panel said in a Jan. 14, \n     1998, report that the wing-drop phenomenon ``could put flight \n     safety at risk.'' And the flaw would make it tough for pilots \n     to track enemy aircraft.\n       The Navy downplays the issue, saying wing drops had cropped \n     up--and been solved--in previous programs. But fixing the \n     problem proved difficult. One solution--a new wing covering--\n     caused yet another problem: vibrations so severe that pilots \n     had trouble reading the display.\n       Another shrewd Navy ploy was to lower the bar for \n     performance standards. When the Navy brass debated whether \n     the E/F should be required to turn, climb, accelerate, and \n     maneuver better than the C/D version, Vice Admiral Dennis V. \n     McGinn, then the head of naval air warfare, rejected all but \n     acceleration. A good thing, too, because the E/F doesn't \n     perform so well in the other areas. In a Jan. 19, 1999, memo, \n     Phillip E. Coyle, a top Defense Dept. weapon systems \n     evaluator, says such Russian fighters as the Su-27 and Mig-9 \n     ``can accelerate faster and out-turn all variants of the F/A-\n     18 in most operating regimes.'' The memo says while that's \n     the price for more payload and range, the Navy plans to use \n     air-combat tactics that won't require the capabilities of the \n     earlier F/A-18 models.\n       Despite efforts to compensate for shortcomings, a July, \n     1997, report by an advisory board of Pentagon and contractor \n     representatives warned that evaluators may find the plane \n     ``not operationally effective'' even if it meets all \n     requirements. One solution proposed: ``aggressive \n     indoctrination of operational community to help them match \n     expectation to reality of F/A-18E/F.'' Translation: Lower \n     pilots' expectations.\n       Early on, one of the Super Hornet's key selling points was \n     a project that the plane would fly 40% farther than its \n     predecessor. But the longer-range figure assumed that 80% of \n     the fleet would be one-seater planes. One-seaters carry more \n     fuel than two-seaters and thus can fly farther. But now the \n     Navy wants just 55% of the fleet to be one-seaters. While \n     this lets it replace the ancient F-15 Tomcat--a two-seater--\n     it undercuts the longer-range promises. In actual \n     performance, the one-seater shows a range of 444 nautical \n     miles, only 20% above the older F/A-18C's 369-mile range, the \n     GAO says.\n       The Navy also says the E/F will have 17 cubic feet more \n     room for high-tech gear than the C/D. But the GAO found only \n     5.46 cubic feet were usable--and that nearly every upgrade \n     could be installed on the C/D. And the Navy claims that the \n     Super Hornet performs a crucial function better than the C/D: \n     Returning to a carrier with unusual munitions. But critics \n     say it would be cheaper to dump the bombs in the ocean than \n     to pay $30 million extra for the E/F.\n       Boeing's Finneran disputes the GAO's findings. He says \n     recent tests show the planes have exceeded range goals, and \n     he rejects the notion that the C/D has the space to be \n     upgraded. Still, looking at the broad picture, former \n     National Security Adviser Brent Scowcraft would kill the \n     program because the E/F ``has the least modernization'' of \n     the three new planes under development.\n       The Super Hornet has plenty of support on Capitol Hill, \n     though. When a House National Security subcommittee \n     threatened funding for the program in 1996, House Minority \n     Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri called every Democrat \n     on the full committee. Representative Jim Talent (R-Mo.) \n     collard his GOP brethren. The funding cuts were restored. \n     Even GOP Presidential hopeful Senator John McCain, who often \n     attacks Pentagon waste, backs the program.\n       The upshot? The Navy will get its plane, regardless of how \n     it works. But Marine pilots won't fly it. They're waiting for \n     the stealthy Joint Strike Fighter, slated for production \n     around 2008. ``If we were going to spend dollars, we wanted \n     to spend them on something that was a leap in technology,'' \n     says recently retired General Charles C. Krulak, a former \n     Marine commandant who opted not to buy the Super Hornet. \n     Indeed, Marine pilots' fears now are quite different from \n     those Spinney heard in 1991. ``If the Joint Strike Fighter \n     dies,'' frets one airman, ``we're stuck with the Super \n     Hornet.''\n\n\n                            words of warning\n\n       Official Evaluation--The Operational Test and Evaluation \n     Force ``may find the F/A-18E/F not operationally effective/\n     suitable even though all specification requirements are \n     satisfied'' Translation--This plane may have plenty of \n     problems even if it meets our specs.\n       Official Evaluation--How to mitigate the problem: \n     ``aggressive indoctrination of operational community to help \n     them match expectation to reality of F/A-18E/F.'' \n     Translation--We oversold this plane and now need to lower \n     pilots expectations.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \nincreasing the minimum wage. I am aware that the bankruptcy reform bill \nthat we recently passed in this chamber contains an amendment that will \nincrease the minimum wage by $1 over a three-year period. While I voted \nfor passage of the final bill, the minimum wage amendment it contained \nwas constructed in a way that is sure to draw a Presidential veto, \nthereby endangering not only a wage increase for working families but \nalso the months of work that all of us have put into reforming our \nbankruptcy laws.\n  The amendment that the bill contained was deeply flawed. I hope that \nthe amendment will be stripped in conference so that we can send a \nbankruptcy reform bill to the President that he will sign. Then, \nperhaps we can move forward on a real increase in the minimum wage, \nperhaps in a package that contains some meaningful tax cuts for small \nbusiness.\n  Madam President, we are living in a time of unprecedented economic \nprosperity. A few days ago, we reached an important milestone: We are \nnow enjoying the longest economic expansion in our nation's history. \nEconomic growth has been so strong that in 17 of the last 24 quarters, \nreal GDP grew at a rate of three percent or more. Innovation, \nproductivity, and fiscal discipline have all contributed to this \nexpansion. Unemployment is at historic lows, real wages are increasing \nfor many, and we have replaced welfare with work in record numbers.\n  But not everyone is realizing the prosperity many have enjoyed. While \nmany workers in the economy have enjoyed sizeable raises, those workers \nat the bottom are still working hard just to make ends meet. Consider a \nminimum wage worker, working 40 hours a week. We want this worker to \nstay off of welfare, to be a responsible citizen and contribute to \nsociety, yet the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour allows this worker to \nearn just $10,700--nearly $3,000 below the poverty level for a family \nof three. Add to this the fact that most of these workers receive no \npension or paid vacation, few receive child care, and many lack \nemployer-provided health insurance. There is no question that it is \nvery difficult in our society to be a worker at the very bottom of the \nincome scale.\n  It is important that we recognize the contributions that these \nworkers make to our economy and our society, and that we act to ensure \nthat the purchasing power of their income does not erode over time. \nToday's minimum wage is more than 20 percent lower in real terms than \nit was in 1979. The proposed increase to $6.15 simply restores the \nminimum wage back to its purchasing power in 1982. Would any of us deny \nthat it's just as tough, or tougher, for a low-income family to make \nends meet today as it was in 1982?\n  Raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour will directly help more than \n11 million workers and their families, as well as the millions more \nearning between the current minimum of $5.15 and the new minimum of \n$6.15 who will also see their wages rise. It will reward the \nresponsibility of these workers with a more living wage. It will send \nthe message that we understand that being a member of the ``working \npoor'' is one of the toughest places to be in America, with obstacles \nto reaching the middle class turning up at every turn. Raising the \nminimum wage would reduce one such obstacle. Nearly 200,000 workers in \nIndiana would benefit directly from a minimum wage increase.\n  Some argue that raising the minimum wage will lead to higher \nunemployment. I am happy to say that has not been the case in Indiana. \nSince September 1996, the last time the Senate passed a minimum wage \nincrease, 133,000 new jobs have been created in my home state. \nUnemployment has dropped by 26 percent and now stands at 2.9 percent, \nsignificantly lower than the national average.\n  The good news in this debate is that it appears we all agree the \nminimum wage should be increased. We have our differences over the \ntiming but by and large both Republicans and Democrats realize it is \ntime to make work pay.\n  The bad news is that there is a poison pill buried in this \nlegislation. At the same time that they seek to raise the take home pay \nof working families, the Republican minimum wage proposal contains a \nprovision that could reduce the wages of approximately 73 million \nAmerican workers who are eligible to receive overtime pay.\n  This overtime pay repeal provision would allow employers to eliminate \nthe requirement that bonuses, commissions, and other forms of \ncompensation based on productivity, quality and efficiency be part of a \nworker's ``regular rate'' of pay for purposes of calculating overtime \npay. Eliminating this provision, and allowing bonuses to be excluded \nfrom overtime pay, would nullify the purposes for which the Fair Labor \nStandards Act was created. Employers would be provided an incentive to \nslash hourly pay rates or reduce the number of new jobs they create. \nSuch cynical actions explain why so many Americans are frustrated with \npolitics.\n  Raising the minimum wage is something that most Americans regard as \nfair, given our economic prosperity, and 75 to 80 percent support an \nincrease in every opinion poll. Yet some refuse\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\nto act in a way that genuinely responds to this concern. What's more, \nthe bill in its current form will almost certainly provoke a \npresidential veto.\n  Madam President, we have been down this road before. Both sides agree \non an issue that needs to be addressed and then allow a partisan \nsquabble to prevent us from getting it done. The American people did \nnot send us here to spend all of our time arguing over our differences. \nThey sent us here--and I came here--to find the common ground on which \nwe agree.\n  Now that the bankruptcy reform bill has passed the Senate, I urge my \ncolleagues to work these issues out in conference. Let's begin the year \nfocused not on what divides us but what unites us in the interests of \nAmerica's working families.\n  Madam President, I want to also take a moment to discuss the Hatch \nAmendment that is now part of this legislation. While I believe that \nthe methamphetamine provisions of this amendment are good and something \nI could support, I voted against this amendment last year for I do not \nsupport the voucher language contained in this amendment. I do not \nsupport diverting needed resources from our public schools for voucher \nproposals. Deserting our public schools is not the answer to the \nproblem. I believe we need greater flexibility and greater \naccountability in our nation's schools. This voucher language is of \ngreat concern to me. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will do the \nright thing and remove the voucher language from this bill during \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S374-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SAVINGS FOR WORKING FAMILIES ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, this week, I joined with my good \nfriends, Senator Lieberman and Senator Santorum, to introduce the \nSavings for Working Families Act of 2000. This important legislation \nwould enable low-income working Americans to increase their savings and \nbuild assets, thus allowing them to enter and become a contributing \npart of America's economic mainstream and benefit from its \nunprecedented period of economic growth.\n  Right now, despite the fact that the net worth of American families \nhas increased dramatically over recent years, the net worth of families \nwith incomes below $25,000 per year has actually decreased. As many as \n20 percent of American families are ``unbanked''--meaning that they do \nnot have either a checking or a savings account.\n  This disparity has had a severe and damaging affect not only on the \nability of lower-income Americans to obtain financial assets but it has \ndrastically reduced the chances of the working poor to achieve upper, \nor even middle class status. Even more distressing is the impact this \ndisparity has had on children and minorities: one-third of all American \nhouseholds, and 60 percent of African-American households, have zero or \nnegative net financial assets and 40 percent of all white children, and \na staggering 73 percent of all Black children, grow up in households \nwith zero or negative net financial assets.\n  The lack of financial assets creates almost insurmountable obstacles \nagainst purchasing a home, starting a small business or investing in a \npost-secondary education--all investments which would enable these \nfamilies to better their economic status and fully participate in the \nAmerican dream, a dream which should be available to all American's \nwilling to put forth the effort and initiative.\n  And, Madam President, providing economic opportunity to all Americans \nis not only the right thing to do morally, but it is the right thing to \ndo economically. Not only will this legislation empower our lower-\nincome working Americans but it will benefit the entire society in the \nform of new businesses, new jobs, increased earnings, greater tax \nrevenue, reduced welfare expenditures and a higher national savings \nrate. Case-in-point, Mr. President, IDAs yield over $5 for every $1 \ninvested.\n  Simply put, Madam President, without productive assets such as a \nhome, a college education or a business upon which to build a \nsuccessful financial future, the working poor may continue to work but \nthey will also continue to remain poor.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, the Savings for Working \nFamilies Act of 2000, recognizes the need to invest in the working \npoor: empower them with the ability to build assets, own a piece of \ntheir neighborhood and achieve wealth.\n  Specifically, this legislation would establish Individual Development \nAccounts for poorer Americans, through which account holders can \ndeposit any discretionary earned income and their Earned Income Tax \nCredit refund and have up to $500 of their savings matched, each year, \nby a financial institution. A tax credit would be made available to \nfinancial institutions and for investment in qualified non-profits \nadministering qualified IDA programs, in order to provide incentives to \nmatch, dollar-for-dollar, IDA account savings, up to $500 per person \nper year.\n  In order to promote asset building, the matched savings accounts \nwould be restricted to buying a first home, receiving post-secondary \neducation or training, or starting a small business. In addition, \naccount holders would participate in classes designed to increase their \nfinancial literacy and better prepare them for full and successful \nparticipation in the mainstream economy.\n  Madam President, I am also pleased to note that Congress has already \nrecognized the important contributions that IDAs make to our \ncommunities and our economy in several important ways. In 1996, \nCongress included in the 1996 welfare overhaul law, a provision \nallowing states to include IDAs in their Temporary Assistance to Needy \nFamilies (TANF)--welfare-to-work--plans. Since then, 28 states have \nincluded IDAs in their state TANF plans, 27 states have passed some \nform of IDA legislation, and five more states have IDA legislation \npending. In addition, Congress established the Assets for Independence \nAct in 1998, which provided $125 million over 5 years for IDA \ndemonstration programs. This Act is expected to reach an additional \n30,000 to 40,000 working-poor Americans by 2003.\n  Last summer, the Senate tax bill included a provision, similar to \nthis bill, which would also have established tax incentives to \nencourage financial institutions to match the savings of lower-income \naccount holders. I feel privileged to have voted for the tax bill, \nwhich included many pro-family and pro-community provisions such as the \nestablishment of the Individual Development Accounts.\n  Lastly, I am proud to be the lead sponsor of comprehensive bi-\npartisan and bi-cameral community development and renewal legislation, \nthe American Community Renewal Act, which includes IDAs as a means by \nwhich communities can help themselves. Please allow me to take this \nopportunity and thank Senators Lieberman and Santorum for their \ncontinued support and effort of IDAs and the American Community Renewal \nAct.\n  In closing, Madam President, the Savings for Working Families Act of \n2000 provides a common sense long-term solution by providing working \nlower-income Americans the education and the tools by which they gain \nthe financial know-how necessary to succeed in today's economy.\n  It is important to recognize that achieving family development, \nneighborhood revitalization and community resurgence begins by \nempowering people to help themselves--this legislation provides this \nopportunity. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues this \nsession to ensure the passage of the Savings for Working Families Act \ninto law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S374-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S374-S375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

This budget upholds my \npolicy of fiscal discipline and promises new opportunity for our \nNation.\n  We have made great progress in the last seven years, rejecting the \nfiscal disarray of an earlier era and in its place, asserting a \nsteadfast commitment to live within our means, balance the budget, and \nuphold fiscal discipline. As a result, we have created the conditions \nfor unprecedented prosperity. The longest peacetime economic expansion \nin American history has produced more than 20 million new jobs. \nUnemployment has hit its lowest level in a generation. Today, more \nAmericans own their own homes than ever before in our Nation's history.\n  Our success in reversing what once seemed to be uncontrollable growth \nin the Federal budget deficit has created more than prosperity. We have \nrestored to America a spirit of purpose and confidence. This is a rare \nmoment in history. Few nations are blessed with a combination of \neconomic prosperity and social stability at home and with the security \nof a relatively peaceful world. It is time to make the most of this \nmoment of promise to extend prosperity to all corners of our Nation.\n  My first budget of the new century is built upon a commitment to \nexpanding opportunity, promoting responsibility, and building \ncommunity. It includes my New Markets Initiative, which relies on \npublic and private sector cooperation to spur economic development in \nareas of our Nation that have not yet fully benefited from this wave of \nprosperity. It includes an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit to \nlift more hard-pressed working families out of poverty. It expands \nhealth insurance coverage to more uninsured low-income children and \nextends this coverage to their hard-working parents.\n  Because education is fundamental to creating opportunity, my budget \ncontains resources to prepare the next generation for the future with \nnew and expanded efforts to improve the quality of our schools, prepare \nour students for college, and make college more accessible. It includes \nefforts to narrow the digital divide, the gap that separates those who \nhave access to information technology and those who do not, so that all \nwill be equipped with the technological tools they need to succeed. It \nalso includes a science and technology initiative to lay the foundation \nfor new scientific breakthroughs.\n  This budget responds to the pressing needs of today and builds an \nAmerica of the future by making our Nation debt free by 2013. To be \nprepared for the retirement of the baby boom generation, my budget also \nprovides a framework to extend the life of the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds, while modernizing Medicare with a needed \nprescription drug benefit.\n  This budget uses the same straightforward approach of relying on \nconservative assumptions, as have all the budgets of my Administration. \nThis conservative approach has built confidence in our budgets, because \nwhen unforeseen results have materialized, an inevitable development in \nforecasting, they have always brought good news. In turn, reversing \nrecent trends, my 2001 Budget builds on the tradition of \nstraightforward budgets to meet the pressing needs of today in a \nbalanced plan that adheres to the principles of fiscal discipline and \ndebt reduction. This budget also maintains a strict set of budget rules \nupholding our long commitment to fiscal discipline, which has sustained \nthe conditions for our economy to flourish.\n  The 2001 Budget continues to project that the Federal budget will \nremain in surplus for many decades to come, provided that a responsible \nfiscal policy holds course, to foster sustained economic growth. Our \nchallenge now, in this era of surplus, is to make balanced choices to \nuse our resources to meet the pressing needs of today, and the needs of \ngenerations to come.\n\n\n            building on the success of our fiscal discipline\n\n  When I took office in 1993, the current strength of our economy \nseemed beyond possibility. At that point, both the Federal budget \ndeficit and the national debt had exploded, threatening our economic \nfuture. The costs of massive Federal borrowing drove interest rates up, \nincomes were stagnant for all but the most well off, and the economy \nhad barely grown during the prior four years. The Nation needed a new \ncourse, and we worked hard to secure the passage of legislation, with \nthe support of Democrats in Congress, to get the economy moving again.\n  My three-part economic strategy, built upon reducing the deficit, \ninvesting in the American people, and engaging the international \neconomy yielded results. The budget deficit quickly began to drop from \nits peak of $290 billion, and in 1997, we pressed ahead with our \ndeficit reduction efforts as Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act on \na bipartisan basis to finish the job. Four years ahead of schedule, the \nbudget reached balance and is projected this year to produce its third \nsurplus in a row. We have started to pay down the national debt and are \non a path to make the Nation debt free by 2013 for the first time since \n1835.\n  Throughout the past seven years, my Administration has been committed \nto creating opportunity for all Americans, demanding responsibility \nfrom all Americans, and strengthening the American community. The crime \nrate, which had tripled during the previous three decades, continues to \nfall and crime is down in every region of the Nation. We have reformed \nthe welfare system, and more than seven million Americans in the past \nseven years have made the transition from welfare to work.\n  Most of all, the prosperity and opportunity of our time offers us a \ngreat responsibility--to take action to ensure that Social Security is \nthere for the elderly and the disabled, while ensuring\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\nthat it not place a burden on our children, that the life of Medicare \nis extended for future generations, and that we modernize Medicare with \na needed prescription drug benefit. If we continue to follow sound \nfiscal policy, we can provide for the future, produce a balanced tax \ncut and meet the needs of today, while sustaining the conditions that \nhave brought us this current wave of prosperity. All this can be done, \nbut balanced and sound fiscal policy is the key.\n\n\n            improving performance through better management\n\n  At the start of this Administration, the Vice President and I set out \nto create a Government that works better, costs less, and gets results \nAmericans care about. We believe that with better stewardship, the \nGovernment can better achieve its mission and improve the quality of \nlife for all Americans. The success of these efforts is reflected in \nthe significant changes of the past seven years in the way Government \ndoes business.\n  We have streamlined Government, cutting the civilian Federal work \nforce by 377,000, giving us the smallest work force in 39 years. We \nhave done more than just reduce or eliminate hundreds of Federal \nprograms and projects. We have also empowered government employees to \ncut red tape, and used partnerships to get results.\n  While we have made real progress, there is still much work to do. We \nare forging ahead with new efforts to improve the quality of the \nservice that the Government offers its customers. My Administration has \nidentified its highest priorities--24 Priority Management Objectives \nlisted in this budget, that will receive heightened attention to ensure \npositive changes in the way Government works. It is a mark of our \nsuccess that in early 2000, we were able to remove last year's number \none objective from the list: Manage the Year 2000 (Y2K) \nComputer Problem. Due largely to the efforts of Federal employees and \nthe leadership provided by my Council on Year 2000 Conversion, the \nFederal Government's Y2K efforts were, beyond all expectation, \nremarkably trouble free. We will continue to move ahead to address \nother priorities, including modernizing student aid delivery, \nimplementing IRS reforms, and strengthening the management of Health \nCare Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare.\n\n  I believe the steps we have taken to change and improve the way \nGovernment works have also changed the way Americans view their \nGovernment, increasing the confidence and trust of the American public. \nIt is our job to keep at this task, so that the Federal Government \ncontinues to improve its performance and the American public is better \nserved. I am determined that we will do more to solve the very real \nmanagement challenges before us.\n\n\n              strengthening our nation in the 21st century\n\n  Education, in our competitive global economy, has become the dividing \nline between those who are able to move ahead and those who lag behind. \nFor this reason, I am committed to ensuring that we have a first-rate \nsystem of education and training in place for Americans of all ages. \nOver the last seven years, we have worked hard to ensure that every boy \nand girl is prepared to learn, that our schools focus on high standards \nand achievement, that anyone who wants to go to college can get the \nfinancial help to attend, and that those who need another chance at \neducation and training, or a chance to improve or learn new skills, can \ndo so. My budget builds on the commitment to make college more \naffordable by expanding the tax credits for higher education and \nincreasing Pell Grants and other college aid beyond the record levels \nalready reached. It promotes smaller learning environments in high \nschools and invests in reducing class size by recruiting and preparing \nthousands more teachers and building thousands more classrooms, as well \nas providing for urgent and essential school repairs.\n  My budget includes significant increases to expand access to after-\nschool and other extended learning time opportunities, a central \nelement of my accountability agenda to help children, especially in the \npoorest communities, reach challenging academic standards while \nsupporting efforts to demand more from schools and support them in \nreturn. It promotes efforts to recruit teachers in high-poverty areas \nand includes a peer review initiative to help school districts raise \nteacher standards and teacher pay. The budget proposes improving school \naccountability by holding States, districts and schools accountable for \nresults by providing resources to identify and turn around the worst-\nperforming schools, and incentives to reward States that do the most to \nimprove student performance and close the achievement gap. It invests \nin programs to help raise the educational achievement of Latino \nstudents. And my budget supports efforts to narrow the digital divide \nby expanding resources for technology centers to make computers \naccessible in low-income community areas.\n  During the past seven years, we have taken many steps to help working \nfamilies, and we continue that effort with this budget. We cut taxes \nfor 15 million working families, provided a tax credit to help families \nraise their children, ensured that 25 million Americans a year can \nchange jobs without losing their health insurance, made it easier for \nthe self-employed and those with pre-existing conditions to get health \ninsurance, provided access to health care coverage for up to five \nmillion uninsured children, raised the minimum wage, and provided \nguaranteed time off for workers who need to care for a newborn or to \naddress the health needs of a family member.\n  I am proposing a significant expansion of the Earned Income Tax \nCredit to provide support to America's hard working, low-income \nfamilies, especially larger families who are more likely to be poor \nthan families with only one or two children. My budget also \nsignificantly increases 21st Century Learning Community Centers and \nexpands after-school learning time. It makes child care more affordable \nby expanding tax credits or middle-income families and for businesses \nthat provide child care services to their employees, by assisting \nparents who want to attend college meet their child care needs, as well \nas making a child care tax credit available to parents who choose to \nstay at home to raise a young child. My budget proposes to create an \nEarly Learning Fund and builds on our expansion of the successful Head \nStart program to help meet the goal of serving one million children by \n2002. An it promotes responsible fatherhood by proposing tough new \nmeasures to ensure that all parents who can afford to pay child support \ndo so, while providing support to increase the employment earnings and \nchild support payments of low-income fathers. My budget includes \nefforts to increase access to food stamps for the working poor, in part \nby proposing that low-income working families, who need efficient \ntransportation to get to work, be permitted to own a modest vehicle and \nretain food stamp eligibility. And, it proposes resources to provide \nhealth care to legal immigrant children, to restore Supplemental \nSecurity Income benefits to legal immigrants with disabilities, and to \nrestore food stamp benefits to legal immigrants in families with \neligible children.\n\n  We have continued to improve health care for millions of Americans. \nSince the establishment of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram in 1997, two million children have enrolled in programs across \nall 50 States. I am proposing a significant expansion of this \nsuccessful program to extend health coverage to more children in hard \nworking, low-income families. My budget also extends this coverage to \ntheir parents, low-income working adults who lack health insurance, \nwhich will help increase the enrollment of their children by enabling \nentire families to receive coverage through the same program. My budget \ncontains other significant incentives to increase access to affordable \nhealth care, including tax credits for small businesses and a provision \nto allow hundreds of thousands of Americans aged 55 to 65 to purchase \nMedicare coverage.\n  My budget puts forth a plan that extends Medicare solvency to at \nleast 2025, respects fiscal discipline, and eliminates the national \ndebt. My plan will modernize Medicare with a needed drug benefit, \nexpand access to preventative benefits, and improve Medicare \nmanagement. I intend to keep pressing ahead and working with Congress \nto enact essential patient protections including emergency room access \nand the right to see a specialist. By Executive\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\nOrder, I have extended these rights to 85 million Americans covered by \nFederal health plans, including Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and \nFederal employees.\n  Most Americans are enjoying the fruits of our strong economy, yet we \nmust do more to bring this prosperity to all corners of our great \nNation. We must use this moment of promise to spread the values of \ncommunity, opportunity, and responsibility, and to help create the \nconditions for all to share in our prosperity. My New Markets \nInitiative, an expanded approach built upon the same public-private \ncooperation at the center of last year's plan, will provide tax credit \nand loan guarantee incentives to stimulate tens of billions of dollars \nin new private investment in distressed rural and urban areas. It will \nbuild a network of private investment institutions to funnel credit, \nequity, and technical assistance into businesses in America's untapped \nmarkets, and provide the expertise to targeted small businesses that \nwill allow them to use investment to grow. I am also proposing to \nexpand the number of Empowerment Zones, which provide tax incentives \nand direct spending to encourage the kind of private investment that \ncreates jobs, and to provide more capital for lending through my \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions program. My budget also \nincludes significant funding increases for Native American communities \nto help this generation and future generations receive greater \nopportunities. It provides additional funds to enforce the Nation's \ncivil rights laws, and strengthens the partnership we have begun with \nthe District of Columbia. In addition, my budget proposes an $11 \nbillion package for farmers in need and to help mend the farm safety \nnet by providing assistance when crop prices are low.\n  Our anti-crime strategy is working. Serious crime has fallen without \ninterruption, and the murder rate is at its lowest point in three \ndecades. Building on our successful community policing (COPS) program \nthat is helping community fund 100,000 cops on the beat, the 21st \nCentury Policing initiative was enacted last year to put us on track to \nfund new anti-crime technology and 50,000 more police. This year, I am \nlaunching the largest gun enforcement initiative ever, adding funds to \nhire 500 new ATF agents, 1,000 State and local gun prosecutors and \nfunds for smart gun technology. The budget also provides funds to \nprevent violence against women, and to address the growing law \nenforcement crisis on Indian lands. To boost our efforts to control \nillegal immigration, the budget provides resources to strengthen \nenforcement, particularly on the Southwest and Northern borders, and to \nremove illegal aliens. To combat drug use, particularly among young \npeople, my budget expands programs that stress treatment and \nprevention, law enforcement, international assistance, and \ninterdiction.\n\n  During the past seven years, I have sought to strengthen science and \ntechnology investments in order to serve many of our broader goals for \nthe Nation in the economy, education, health care, the environment, and \nnational defense. Building on the balanced portfolio of basic and \napplied research in the 21st Century Research Fund, my budget includes \na Science and Technology Initiative which places special emphasis on \nhigh-priority, long-term basic research, including nanotechnology, the \nmanipulation of matter at the atomic and molecular level, which offers \nthe promise that medical science may one day be able to detect \ncancerous tumors when they are comprised of only a few cells. My budget \nalso increases resources for the Information Technology research and \ndevelopment program to invest in long-term research in computing and \ncommunications. It will accelerate development of extremely fast \nsupercomputers to support civilian research, enabling experts to \ndevelop life-saving drugs, provide earlier tornado warnings, and design \nmore fuel-efficient safer automobiles. The budget provides strong \nsupport for the Nation's two largest sources of civilian basic research \nfunding for universities: the National Science Foundation and the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  The Nation does not have to choose between a strong economy and a \nclean environment. The past seven years are proof that we can have \nboth. We have set tough new clean air standards for soot and smog that \nwill prevent up to 15,000 premature deaths a year. We have set new food \nand drinking water safety standards and have accelerated the pace of \ncleanups of toxic Superfund sites. We expanded our efforts to protect \ntens of millions of acres of public and private lands, including \nYellowstone National Park, Florida's Everglades, and California's \nredwoods. Led by the Vice President, the Administration reached an \ninternational agreement in Kyoto that calls for cuts in greenhouse gas \nemissions. My budget significantly expands support for the environment, \nby establishing dedicated funding and increasing resources for the \nhistoric interagency Lands Legacy initiative to preserve the Nation's \nnatural and historic treasures. My budget also supports the Clean \nEnergy initiative to reduce the threat of global warming, and the \nGreening the Globe initiative to save tropical and other forests around \nthe globe. It provides resources to support farm conservation to \nupgrade water quality, the Clean Water Action plan to clean up polluted \nwaterways, and climate change technology efforts to increase energy-\nefficient technologies and renewable energy to strengthen our economy \nwhile reducing greenhouse gases.\n  In the past year, America's leadership was essential to the success \nof the NATO alliance in halting the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's ethnic \nAlbanians and containing the risk of wider war at the doorstep of our \nallies. The United States has played a critical role in the strides \nmade toward lasting peace in Northern Ireland, the Middle East, and \nSierra Leone. The United States has worked to detect and counter \nterrorist threats and continue efforts with Russia and other former \nSoviet nations to halt the spread of dangerous weapons materials. My \nbudget seeks to build on these efforts, proposing funding to build a \ndemocratic society and stronger economy in Kosovo, initiatives to \nfurther protect our men and women overseas, and a 2000 emergency \nsupplemental to provide critical assistance to the Government of \nColombia in its fight against narcotics traffickers. My budget also \nproposes funding to promote international family planning, contain the \nglobal spread of AIDS, promote debt forgiveness to help people in the \nworld's poorest countries join the global economy, and promote trade by \nopening global markets.\n\n  The Armed Forces of the United States serve as the backbone of our \nnational security strategy. As it did successfully last year in Kosovo, \nthe military must be in a position to protect our national security \ninterests and guard against the major threats to U.S. security. These \ninclude regional dangers, such as cross-border aggression; the \nproliferation of the technology of weapons of mass destruction; \ntransnational dangers, such as the spread of illegal drugs and \nterrorism; and, direct attacks on the U.S. homeland from \nintercontinental ballistic missiles or other weapons of mass \ndestruction. To ensure that the military can fulfill this mission, I \nmade a major commitment last year to maintain our military readiness, \nwhich this budget builds upon with additional resources to ensure that \nthe services can meet required training standards, maintain equipment \nin top condition, recruit and retain quality personnel, and procure \nsufficient spare parts and other equipment. To help improve the quality \nof life and strengthen the Department's ability to attract and retain \nquality individuals, this budget includes a major initiative to reduce \nservicemembers' out-of-pocket costs for off-base housing. In addition, \nthis budget provides resources for the Department of Defense and other \nagencies to combat emerging threats, including terrorism and weapons of \nmass destruction, and to provide for critical infrastructure \nprotection.

Never before has our \nNation enjoyed so much prosperity, at a time when special progress \ncontinues to advance and our position as the global leader is secure. \nToday, we are well\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\nprepared to make the choices that will shape our Nation's future for \ndecades to come.\n  By reversing the earlier trend of fiscal irresponsibility, balancing \nthe budget, and producing a historic surplus, we have restored our \nnational spirit and produced the resources to help opportunity and \nprosperity reach all corners of this Nation. We have it within our \nreach today, by making the right choices, to offer the promise of \nprosperity to generations of Americans to come. If we keep to the path \nof fiscal discipline, we can build a foundation of prosperity for the \nNation's future.\n  My plan to extend the solvency of Social Security and Medicare allows \nthe United States to become debt-free in the next 13 years, for the \nfirst time since 1835, Eliminating the debt will strengthen our \neconomy, devote resources to Social Security, and prepare us to meet \nthe challenges of the aging of America. Through fiscal discipline and \nwise choices we can extend the life of Social Security to the middle of \nthe century, extend the solvency of Medicare until 2025, and modernize \nMedicare with a needed prescription drug benefit.\n  By continuing to maintain discipline, we can provide for the aging of \nAmerica and for the investments of the future--including education, the \nenvironment, research and development, and defense--which are central \nto our economic growth, health, and national security. By making \nchoices that respect fiscal discipline, we can make room to provide \nboth for a balanced tax cut and for investments that will help this \nNation stay strong in the future.\n  This new century is filled with promise, for we live at a remarkable \ntime. By making wise choices, we have it within our power to extend the \nsame promise and prosperity to generations to come.\n                                                   William J.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to the protection and restoration \n     of the Atlantic Salmon; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Government, through the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service, has proposed to list the Atlantic salmon in 8 Maine \n     rivers under the federal Endangered Species Act and has \n     indicated a potential to include additional Maine rivers to \n     the detriment of the agriculture, manufacturing, forest \n     products and aquaculture industries of Maine on the basis of \n     limited scientific evidence;\n       Whereas, Maine is strongly committed to the restoration of \n     the Atlantic salmon to its waters, as demonstrated through \n     the development of a comprehensive and cooperative Salmon \n     Conservation Plan, which was produced over the course of 3 \n     years with input from federal officials, relevant state \n     departments, local conservation groups, affected businesses, \n     farmers and riverside residents; and\n       Whereas, since the area covered by these 8 rivers and other \n     rivers that may be included in the listing in the future \n     contains \\1/3\\ of the human population of Maine and virtually \n     all of the aquaculture industry, all of Maine will feel the \n     impact of the naming of the Atlantic salmon to the Endangered \n     Species List; and\n       Whereas, adding the Atlantic salmon to the Endangered \n     Species List in order to help the return of the Atlantic \n     salmon in significant numbers to Maine's waters compromises \n     partnership between Maine and the Federal Government, which \n     has had a history of good faith; and\n       Whereas, there exist many significant threats to the \n     Atlantic salmon that lie beyond the influence of Maine that \n     also affect the prospects of long-term Atlantic salmon \n     restoration to the rivers of Maine; and\n       Whereas, Maine is strongly committed to the restoration of \n     the Atlantic salmon to its waters, has committed millions of \n     dollars to its plan to produce this result and feels that the \n     naming of the Atlantic salmon to the Endangered Species List \n     is premature; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of \n     Commerce William Daly and the Congress of the United States \n     reconsider the intent to include the Atlantic salmon on the \n     Endangered Species List as it would benefit neither the \n     Atlantic salmon nor the people of Maine and allow Maine to \n     continue to execute its own comprehensive plan to restore the \n     Atlantic salmon to its waters; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of the United States, to the Secretary of the \n     Interior Bruce Babbitt, to the Secretary of Commerce William \n     Daley and to each Member of the Maine Congressional \n     Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S381-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. GRASSLEY, from the Special Committee on Aging: \n     Special Report entitled ``Developments in Aging: 1997 and \n     1998'' (Rept. 106-229).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S381-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst time and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as \nindicated:\n\n           By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n             Lautenberg, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Murray, \n             Mr. Dodd, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \n             Sarbanes, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Robb, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n             Gramm):\n       S. 2035.

This legislation will correct an \nunintended drafting error involving Medicare reimbursements for the \nSole Community Hospital program, enacted last year as part of the \nMedicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act (P.L. 106-\n113).\n  Medicare designates Sole Community Hospitals based on factors such as \nisolated location, weather or travel conditions, or the absence of \nother hospitals within a 35 road-mile radius. These hospitals are \nconsidered the only source of inpatient services that are reasonably \navailable in a geographic area. Sole Community Hospitals are reimbursed \nfor services on either a federal national standardized amount or on a \nhospital-specific target amount that is based on either updated FY 1982 \nor updated FY 1987 costs.\n  Last year, Congress passed legislation updating the federal rate \nreimbursement level to costs based on Fiscal Year 1996. A drafting \nerror in the bill, however, unintentionally updated the reimbursements \nfor hospitals that are paid on a specific rate--leaving out 327 \nhospitals across the country that Congress intended to help.\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\n  If this error had not been made America's rural hospitals would be \nexpecting an additional $600 million over five years. Without \ncorrection, the error could cost four hospitals just in my state \napproximately $2.84 million annually that had been anticipated from \nthis legislation. These hospitals--Mayo Regional Hospital in Dover-\nFoxcroft, Down East Community Hospital in Machias, Northern Maine \nMedical Center in fort Kent, and Rumford Community Hospital in \nRumford--are a vital part of their communities and had expected these \nadditional funds.\n  Small hospitals across the country are facing an increasingly \nuncertain future, and we cannot afford to lose any more of our rural \nhealth care providers. This funding is critical to these small \nhospitals and the communities they serve. These facilities and the \npatients they serve should not be penalized for a mistake made by \nCongress I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation \nand I urge the Senate to pass this technical correction bill \nimmediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url":

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This resolution may be cited as the ``Biomedical \n     Revitalization Resolution of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that funding for the National \n     Institutes of Health should be increased by $2,700,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2001 and that the budget resolution appropriately \n     reflect sufficient funds to achieve this objective.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this morning President Clinton announced \nthe budget for the administration for fiscal year 2001. It has a large \nnumber of new programs and has a very substantial increase in spending, \nup to $1.835 trillion. In examining the budget as to its applicability \nto the Departments of Labor, Health, Human Services and Education on \nitems which I chair, the appropriations subcommittee, I am concerned \nabout the number of new programs.\n  On Education, there are 19 new programs. In the Department of Labor, \nthere are nine new programs. It is a matter of concern when the \nPresident proposes programs which have mandates directing the local \nschool districts as to what they should be doing without giving \ndiscretion to local school districts as to specific needs which they \nmight have which might be in a somewhat different category. For \nexample, this year the 19 new programs will increase expenditures by $2 \nbillion 951 million--almost $3 billion. Let's put it that way, round it \nup a little bit.\n  Within these programs, there is a new program for school renovation \nof $1.3 billion. While there may be some merit to that specific kind of \nprogram, it may well be that the local school district could better use \nthat money, depending upon local needs, for matters such as a science \nprogram, for laboratory equipment, for computers, for teacher training \ndepending upon what the needs are in the local school district.\n  Last year, we had a considerable amount of controversy on the \nPresident's program for new teachers, a commendable objective, but it \nmay well be that there are many school districts where the needs for \nsome alternative programs are more pressing there. So I express a \nconcern about the budget with its increased spending up to $1.835 \ntrillion, and the mandate of a great many new programs which have not \nbeen authorized by the appropriate authorizing committees in the \nCongress.\n  When it comes to the question of paying for these programs, the \nPresident has proposed raising the caps by some $62 billion, but it is \nhighly questionable whether that raise in the caps will accommodate all \nthe programs which he has proposed. I think there is agreement between \nthe Congress and the administration that Social Security and Medicare \nhave to be kept inviolate and that there not be expenditures which \nwould threaten Social Security.\n  On the face and on the figures, the President's budget does not \ninvade Social Security, but there is the lurking possibility that \nSocial Security could be invaded with the tremendous number of new \nprograms which the President has proposed.\n  Last year, when the President came forward with his budget, he had \nproposals for some $18 billion in offsets: Federal tobacco revenues of \n$6 billion, FAA user fees of $1 billion, and so on, down to some $18 \nbillion, none of which materialized. So when we take a look at the \nPresident's proposed offsets, we have to take them with more than a \ngrain of salt as to whether they ever will materialize.\n  The President has proposed this year to have offsets for penalties \nfor tobacco companies where they fail to live up to the reduction on \nteenage smoking. The administration's budget will cut youth smoking in \nhalf by charging the tobacco industry an assessment for every underage \nsmoker, with an estimated penalty of $3,000 for each underage smoker. \nIt does not pick up until some of the out years.\n  This is an illustration of where the President is proposing alleged \ncuts which may well never materialize.\n  There is one item where the Clinton administration budget is not \nadequately funded, and that is for the National Institutes of Health. \nIn 1997, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution called for a doubling of \nthe NIH budget over a 5-year period.\n  During the course of the last 3 years, very substantial advances have \nbeen made on funding for the National Institutes of Health, although we \nare not quite yet on target. That has been a\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\nreal battle because although the Senate passed a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution in 1997 calling for doubling within 5 years, when the issue \nhas come before the budget resolution on amendments sponsored by \nSenator Harkin, who is the ranking Democrat, and myself as chairman of \nthe relevant appropriations subcommittee, those increases in funding \nhave been rejected. But with a sharp pencil and with very substantial \nhelp from staff on allocation of funding, we have succeeded in \nincreasing the funding for the National Institutes of Health by more \nthan $5 billion over the last 3 years.\n  Three years ago, the Senate passed an increase of $950 million. It \nwas pared down somewhat in conference to $907 million. Two years ago, \nwe increased NIH funding by some $2 billion, and last year we increased \nNational Institutes of Health funding by $2.3 billion.\n  It is true the National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of \nthe Federal Government. In fact, it may be the only jewel of the \nFederal Government. This year, with a long list of cosponsors who are \nbeing added incrementally each day--and I expect quite a few more by \nthe end of the day, and more even before Senator Harkin, the principal \ncosponsor, and I offer this for a budget resolution--we are proposing \nan increase in funding of $2.7 billion, which is the minimal amount \nnecessary to keep funding for the National Institutes of Health on a \ntrack to approximate the goal of doubling NIH funding over the 5-year \nperiod.\n  In addition to Senator Harkin and myself, we have cosponsorship by \nSenator Mack, Senator Mikulski, Senator Frist, Senator Schumer, Senator \nCollins, Senator DeWine, Senator Sarbanes, and Senator Hutchinson. The \nadvances which have been made by NIH over the course of the past \nseveral years have truly been astounding with the projection that \nParkinson's may be on the verge of being solved within a 5-year period, \nenormous advances on Alzheimer's, enormous advances on a variety of \ncancer problems--breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer--\nenormous advances on heart disease. As a capital investment in the \nhealth of America, there is no better investment. As a capital \ninvestment for cutting costs for Medicare and Medicaid, there is no \nbetter investment.\n  Last year, the Clinton administration proposed an increase of some \n$300 million which was far under the mark. That was raised by Congress \nto $2.3 billion and signed into law by the President.\n  This year, I think, noting the strong congressional support, the \nadministration has proposed an increase of $1 billion in NIH funding, \nbut that, too, is short of the mark on meeting the objective of \ndoubling NIH funding within a 5-year period.\n  I have sought recognition today to submit, with my distinguished \ncolleague Senator Harkin, an important resolution calling for increased \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health, to keep us on track to \ndouble NIH funding by 2002. Specifically, the resolution which we are \noffering today calls for the fiscal year 2001 Budget Resolution to \ninclude an additional $2.7 billion in the health account, to be \nallocated for biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, Education and Related Agencies, I have said many times \nthat the National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the \nFederal Government--perhaps the only jewel of the Federal government. \nWe all remain enthralled by the advances realized by the National \nInstitutes of Health, which has spawned innumerable breakthroughs in \nour knowledge and treatment for diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's \ndisease, Parkinson's disease, severe mental illnesses, diabetes, \nosteoporosis, heart disease, and many others. It is clear that a \nsubstantial investment in the NIH is crucial to allow the continuation \nof these advances into the next decade.\n  On May 21, 1997, the Senate passed a Sense of the Senate resolution \nsubmitted by our distinguished colleague, Senator Mack, which stated \nthat funding for the National Institutes of Health should be doubled \nover five years. Regrettably, even though that resolution was passed by \nan overwhelming vote of 98 to nothing, when the budget resolution was \nconsidered on the Senate floor, the appropriate health account had a \nreduction of $100 million. That led to the introduction of an amendment \nto the resolution by myself and Senator Harkin. We sought to add in \n$1.1 billion to carry out the expressed sense of the Senate. Our \namendment, however, was defeated 63-37. We were extremely disappointed \nthat while the Senate had expressed its druthers on a resolution, they \nwere simply unwilling to put up the actual dollars to accomplish this \nvital goal.\n  The following year, during debate on the fiscal year 1999 Budget \nResolution, Senator Harkin and I again introduced an amendment which \ncalled for a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, \nand which provided sufficient resources in the budget to accomplish \nthis. While we gained more support on this vote than in the previous \nyear, our amendment was again defeated, this time by a vote of 57-41. \nNot to be deterred, Senator Harkin and I again went to work with our \nSubcommittee and we were able, by making economies and establishing \npriorities, to add an additional $2 billion to the NIH account for \nfiscal year 1999, which at the time was the largest increase in \nhistory.\n  Most recently, for fiscal year 2000, Senator Harkin and I again \nintroduced an amendment to the Budget Resolution which would have added \n$1.4 billion to the health accounts, over and above the $600 million \nwhich had been already been provided by the Budget Committee. Despite \nthis amendment's defeat by a vote of 47-52, we were able to provide, \nthrough the maximization of our limited resources, a $2.3 billion \nincrease for fiscal year 2000--truly an historic accomplishment.\n  In 1981, when I was first elected to the Senate, NIH funding was less \nthan $3.6 billion; for fiscal year 2000, it is $17.9 billion, a 95% \ninflation-adjusted increase. Through several years and several \nSubcommittee Chairs--Senator Weicker, Senator Chiles, Senator Harkin, \nand myself--the budgets were always tight and frequently faced \nAdministration-proposed cuts. Still, we managed to increase NIH funding \ntremendously. This resolution seeks to reiterate the intent of the \nSenate to double our investment in the National Institutes of Health: \nwe must provide $2.7 billion to stay on track to reach that goal. I \nbelieve that this goal can be achieved if we make the proper allocation \nof our resources.\n  Our investment has resulted in tremendous advances in medical \nresearch. A new generation of AIDS drugs are reducing the presence of \nthe AIDS virus in HIV infected persons to nearly undetectable levels. \nDeath rates from cancer have begun a steady decline. The human genome \nis on track to be 90 percent mapped by this spring, and fully sequenced \nby 2003. We are seeing the advent of a relatively new field of \npharmacogenomics, which seeks to solve whether there is something about \nan individual's genetic instructions which prevent them from \nmetabolizing a particular drugs as intended. In essence, drugs may soon \nbe designed to fit the patient's genetic makeup. I anxiously await the \nresults of all of these avenues of remarkable research.\n  I, like millions of Americans, have benefitted tremendously from the \ninvestment we have made in the National Institutes of Health. But to \ncontinue that commitment takes actual dollars, not just the discussion \nof dollars. That is why we offer this resolution today--to call upon \nthe Budget Committee to add $2.7 billion to the health accounts so we \ncan carry forward the important work of the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S384-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S384-S385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS COVENANT IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                MURKOWSKI (AND AKAKA) AMENDMENT NO. 2807\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Akaka) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill (S. 1052) to implement further the Act (Public Law 94-241) \napproving the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, \nand for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 29, lines 20-21, strike ``regard to'' and insert \n     ``counting against''.\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\n       On page 34, lines 7-8, strike ``to be made available during \n     the following fiscal year'' and insert ``that will not count \n     against the numerical limitations''.\n       On page 34, strike line 15 and all that follows through \n     page 35, line 4.\n       On page 34, strike ``(C)'' and insert ``(B)''.\n       On page 35, strike line 20 and all that follows through \n     page 36, line 18.\n       On page 36, strike ``(E)'' and insert ``(C)''.\n       On page 37, strike line 3 and all that follows through page \n     38, line 9.\n       On page 38, strike line 10 and all that follows through \n     line 24.\n       On page 39, line 1, strike ``(I)'' and insert ``(D)''.\n       On page 40, line 6, strike ``and reviewable''.\n       On page 41, lines 3-6, strike ``The determination as to \n     whether a further extension is required shall not be \n     reviewable.''.\n       On page 41, lines 20-21, strike ``The decision by the \n     Attorney General shall not be reviewable.''.\n       On page 42, lines 6-7, strike ``The determination by the \n     Attorney General shall not be reviewable.''.\n       On page 45, line 16, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through page 46, line 10.\n       On page 46, line 11, strike ``(h)'' and insert ``(g)''.\n       On page 46, line 20, strike ``(i)'' and insert ``(h)''.\n       On page 47, line 3, strike ``(j)'' and insert ``(i)''.\n       On page 47, line 9, strike ``regard to'' and insert \n     ``counting against''.\n       On page 47, line 14, strike ``(C) through (H)'' and insert \n     ``(B) and (C)''.\n       On page 48, line 5, strike ``five-year'' and insert ``four-\n     year''.\n       On page 48, line 9, strike ``5-year'' and insert ``four-\n     year''.\n       On page 48, line 18, strike ``five years'' and insert \n     ``four years''.\n       On page 48, line 23 and all that follows through page 49, \n     line 4.\n       On page 49, line 5, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 49, line 10, strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(3)''.\n       On page 49, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(k) Statutory Construction.--Nothing in this section may \n     be construed to count the issuance of any visa to an alien, \n     or the grant of any admission of an alien, under this section \n     toward any numerical limitation contained in the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S385-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                      committee on small business\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Madam President, I wanted to take a few minutes \nto talk about an exciting new project that was announced recently--\nIntel's ``Teach to the Future'' program. Intel has joined forces with \nMicrosoft and a number of other companies to train 100,000 of our \nelementary and secondary school teachers in how to use information \ntechnology to improve what our kids learn. Intel will invest $100 \nmillion in this project and Microsoft will contribute more than $300 \nmillion in software, its largest donation ever. Intel and its partners \ndeserve to be strongly commended by the Senate and the Congress for \ntheir forward thinking efforts.\n  The goal of Intel's Teach to the Future Program is to train 100,000 \nAmerican teachers in 1,000 days. This year Intel will make grants to 5 \nregional training agencies in Northern California, Oregon, Texas, and \nArizona that will each train 100 Master Teachers in a 40-hour \ncurriculum on effectively applying computer technology to improve \nstudent learning. This award-winning curriculum was developed over the \nlast two years by the Institute for Computer Technology; over 80% of \nthe teachers who've been trained by it felt that it enhanced their \nstudent's learning. These 500 Master Teachers will return to their \nschool districts, embedding the expertise locally by training an \nadditional 20 teachers. By the end of this year, 10,000 teachers will \nbe trained. Next year, the program will expand to include my home state \nof New Mexico, along with Washington State, Massachusetts, Utah, \nSouthern California, Washington, DC, and elsewhere in order to train \n40,000 teachers. Finally, the program will again expand to train 50,000 \nteachers in 2002.\n  We have been working hard on the federal, state, and local levels to \nprovide schools with computers, software and access to the Internet. I \nauthored several programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nin 1994 that have gone a long way toward these goals. Studies of the \nexisting uses of technology in schools demonstrate, however, that these \ninvestments have not been optimized because teachers have not been \nadequately trained in its use--particularly its curriculum-based use. \nThe availability of hardware is irrelevant if teachers are not properly \ntrained, because it's teachers who teach, not technology.\n  Only 20% of today's teachers feel really prepared to use technology \nin the classroom. Given the dynamic nature of technology and the influx \nof new teachers we expect to enter the classroom in the next few years, \nit's easy to see how this problem could get worse if we don't focus on \nit. The average school spends less--often significantly less--than 1% \nof its technology funds on training. The Department of Education, the \nCEO Forum and other experts have determined that the appropriate \ninvestment should be closer to 30%.\n  In response to this need, I have worked closely with Senator Murray \nto secure funding for a pre-service technology training program in the \neducation budget. As we approach reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, I also have made teacher training the \ncenterpiece of my proposal for reauthorization of the Education \nTechnology programs in ESEA--``S. 1604: the Technology for Teaching \nAct.'' Even with the continued commitment of companies like Intel, we \nmust provide federal support and leadership for technology training for \nall teachers in all fifty states.\n  Intel's ``Teach to the Future'' project is an outstanding example of \ngood corporate citizenship; one that should be instructive for \npoliticians, educators, and corporations across the nation. Intel and \nits corporate partners clearly recognize that--just as information \ntechnology has revolutionized the workplace and the marketplace--it \nalso promises to transform the schoolhouse. Perhaps, more importantly, \nhowever, these companies recognize that we must transform the \nschoolhouse in order to continue the economic revolution. We in \nCongress must support their efforts by increasing the federal \ncommitment to educational technology and teacher training in this \narea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S385-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S385-S387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PRAISING FORD MOTOR COMPANY FOR COMPUTER DONATIONS TO EMPLOYEES\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to praise Ford Motor \nCompany's president and chief executive, Mr. Jacques Nasser, and Ford \nMotor Company's unprecedented gift of a home computer, color printer \nand unlimited access to the Internet to each and every one of Ford's \n350,000 thousand employees worldwide.\n  Through this act, Ford Motor Company has shown that it has truly \nrecognized the need to provide all Americans with computer and Internet \naccess. Not a single Ford employee will be left out of Ford's \ninitiative to provide its people with access to the Information Age. To \nits great credit, Ford has recognized that competing in today's high-\ntech global marketplace means doing everything possible to secure and \ntrain a skilled and informed workforce.\n  What is more, Mr. President, Ford has recognized that any company \nthat wants to continue to succeed must see to it that everyone in its \nworkforce, and not just a select few ``specialists'' be fully plugged \nin to the Information Age.\n  Mr. President, there is a growing digital divide in this country. \nAlthough over 40 percent of all households owned computers and one-\nquarter had Internet access by the end of 1998, figures show a \ndisturbing and significant gap between two growing classes: the \ntechnical haves and the technical have-nots. This divide is defined by \nincome and education levels, race and geographical location.\n  Household with incomes of $75,000 and greater are more than twenty \ntimes more likely to have Internet access in the home than households \nin the lowest income levels. Wealthier\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\nfamilies are nine times as likely to have a computer in the home. \nWhites are more likely than African Americans or Hispanics to have \nInternet access from any location, including work and the home. In \naddition, where a family lives can impact the likelihood of having \ncomputer and Internet access, regardless of income level. Americans \nliving in rural areas are lagging behind in Internet access. Even at \nthe lowest income levels, households in urban areas are more than twice \nas likely as their rural counterparts to have Internet access.\n  We are all aware that the increasing dominance of computers \nthroughout the workplace demands computer proficiency. Right now, 60 \npercent of all jobs require high-tech skills. Mr. President, it is only \nthrough readily available access and consistent use of computers and \ntechnology that Americans will gain the skills necessary to participate \nand succeed in the New Economy. And, it is only through a skilled and \neducated workforce that the United States will continue to maintain its \ndominance in the New Economy.\n  That means, Mr. President, that we cannot afford to leave anyone \nbehind in our journey into the New Economy. We will need everyone to \nhelp us face the tasks ahead. I take this challenge seriously. That is \nwhy my New Millennium Classrooms Act would give businesses increased \nincentives to donate used but still highly useful computers to our \nschools. It's unconscionable that 32 percent of public schools have \nonly one classroom with access to the Internet when U.S. businesses are \ntrying to figure out what to do with literally millions of used \ncomputers. It's also bad policy.\n  We need to get everyone onto the information superhighway. And I \nstrongly believe, Mr. President, that Ford's exceptional program will \nhelp us in that effort. It will ensure access to the fundamental tools \nof the digital economy, and that is one of the most significant \ninvestments in our country that we can make. Ford's initiative not only \nbenefits their immediate workforce, but their families and our greater \ncommunities. I would encourage all of our companies to look closely at \nFord's contributions and the overwhelming good it creates.\n  Again, please allow me to commend Mr. Nasser and Ford Motor Co, for \ntheir dedication and invaluable contribution.\n  I ask that the full texts of the February 4, 2000 Washington Post and \nDetroit News articles be printed in the Record immediately following my \nstatement.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 4, 2000]\n\n                 Ford Offers Home PC To Every Employee\n\n                  (By Warren Brown and Frank Swoboda)\n\n       Ford Motor Co. said yesterday that it will provide every \n     one of its 350,000 employees worldwide with home computers, \n     color printers and unlimited access to the Internet for as \n     little as $5 a month.\n       Leapfrogging across the ``digital divide'' that some fear \n     separates wealthy computer users from people unable to afford \n     them, Ford is the first major company to offer every \n     employee, from the loading dock to the boardroom, the tools \n     to participate in the Information Age.\n       ``It is clear that individuals and companies that want to \n     be successful in the 21st century will need to be leaders in \n     using the Internet and related technology. That is what this \n     program is all about,'' Chairman Bill Ford said.\n       Ford, the nation's second-biggest company in terms of \n     revenue, is betting the estimated $300 million cost of the \n     program will be quickly offset by gains in making all its \n     employees computer literate.\n       ``We're committed to serving consumers better by \n     understanding how they think and act,'' said Jacques Nasser, \n     Ford's president and chief executive. ``Having a computer and \n     Internet access in the home will accelerate development of \n     these skills, provide information across our businesses, and \n     offer opportunities to streamline our processes.''\n       Ford said it may offset some of its costs by selling \n     advertisements to run on the Internet service its employees \n     will use. But even with that, the ambitious program appears \n     unique in corporate America. Even Microsoft Corp. has nothing \n     similar. And Hewlett-Packard Co., which is supplying the \n     hardware under contract with Ford, provides computers only to \n     employees who need them for work.\n       The program results from a contract settlement negotiated \n     last year between the automaker and the United Auto Workers \n     union. But Nasser said the computer program would cover all \n     employees, even those not represented by the UAW. ``We're not \n     leaving out anyone,'' Nasser said.\n       Edward Hay, president of UAW Local 919 at the Ford pickup-\n     truck plant in Norfolk, called the computer plan a ``really \n     good thing. The way the modern world is going, it's all going \n     to be about computers and we've got to get up to speed.''\n       Many members of the local put off buying computers at \n     Christmas in anticipation of a Ford computer program. But Hay \n     said no one on the local predicted the deal would be this \n     good. UAW officials said the local predicted the deal would \n     be this good. UAW officials said they have talked to both \n     General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG about similar \n     deals, but officials at those companies said they now have \n     no plans to follow Ford. The three U.S. automakers, \n     however, have in the past tended to match each others' \n     benefits programs.\n       There are no strings attached to the computer deal for \n     individual employees and no requirement that the PCs be used \n     for work. Both Ford and UAW officials said there will be no \n     monitoring of how employees use their computers or Internet \n     access.\n       Company sources said the price tag could be as much as $300 \n     million over three years, but Ford officials declined to \n     confirm that. Ford last year netted $7.2 billion. It has \n     another $28 billion in the bank.\n       In the United States, Ford workers will pay $5 a month for \n     the basic package put together by San Francisco-based \n     PeoplePC Inc. Hewlett-Packard Corp. will supply the computers \n     and printers, and Fairfax-based UUNet Technologies Inc., a \n     subsidiary of MCI WorldCom Inc., will provide the Internet \n     access.\n       After three years--and a total payment of $180 per \n     employee--the hardware will be the worker's property, though \n     Ford officials said it isn't clear yet if employees will have \n     to continue to pay for Internet access.\n       Elsewhere in the world, the monthly fee will be adjusted \n     for household incomes and living standards.\n       The $5 fee is largely symbolic. It hearkens back to 1914, \n     when Henry Ford, the company's founder, introduced the then-\n     revolutionary industrial wage of $5 a day. Chairman Bill \n     Ford, Henry's grandson, said the $5-a-month computer offer is \n     equally revolutionary.\n       The base computer will have a 500-megahertz Intel Celeron \n     chip, 64 megabytes of RAM, a 4.3 gigabyte hard disk, CD-ROM \n     drive, 15-inch monitor, speakers and a modem. The printer \n     will be a color inkjet.\n       Hardware will start going out to Ford employees in April. \n     All Ford employees who want to participate in the program \n     should receive the necessary equipment within 12 months, \n     according to the company and UAW officials.\n       Hewlett-Packard sold 7.6 million personal computers \n     worldwide last year, 4 million in the United States. If \n     300,000 Ford employees take advantage of the program, as \n     Hewlett-Packard projects, the deal would represent nearly 4 \n     percent of the company's worldwide computer sales. Weis said \n     yesterday that it was one of the biggest single computer \n     sales contracts for the company.\n       Over the past year, Ford has moved aggressively to \n     establish itself as the e-business leader, at least in the \n     automotive industry. Under Nasser's prompting, the company \n     has entered into deals with Oracle Corp. to use the Internet \n     to speed up transactions and cut costs in dealing with \n     suppliers. The company has also struck deals with Microsoft \n     Corp., CarPoint and Yahoo Inc. to help customers shop for \n     cars and trucks and other Ford-provided automotive services.\n       Ford announced another agreement Wednesday, this one with \n     UPS Logistics Group, to drastically reduce the delivery times \n     of components to Ford factories and products to consumers.\n       Organized labor is getting into the low-price computer \n     business with the creation last fall of Workingfamily.com, \n     which has already signed up more than a dozen unions \n     representing approximately half the 13 million members of the \n     AFL-CIO. But the lowest price the unions have come up with so \n     far is $8 a week.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Detroit News, Feb. 4, 2000]\n\nFree PCs Give Ford Web Edge--Computers, Internet Access Put Workers in \n                             High-Tech Age\n\n                            (By Mark Truby)\n\n       Detroit.--In announcing plans to offer personal computers \n     and Internet access to all Ford Motor Co. employees for $5 a \n     month, Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. evoked his great-\n     grandfather's decision to pay employees $5 a day.\n       For sheer impact, it may not match Henry Ford's seminal \n     1914 wage decision that gave assembly line workers the \n     wherewithal to buy the product they built.\n       But the world's No. 2 automaker is making a bold \n     statement--unprecedented in the industrial world--about its \n     commitment to electronic connectivity.\n       With a dizzying series of alliances with high-technology \n     companies in recent weeks, Ford already has committed to \n     using the World Wide Web to revamp trade with suppliers, \n     connect drivers to the Internet and communicate with dealers \n     and buyers.\n       Now, in offering entry to cyberworld cheaply to 350,000 \n     employees worldwide, Ford is seeking to change its corporate \n     culture--and at cyberspeed.\n       ``Jac Nasser (Ford's chief executive) is working very hard \n     to drive an e-culture into the economy,'' said David Cole, \n     the University of Michigan's top auto expert.\n       ``When Nasser talks about Ford becoming an e-company, he is \n     not talking about inanimate objects. He is talking about \n     people of Ford.''\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\n                            Idea Born in '99\n\n       The idea first emerged during negotiations last year \n     between Ford and the United Auto Workers, UAW President \n     Stephen Yokich said. An arrangement in which Ford and UAW \n     would share the cost was originally floated.\n       Nasser instead decided Ford would foot the bill alone and \n     the company would offer the computers and Internet service to \n     the company's 100,000 hourly workers in the United States, \n     100,000 salaried employees worldwide and 150,000 hourly \n     employees outside the United States.\n       Workers at Visteon Automotive Systems, the auto-parts unit \n     that Ford wants to spin off later this year, will be \n     eligible, as will employees at Ford's Volvo and Jaguar units.\n       Ford hasn't decided whether to extend the offer to \n     employees of Mazda Motor Corp., which is controlled by Ford.\n\n\n                          company is committed\n\n       ``It is clear that individuals and companies that want to \n     be successful in the 21st century will need to be leaders in \n     using the Internet and related technologies,'' Ford said at a \n     press conference. ``That is what this program is all about.''\n       Nasser said the company is committed to serving consumers \n     better by understanding how they think and act. ``Having a \n     computer and Internet access in the home will accelerate the \n     development of these skills,'' he said.\n       General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG have not \n     announced any plans to match Ford's program and would not say \n     Thursday whether they are considering it.\n       ``We are always willing to look at anything that would \n     benefit our workforce, but any discussions of this nature are \n     internal,'' said Trevor Hale, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman.\n       Ford plans to start the program in the United States in \n     April and complete it in 12 months.\n\n\n                        ford's decision recalled\n\n       Employees who sign up will receive a Hewlett-Packard \n     computer with a 500-megahertz processor, 64 megabytes of RAM \n     and a 4.3 gigabyte hard disk. A 15-inch monitor and color ink \n     jet printer computer will be included.\n       Employees can upgrade to three more powerful computers at \n     their expense.\n       ``It does remind me of Henry Ford's decision to pay his \n     employees enough so they could afford his products,'' said \n     Malcolm Maclachlan, an e-commerce research analyst for \n     International Data Corp. in Mountain View, Calif.\n       ``It sort of goes against the grain of corporate America in \n     the last 20 years.

Introduction\n\n       America today is haunted by the paradox of hunger and food \n     insecurity amidst unprecedented prosperity. Despite a record \n     economic expansion that is now in its ninth year, accompanied \n     by an historic mix of low inflation and low unemployment, \n     millions of American households are struggling to find \n     sufficient resources to feed their family members.\n       Signs of our economy's unparalleled prosperity are \n     everywhere: the national unemployment rate, currently at 4.1 \n     percent, is the lowest in thirty years; after-tax average \n     income is expected to be 20% higher in 1999 than in 1977 \n     after adjusting for inflation; the stock market toys \n     repeatedly with new highs; consumer spending is at an all-\n     time high; the federal budget surplus is positive for the \n     first time since the sixties; and even the poverty rate has \n     edged downward with fewer children living in poverty today \n     than at any time since 1980.\\1\\ Among the industrialized \n     economies of the world, the United States has emerged from a \n     period of heavy corporate restructuring and deregulation, and \n     stands vibrant and flexible, leading the world in \n     technological innovation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       According to our national leaders, significant social goals \n     have also been accomplished during this period. Over the last \n     half decade, a profound transformation of our social welfare \n     system has occurred as key elements of the New Deal framework \n     have been replaced by time-limited public assistance and an \n     arrangement in which states have great flexibility over the \n     design and implementation of their welfare programs. \n     Congressional intent to reduce the number of poor families \n     receiving government benefits has been achieved in a \n     remarkably short period of time. The percentages of Americans \n     currently on welfare (2.7%) or receiving food stamps (6.6%) \n     are at historic lows: for welfare cash assistance, the \n     participation rate is the lowest in more than three decades \n     while the food stamp participation rate is the lowest since \n     1978 (``Green Book'', 1998).\n       The hallmark of these economic and policy accomplishments, \n     however, is paradox. Beneath the surface of almost \n     unparalleled economic vitality and the touted ``success'' of \n     the 1996 welfare reform law lie deep contradictions and \n     mismatches in the nation's social and economic fabric. The \n     most troubling aspect of our times is that the country's \n     economic prosperity has not been broadly or deeply shared. \n     And perhaps the most glaring manifestation of this fact is \n     the level of food insecurity and hunger in our society. \n     Hunger persists in every region of the country and in every \n     state--in urban, rural, and suburban areas, in households \n     with children, among the elderly and other adults who live on \n     their own, among minority and immigrant communities. Indeed, \n     in some pockets of our society, food insecurity and hunger \n     are at levels that pose significant public health problems, \n     seriously compromising individual and family health and \n     well-being while generating a myriad of societal costs.\n       This report constitutes a new and somewhat disturbing look \n     into America in 2000. Focusing on families with children, it \n     has three main purposes. The first is to present the most \n     current evidence on the problem of food insecurity and hunger \n     in America, synthesizing information from three key sources: \n     national studies, state and local studies, and finally, \n     reports concerning the use of the non-governmental emergency \n     food system. The second purpose is to identify the key forces \n     driving food insecurity and hunger within what is the now the \n     longest economic expansion since the Vietnam War. In \n     particular, we examine two sets of factors: problematic \n     aspects of the two major programs designed to assist poor \n     families--Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and the Food \n     Stamp Program--and at a more systemic level, economic forces \n     that are creating growth but also are increasing inequality, \n     insecurity, and wage stagnation at the lower end of the labor \n     market.\n       The final purpose of this report is to provide a framework \n     for a comprehensive approach to the problem of hunger and \n     food insecurity in America. A three-pronged approach is \n     suggested: (1) attending to the immediate need to improve \n     access to the Food Stamp Program for people who do not have \n     secure and safe sources of sufficient food, (2)\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\n     recasting the Food Stamp Program to orient it more to the \n     needs of low-income working families, and (3) addressing the \n     deepest roots of hunger in America through a fundamentally \n     new paradigm for domestic social policy that responds to--\n     rather than lags behind--the country's new social and \n     economic realities. Among the key components of such a \n     framework must be a revamped social insurance system \n     (including improved unemployment insurance and portable \n     benefits), more comprehensive income support programs that \n     help families supplement their earnings and stabilize their \n     economic circumstances, and opportunities for individuals and \n     families to build their assets and economic security over the \n     various stages of life.\n\n   II. Hunger and Food Security in the United States: What Does the \n                           Evidence Tell Us?\n\n       Information about the extent and severity of hunger and \n     food insecurity \\2\\ in the U.S. comes from several sources. \n     To provide information about circumstances at the national \n     level, in 1995 the U.S. government began to annually collect \n     data on the prevalence of food insecurity and hunger among \n     households. State and local studies of household food \n     security, typically conducted by non-governmental \n     organizations, also contribute important information. \n     Finally, evidence of food insecurity comes from studies that \n     document changes in emergency food demand in various parts of \n     the country. These varied sources of information capture \n     different aspects of food insecurity and hunger in America \n     today, and taken together constitute a composite of the \n     problem.\n\n\n              National Data on Food Insecurity and Hunger\n\n       Prior to the mid-1990s, estimates of the number of \n     households or individuals who were hungry or at risk of \n     hunger relied upon extrapolations of the poverty rate. With \n     the development and implementation of the USDA Food Security \n     Measure,\\3\\ the ability to consistently and reliably measure \n     the prevalence of hunger improved dramatically. The U.S. \n     government now collects information on the food security of \n     households in all states, and reports on an annual basis the \n     food security status of population groups over time.\n       The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has \n     released four years of household food security data, which \n     together cover the period from 1995 to 1998.\\4\\ The most \n     recent data released (1998 figures) show that an estimated \n     10.5 million households experienced some degree of food \n     insecurity, or 10.2% of all households in the United States. \n     Of the more than 30 million people who lived in these \n     households, nearly 40% (or 12.4 million) were children. Over \n     9 million households (3.6%) experienced hunger, the most \n     severe state of food insecurity (USDA, 1999).\n       In 1998, households with children--the focus of this \n     report--experienced food insecurity at more than double the \n     rate for households without children (15.2% versus 7.2%). \n     Households with the youngest children (under six) experienced \n     an even higher level of food insecurity (16.3%). Of the \n     different types of households with children, those headed \n     by single females showed the highest food insecurity and \n     hunger levels, with nearly one in three reporting food \n     insecurity and one in ten experiencing hunger (USDA, \n     1999).\n       Food insecurity prevalence for households with children \n     under 18 remained virtually unchanged across the four-year \n     period ending in 1998 at about 15% (see table below), \n     although the data indicate a small decline in the prevalence \n     of hunger. Given the unprecedented strength of economic \n     indicators during this period, a decline in the national food \n     insecurity prevalence could reasonably have been expected. \n     Instead, the data indicate that food insecurity remains a \n     serious, persistent problem in the U.S. with a significant \n     proportion of families and individuals struggling to meet \n     their basic food needs.\n\n   FOOD SECURITY PREVALENCE ESTIMATES FOR CHILDREN AND HOUSEHOLDS WITH\n                         CHILDREN 1995 AND 1998\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1995             1998\n                                       ---------------------------------\n                                          000s      %      000s      %\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHouseholds with children under 6......   18,003   100.0   17,176   100.0\n  Food insecure.......................    3,047    16.9    2,796    16.3\n    Without hunger....................    2,149    11.9    2,132    12.4\n    With hunger.......................      898     5.0      664     3.9\nHouseholds with children under 18.....   37,520   100.0   38,178   100.0\n  Food insecure.......................    5,791    15.4    5,812    15.2\n    Without hunger....................    3,940    10.5    4,216    11.0\n    With hunger.......................    1,851     4.9    1,596     4.2\nChildren in households................   70,279   100.0   71,463   100.0\n  Food insecure.......................   12,231    17.4   12,373    17.3\n    Without hunger....................    8,131    11.6    9,114    12.8\n    With hunger.......................    4,100     5.8    3,259     4.6\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture (1999).

This effort \n     includes the fielding of a nationally representative survey \n     called the National Survey of America's Families (NSAF). \n     Based on a sample of 44,461 households in 13 states, the 1997 \n     NSAF found that half of all families at 200% of the poverty \n     line or below worried about food shortages or had difficulty \n     affording food (Urban Institute, 1999).\\5\\ In their \n     examination of low-income households, the USDA reported that \n     nearly 40% of all households whose incomes were below half of \n     the poverty line experienced food insecurity in 1998 (USDA, \n     1999).\n\n\n               state and local food insecurity prevalence\n\n       Studies that measure state and local food insecurity \n     prevalence differ in scope and methodology. Some studies of \n     household food insecurity provide evidence of the statewide \n     prevalence, while others detail the characteristics of \n     household food insecurity on a local level.\\6\\ Studies of \n     economic well-being often incorporate a measure of food \n     insecurity as well. Depending upon the scope of the study, \n     samples range from random, representative samples to \n     convenience samples of at-risk populations. Although studies \n     use questions from the USDA Food Security Core Module, each \n     sampling approach provides specific information about \n     households that experience food insecurity and hunger.\n       Food insecurity and hunger prevalence appears to vary \n     considerably at the state level. USDA data shows that the \n     percentage of households experiencing food insecurity ranged \n     from 4.6% of households in North Dakota to 15.1% of \n     households in New Mexico (calculated as a three-year average \n     over the period of 1996-1998) (Nord et al., 1999). The Urban \n     Institute survey found that the percentage of low-income \n     families who worried about food or had difficulty purchasing \n     food among the 13 states surveyed ranged from 47% in \n     Wisconsin to 61% in Texas (Urban Institute, 1999).\n       These survey results have been augmented by a number of \n     recent studies conducted by citizen groups, academic \n     institutions, and state government agencies:\n       A survey of at-risk households in Green Bay, Wisconsin \n     conducted at 21 meal sites in April and May 1998 found that \n     66% of respondents reported food insecurity with varying \n     degrees of hunger. Of these, well over half (58.1%) suffered \n     moderate to severe hunger (Kok, 1998).\n       A California study of 823 families with incomes below the \n     poverty line seeking emergency services in April and May 1998 \n     found that 27% of households experienced food insecurity with \n     severe hunger, and 33% were food insecure with moderate \n     hunger present--an overall hunger prevalance of 60% \n     (California Food Policy Advocates, Persons . . ., 1998).\n       Using the USDA's Core Food Security Module, the Rhode \n     Island Department of Health conducted a pilot food security \n     assessment of households residing in poverty census tracts. \n     Of the 410 households surveyed, 24.4% were determined to be \n     food insecure. Among food insecure households, 15.6% were \n     food insecure without hunger and 8.8% of households \n     experienced hunger (RIDOH, 1999).\n\n            Food Insecurity Among Former Welfare Recipients\n\n       In addition to the sources cited above, documentation on \n     the food security status of former welfare recipients is \n     being collected by states in their examination of the effects \n     of policy changes on former recipients. While many studies of \n     the economic well-being of this population are currently \n     underway, some results are available. These studies, though \n     different in their methodologies, document persistent food \n     insecurity among former welfare recipients.\n       According to Urban Institute's national study more than \n     one-third (38%) of former recipients reported that they ran \n     out of food and did not have money for more (Loprest, 1999). \n     A number of state surveys of former welfare recipients report \n     similar outcomes:\n       In a Wisconsin welfare ``leaver'' study, 375 former \n     recipients were asked if there was ever a time after leaving \n     welfare when they could not buy food; 32% of those families \n     responded ``yes.'' Of those unable to purchase food, 49% \n     reported going either to a church, food pantry, food kitchen, \n     or shelter at some point; 46% went to friends and relatives, \n     and 5% reported going hungry (WDWD, 1999).\n       In 1997, 17% of 384 South Carolina survey respondents \n     reported that there were times, after leaving the welfare \n     program, when they had no way to buy food (SCDSS, 1999).\n       A post-time limit welfare tracking study in Connecticut \n     found that 22% of 421 respondents indicated that they \n     ``sometimes'' or ``often'' did not have enough to eat. Of \n     these respondents, 96% reported that the food they bought did \n     not last and they did not have money to buy more sometime \n     during the three months after the benefit termination \n     (Hunter-Manns et al, 1998).\n       In Michigan, 27% of families who had their cash assistance \n     benefits terminated due to sanctions reported not having \n     sufficient food (Colville et al, 1997).\n\n\n            reports from emergency food assistance providers\n\n       Emergency food providers, like soup kitchens and food \n     pantries, help supplement the food obtained through federal \n     food assistance programs, and also provide food to those who \n     are either ineligible for or do not participate in government \n     assistance programs. In addition to receiving commodities \n     through the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program \n     (TEFAP), emergency food providers obtain food supplies from \n     food banks and food rescue organizations, known collectively \n     as food recovery organizations (Youn, 1999).\n       When families experience food shortages, some turn to \n     emergency food programs, yet, many households remain food \n     insecure. In fact, the very act of seeking emergency food \n     assistance implies that families are unable to meet their \n     food needs after pooling resources from their own households, \n     federal food programs, or friends and family. Utilization of \n     emergency food assistance programs is therefore an indicator \n     of food insecurity.\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\n                 Emergency Food Demand High Nationwide\n\n       Recent national studies document persistent, and even \n     increased, demand for emergency food assistance. Second \n     Harvest reported that its emergency food programs across the \n     country served over 21 million people (an unduplicated count) \n     in 1997. Of the clients interviewed, 78.5% had insufficient \n     income for food and relied upon agency or government food \n     programs. Over one-quarter (27.5%) of Second Harvest clients \n     reported that adults in their household missed meals during \n     the previous month because they did not have enough food or \n     money to buy food. Of those households with children, 9.1% \n     reported that children missed meals in the prior month for \n     similar reasons (Second Harvest, 1998). In addition, Catholic \n     Charities reported that during 1998, the demand for emergency \n     food assistance rose an average of 38% among reporting \n     agencies (GAO, July 1999).\n       The recently-released U.S. Conference of Mayors survey of \n     26 major cities reveals that 85% of respondent cities \n     reported a rise in emergency food assistance demand between \n     November 1998 and October 1999, with requests increasing by \n     an average of 18% over the previous year. For those cities \n     reporting increases, the rising demand for emergency food \n     ranged from 1% in Chicago to 45% in Los Angeles. Nearly 60% \n     of those requesting food assistance were children and their \n     parents. In addition, over two-thirds (67%) of adults \n     requesting food assistance were employed. In all of the \n     cities surveyed, people relied upon emergency food assistance \n     facilities not only in emergencies but also as a steady \n     source of food over long periods of time. Officials in \n     virtually every city surveyed anticipate increased requests \n     for emergency food assistance in 1999, especially among \n     families with children (U.S. Conference of Mayors, 1999).\n\n      State and Local Emergency Food Programs Seeing More Families\n\n       Reports from states and metropolitan areas present a \n     similar, if not a more striking, picture of emergency food \n     demand in various regions throughout the United States. Of \n     those studies reviewed, recent increases in the number of \n     clients ranged from 14% to 36%.\n       Maryland emergency providers reported that from September \n     1997 to September 1998, soup kitchens experienced a 25% \n     increase in the number of children served, a 24% increase in \n     the number of women served, and a 19% increase in the number \n     of families served. Food pantries reported an 8% increase in \n     children, a 21% increase in women, and a 24% increase in the \n     number of families served (Center for Poverty Solutions, \n     1998).\n       A Massachusetts study of 98 emergency providers found that \n     between 1996 and 1997, 63% experienced a rise in the total \n     number of emergency food requests, with clients served \n     increasing an average of 22.4%. Over half (52.4%) of the \n     clients requesting emergency food assistance were families \n     with children, and nearly half of the programs reported an \n     increasing number of families with children requesting \n     services. (Project Bread and the Center on Hunger and \n     Poverty, Tufts University, 1998).\n       A recent survey of 330 New York City providers revealed \n     that emergency food requests at each site increased an \n     average of 36% from January 1998 to January 1999. Providers \n     reported a 72% increase in the number of families with \n     children seeking emergency food assistance (New York City \n     Coalition Against Hunger, 1999).\n       Of the greater Philadelphia community food providers \n     surveyed between April 1998 and April 1999, 67% reported a \n     greater demand for food assistance during this time period. \n     Overall, providers reported an 18% increase in the number of \n     individuals seeking food assistance compared to the previous \n     year, with 45% of their clients from families (Philabundance, \n     1999).\n       Connecticut also reported higher demand for food \n     assistance. Of the 128 food sites that reported an increased \n     demand for assistance between October 1997 and October 1998, \n     the number of persons served grew by an average of 24% \n     (Connecticut Association for Human Services, 1999).\n       At emergency food programs in Utah, researchers found a 24% \n     increase in the number of individuals served from 1997 to \n     1998, and an astonishing 107% increase over the prior two-\n     year period (Utah Food Bank, 1999).\n       An Oregon survey of over 680 regional food providers \n     reported that the number of people who received emergency \n     food boxes increased 14% from 1997 to 1998, to a high of \n     458,208 individuals, or 1 in 8 people in Oregon and Clark \n     County, Washington (Oregon Food Bank, 1999).\n\n           Emergency Food Providers Struggling to Meet Demand\n\n       Emergency food providers are struggling to meet the \n     increased food needs of their clients. Although the provider \n     network continues to grow, reports indicate that it is unable \n     to meet the demand for assistance, and providers must \n     sometimes either turn clients away or provide them with less \n     in order to stretch resources over a growing client \n     population. For example, the U.S. Conference of Mayors report \n     that in 1998, on average, 21% of requests for emergency food \n     assistance went unmet (U.S. Conference of Mayors, 1999).\n       Studies also indicate a shift in the composition of people \n     using emergency food programs. Soup kitchens, which have \n     traditionally served homeless adults, report an increase in \n     the number of families with children. Pantries report \n     increased requests for evening hours in order to serve needy \n     working parents. And food bank directors report increased \n     regular use of their programs by clientele who used to stop \n     in occasionally for a bag of food.\n       Taken together, this evidence raises red flags concerning \n     the depth of food insecurity experienced by many families. \n     Typically, seeking out emergency food assistance is an end-\n     stage coping strategy. As such, emergency food program \n     activity constitutes a unique barometer for gauging the \n     paradox of hunger in a strong economy, and is evidence of the \n     numbers of households and individuals for whom neither \n     employment in the strong economy nor federal safety nets are \n     providing the support necessary to ensure their food \n     security.\n\n\n                        Summing Up the Evidence\n\n       Based on data from national, state and local studies as \n     well as reports from emergency food providers, the evidence \n     on hunger and food insecurity in the United States can be \n     summarized as follows.\n       The national data show remarkably persistent levels of \n     aggregate household food insecurity over the last four years \n     that appear unresponsive to favorable national economic \n     trends. Approximately one in ten households in the US report \n     food insecurity; over 30 million adults and children live in \n     these households.\n       Household food security at the state level varies widely \n     around the national average, ranging from less than 5% to \n     over 15%.\n       Local studies using the same food security survey \n     instrument used by the USDA have found hunger prevalence \n     rates among various at-risk groups that are 5 to 10 times the \n     overall national rate.\n       Recent reports from emergency food assistance providers \n     across the country indicate greater dependence of food \n     insecure families on the emergency food system, increased \n     regular reliance on this system to meet household food needs, \n     a significant number of unfulfilled requests, and greater \n     numbers of families with children among their clientele.\n\n\n                               FOOTNOTES\n\n     \\1\\ Shapiro and Greenstein (1999): U.S. Census Bureau, \n     Statistical Abstract of the United States 1999.\n     \\2\\ Food insecurity occurs whenever the availability of \n     nutrionally adequate and safe food, or the ability to acquire \n     acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways, is limited or \n     uncertain. Hunger is defined as the uneasy or painful \n     sensation caused by a recurrent or involuntary lack of food \n     and is a potential, although not necessary, consequence of \n     food insecurity.

Mr. President, last November, Akezhan Kazhegeldin, \nwho served as Prime Minister of Kazakhstan from 1994 to 1997, was the \nfeatured speaker at the City Club of Cleveland. His remarks summarize \nthe many challenges and struggles in Kazakhstan and how the United \nStates can be a partner for progress and democracy in Central Asia.\n  I have a copy of Mr. Kazhegeldin's remarks, as well as a copy of the \nstory on his visit that appeared in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, and I \nask that both appear in the Record following the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The material follows:\n\n              Remarks of the Honorable Akezhan Kazhegeldin\n\n       Ladies and Gentlemen!\n       First of all, I would like to thank those who arranged this \n     radio forum and asked me to appear before you. This is not \n     only an honor for me, but also a great responsibility. At \n     this rostrum I have been preceded by many respected \n     politicians, among them presidents of the United States. Now \n     the chance to be heard here, in Ohio--the very heart of the \n     United States, has been given not only to me, Akezhan \n     Kazhegeldin, economist and politician, but through me to all \n     of Kazakhstan.\n       My country lies in the very center of Asia between Russia \n     and China, between Siberia and the great deserts. Poets say \n     that Kazakhstan is the very heart of Asia. For me, therefore, \n     this appearance before the citizens of Ohio represents a \n     conversation between two hearts, a true heart-to-heart talk.\n       American society needs first-hand knowledge about what is \n     happening in the countries which were formerly parts of the \n     Soviet Union. American corporations, working in Kazakhstan, \n     may have knowledge and understanding of geological resources, \n     but no more\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\n     than that. I am sure that the oil companies which worked in \n     Iran under Shah Pahlevi had the most detailed and accurate \n     geophysical maps. But these maps could not have predicted \n     that the Shah would be replaced by the Khomeini regime.\n       In many of the former Soviet republics one can clearly see \n     the possibility or the actual threat of new anti-democratic \n     regimes arising. They are not necessarily linked to religious \n     extremism. And even less to Islam. The Serbian leader \n     Milosevich is not an Islamic extremist. He is a Christian \n     extremist, a nationalist. But that does not make him any less \n     dangerous.\n\n\n                            ABOUT KAZAKHSTAN\n\n       My country has been in existence as an independent state \n     for only eight years. I am not surprised that not everyone \n     can find it on a map. And yet in recent times American \n     newspapers have been writing about Kazakhstan more \n     frequently. So it is harder nowadays to miss Kazakhstan. Some \n     may say that Kazakhstan is simply a splinter of the former \n     Soviet empire. If so, it is a very large splinter. The \n     largest if one does not count Russia. The territory of \n     Kazakhstan covers 2.7 million square kilometers. This huge \n     territory is inhabited by fifteen million people. This is a \n     bit more than the population of the greater New York \n     metropolitan area. I suspect that it will be a long time \n     before we enter the international discussion of world \n     overpopulation. Imagine the reaction of Japanese businessmen \n     during a four-hour flight from Almaty, our southern capital, \n     to Atray, the center of the oil production region in the \n     western part of the country, when they are told by the \n     stewardess that on their way they will pass over all of \n     three towns. On the other hand, Kazakhstan businessmen are \n     equally stunned when they find out the size of the assets \n     of Japanese and American banks. The total annual state \n     budget of Kazakhstan is somewhere in the area of six \n     billion dollars. That sum passes through a New York bank \n     during one week. And I am not specifically speaking of the \n     Bank of New York.\n\n\n                       THE RESOURCES OF DEMOCRACY\n\n       When I speak of money, I have no intention of asking for a \n     donation of a certain number of millions to Kazakhstan. This \n     in spite of the catastrophic lack of funds for everything and \n     anything, from formula for the newborn to pensions for the \n     aged. The envoys of the current president regularly come to \n     Washington to ask for credits and donations. But we, the \n     opposition, expect a different kind of aid from America. You \n     probably know the ancient saying that one can give a hungry \n     man a fish or one can teach him how to fish. This holds true \n     not only for Kazakhstan but for all other newly independent \n     states. People in those countries do indeed need the means to \n     exist, but what they need even more is the ability to earn \n     these means within the framework of a unified world market.\n       God has not been ungenerous to Kazakhstan when He \n     distributed natural resources. Oil is far from being our only \n     treasure. Kazakhstan possesses deposits of almost all metals, \n     including gold, aluminum, copper, titanium, uranium, zinc and \n     others. All of these resources were being used in one form or \n     another under the Soviet regime. Kazakhstan was then one of \n     the key regions impacting on the growth of the military and \n     industrial might of the Soviet Union.\n       When I entered the government in 1993 after having held the \n     position of President of the Entrepreneurs' Union, I \n     considered it my main task to attract foreign investment \n     capital. I traveled the world meeting with businessmen and \n     touting our mineral resources, our highly qualified labor \n     force and engineers, and the possibility of unlimited new \n     markets.\n       During the four years that I held the position of prime-\n     minister we were able to attract to our country hundreds of \n     Western, primarily American, companies. Their investments \n     totaled 9 billion dollars. We not only managed to avoid \n     defaulting on the multi-billion debt incurred by the previous \n     regime, but we created gold and hard currency reserves of a \n     size remarkable for a country such as Kazakhstan.\n       But I have to confess that during my tenure I failed to \n     achieve the most important goal--that of creating a \n     sufficient reserve of democracy in our society. Parallel with \n     the development of a liberalized economy an authoritarian and \n     anti-democratic regime was emerging in Kazakhstan--the regime \n     of President Nazarbaev.\n       And, unfortunately, I myself helped solidify it. As a young \n     politician and, more accurately, a technocrat, I believed \n     that everything would develop on its own as it should. \n     Together with my reform-minded colleagues I thought that once \n     a market economy was established, democracy would follow; \n     once Western investments started coming, society would \n     automatically become transparent; once a middle class had \n     emerged and defined its interests, a multi-party system would \nappear.\n\n       We were wrong. Even while still in the position of prime-\n     minister I began to notice that foreign investors would \n     frequently find themselves in conflict with local \n     administrations and would always lose in the end.\n       The courts and media controlled by local officials \n     invariably took the side of their bosses. Foreign investors \n     and ambassadors applied to me and in each specific case I was \n     forced to use my authority as prime-minister.\n       Our own businessmen found themselves in an even worse \n     situation. They became hostages to the officials. They did \n     not have embassies on their side, and their complaints were \n     not being heard by the international arbitration board in \n     Stockholm. Without the administration's patronage they were \n     unable to conduct their business.\n       At the same time more and more positions in government were \n     being occupied by the President's relatives. Other positions \n     went to nephews, to fellow-villagers and former colleagues in \n     the Communist Party.\n       Combining business holdings, obtained without investment or \n     qualifications, with power, they created a unique sort of \n     capitalism profiting an oligarchy determined by clan and \n     family ties. It was futile to expect of these people either \n     democratic views or even professional managerial conduct.\n       At this point I left the government and dedicated myself to \n     political activity. I became the head of the Union of \n     Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan and later the \n     chairman of the Republican National Party of Kazakhstan. \n     These organizations formed an opposition to President \n     Nazarbaev, and I personally was forced to leave my country \n     and seek temporary asylum in Western Europe.\n\n\n                              AMERICAN AID\n\n       I recently read in the New York Times a commentary by Tina \n     Rosenberg on the work of one of the specialists of the \n     Carnegie Endowment for Peace dealing with the effectiveness \n     of America's ``export of democracy''. I have not as yet seen \n     the book myself, but I noted the following figure: Seven \n     hundred nineteen million dollars were spent last year on US \n     government support of democracy in other countries.\n       Thomas Carothers attempted to estimate the effect of such \n     investment in democracy. This is an extremely important \n     question. In the case of Kazakhstan, I see how often such aid \n     is being used by anti-democratic forces for their own \n     purposes. I will give you an example: The International \n     Financial Corporation -opened the printing house ``Franklin'' \n     in Almaty. At first it printed a number of newspapers \n     expressing different viewpoints, among them ``Karavan'', the \n     most widely read and independent of the newspapers of \n     Kazakhstan.\n       However, just before last year's presidential elections the \n     authorities forced the owner to sell the newspaper together \n     with the printing house to a relative of President Nazarbaev. \n     Since then the facility has printed nothing but pro-\n     government publications, and the opposition has been forced \n     to print its materials a thousand miles away in Russia and \n     ship them secretly into Kazakhstan.\n       As you know, barely a month ago parliamentary elections \n     were held in Kazakhstan. They were carried out with massive \n     violations of voting procedures and false vote counts. As a \n     result, the majority of the seats in parliament went to the \n     candidates of the powers that be and to government officials. \n     This happened in spite of the fact that sociological polling \n     and the monitoring of voting precincts on election day \n     indicated that the opposition candidates were in the lead \n     across the country.\n       It is not surprising that all this falsification was \n     carried out and later covered up by the Central Electoral \n     Commission. The Commission was created and is controlled by \n     President Nazarbaev. It is, therefore, understandable that \n     local electoral commissions composed of government employees \n     and controlled by local administrators and governors added \n     fake ballots and issued false election returns.\n       What is amazing is the fact that on the eve of the \n     elections international organizations conducted serious work \n     of ``educating'' the members of these electoral commissions. \n     Dozens of experts from Western Europe and the United States \n     lectured on the subject of how ballots must be handled and \n     counted correctly and honestly. Members of the Central \n     Electoral Commission went abroad for training. Instructions \n     and methodological materials were printed, seminars \n     conducted. I do no know how much all of this cost, but I \n     suspect that millions were spent. We, the citizens of \n     Kazakhstan, watched all this as a performance of the theater-\n     of-the-absurd.\n       Why were all these efforts and funds, among them those of \n     the American taxpayers, expended in vain? As recently as in \n     January of this year, these very same electoral commissions \n     had falsified the results of the presidential elections. The \n     free press had been annihilated and many members of the \n     opposition had been denied their civil rights. I was one of \n     them.\n       The Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, a \n     number of Congressional committees and the Administration of \n     President Clinton have condemned those elections as \n     incompatible with democratic norms. The authorities of \n     Kazakhstan never intended to hold honest elections or to \n     admit opposition candidates to parliament. Could the \n     Administration and the agencies involved in foreign aid have \n     deemed it possible that, having falsified the presidential \n     election, Nursultan Nazarbaev would allow honest \n     parliamentary elections? That is hard to believe.\n\n\n                    THE SECRET STRATEGY OF DICTATORS\n\n       It seems to me that after the dissolution of the Soviet \n     bloc and the Soviet Union, the West was caught in a trap set \n     by crafty post-Soviet leaders. These people have learned the \n     lesson of history, they have understood that one cannot \n     openly reject democratic principles. They determined that it \n     is much better to verbally acknowledge common\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\n     human values, to proclaim them loudly at every turn, to \n     promise to stop all violations of human rights, and--most \n     of all--to abstain from polemics with the West.\n       Then one can pay yearly visits to Washington, make speeches \n     before members of the various think tanks about progress \n     towards democracy, and acquire the reputation of being ``our \n     man''. And meanwhile in one's own country one can destroy the \n     free press, quash the opposition, and prevent any possibility \n     of a transfer of power by constitutional means.\n       At the same time, these leaders, trying to preempt \n     criticism, are asking the West for help in building \n     democracy. They say that because of long years of Soviet \n     dictatorship, their citizens are unable to absorb such \n     concepts as equality before the law, freedom of speech, \n     political competition and the division of power.\n       Thus in April of this year, President Nazarbaev during his \n     appearance at the Carnegie Endowment asserted in all \n     seriousness that America had needed two hundred years to \n     build its democracy and that, therefore, no demands in that \n     respect could be made on Kazakhstan.\n       Had I been present at that meeting, I would have answered \n     my president by saying: ``Had American presidents allowed \n     themselves to rig elections and prolong their terms in office \n     at will, even five hundred years would not have been enough \n     for building democracy in the United States.''\n       It is hard to say how many American consultants have \n     visited Kazakhstan and how many proposals and memorandums \n     they have written for the government. All of them were \n     qualified experts, all of them believed that the government \n     was just waiting for their recommendations to make one more \n     step toward genuine democracy. But none of these \n     recommendations are implemented if they go contrary to the \n     preservation of power by the new ``nomenklatura''.\n       You must realize that the elective nature of local \n     government has been abolished in Kazakhstan. All regional \n     governors and local mayors are appointed by the President. \n     There is a Ministry of Information and Social Concensus which \n     controls the media and printing. What kind of recommendations \n     can one give to these institutions? All this reminds one of a \n     discourse between a cannibal and dieticians. The members of \n     the rubber-stamp parliament have frequently visited \n     Washington on the invitation of their colleagues, the US \n     legislators. They pretended to admire the perfection of the \n     American system of division of power and then returned home \n     to vote for granting President Nararbaev additional powers \n     and authority and extending his term of office from five to \n     seven years. There is a Russian proverb ``The oats were of no \n     profit to the horse''. I think it fits the situation.\n       A year ago a ban was placed on the publication of my book \n     ``The Right to Chose'', which exposed the true nature of the \n     current regime. More than three hundred thousand copies \n     published in the Kazakh language were destroyed. For the last \n     two years the authorities have been denying registration to \n     the newspaper ``Respublika''. During the presidential \n     elections twelve opposition papers and two radio stations \n     were closed down. Three printing houses were confiscated \n     and have not been returned to their owners. Quite recently \n     the owner of the independent radio station RIK was forced \n     to leave for Canada.\n       I was outraged when I heard the testimony of Kazakhstan's \n     ambassador to Washington Nurgaliev at the hearings before the \n     Congressional Committee on Cooperation and Security in \n     Europe. He was trying to convince Congress that democracy was \n     indeed evolving in Kazakhstan, that it was becoming an \n     accomplished fact. As proof thereof he cited the cooperation \n     of his government with international organizations and \n     American consultants.\n       And this at a time when it is clear to any objective \n     observer that Kazakhstan is moving swiftly away from \n     democracy and mutating towards a classic dictatorship. What \n     is encouraging is that US legislators do not allow themselves \n     to be duped by such litanies of ``good deeds'' and continue \n     to condemn the anti-democratic practices of the current \n     regime.\n       Does this mean that the United States should abandon their \n     efforts to export democracy to post-Soviet states? Not at \n     all! But it would be useful to analyze the correlation \n     between cost and effect.\n       When viewed from that perspective, the most effective aid \n     turns out to be that which is given not to governmental \n     bodies, but to specific opposition groups, to independent \n     newspapers to intellectuals, to unofficial trade unions. It \n     is such aid that proved to be decisive in Poland. A simple \n     Xerox machine in the hands of ``Solidarity'' proved to be a \n     more powerful weapon than the guns and clubs of the secret \n     police.\n       But one must remember that the new dictators are extremely \n     resourceful. For the benefit of the West they create a large \n     number of seemingly non-governmental and quite democratic \n     organizations: ``pocket'' trade-unions, environmental \n     movements, women's movements, fake political parties.\n       It would seem, that a foreigner would be incapable of \n     telling a genuine human rights advocate from a false one, a \n     real democratic movement from a fictional one. But in \n     actuality, it is all quite simple: There is only one \n     criterion and it is well known to your journalists and \n     diplomats who work in Kazakhstan: Does this or that \n     opposition group allow itself to criticize the President?\n       All the ``pocket'' dissidents and fictional opponents are \n     permitted to severely criticize and expose regional governors \n     and even government ministers, but will never dare to point \n     out that, if corruption has pervaded the highest levels of \n     government, the President is obviously aiding and abetting \n     it. Once you identify the ``upper limit of criticism'', you \n     can determine whether the organization in question is really \n     independent of the government and the secret police.\n\n\n                THE VOICE OF AMERICA MUST BE TRULY HEARD\n\n       The credit for the fact that the Soviet Union crumbled of \n     its own accord without anybody coming to its defense belongs \n     to a greater degree to the radios ``Liberty'' and ``Voice of \n     America'' than to the Pentagon and the CIA. I hope that the \n     workers of those two venerable agencies will not feel \n     offended.\n       But it is precisely from those broadcasts that I myself \n     gained my basic understanding of a free society and of a \n     market economy. At that time the broadcasts were being \n     heavily jammed, but we listened anyway. We did so because man \n     has, among other instincts, the very basic instinct, the \n     unquenchable desire to know the truth. The great Russian \n     writer and the great dissident of the Soviet era, Nobel Prize \n     Laureate Alexander Solzhenitsyn proclaimed that ``God is to \n     be found in truth, not in might''. It is because of this that \n     Brezhnev feared him more than any other of his enemies.\n       This is why, when I meet with members of Congress and the \n     Administration in Washington, I ask them again and again not \n     to cut down on broadcasts to the former Soviet republics, but \n     to create broadcast services for each of the new states of \n     Central Asia. My people need information as much as they need \n     bread.\n       You cannot imagine to what length my fellow-citizens will \n     go to obtain truthful information. Because of the difference \n     in time zones, they watch Russian TV broadcasts deep into the \n     night trying to find out what is really happening in \n     Kazakhstan. Early in October the New York Times published an \n     article about the fact that the Swiss police had frozen the \n     personal bank account of President Nazarbaev in the amount of \n     eighty five million dollars. As soon as reports about this \n     event began to be broadcast by Russian television stations, \n     all Russian TV channels were blocked for three days in \n     Kazakhstan.\n       I am sure that you find it hard to believe. But this is \n     indeed so. Try to imagine it. Try to imagine how hard it is \n     for people to live not only in poverty but surrounded by \n     lies. Help people in all post-Soviet states to turn from mere \n     populations into civic societies. The broadcasts of the Voice \n     of America and of Radio Liberty must not be curtailed.\n       Full-fledged programs for each of these states in its own \n     language must be created. One should not economize on truth \n     and freedom of information. The United States, as the last of \n     the superpowers, bear the responsibility for maintaining not \n     only peace but truth. I repeat the words of Solzhenitsyn: \n     ``God is to be found in truth, not in might''.\n\n\n                         THE THREAT TO THE WEST\n\n       No one can say that Kazakhstan and other states of Central \n     Asia are being ignored by American diplomats and non-\n     governmental experts. But this is so mainly because of their \n     oil and the question of its delivery to Western markets. The \n     bloody conflict in Chechnya and the armed religious movements \n     in these countries are viewed merely as arguments pro or con \n     for one or the other route the future gigantic pipeline might \n     take.\n       I am convinced that world history is driven not by oil, but \n     by blood. The danger of terrorist movements lies not in the \n     fact that they may hinder the building of this or that \n     pipeline, but in the fact that they disrupt and destroy \n     human lives. Remember Bosnia and Kosovo. There is no oil \n     in the Balkans, but the threat to peace which arose there \n     forced the United States and NATO to send their troops.\n       If after the passing of Tito the West had not abandoned \n     Yugoslavia to the tender mercies of Milosevich, if the \n     democratic movements there had received support in the \n     nineteen eighties, the dissolution of that state would not \n     have been as tragic and prolonged. If a radio ``Free Serbia'' \n     had begun broadcasting early enough, Milosevich would have \n     left the scene five years ago. Instead, just as the \n     presidents of some of the CIS countries, among them President \n     Nazarbaev, had done, he placed his daughter at the head of \n     state television and radio. The Serbian people became the \n     victims of nationalist lies and have suffered for it.\n       Nationalism and religious extremism are the two main \n     threats to a happy and prosperous future. Do they threaten \n     Kazakhstan? To a great extent they do, unless the opposition \n     forces and world opinion counter them with a democratic \n     alternative. Otherwise no strong-hand tactics, not \n     dictatorial regime will stand up to that threat.\n       Conversely, dictatorship and the corruption it breeds is \n     likely to lead to an explosion of religious, and particularly \n     Islamic, fanaticism. In a poor country where the ruling elite \n     cynically robs the people and deprives them of the \n     opportunity to express their aspirations, the emergence of \n     religious extremism becomes unavoidable.\n       The average person sees that he or she cannot change \n     anything, becomes desperate and ready to do anything. And at \n     this moment a preacher inevitably appears saying that God \n     will bless your protest and forgive any bloodshed. All that \n     remains is to find the weapons, and that is not difficult in \n     our world today.\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\n       So wherein lies the true source of religious extremism--in \n     religion or in dictatorship which pushes people towards \n     violence? The answer is self-evident. Leaders of some CIS \n     regimes find it useful to have a few extremist Islamic groups \n     handy to frighten the West.\n       They tell you: ``Only dictatorship can stop Islamic terror. \n     If you do not support me, your oil pipelines will suffer''. \n     This is a lie. This is a total reversal of cause and effect. \n     The longer dictatorial clan-based regimes remain in power, \n     the greater will the influence of religious fanatics become, \n     and the more blood will be spilled eventually.\n       For Kazakhstan the threat of national and religious \n     extremism is especially great. In our country there are as \n     many Kazakhs as non-Kazakhs, as many Muslims as there are \n     Orthodox Christians. If the danger of religious extremism \n     arises in the predominantly Kazakh south, the Russian \n     population which is concentrated in the north will turn to \n     Russia for aid. The oil-rich western part of the country will \n     proclaim its own interests. In that case the \n     ``balkanization'' of Kazakhstan will become inevitable.\n       It pains me to say all this. I am asking you to help my \n     country avoid this fate. There is no other way to achieve \n     this than to help the people of Kazakhstan to secure those \n     freedoms which were initially promised by the Constitution \n     but which were then stolen: the freedom of speech, the \n     freedom of forming political organizations, the freedom to \n     choose one's representatives in the governing bodies. And, I \n     beg, do not help dictators stay in power.\n       Our world stands on the threshold of a new millennium. \n     There is a saying: ``As you greet the New Year, so will you \n     live in it''. If this is true, then equally true would be the \n     conclusion that ``as you greet a new century, so will you \n     live in it'', or ``as you greet a new millennium, so will you \n     live in it''. During most of the first millennium of the new \n     era East and West existed apart from each other. During the \n     second millennium they fought a great deal. Let us live the \n     third millennium in peace, justice and prosperity.\n       I thank you for your interest in my country, Kazakhstan, \n     and its people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         National Exile Warns of Extremist Threat in Kazakhstan\n\n          [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, OH, Nov. 13, 1999]\n\n                            (By Joe Frolik)\n\n       A Kazakhstani dissident leader in exile since April warns \n     that his resource-rich homeland could fall prey to religious \n     or nationalist extremists if the current regime continues to \n     resist democratic reforms.\n       Akezhan Kazhegeldin told a City Club of Cleveland audience \n     yesterday that United States and other democratic countries \n     should continue pressing the former Soviet Republic of \n     Kazakhstan to hold open elections, to allow a free press and \n     to permit political dissent.\n       ``When the average person sees that he or she cannot change \n     anything, they become desperate and ready to do anything,'' \n     said Kazhegeldin, Kazakhstanys Prime Minister before he broke \n     with President Nursultan Nazarbaev in 1997. ``It pains me to \n     say all this. I am asking you to help my country avoid this \n     fate.''\n       Nazarbaev was Kazakhstan's communist boss at the end of the \n     Soviet Union and became president of the newly independent \n     republic. He has concentrated economic and political power in \n     family members and sponsored a series of elections that have \n     been criticized by outside observers, including the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n       Last year, Nazarbaev suddenly moved the date of the next \n     presidential election ahead two years.\n       Then his election commission disqualified Kazhegeldin, who \n     most Western observers consider the country's most popular \n     opposition figure. The reason: He had delivered a speech to \n     an ``unauthorized'' group--Kazakhstanis for Free Elections. \n     Kazhegeldin also was barred from last month's parliamentary \n     ballot, though by then he had fled to Moscow and then London \n     after being shot at and accused of corruption and money \n     laundering.\n       He has denied the charges.\n       Nazarbaev himself is widely suspected of having profited \n     from power.\n       The Guardian newspaper last year reported that he was the \n     eighth wealthiest person in the world.\n       Kazakhstan covers 1 million square miles of Central Asia \n     and borders both Russia and China.\n       It is believed to contain the world's largest untapped pool \n     of oil, as well as large deposits of gold and titanium.\n       But unemployment is high and the average annual income is \n     less than $1,300,according to the State Department.\n       Foreign investors are afraid to set up shop in Kazakhstan, \n     Kazhegeldin said, because of an unreliable legal \n     system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S392-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNITION OF ANNE SWANT'S AP BIOLOGY CLASS IN WALLA WALLA\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in November I had the pleasure of \njoining a unique group of students on a field trip to Coppei Creek \noutside of Walla Walla, Washington. The Advanced Placement biology \nclass from Walla Walla high school, led by their teacher Anne Swant, \nhas been engaged in an innovative program to study wild steelhead \nrestoration and monitor water quality.\n  The Coppei Creek project is a collaboration between the Walla Walla \nconservation district, Tri-State Steelheaders, City of Waitsburg, and \nlocal landowners. This group came together after severe flooding \ndamaged property and habitat in 1996. Their goal was to restore stream \nhabitat for threatened steelhead while providing necessary flood \ncontrol for adjacent farmlands.\n  As part of the ``Four Schools'' project Anne Swant's class has teamed \nup with John Geidl, a retired educator and executive secretary of Tri-\nState Steelheaders, to institute a ``classrooms in the stream'' \nproject--teaching biology and scientific research techniques through \nreal-life applications.\n  In addition to the work at Coppei Creek, the students helped design \nand construct in-stream habitat and riparian buffers for a fish-bearing \nstream on their own school campus.\n  For their leadership in this revolutionary program, I was proud to \naward Anne Swant and John Geidl one of my ``Innovation in Education'' \nawards for excellence and creativity in hands-on science learning and \nleadership in teaching community conservation.\n  This program, and the Coppei Creek restoration project are models of \nlocally-driven conservation and education initiatives. This community \nhas taken it upon itself, without unnecessary pressure from Washington \nDC bureaucrats, to engage in salmon habitat restoration and use it as \nan educational experience for future stewards of this precious \nresource.\n  Clearly, a good education in today's world requires much more than \njust solid academic instruction--it must also include a broader \nunderstanding of the application of those skills learned in the \nclassroom. The Four Schools Project is an excellent example of this \nprinciple in action. I propose to my colleagues here in the Senate that \nthis successful project is further proof that local educators will be \nable to make the best decisions about the unique needs of their \nstudents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S392-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S392-S393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE WATCHDOGS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a \nspecial program that is having a positive impact on schools throughout \nmy home State of Arkansas. This program is called WatchDOGS, and was \nfounded to combat school violence in the wake of the Jonesboro tragedy \nby Jim Moore, PTA President of Gene George Elementary School in \nSprindgale, Arkansas. Jim has informed me that the program has rapidly \nexpanded to about 35 schools and I share in his goal of seeing it \nimplemented in schools throughout the State of Arkansas. Furthermore, \nit is my hope that this program will be implemented in schools \nthroughout the nation.\n  In a WatchDOGS program, fathers and grandfathers of students \nvolunteer to spend at least one day a year in their child's school. By \ndoing so, they not only provide unobtrusive security, but they also \nserve as positive role models for the children. Each school has a \nWatchDOGS coordinator who schedules the shifts to ensure that there is \na father or grandfather on the premises at all times. WatchDOGS \nparticipate in a wide variety of school activities. For example, they \nread to and tutor students, participate in playground activities, eat \nlunch with students, and assist in the loading and unloading of school \nbuses.\n  I believe that this program can be a great tool in our efforts to \nprevent school violence and to improve student performance because it \nincrease parental initiative and involvement in their children's \neducation. It can often be implemented without any expenditure of \nschool funds as the only supplies necessary are a pair of walkie-\ntalkies and identifying t-shirts, which are usually donated by local \nmerchants or the PTA.\n  I hope that my colleagues will ask the school superintendents and \nprincipals in their respective home states to consider implementing \nthis program in their schools. Finally, I wish to thank Jim Moore, Gene \nGeorge Elementary School Principal Jim Lewis,\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\nand all the other people who have worked so hard to develop and \nimplement the WatchDOGS program. Thank you for helping to make Arkansas \nschools the safe havens of learning that they are meant to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/07/senate-section/article/S393-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S393-S453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n  H.R. 833, as amended and passed by the Senate on February 2, 2000, is \nas follows:\n\n         Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 833) entitled ``An Act to amend title 11 of the United \n     States Code, and for other purposes.'', do pass with the \n     following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

EXCLUSIVE ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Only the Attorney General of a State in \n     which electric power is provided under the contract referred \n     to in section 1802(a)(4), as the contract may be amended \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, may bring a civil \n     action in United States district court for an order that--\n       (1) declares the amended contract not consistent with the \n     findings and purposes of this title and is therefore void;\n       (2) enjoins performance of the amended contract; and\n       (3) relieves the electric utilities that are party to the \n     amended contract of any liability under the contract.\n       (b) Timing.--A civil action under subsection (a) shall be \n     brought not later than 1 year after the date of the amended \n     contract or new contract.\n\n                 TITLE XIX--CONSUMER CREDIT DISCLOSURE\n\n     SEC. 1901.
