Mr. President, I rise this morning to reflect on the \nservice of our 11 colleagues who will be completing their Senate \nservice in the next few days. Hugh Sidey, one of the great journalists \nand political observers of our time, who covered eight Presidents and \nbecame well acquainted with those Presidents, once said that \n``politics, after all is said and done, is the business of belief and \nenthusiasm. Hope energizes, doubt destroys. Hopelessness is not our \nheritage.'' So said Mr. Sidey. Aside from the fact that he has Nebraska \nroots, which I suspect reflects some element of his good judgment, he \nis right.\n  As we reflect on the service of these 11 individuals who will be \nleaving this institution, the one common denominator that anchored the \n11 was commitment to something bigger than themselves: service to this \ncountry. The 11 individuals reflect our society, as does this body, \nfrom the States they represented, to their backgrounds, to their \ncommitments. That, too, represented what may be this country's greatest \nstrength and that is its diversity.\n  As Tom Daschle mentioned last night at the Supreme Court dinner, in \nthe history of this institution, only 1,853 men and women have ever \nserved\n\n[[Page S11618]]\n\nhere. Now, we will increase that number on January 3. But the 11 \ncolleagues and friends who leave this institution are among those 1,853 \nindividuals who have served and are now serving.\n  I think it is worthy to bring some note to these 11 individuals. They \nhave been honored and recognized throughout this year, and very \nappropriately so, individually by many Members of this body, but I \nwish, in the few minutes I have, to maybe tie some more general themes \ntogether about why these 11 men have been so important together to this \nbody.\n  We begin by asking the question: Who are these 11 bold, different, \ndistinguished citizens?\n  Well, first, they are from all parts of the country. They are of \ndifferent religions. They are fathers, husbands, brothers, uncles, and \ngrandfathers. Scattered among these 11, of course, are Republicans and \nDemocrats, maybe liberals, maybe some conservatives, and maybe some \nmoderates.\n  As we look further, we find the veterans--World War II veterans, \nVietnam war veterans. One among them is my friend and colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Bob Kerrey, who holds the Congressional Medal of \nHonor.\n  We have war heroes and veterans among these 11. We have former \nGovernors, former attorneys general, ambassadors, businessmen, \njournalists, lawyers, and bankers--all representing the fiber of this \ncountry, all representing the different universes of this country that \ntie us together as a nation. Surely among the 11 is one of the \npreeminent public servants of our time, Senator Moynihan from New York.\n  At a time when the world peers in the large window of the front room \nof American politics--in some cases they may be bewildered by what they \nare seeing in this country, that we can't seem to elect a President--it \nis even more important that we spend some time reflecting on these 11 \nindividuals because, as we know, this country will produce a President. \nThat President will govern. That President will be effective. And the \ninstitution of the U.S. Senate will be very much a part of assisting \nthat President in governing this country, which has immense \nconsequences for the world.\n  If there is a question about unsteadiness in this country or our \ninstitutions, again we need only reference the 11 Senators who will be \nleaving this body because there was nothing unsteady about these 11 \nindividuals. They were anchored to a Constitution that has been the \nroadmap for this great country for over 200 years, and that has ensured \nthe liberties, the privileges, and the rights that these 11 individuals \nfought for, debated over, and made stronger.\n  These 11 Senators brought unique experience and perspectives. They \napplied those in their own ways and in their own individual styles, \nwhich again has added to the richness of the culture of this \ninstitution and reflects the richness and the culture of this country. \nEvery new Senator we bring on and every Senator who leaves has had a \npart in stitching the fabric--and continues to stitch the fabric--of \nthis country.\n  At a time when we question the institutional structures, the \nprocedures and the processes, we must not forget that it is the \nindividual that has made this country what it is. De Tocqueville wrote \nabout it in the mid-19th century. When he observed America and wrote at \nthat point the most authoritative document on America, he said the most \namazing thing about America was the magic of America. He said it was \nthe individual. It was individual commitment. It was freedom. That was \nthe magic of America.\n  Arnold Toynbee, who probably wrote the most definitive book on the \ncivilization of mankind as he documented the 21 civilizations of the \nworld, wrote that each civilization begins with a challenge and a \nresponse.\n  Surely, as we reflect on these 11 Senators, each of their lives is a \nremarkable story. Each has been, as Toynbee wrote in his study of \nhistory, a challenge and response. That is what representative \ngovernment is about. But it cannot function without the individual \ncommitment of people such as these 11 distinguished Americans who leave \nthis body.\n  Yes, they helped chart a course for this country. And, yes, they \nhelped fulfill the destiny of this country. Yes, they understood \nexactly what Hugh Sidey said--that hopelessness is not our heritage. \nThey understood that as well as any 11 people in the history of this \ncountry.\n  But they did something equally remarkable in that they inspired \nothers.\n  I suspect, as you go across those 11 States represented by these 11 \nSenators, and go into schools and talk to teachers and young men and \nwomen who watched Pat Moynihan, Bob Kerrey, Frank Lautenberg, and \nConnie Mack, they would have a story. They would have some dynamic to \ntheir personal lives that somehow would be tied back to leadership and \nthe inspiration of one of these 11 Senators. In the end, that is our \nhighest obligation in public service. In the end, that is the most \nimportant thing we can do.\n  Not just for the Record but because it is important that we hear the \nlist of these names, I would like to read the list of these 11 \nSenators:\n  Senator Spence Abraham from Michigan;\n  Senator John Ashcroft from Missouri;\n  Senator Richard Bryan from Nevada;\n  Senator Slade Gorton from Washington;\n  Senator Rod Grams from Minnesota;\n  Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska;\n  Senator Frank Lautenberg from New Jersey;\n  Senator Connie Mack from Florida;\n  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan from New York;\n  Senator Chuck Robb from Virginia;\n  And Senator Bill Roth from Delaware.\n  They have accomplished, each in their own way but, more importantly, \ntogether as part of this institution, a remarkable number of things in \ntheir careers. Many will go on and do other things. All will stay \nactive. All will stay committed to this country.\n  What they have done, for which we all are grateful and for which \nAmerica is grateful, deserves immense recognition; that is, they leave \nthis great institution stronger and better because of their service. \nTherefore, they leave America stronger and better because of their \nservice.\n  Mr. President, thank you for allowing me some time to talk about our \ncolleagues whom all of us will miss.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/06/senate-section/article/S11618-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11618-S11621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ABOLISH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 5 weeks ago, on November 1, I held a news \nconference with my colleague from Illinois, Congressman Ray LaHood, on \nthe subject of the electoral college. I always preface my remarks on \nthis issue by reminding people that that was before the November 7 \nelection.\n  In 1993, I had introduced legislation with Congressman Gerald \nKleczka, of Wisconsin, as a Member of the House, to abolish the \nelectoral college. Congressman LaHood and I came forward on November 1 \nof this year and made the same recommendation before the election on \nNovember 7. So what I am about to say and what I am about to propose, \nreally, although it is going to take into account what happened in our \nlast election, is motivated by a belief that the underlying mechanism \nin America for choosing the President of the United States is flawed \nand should be changed.\n  On that day, November 1, I came to the floor of the Senate to explain \nwhy I thought the Constitution should be amended to replace the \nelectoral college with a system to directly elect our President. One \nweek after the press conference, the American people went to the polls \nto express their will. It is worth pausing to realize that we are \nliving through an extraordinary election, the closest by far in more \nthan a century. As we await the outcome, it is important to remember \nthat soon our country will have a new President. I am confident that \nour great Nation\n\n[[Page S11619]]\n\nwill successfully navigate the difficulties of this historic election. \nI am concerned, however, at the loss of confidence of the American \nvoters in the system we know as the electoral college.\n  If we do nothing else over the next year, let's commit to improve and \nreform the way we elect leaders in America. There are three critical \nareas of election system reform that I think we should address. The \nfirst is campaign financing. I certainly support the McCain-Feingold \nbipartisan approach to cleaning up the way we pay for campaigns. The \nsecond is the mechanisms of the voting process. My colleagues, Senator \nSchumer of New York and Senator Brownback of Kansas, have suggested we \nput some money on the table for States and localities that want to put \nin more efficient and more accurate voting machinery. I think that is a \ngood idea. And, of course, the third is changing the electoral college. \nToday I will discuss replacing that system with a direct popular vote \nfor President.\n  For those who want to defend the current electoral college system, I \nwant to ask, What are the philosophical underpinnings that lie at its \nfoundation? I submit there are none. Instead, the electoral college was \na contrived institution, created to appeal to a majority of the \ndelegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, who were divided by \nthe issue of Federal versus State powers, big State versus small State \nrivalries, the balance of power between branches of Government, and \nslavery.\n  James Madison was opposed to any system of electing the President \nthat did not maintain the South's representational formula gained in an \nearlier compromise that counted three-fifths of the African American \npopulation toward their State totals. A direct popular election of the \nChief Executive would have diluted the influence of the South and \ndiluted the votes based on the slave population.\n  Many delegates opposed a direct popular election on the grounds that \nvoters would not have sufficient knowledge of the candidates to make an \ninformed choice. Roger Sherman, delegate from Connecticut, said during \nthe Convention: I stand opposed to the election by the people. The \npeople want for information and are constantly liable to be misled.\n  Given the slowness of travel and communication of that day, coupled \nwith the low level of literacy, the delegates feared that national \ncandidates would be rare and that favorite sons would dominate the \npolitical landscape. James Madison predicted that the House of \nRepresentatives would end up choosing the President 19 times out of 20.\n\n  Also, this system was created before the era of national political \nparties. The delegates intended the electoral college to consist of a \ngroup of wise men--and they were all men at that time--appointed by the \nStates, who would gather to select a President based primarily on their \nindividual judgments. It was a compromise between election of the \nPresident by Congress and election by popular vote. Certainly, it is \nunderstandable that a young nation, forged in revolution and \nexperimenting with a new form of government, would choose a less risky \nmethod for selecting a President.\n  Clearly, most of the original reasons for creating the electoral \ncollege have long since disappeared, and after 200 years of experience \nwith democracy, the rationale for replacing it with a direct popular \nvote is clear and compelling.\n  First, the electoral college is undemocratic and unfair. It distorts \nthe election process, with some votes by design having more weight than \nothers. Imagine for a moment if you were told as follows: We want you \nto vote for President. We are going to give you one vote in selection \nof the President, but a neighbor of yours is going to have three votes \nin selecting the President.\n  You would say that is not American, that is fundamentally unfair. We \nlive in a nation that is one person--one citizen, one vote.\n  But that is exactly what the electoral college does. When you look at \nthe States, Wyoming has a population of roughly 480,000 people. In the \nState of Wyoming, they have three electoral votes. So that means that \nroughly they have 1 vote for President for every 160,000 people who \nlive in the State of Wyoming--1 vote for President, 160,000 people. My \nhome State of Illinois: 12 million people and specifically 22 electoral \nvotes. That means it takes 550,000 voters in Illinois to vote and cast \n1 electoral vote for President. Comparing the voters in Wyoming] to the \nvoters in Illinois, there are three times as many people voting in \nIllinois to have 1 vote for President as in the State of Wyoming.\n  On the other hand, the philosophical underpinning of a direct popular \nelection system is so clear and compelling it hardly needs mentioning. \nWe use direct elections to choose Senators, Governors, Congressmen, and \nmayors, but we do not use it to elect a President. One-person, one-\nvote, and majority rule are supposedly basic tenets of a democracy.\n  I am reminded of the debate that surrounded the 17th amendment which \nprovides for the direct election of Senators. It is interesting. When \nour Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they said the people of \nthe United States could choose and fill basically three Federal \noffices: The U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, and the \nPresident and Vice President. But only in the case of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives did they allow the American people to directly elect \nthat Federal officer with an election every 24 months.\n  I suppose their theory at the time was those running for Congress \nlived closer to the voters, and if the voters made a mistake, in 24 \nmonths they could correct it. But when it came to the election of \nSenators in the original Constitution, those Founding Fathers committed \nto democracy did not trust democracy. They said: We will let State \nlegislatures choose those who will serve in the Senate. That was the \ncase in America until 1913. With the 17th amendment, we provided for \nthe direct election of Senators. So now we directly elect Senators and \nCongressmen, but we still cling to this age-old electoral college as an \nindirect way of electing Presidents of the United States. The single \ngreatest benefit of adopting the 17th amendment and providing for the \ndirect election of Senators was that voters felt more invested in the \nSenate as an institution and therefore able to have more faith in it.\n  In my State, in that early debate about the 17th amendment, there was \na Senator who was accused of bribing members of the State legislature \nto be elected to the Senate. There were two different hearings on \nCapitol Hill. The first exonerated him. The second found evidence that \nbribery did take place. That was part of the impetus behind this reform \nmovement in the direct election of Senators.\n  Second, while it appears smaller and more rural States have an \nadvantage in the electoral college, the reality of modern Presidential \ncampaigns is that these States are generally ignored.\n  One of my colleagues on the floor said: I will fight you, Durbin, on \nthis idea of abolishing the electoral college. I come from a little \nState, and if you go to a popular vote to elect a President, \nPresidential candidates will pay no attention to my little State.\n  I have news for my colleagues. You did not see Governor Bush or Vice \nPresident Gore spending much time campaigning in Rhode Island or Idaho. \nIn fact, 14 States were never visited by either candidate during the \ncampaign, while 38 States received 10 or fewer visits. The more \npopulous contested States with their large electoral prizes, such as \nFlorida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin, really have the true \nadvantage whether we have a direct election or whether we have it by \nthe electoral college.\n  Third, the electoral college system totally discounts the votes of \nthose supporting the losing candidate in their State. In the 2000 \nPresidential race, 36 States were never really in doubt. The average \npercentage difference of the popular vote between the candidates in \nthose States was more than 20 percent. The current system not only \ndiscounts losing votes; it essentially adds the full weight and value \nof those votes to the candidate those voters oppose.\n\n  If you were on the losing side in a State such as Illinois, which \nwent for Al Gore, if you cast your vote for George Bush, your vote is \nnot counted. It is a winner-take-all situation. All 22\n\n[[Page S11620]]\n\nelectoral votes in the State of Illinois went to Al Gore, as the votes \nin other States, such as Texas, went exclusively to George Bush.\n  Fourth, the winner-take-all rules greatly increase the risk that \nminor third party candidates will determine who is elected President. \nIn the electoral college system, the importance of a small number of \nvotes in a few key States is greatly magnified. In a number of U.S. \nPresidential elections, third party candidates have affected a few key \nState races and determined the overall winner.\n  We can remember that Ross Perot may have cost President Bush his \nreelection in 1992, and Ralph Nader may have cost Al Gore the 2000 \nelection. In fact, in 1 out of every 4 Presidential elections since \n1824, the winner was one State away from becoming the loser based on \nthe electoral college vote count.\n  This is a chart which basically goes through the U.S. Presidential \nelections since 1824 and talks about those situations where we had a \nminority President, which we did with John Adams in 1824, with \nRutherford B. Hayes in 1876, and Benjamin Harrison in 1888. These \nPresidential candidates lost the popular vote but won the election, \nwhich is rare in American history. It may happen this time. We do not \nknow the outcome yet as I speak on the floor today.\n  In so many other times, though, we had very close elections where, in \nfact, the electoral vote was not close at all. Take the extremely close \nrace in 1960 to which many of us point: John Kennedy, 49.7 percent of \nthe vote; Richard Nixon, 49.5 percent. Look at the electoral college \nbreakdown: 56 percent going to John Kennedy; 40 percent to Richard \nNixon. The electoral college did not reflect the feelings of America \nwhen it came to that race.\n  The same thing can be said when we look at the race in 1976. Jimmy \nCarter won with 50.1 percent of the vote over Gerald Ford with 48 \npercent of the vote. Jimmy Carter ended up with 55 percent of the \nelectoral college and Gerald Ford with 44 percent. Again, the electoral \ncollege did not reflect that reality.\n  In comparison, under a direct popular vote system where over 100 \nmillion votes are cast, third party candidates generally would have a \nmuch more difficult time playing the spoiler. For instance, there have \nonly been two elections since 1824 where the popular vote has been \nclose enough to even consider a recount. Those were 1880 and 1960. In \ntoday's Presidential elections, a difference of even one-tenth of 1 \npercent represents 100,000 votes.\n  Fifth, the electoral college is clearly a more risky system than a \ndirect popular vote, providing ample opportunity for manipulation, \nmischief, and litigation.\n  The electoral college provides that the House of Representatives \nchoose the President when no candidate receives a majority of electoral \nvotes. That happened in 1801 and 1825.\n  The electoral system allows Congress to dispute the legitimacy of \nelectors. This occurred several times just after the Civil War and once \nin 1969.\n  In 1836, the Whig Party ran different Presidential candidates in \ndifferent regions of the country. Their plan was to capitalize on the \nlocal popularity of the various candidates and then to pool the Whig \nelectors to vote for a single Whig candidate or to throw the election \nto Congress.\n  In this century, electors in seven elections have cast ballots for \ncandidates contrary to their State vote. Presidents have received fewer \npopular votes than their main opponent in 3 of the 44 elections since \n1824.\n  In the 2000 election, I ask why the intense spotlight on Florida? The \nanswer is simple: That is where the deciding electoral votes are. More \ndisturbing is the fact that anyone following the election knew that \nFlorida was the tightest race of those States with large electoral \nprizes. Those wishing to manipulate the election had a very clear \ntarget.\n  In contrast, under a direct popular vote system, there is no \nequivalent pressure point. Any scheme attempting to change several \nhundred thousand votes necessary to turn even the closest Presidential \nelection is difficult to imagine in a country as vast and populous as \nthe United States. Similarly, as I previously mentioned, recounts will \nbe much more rare under a direct popular vote system given the size of \nthe electorate.\n  Some people have said to me: Durbin, if you have a direct popular \nvote--here we had Gore winning the vote this time by 250,000 votes--\nwouldn't you have contests all across the Nation to try to make up that \ndifference? Look what happened in Florida. The original Bush margin was \nabout 1,700 votes. It is now down to 500 votes after 4 weeks of recount \nefforts and efforts in court, not a very substantial change in a State \nwith 6 million votes. So to change 250,000 votes nationwide if we go to \na popular vote would, of course, be a daunting challenge.\n  Throughout American history, there has been an inexorable march \ntoward one citizen, one vote. As the Thirteen Colonies were debating if \nand how to join a more perfect Union, only a privileged few--those with \nthe right skin color, the right gender, and the right financial \nstatus--enjoyed the right to cast votes to select their leaders. The \npeople even gained the right to choose their Senators by popular vote \nwith the ratification of the 17th amendment in 1913.\n  As one barrier after another has fallen, we are one step away from a \nsystem that treats all Americans equally, where a ballot cast for \nPresident in Illinois or Utah or Rhode Island has the same weight as \none cast in Oregon or Florida. The electoral college is the last \nbarrier preventing us from achieving that goal. As the world's first \nand greatest democracy, it is time to fully trust the people of America \nand allow them the right to choose a President.\n  We would like to say, when this is all over, that the American people \nhave spoken and chosen their President. The fact is that is not the \ncase. With the electoral college, the American people do not make the \nchoice. The choice is made indirectly, by electing electors in each \nState, on a winner-take-all basis.\n  I leave you with a quote from Representative George Norris of \nNebraska, who said the following during the debate in 1911 in support \nof the direct election of U.S. Senators. I quote:\n\n       It is upon the citizens that we depend for stability as a \n     government. It is upon the patriotic, common, industrious \n     people of our country that our Government must always lean in \n     time of danger and distress. To this class of people then, we \n     should give the right to control by direct election the \n     selection of our public officials and to permit each citizen \n     who is part of the sinew and backbone of our Government in \n     time of danger to exercise his influence by direct vote in \n     time of peace.\n\n  Mr. President, I will be introducing this proposal to abolish the \nelectoral college and to establish the direct election of a President \nas part of our agenda in the next Congress. I sincerely hope it will be \ndebated and considered. This time is the right time for us to take the \ntime and look at the way we choose the President of the United States. \nIt will not change the outcome of what happened on November 7 in the \nyear 2000. But if history is our guide, I hope we will learn from this \npast experience and make our election machinery more democratic and \nmore responsive.\n  Part of my proposal will also include the requirement that anyone to \nbe elected President has to win 40 percent of the popular vote. Failing \nthat, the top two candidates would face a runoff election. I think it \nis reasonable to suggest that leading this country requires at least \nthe approval of 40 percent of the popular vote. That is why it would be \nincluded.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate, even those from the smaller \nStates, will pause and take a look at this proposal.\n  I hope, before I yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota, to \nmake one other comment. There is a lot of talk about how this contest \nis going to end when it comes to this last election and the impact it \nwill have on the Presidency.\n  I continue to believe that the American people want a strong \nPresident. They want a strong leader in the White House. They want our \nPresident to succeed. Whoever is finally declared the winner in the \nNovember 7, 2000, election, that person, I believe, deserves the \nsupport not only of the American people but clearly of Congress, too. \nWe have to rally behind our next President in support of those \ndecisions which really do chart the course for America. I think that \nforce, coupled with the\n\n[[Page S11621]]\n\nSenate equally divided 50-50, is going to be a positive force in \nbringing this Nation back together after this session of Congress comes \nto a close.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/06/senate-section/article/S11621-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I submit for the Record the names of \nthose Americans who exactly 1 year ago were killed by gunfire.\n  It has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still \nthis Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.\n  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nUntil we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of \nthose who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and \nwe will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.\n  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following \nare the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year \nago today:\n  December 6, 1999: Shyheem Abraham, 17, Philadelphia, PA; Godofredo \nCarmenate, 70, Miami-Dade County, FL; Mike D'Alessandro, 32, \nPhiladelphia, PA; John Davis, 18, Gary, IN; Norman Dotson, 33, Detroit, \nMI; Bernie Graham, 29, Fort Worth, TX; Latnaia Jefferies, 27, Gary, IN; \nJames Jones III, 24, Baltimore, MD; Lorraine Lawhorn, 45, Knoxville, \nTN; Tavares Lavor McNeil, 22, Baltimore, MD; Emmett Outlaw, 76, \nMemphis, TN; Chester Roscoe, 28, Rochester, NY; Tavrise Tate, 20, \nChicago, IL; and Antonio Thompson, 21, Charlotte, NC.\n  One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 45-year-old Lorraine \nLawhorn of Knoxville, was shot and killed by one of her coworkers who \nrecently had been fired. The gunman shot Lorraine in the back of the \nhead.\n  We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. \nThe deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to \nenact sensible gun legislation now.\n  Mr. President, am I correct that we have 5 minutes left in morning \nbusiness, and then we will be going to the bankruptcy bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/06/senate-section/article/S11621-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will speak on the bankruptcy bill in \na moment. But in the time I have in morning business, I will speak on \nanother matter. I do not have any statistics with me, but maybe that is \nbetter; I can talk about it in more personal or human terms.\n  In 1997, we passed the Balanced Budget Act with much acclaim. To be \nvery bipartisan about this, President Clinton was very much for it. I \nthink many Democrats and Republicans voted for it. But what has \nhappened is--with the benefit of some time for observation and, \nhopefully, reflection--the cuts in Medicare have been draconian and \nhave had a very harsh effect on health care, the quality of health care \nin our States, for Minnesota, Rhode Island, and all across the country.\n  It does not do any good to look back and affix blame. The point is, \nlast year we said we were going to fix this problem. I think Senators--\nDemocrats and Republicans alike--have heard from people back in their \nStates.\n  In my State of Minnesota, here is the effect of this. First of all, \nin our rural communities, in what we call greater Minnesota outside the \nmetro area, in the absence of getting some decent Medicare \nreimbursement, where you have a disproportionate number of elderly \npeople living who are dependent on health care, the cost of providing \nthat health care runs ahead of the reimbursement. The hospitals are \nlosing money.\n  Here is the problem. This is not the case of greedy hospitals or \ngreedy doctors. As a matter of fact, they have a very low profit \nmargin. In fact, many hospitals have gone under over the last several \nyears. When the hospital is no longer there, that is the beginning of \nthe death of a community because people do not raise their children in \ncommunities unless there are good schools and good hospitals and good \nhealth care.\n  So we are in a real crisis, which should be spelled in capital \nletters, in the State of Minnesota, where many of our rural health care \nproviders will go under unless we fix this problem, which is a problem \nwe created. The same thing can be said for nursing homes, where there \nis inadequate reimbursement. The same thing can be said for home health \ncare providers. The same thing can be said for medical education, which \nis financed, believe it or not, in part out of Medicare. The cuts in \nthe reimbursement have led to a very serious situation in all of our \nStates--certainly in Minnesota.\n  Then there are those hospitals--Hennepin County Medical Center is a \nperfect example; it is a very good public hospital; there are not a lot \nof them left--that, in fact, provide medical care to a disproportionate \nnumber of poor people in America. These hospitals are really having a \ndifficult time making it. They are not going to continue to be \nfinancially solvent because we have so cut the reimbursement that they \ndo not have the financial stability.\n  We never should have done this, but we did.\n  Then last year, we passed a piece of legislation. I feel kind of \nguilty about this. I didn't think it 100-percent fixed the problem, but \nI thought it did more than it did. So I went back to meet with people. \nWe all go back to our States. We should. We meet with people in \ncommunities. We want to do well for people.\n  I said: Listen, I think this is going to really help. To the best of \nmy ability, I talked about what this package was. But as it turns out, \nit, at best, I think, dealt with about 10 percent of the cuts, \nsomewhere in that neighborhood.\n  We should not leave here--I want to go home, believe me. I want to go \nhome. I would love to be back home. I would love not to be here right \nnow, although I am always happy to be in the Senate. It is an honor. \nBut you know what I am saying.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If we just put everything off and have a continuing \nresolution until next year and we do not fix this problem, it will be \nirresponsible.\n  There is one proposal--that tends to be the Republican proposal, as I \nunderstand it--that gives a lot more of the money over the next 5 years \nto managed care plans without any requirement that they be accountable \nand that they serve senior citizens and serve people who live in rural \ncommunities, which they do not do now. Too many managed care plans have \ncut loose people they are supposed to be helping, and that is not the \nanswer.\n\n  We have a package--I believe it is a Democratic package; it can be \nDemocratic, Republican, anybody's package for all I care; I just want \nto get it done--which is $40 billion over the next 5 years, which does \nput the emphasis on getting the resources back to our rural health care \nproviders and home health care providers and nursing homes and public \nhospitals and medical education, all of which is essential to whether \nor not we are going to be able to provide people with humane, \ndignified, and quality health care.\n  This is an important family issue. This is an important people issue. \nThis is an important Minnesota issue. This is an important national \nsecurity issue. We ought to get the job done before we leave.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that we now have concluded with \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the conference\n\n[[Page S11622]]\n\nreport to accompany H.R. 2415, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany the bill (H.R. 2415) an act \n     to enhance security of the United States missions and \n     personnel overseas, to authorize appropriations for the \n     Department of State for fiscal year 2000, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have up to an hour. I don't know that \nI will take all that time. I might take about a half an hour now. If \nother Senators come down to the floor, then I certainly would yield the \nfloor and reserve the balance of my time for tomorrow.\n  We are at the final days of the 106th Congress, I hope. Maybe we are \nnot. Maybe we are going to be here until Hanukkah or Christmas. I think \nwe are in the final days.\n  It is bitterly ironic to me that once again we are dealing with this \nbankruptcy ``reform'' bill. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a major safety net \nprogram so that if you find yourself in horrible financial \ncircumstances, crisis financial circumstances, you can file chapter 7 \nand rebuild your life. About 50 percent of the people who do that do it \nbecause of a medical bill that puts them under or they lose their job \nor have such a tight budget.\n  We don't have that kind of tight budget. We make a very high salary. \nBut a lot of people don't. So if every month you have to scratch and \nclaw to make ends meet, and your car breaks down or, Lord, your child \nhas some kind of an infection and you get antibiotics that can cost \n$80-$90, you can find yourself in a tough situation. It is major \nmedical bills that are the principal reason.\n  At the end of the 106th Congress, a do-nothing Congress, are we doing \nanything during this lame duck session to deal with economic security \nfor families? No. Are we considering any kind of health care \nlegislation that would make health care coverage more affordable for \npeople? No. Are we passing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nwhich focuses on that issue about which I heard so much in the \nPresidential campaign; namely, education, making sure that there is \ngood, high-quality education for every child? No. Have we raised the \nminimum wage yet? No. Have we done anything to deal with catastrophic \nmedical expenses, if you should be aged, older, and wind up in a \nnursing home, or you need somebody to help you stay at home so you \ndon't have to be in a nursing home? No.\n  What do we have before us instead? We have something before us in \nthis lame duck session--the majority leader came out yesterday and \ncalled for another cloture vote--that is 100 percent representative of \nthe 106th Congress; that is to say, it will do nothing. It is will do \nnothing because it is going to come to nothing. And it is going to come \nto nothing because the President is going to veto it. In all \nlikelihood, we won't be here anyway. It will end up being a pocket \nveto. If we are here, I am convinced we would get the 34 votes to \nsustain the veto. But that is now how we are spending our time.\n  This is a do-nothing effort for, unfortunately, a worse than do-\nnothing bill because it will do harm to people which will amount to \nnothing in a do-nothing Congress. There is a symmetry to this.\n  I observed one thing from the beginning about this bill. It is \nhemorrhaging support. There was a time when there was a stampede for \n``bankruptcy reform,'' but now what has happened is, at least on our \nside, the majority of Democrats are opposed to this bill. Every single \ncivil rights organization, labor organization, women's organization, \nchildren's organization, and consumer organization opposes it. I didn't \nsay the credit card companies oppose it or the big financial \ninstitutions.\n  I think we will get a solid vote on Thursday, and it will pass. But \nwe will be close to the number of votes that we need to sustain a \nPresidential veto. I thank President Clinton for being so strong on \nthis. In any case, in all likelihood we will be gone. I don't even know \nwhat this exercise is about.\n  We can do better in the 107th Congress. We can have a piece of \nlegislation that is balanced. We can have bankruptcy reform. We can \nmake sure the scope of this legislation deals directly with those \npeople who abuse this system, a very small percentage, and we can also \ncall upon the credit card companies to be accountable. Instead we have \nthis out here, which is going to go nowhere.\n  I rise to talk a little bit about how awful this piece of legislation \nis. Supporters have cited the high number of bankruptcy filings in \nrecent years as the reason to move forward on what they call \n``reform.'' But there has been a dramatic drop in the last 2 years in \nthe number of bankruptcies. That is about the period of time we have \nheld up this piece of legislation. In the months since the Senate \npassed bankruptcy reform, any pretense that this legislation is needed \nhas evaporated. The number of bankruptcies has fallen steadily over the \npast year. Charge-offs and credit card debt are down significantly, and \ndelinquencies have fallen to the lowest level since 1995.\n  The proponents and opponents agree that nearly all the debtors who \nresort to bankruptcy do not game the system but do it out of desperate \nfinancial circumstances, and that only a tiny minority of chapter 7 \nfilers, as few as 3 percent, could afford repayment.\n  Where is the crisis? We are trying to address yesterday's headline. \nBut as I have already stated, there really should not be any wonder. \nThe credit card industry wants this legislation. They want to be able \nto protect the risky investments they have made. They want to be able \nto pump their credit cards out to our children--everybody has had that \nexperience--and they want the Senate to do their bidding.\n  Bankruptcy ``reform'' has been nothing more than a filler on the \nSenate calendar. It is a place holder while we wait for some \nappropriations bill, some agreement. That is what this proceeding is \nabout.\n  Guess what. That is where all the attention is focused. The calendar \nmay say that bankruptcy is on the agenda, but I can tell you--and my \ncolleagues know this is true--it is not bankruptcy ``reform'' that is \non the minds of our colleagues. Instead, we are all obsessing over \nnegotiations in maybe a smoke-filled room--or maybe it is not smoke \nfilled--with very few of us who are party to it. That is why right now \nthere is little attention given to this legislation. That is another \nawful thing. We don't get our work done, we don't get these bills out \nhere, and it winds up with a few people negotiating and the rest of us \nwaiting around like potted plants. None of us worked hard to get here \nfor this kind of process. I will tell you something else. None of us \nworked hard to get here for a process where the majority leader can \ntake a piece of legislation--the State Department embassy bill--and \ncompletely gut it, where the only thing left is the number, and put a \nbankruptcy bill in it and bring it over here under the conference \ncommittee rules. That makes a mockery of the legislative process--a \nmockery.\n  I will tell you something else. I will try to say it with a twinkle \nin my eye because it never does any good to get bitter. But even from \nmy own caucuses I sometimes don't understand the votes of some \nDemocrats on this, because we have discussions in our caucus, and the \none thing we feel strongly about--and I hope Republicans feel just as \nstrongly about this--is that we have to change our modus operandi. We \ncannot continue to do things outside the scope of conference and put \neverything into conference committee. We have to have bills out here, \nwe have to have amendments, and we have to have debate. We have to have \na vital institution again where Senators can become good Senators--not \nwait around for a year and a half where you can hardly do anything. We \nhave had that discussion in our caucus, and then some Democrats come \nout and vote for this turkey. I don't understand why. It is such an \naffront to what should be the legislative process and the way this \ninstitution works.\n  I wish to begin by laying out my reasons for opposing this measure, \nand I hope today we will have a thorough discussion. I know a number of \nSenators are going to be speaking in opposition. I am sure some \ncolleagues and friends, such as Senator Grassley, will be out here to \nspeak for it, or Senator Biden.\n  Reasons for opposing the conference report: The legislation, No. 1, \nrests on faulty premises. The bill addresses a crisis that doesn't \nexist. Increased filings are being used as an excuse to\n\n[[Page S11623]]\n\nharshly restrict bankruptcy protection, but the filings have abruptly \nfallen in the last 2 years. Additionally, the bill is based on the myth \nthat the stigma of bankruptcy has declined. There is not a shred of \nevidence for that. In fact, that is part of the reason that 116 law \nprofessors who teach bankruptcy law in the country have said this bill \nis a mistake, and they point out that it is hardly the case that people \njust abuse it and feel no stigma.\n  No. 2, abusive filers are not the majority; they are a tiny minority. \nLet's write a good bill that goes after them. But let's not have some \nsweeping bill that turns the clock back and basically removes a major \nsafety net not just for low-income families but middle-income families. \nBill proponents cite the need to curb ``abusive'' filings as the reason \nto harshly restrict bankruptcy protection. But the American Bankruptcy \nInstitute found that only 3 percent of chapter 7 filers could have paid \nback more of their debt. Even the bill's supporters acknowledge that \nthe highest percentage you could get would be 10 to 13 percent.\n\n  No. 3, the conference report falls heaviest on the most vulnerable. \nThe harsh restrictions in this bill will make bankruptcy less \nprotective, more complicated and expensive to file, and this will make \nit much harder for low- and moderate-income people to effectively file \nand get any protection. Unfortunately, the means test and safe harbor \nwill not shield any debtor from the majority of these harsh provisions \nand have been written in such a way that they will capture many debtors \nwho truly have no ability to pay off significant debt. They won't make \nit with chapter 13. The only way they will have a chance to rebuild \ntheir lives is to be able to file chapter 7. They won't be able to do \nit under this legislation.\n  No. 4, the bankruptcy code is a critical safety net for America's \nmiddle class. Low- and moderate-income families--especially single \nparent families--are those who most need the ``fresh start'' which is \nprovided by bankruptcy protection. This bill will make it much harder \nfor them to get out from under the burden of crushing debt.\n  Colleagues, this is a very harsh piece of legislation that is going \nto most dramatically hurt the most vulnerable people in this country--\nwomen and children, working income, low- and moderate-income families \nput under.\n  About 50 percent of the bankruptcy cases are because of a major \nmedical bill. Now, I have no doubt that the credit card industry has \npumped unbelievable amounts of money into getting this passed. They are \neverywhere. This is a pretty one-sided debate because the people who \nget the protection are the people without the money. They are not the \nbig contributors. They are not the heavy hitters. They are not the well \nconnected. They are not the players. But why don't we get it right and \npass a decent bill, not one that hurts those people who are most \nvulnerable?\n  No. 5, the banking and credit card industry--is anybody surprised?--\ngets a free ride. The bill as drafted gives a free ride to banks and \ncredit card companies that deserve much of the blame for the high \nnumber of bankruptcy filings because of their loose credit standards. \nLenders can pump those credit cards and they can be involved in all the \nreckless lending--and I will have more to say about that later--and now \nwe bail them out. This is a bailout for the big credit card companies \nand the big lenders.\n  No. 6, this legislation may cause increased bankruptcies and \ndefaults. Another bitter irony. Several economists have suggested that \nrestricting access to bankruptcy protection will actually increase the \nnumber of filings and defaults because banks will be more willing to \nlend money to marginal candidates.\n  Indeed, it is no coincidence that the recent surge in bankruptcy \nfilings began immediately after the last major ``pro-creditor reforms'' \nwere passed by the Congress in 1984. You make it easy for them to do \nthis, to be involved in reckless lending, and they know they will be \nable to collect. They know people won't be able to file chapter 7, and \nthis will lead to more reckless lending and more bankruptcy.\n  No. 7, this conference report is worse than the Senate bill.\n  I opposed the Senate bill. However, even that flawed legislation was \nfar superior to this conference report. The sham bankruptcy \n``conference'' report has taken big steps backward when it comes to \nbalancing fairness.\n  No. 8, again, I am going to emphasize this over and over again to \nDemocrats and Republicans because we are 50-50; or, we may be 50-50. We \nmay be 51-49. But we could be the majority someday. We could very well \nbe the majority someday.\n  This conference report mocks the legislative process. This is a \nlarger issue than bankruptcy reform. It is a question of the \nfundamental integrity of the Senate as a legislative body. Not one \nprovision in the original State Department authorization bill--aside \nfrom the bill number itself--remains a part of this legislation. To \nreplace in totality a piece of legislation with a wholly new and \nunrelated bill in conference takes the Congress one step forward to a \nvirtual tricameral legislature--House, Senate, and conference \ncommittee.\n  I will tell you something. Again, if there is one thing we had better \nagree to over the next couple of weeks when it comes to shared power, \nit better be that we are going to put an end to the abusive use of \nthese conference committees. We never should have moved away from rule \nXXVIII. We should not let unrelated amendments or basically whole new \nbills be put into conference reports and then brought back to this \nChamber this way. It is an outrageous abuse of the legislative process. \nI think the Senate should vote against this for that reason alone.\n  I say to the majority that we could be a majority in the Senate. You \nwouldn't want it done to you either.\n  I want to observe that in July my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, \nreferred to the opposition to this bill as ``radical fringe.'' I think \nhe is one of the best Senators in the Senate. But, again, I will repeat \nthis. I am in the company of every consumer organization that I know \nof--every labor union, every civil rights organization, every women's \norganization, and almost every children's organization that I know of. \nIt is one of the broadest coalitions I have ever seen.\n  I say to my colleagues that it is said you can tell a lot about a \nperson by who his or her friends are. You can also tell a lot about a \npiece of legislation by who the enemies are.\n  I don't see a lot of working families, a lot of hard-pressed \nfamilies, a lot of ordinary citizens around this country, from \nMinnesota to Arkansas to New York to California, clamoring for this \npiece of legislation for which the credit card companies are so gung-\nho.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that this is a bad bill. It punishes the \nmost vulnerable and rewards the big banks and credit card companies for \ntheir own poor practices.\n  I am for a more balanced bill. I think we can do it the next time. We \ncan go after the tiny minority that abuses it. We ought to have some \nstandards that these credit card companies have to live up to as well.\n  Earlier, I used the word ``injustice'' to describe this bill. That is \nexactly right. It would be a bitter irony if the creditors were able to \nuse a crisis--largely their own marking--to encourage Congress to \ndecrease more borrowing access.\n  We should have a major safety net program for the vast majority in \nthis country.\n  This is sham reform.\n  Real bankruptcy reform would address the concentration of financial \nmarkets, which is increasing the power and clout of the big banks and \ncredit card companies to unprecedented levels.\n  Real bankruptcy reform would address the predatory and abusive \nlending.\n  Real bankruptcy reform would make working families more economically \nsecure.\n\n  Real reform would address skyrocketing and unaffordable medical \nexpenses.\n  Real economic reform would confront the increasing chasm between the \nwealthy and the rest of America. But instead of lifting up working \nfamilies, and instead of lifting up the majority, the standard of \nliving of the majority living in this country, this bill punishes them. \nAnd I urge its rejection.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for debate tomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11624]]\n\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nunder the time allocated for Senator Leahy on the bankruptcy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I come to the floor today, as I did on the last day of October, to \nstate my opposition to this bankruptcy conference report. This is an \nissue that I have worked on for the last 4 years. For 2 of those years, \nI served on a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee with Senator \nGrassley. I worked very closely with many in drafting what I consider \nto be very balanced and very positive bankruptcy reform. That bill was \ncalled for a vote on the floor of the Senate. Ninety-seven Senators \nvoted in favor of that bill. It was the most overwhelming vote on this \nsubject to my knowledge that we have seen on the Senate floor in modern \ntimes. It was a balanced bill. I thought it was a good bill.\n  For these last 2 years, I have not served on the Judiciary Committee, \nand it has been Senator Grassley's responsibility to continue this \neffort. He came forward with a bill which I supported on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Sadly, when this bill left the Senate floor to go to conference \ncommittee, it got in trouble again. Some of the special interests that \nare interested in this particular bill can't wait for this conference \ncommittee to literally rip apart the best efforts of the Senate.\n  They did it 4 years ago; they have done it this year. They have taken \nwhat was a generally good bill on bankruptcy and made some rather \ndisastrous changes in it. I think that is unfortunate.\n  I accept the premise that bankruptcy reform is overdue. I think it is \nunfair to consumers across America to try to absorb all the costs of \nthose who go to bankruptcy court, particularly those who have no \nbusiness in bankruptcy court. But I also believe the credit industry \nhas a responsibility as well. This bill does not serve the needs of \nbalance. This bill, the conference report that is before the Senate \ntoday, is a conference report that was written entirely by the \nRepublican Party. They didn't even invite the Democratic conferees into \nthe discussion. It was a slam dunk--take it or leave it.\n  As far as I am concerned, I want to leave it. I think we can do a \nbetter job. If we have to wait for a new Congress to accomplish that, \nso be it.\n  Let me say from the outset, I support and am committed to bankruptcy \nreform. There are some things we can and should do to make it a better \nsystem. What we have today is not balanced. Make no mistake, this \nbankruptcy bill is lopsided in favor of the credit card industry.\n  When I came to the floor on November 1 and voted against cloture on \nthis particular bill, some of my colleagues asked me why. Why did I, a \nMember who previously voted for bankruptcy reform, now oppose this \nconference report? I oppose it because the bill I voted for was \ndecimated in conference. As a result, we have before the Senate a very \npoor work product.\n  In 1985, Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance \nCorporation of New York City, said:\n\n       [Bankruptcy would be] like stepping into a tepid bath and \n     slashing your wrists. You might not feel yourself dying, but \n     that's what would happen.\n\n  I oppose this one-sided bankruptcy conference report on behalf of \ndebtors who lack the lobbying dollars of the credit card industry and \nare unable to make their voices heard. We must keep in mind, the vast \nmajority of people who go to the bankruptcy court don't want to be \nthere. They are people in a very low-income status who have found \nthemselves, because of circumstances beyond their control, unable to \npay off their debts. They go many times with embarrassment to a \nbankruptcy court because they have nowhere else to turn. I oppose the \nbankruptcy conference report on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of \npeople in this predicament. I am talking about older Americans, women \nraising families, and unemployed workers.\n  When you do a survey of the reasons people end up in bankruptcy \ncourt, many of the same reasons keep coming forward: Unanticipated \nhealth care bills can happen to anybody; a divorce which results in one \nof the spouses ending up with custody and very few assets to take care \nof the children; the loss of a job. These sorts of things are totally \nunanticipated, and people find themselves needing to turn to bankruptcy \nto get a fresh start in life.\n  Older Americans are less likely to end up in bankruptcy than their \nyounger counterparts, but when they do file, a large fraction of them, \nnearly 40 percent, give medical debts as the reason for filing. Another \nreason is jobs. The economic consequences for someone who has worked \nfor 30 years and loses his job at age 54 can be catastrophic.\n  Both men and women are more likely to declare bankruptcy following \ndivorce. Families already laden with consumer debt can't divide their \nincome to support two households and survive economically. Divorced \nwomen file for bankruptcy in greater proportion than divorced men. \nAccording to the credit industry's own data, women heads of household \nare not only the largest demographic group in bankruptcy; they are also \nthe poorest. I remind Members of that fact when we consider the debate \non this bill.\n\n  Yesterday, my friend, the Senator who chairs the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Orrin Hatch, came to the floor and made note of the fact \nthat there are provisions made in this bankruptcy conference report \nthat benefit and improve the status of women and children in the throes \nof bankruptcy. What Senator Hatch failed to add was that there are also \nprovisions in this bill which enhance and improve the status of credit \ncard companies so that debts that otherwise would have been wiped away \nor discharged linger and continue to plague the limited assets left \nover after a bankruptcy.\n  So while it is true you may put the women and children at the head of \nthe line, the line is a very short one with very few dollars because \nthe credit card industry receives benefits under this bill to allow \nthem to continue to pursue the debts of someone who has filed for \nbankruptcy, whereas today they could not.\n  More than half the debtors who file for bankruptcy report a \nsignificant period of unemployment preceding their filings. For single-\nparent households, a period of unemployment can be absolutely \ndevastating. It is on behalf of these debtors that I opposed this \nunbalanced bankruptcy conference report that gives them little or \nnothing.\n  Some of my colleagues may be saying, what is the Senator talking \nabout? Doesn't the bankruptcy bill put women and children first, as \nSenator Hatch said yesterday? Indeed, that was the rhetoric we heard. \nSenators came to the floor with large posters claiming how wonderful \nthe bankruptcy bill was for women and children.\n  Mr. President, the bankruptcy bill does grant first priority to \nalimony and support claims. Unfortunately, the bill places women and \nchildren first in line to receive little or nothing. Priority is only \nrelevant for distributions made to creditors in the bankruptcy case \nitself. However, such distributions are made in only a negligible \npercentage of cases.\n  More than 95 percent of bankruptcy cases make no distribution to \ncreditors because there are no assets to distribute. So to say to women \nand children, when it is all over we will give you a greater share of \nthe assets, in 95 percent of the cases there are no assets to give \nthem; the assets have been dissipated and used up already by the credit \ncard creditors.\n  The real battle for women and children is reaching an ex-husband's \nincome after bankruptcy. Right now under current law, child support and \nalimony share a protected postbankruptcy position with only two other \nrecurrent collectors of debt--taxes and student loans. The credit card \nindustry wants to muscle in and get a large piece of a very small pie. \nThey want credit card debt and other consumer credit to share in this \nprotected postbankruptcy position. They want to shove women and \nchildren aside to try to collect on their own behalf.\n  The simple fact is this: When pitted against the high-powered credit \ncard\n\n[[Page S11625]]\n\nindustry, women and children do not have the resources to compete. If \nthe credit card industry is permitted to elevate its status to the \nprotected postbankruptcy status position already shared by taxes and \nstudent loans, women and children will lose every single time.\n  Later on, I will make reference to a press release recently put out \nby the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. They say in their press \nrelease: A child is more important than a credit card. Those who vote \nfor this conference report believe just the opposite: The credit card \nindustry has a greater claim to some sort of support from the Senate \nthat the children who are involved in a divorce proceeding.\n  My colleagues must ask themselves, if this bill truly puts women and \nchildren first, why is every major women's group and children's group \nopposing this legislation? We have advocates for women and children who \nare opposed to the bill. I will not go through the long list, but if \nyou believe the statements made yesterday by some of my colleagues on \nthe floor, you have to ask yourself, are all of these groups wrong? Are \nall of these advocates for women and children opposed to the bill for \nthe wrong reason? I don't think so. These are not partisan \norganizations; they are organizations that fight for women and children \nwhen they know that they are struggling to survive. They read this bill \nas I have, too, and came to the same conclusion. When all is said and \ndone, the credit card industry will do just fine. It is the women, the \nmothers, the kids who won't.\n\n  Mr. President, 116 nonpartisan law professors from all over the \ncountry have written expressing their concerns over the grave effects \nthe bill will have on women and children. In addition, to the concerns \nI have already raised, the law professors write:\n\n       Women and children as creditors will have to compete with \n     powerful creditors to collect their claims after bankruptcy. \n     This increased competition for women and children will come \n     from many quarters: from powerful credit card issuers, whose \n     credit card claims increasingly will be accepted from \n     discharge and remain legal obligations of the debtor after \n     bankruptcy; from large retailers, who will have an easier \n     time obtaining reaffirmations of debt that legally could be \n     discharged; and from creditors claiming they hold security, \n     even when the alleged collateral is virtually worthless. None \n     of the changes made to S. 625 and none being proposed in H.R. \n     2415 addresses these problems.\n       The truth remains: if H.R. 2415 is enacted in its current \n     form, women and children will face increased competition in \n     collecting their alimony and support claims after the \n     bankruptcy claim is over. We pointed out this difficulty \n     repeatedly, but no change has been made in the bill to \n     address it.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       In addition to the concerns raised on behalf of the \n     thousands of women who are struggling now to collect alimony \n     and child support after their ex-husband's bankruptcies, we \n     also express our concerns on behalf of the more than half a \n     million women heads of household who will file for bankruptcy \n     this year alone. As the heads of the economically most \n     vulnerable families, they have a special stake in the pending \n     legislation. Women heads of households are now the largest \n     demographic group in bankruptcy, and according to the credit \n     card industry's own data, they are the poorest. The \n     provisions in this bill, particularly the many provisions \n     that apply without regard to income, will fall hardest on \n     them. Under this bill, a single mother with dependent \n     children who is hopelessly insolvent and whose income is far \n     below the national median income would have her bankruptcy \n     case dismissed if she does not present copies of income tax \n     returns for the past three years--even if those returns are \n     in the possession of her ex-husband. A single mother who \n     hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment plan would be \n     forced to repay every penny of the entire debt owed on almost \n     worthless items of collateral, such as used furniture or \n     children's clothing, even if it meant that successful \n     completion of a repayment plan was impossible.\n\n  I can't get over the fact that we have just finished an election \nseason when so many candidates in both political parties spoke of their \nsympathies and their commitments to America's families. They talked \nabout the vulnerable in our society, about the need for compassion \nwhether you are liberal or conservative, and they spoke to groups about \ntheir love for children. Yet we turn around here, 4 weeks and a day \nafter that last election, and start debating a bill which clearly is \nnot designed to help women and children in the most vulnerable \ncircumstances. All of these groups, every single one of them that stand \nfor the interests of these women and children, have told us this is a \nbad bill.\n  If you look at this group, you will not see too many political action \ncommittees. I don't believe Churchwomen United have a PAC, or many of \nthe others. But certainly the credit card industry does. The financial \ninstitutions do. They have come to get involved in this election \ncampaign, as is their constitutional right. Their voice, unfortunately, \nis a lot louder on the floor of the Senate than the voices of those who \nrepresent the women and children across America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the full text of this letter \nby the 116 law professors be printed in the Congressional Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 1, 2000.\n     Re The Bankruptcy Reform Act Conference Report (H.R. 2415).\n\n       Dear Senators: We are professors of bankruptcy and \n     commercial law. We have been following the bankruptcy reform \n     process with keen interest. The 116 undersigned professors \n     come from every region of the country and from all major \n     political parties. We are not a partisan, organized group, \n     and we have no agenda. Our exclusive interest is to seek the \n     enactment of a fair and just bankruptcy law, with appropriate \n     regard given to the interests of debtors and creditors alike. \n     Many of us have written before to express our concerns about \n     the bankruptcy legislation, and we write again as yet another \n     version of the bill comes before you. This bill is deeply \n     flawed, and we hope the Senate will not act on it in the \n     closing minutes of this session.\n       In a letter to you dated September 7, 1999, 82 professors \n     of bankruptcy law from across the country expressed their \n     grave concerns about some of the provisions of S. 625, \n     particularly the effects of the bill on women and children. \n     We wrote again on November 2, 1999, to reiterate our \n     concerns. We write yet again to bring the same message: the \n     problems with the bankruptcy bill have not been resolved, \n     particularly those provisions that adversely affect women and \n     children.\n       Notwithstanding the unsupported claims of the bill's \n     proponents, H.R. 2415 does not help women and children. \n     Thirty-one organizations devoted exclusively to promoting the \n     best interests of women and children continue to oppose the \n     pending bankruptcy bill. The concerns expressed in our \n     earlier letters showing how S. 625 would hurt women and \n     children have not been resolved. Indeed, they have not even \n     been addressed.\n       First, one of the biggest problems the bill presents for \n     women and children was stated in the September 7, 1999, \n     letter:\n       ``Women and children as creditors will have to compete with \n     powerful creditors to collect their claims after \n     bankruptcy.''\n       This increased competition for women and children will come \n     from many quarters: from powerful credit card issuers, whose \n     credit card claims increasingly will be excepted from \n     discharge and remain legal obligations of the debtor after \n     bankruptcy; from large retailers, who will have an easier \n     time obtaining reaffirmations of debt that legally could be \n     discharged; and from creditors claiming they hold security, \n     even when the alleged collateral is virtually worthless. None \n     of the changes made to S. 625 and none being proposed in H.R. \n     2415 addresses these problems. The truth remains: if H.R. \n     2415 is enacted in its current form, women and children will \n     face increased competition in collecting their alimony and \n     support claims after the bankruptcy case is over. We have \n     pointed out this difficulty repeatedly, but no change has \n     been made in the bill to address it.\n       Second, it is a distraction to argue--as do advocates of \n     the bill--that the bill will ``help'' women and children and \n     that it will ``make child support and alimony payments the \n     top priority--no exceptions.'' As the law professors pointed \n     out in the Setpember 7, 1999, letter:\n       ``Giving `first priority' to domestic support obligations \n     does not address the problem.''\n       Granting ``first priority'' to alimony and support claims \n     is not the magic solution the consumer credit industry claims \n     because ``priority'' is relevant only for distributions made \n     to creditors in the bankruptcy case itself. Such \n     distributions are made in only a negligible percentage of \n     cases. More than 95% of bankruptcy cases make NO \n     distributions to any creditors because there are no assets to \n     distribute. Granting women and children a first priority for \n     bankruptcy distributions permits them to stand first in line \n     to collect nothing.\n       Women's hard-fought battle is over reaching the ex-\n     husband's income after bankruptcy. Under current law, child \n     support and alimony share a protected post-bankruptcy \n     position with only two other recurrent collectors of debt--\n     taxes and student loans. The credit industry asks that credit \n     card debt and other consumer credit share that position, \n     thereby elbowing aside the women trying to collect on their \n     own behalf. The credit industry carefully avoids discussing \n     the increased post-bankruptcy competition facing women if \n     H.R. 2415 becomes law. As a matter of public policy, this \n     country should not elevate credit card debt to the preferred \n     position of taxes and child support. Once again,\n\n[[Page S11626]]\n\n     we have pointed out this problem repeatedly, and nothing has \n     been changed in the pending legislation to address it.\n       In addition to the concerns raised on behalf of the \n     thousands of women who are struggling now to collect alimony \n     and child support after their ex-husband's bankruptcies, we \n     also express our concerns on behalf of the more than half a \n     million women heads of household who will file for bankruptcy \n     this year alone. As the heads of the economically most \n     vulnerable families, they have a special stake in the pending \n     legislation. Women heads of households are now the largest \n     demographic group in bankruptcy, and according to the credit \n     industry's own data, they are the poorest. The provisions in \n     this bill, particularly the many provisions that apply \n     without regard to income, will fall hardest on them. Under \n     this bill, a single mother with dependent children who is \n     hopelessly insolvent and whose income is far below the \n     national median income would have her bankruptcy case \n     dismissed if she does not present copies of income tax \n     returns for the past three years--even if those returns are \n     in the possession of her ex-husband. A single mother who \n     hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment plan would be \n     forced to pay every penny of the entire debt owed on almost \n     worthless items of collateral, such as used furniture or \n     children's clothes, even if it meant that successful \n     completion of a repayment plan was impossible.\n       Finally, when the Senate passed S. 625, we were hopeful \n     that the final bankruptcy legislation would include a \n     meaningful homestead provision to address flagrant abuse in \n     the bankruptcy system. Instead, the conference report \n     retreats from the concept underlying the Senate-passed \n     homestead amendment.\n       The homestead provision in the conference report will allow \n     wealthy debtors to hide assets from their creditors.\n       Current bankruptcy law yields to state law to determine \n     what property shall remain exempt from creditor attachment \n     and levy. Homestead exemptions are highly variable by state, \n     and six states (Florida, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, Texas, \n     Oklahoma) have literally unlimited exemptions while twenty-\n     two states have exemptions of $10,000 or less. The variation \n     among states leads to two problems--basic inequality and \n     strategic bankruptcy planning. The only solution is a dollar \n     cap on the homestead exemption. Although variation among \n     states would remain, the most outrageous abuses--those in the \n     multi-million dollar category--would be eliminated.\n       The homestead provision in the conference report does \n     little to address the problem. The legislation only requires \n     a debtor to wait two years after the purchase of the \n     homestead before filing a bankruptcy case. Well-counseled \n     debtors will have no problem timing their bankruptcies or \n     tying-up the courts in litigation to skirt the intent of this \n     provision. The proposed change will remind debtors to buy \n     their property early, but it will not deny anyone with \n     substantial assets a chance to protect property from their \n     creditors. Furthermore, debtors who are long-time residents \n     of states like Texas and Florida will continue to enjoy a \n     homestead exemption that can shield literally millions of \n     dollars in value.\n       These facts are unassailable: H.R. 2415 forces women to \n     compete with sophisticated creditors to collect alimony and \n     child support after bankruptcy. H.R. 2415 makes it harder for \n     women to declare bankruptcy when they are in financial \n     trouble. H.R. 2415 fails to close the glaring homestead \n     loophole and permits wealthy debtors to hide assets from \n     their creditors. We implore you to look beyond the distorted \n     ``facts'' peddled by the credit industry. Please do not pass \n     a bill that will hurt vulnerable Americans including women \n     and children.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n       Signed by 116 Law Professors.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, some of my colleagues have also asked why \ndid I vote for this bill in the first place. When I voted for it, I did \nso in the hopes that the bill would be strengthened in conference. \nInstead, exactly the opposite occurred. The bankruptcy code is a \ndelicate balance. When you push one thing, almost invariably something \nelse will give. In this bill, the credit card industry pushed, and what \ngave were the debtors. Is that fair? Is that balanced? In a word: No.\n  The constant theme that has guided me throughout the consideration of \nbankruptcy legislation is balanced reform. I do not believe you can \nhave meaningful bankruptcy reform without addressing both sides of the \nproblem, irresponsible debtors and irresponsible creditors.\n  The bill that passed the Senate in the 105th Congress was a balanced \nand bipartisan approach. Senator Grassley and I, along with several \nother Senators, worked hard to develop it, and 97 Senators supported \nour efforts and agreed that it was a good, balanced way to deal with \nthe problem.\n  That bill was killed in conference 2 years ago. Unfortunately, our \nefforts of many, many months did not result in the bankruptcy reform \nlegislation that we needed.\n  I had hoped this year would be different. This year when I voted for \nit, I did so with the hope that some key provisions of the legislation \nwould be strengthened. It didn't happen in conference. Rather, the bill \nwe have before us today falls far short of the Senate effort. Perhaps \nif the Democrats hadn't been shut out of conference, we would have a \nmore balanced conference bill. Sadly, like so many instances in this \nCongress, Democrats were kept from the table. Rather than negotiate \nwith Democrats directly and bring forth a bill the President could \nsupport, that both creditors and debtors could support, our Republican \ncolleagues are trying to force us to take a bad bill. I say don't take \nit, leave it. This bill is not balanced.\n  I said in the beginning of my statement and I will say it again, I \nsupport reform. I for one am willing to reach across the aisle and work \nin a bipartisan fashion in the next Congress to develop a bill. I know \nsome of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are anxious to do the \nsame. In this Congress, we have, rarely but at some times, worked in a \nbipartisan manner and obtained meaningful results for the American \npeople: the reauthorization of the Older American Act, the H-1B visa \nlegislation, and the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act.\n  Despite these accomplishments, Congress has missed opportunities to \npass a lot of other meaningful legislation such as a Patients' Bill of \nRights, expanding the current hate crimes law, and passing commonsense \ngun safety legislation. Let's not add bankruptcy to the list. Let's \npledge to work together in the new, 50-50 split in the Senate, in the \n107th Congress to come up with a balanced bill.\n  Although our Republican colleagues may be able to disguise the \nbankruptcy bill by putting it in a State Department authorization bill, \nthey cannot hide the simple truth--this bill is not a balanced \napproach. Many of the Members of this Chamber know I am a strong \nproponent of credit card disclosure. I am not in favor of rationing \ncredit. I believe Americans should be allowed to make that choice. But \nit should be an informed choice. You should know what you are getting \ninto when you sign up for that credit card. The number of people who \nend up overextending on credit cards and finding they cannot meet their \nobligations include quite a few who never understood the terms and \nconditions of their credit card arrangement.\n\n  I am a lawyer. I have been around legislatures and Congress for a \nlong time. When I turn over my monthly statement for my credit card and \nlook at that fine print, I struggle to figure out what they are trying \nto say to me. There are some basic things people ought to know when \nthey sign up for a credit card. What is the interest rate? How much am \nI going to pay and for how long? Is the interest rate going to change? \nIf I receive a monthly statement and this is the minimum monthly \npayment, how many months do I have to pay off that minimum payment \nbefore it is finally gone? During that period of time, how much will I \npay in principal, how much will I pay in interest?\n  These are not outrageous ideas. It is kind of the basic information \nyou would expect to know so consumers can know whether or not they have \noverestimated, whether they are going too far in debt. You would think \nmost people in the credit card industry would not fight that. The fact \nis, they did. They don't want to make that disclosure to the American \npeople. They are afraid if the American consumers have the facts, the \nAmerican consumers will make some different choices. They might not \nsign up for that extra credit card. They might think twice before just \nsending in a couple of bucks a month if it means they are going to be \npaying for years and pay more in interest than they are on the \nprincipal.\n  During the course of my involvement in the industry, I have tried to \nstress to the credit industry that they have some responsibility in \nthis debate as well. There is ample evidence to suggest they are \nhawking credit to children, to college students, and people already \ndeeply in financial trouble.\n  In 1999 alone, there were 3.5 billion credit card solicitations \nmailed to American households. If you follow\n\n[[Page S11627]]\n\nthis debate, you know exactly what I am talking about. You go home \nevery night, open the mailbox, take a look at what is there, and throw \naway all the new credit card applications because each of us, \nparticularly in the households that are considered creditworthy, \nreceived an armload of these invitations to sign up for a new credit \ncard on a regular basis.\n  Credit cards have been addressed to 4-year-old preschool children \nand, yes, every once in a while the family dog gets an application, \ntoo. These 3.5 billion credit card solicitations don't take into \naccount phone calls at dinnertime, the ads stuck in the middle of \nmagazines, or the booths set up on every college campus offering free \ntee-shirts if you just sign up for a credit card. In fact, on many \ncollege campuses, each time a student buys something at a bookstore \nthey often get a credit card solicitation at the bottom of their bag. \nThe bags are premade with credit card applications and ads at the \nbottom of the bag. These ads are directly aimed at college students, \nads such as those for Visa, which say: ``Accepted at more colleges than \nyou were.''\n  Never mind that these students, many of them young men and women away \nfrom home for the first time, don't have the skills to navigate what \ncould be some choppy waters. Some of these students end up ruining \ntheir credit before they even get their first real job. Are we supposed \nto believe the credit card industry is not responsible? Regrettably, \nthe already minimalist approach to credit card disclosure in the Senate \nbill was weakened further in the conference.\n  I continue to believe, as I did in 1998 when we passed strong \ndisclosure provisions, that consumers benefit from knowing, for \nexample, that paying the 2 percent monthly minimum on a $1,295 balance \nwould take 93 months, or more than 7 years to pay off the balance. An \nestimate of the total cost to pay off this $1,295 balance if only the \nminimum payments are made is $2,418--almost twice the original balance. \nIf all this information were available, I don't think many consumers \nwould consider the monthly minimum payment a very good idea.\n  Oh, certainly there could be a month when that is all you can pay. \nBut you have to know down the line, if you go along with the credit \ncard industry and just make the minimum monthly payment, at the end of \nthis you are going to pay a lot more in interest. Maybe that is your \nchoice. But shouldn't you know, going in? Shouldn't that information be \ngiven to you?\n  College students might think twice before using their credit cards to \ncharge another pizza. The bankruptcy bill in the 105th Congress \nincluded debtor-specific information that enabled cardholders to \nexamine their current credit card in tangible terms, driving home the \nseriousness of their financial commitments.\n  Sounds simple, doesn't it? Today's technology is such that it \nprobably would not take much to make this happen. So why isn't this \nreasonable provision part of the bankruptcy bill? The credit card \nindustry said: No, we don't want to make any additional disclosures, we \ndon't want to give consumers more information, we don't want to give \nthem a reason to say no. We want to create reasons for them to say yes.\n  Frankly, if you take a person who is in a precarious credit situation \nand they sign up for a new credit card and end up in bankruptcy court, \ndoesn't the credit card industry bear some responsibility? It was the \nconsumer's choice to take the credit card, but how diligent was the \ncredit card industry in finding out whether a person really knew the \nterms and conditions of the agreement and whether or not they were \ncreditworthy?\n  Unfortunately, this industry, not the majority of the American \npeople, have the money and resources to make their wishes known, and \nthus the bill we have on the floor. The credit card industry decided it \nwas in their best interest not to let the American people know exactly \nwhat paying only the minimum balance on their 19-percent credit card \nwould actually cost them.\n  This year, the debtor-specific information was reduced to providing \ncardholders with generic examples, and I accepted this reduced \noperation with some reservations. It is my understanding that it was \neven further weakened in the conference committee.\n  It amazes me. The credit card industry, with all of their computers \nand all of their information, when you say to them: When you put down \nthe minimum monthly payment on a card, can you put right next to it how \nmany months it will take to pay it off? They say: That is just totally \nbeyond us; we don't know that our computers could ever figure that out.\n\n  I do not get it. I do not understand how they can say that with a \nstraight face. They know that information is readily accessible. They \nknow also it may discourage people from putting too much debt on their \ncredit cards. That will cost them business, it will cost them interest \npayments, and they will not let it be included in this bill.\n  The Republican leadership agreement permits banks with less than $250 \nmillion in assets--incidentally, that is over 80 percent of all banks--\nto have the Federal Reserve provide its customers with a toll-free \nnumber to review their credit card balances for the next 2 years. It is \nunclear whether the banks would be required to provide the service \nthemselves after 2 years. The exemption would cover 4,000 banks holding \nabout $3 billion in consumer credit card debt.\n  The American people are not going to be calling this toll-free number \nto find out what their credit card balances are. You know it, I know \nit, the credit card industry certainly knows it, too. That is why they \nagreed to it. They agreed to a provision that does little to help \ndebtors take responsibility for their financial situation.\n  This is a departure from a balanced approach. This is a sham. This is \nabout as worthless as the warnings on cigarette packages. They do not \nwant to give consumers specific information about their credit card \nbalances. The credit card industry won that battle in the conference \nreport.\n  In addition, the current bankruptcy bill provides for a homestead \nexemption that is weaker than the version included in the Senate-passed \nbill. The Senate, in a 76-22 bipartisan vote, agreed to an amendment by \nSenator Kohl of Wisconsin to create a $100,000 nationwide cap on any \nhomestead exception.\n  You go before a bankruptcy court and say: Here are my assets. In many \ncases, it is the home. Many States decided what the value of that home \nto be exempted by creditors can be. Every State has a different \nstandard. Some States have no standard. We have had outrageous \nsituations in the past where well-known actors and public figures, \nknowing they were going to file for bankruptcy, bought an expensive \nestate or ranch and put every asset they had in it, walked into the \nbankruptcy court and said: I have nothing but my home. The home happens \nto be palatial, and the home is exempt.\n  If we are talking about holding people accountable for their conduct, \nwhy would we let this kind of thing happen? If the average mother, \nfresh from a divorce and trying to raise kids, has to scrape together \nthe pennies and dollars she has in savings and declare them as assets \nand put them on the table to be taken by creditors, why shouldn't the \nwealthiest among us be held to the same standards and not able to \nexempt estates and ranches and mansions? It seems to make sense, \ndoesn't it? It certainly does not for those who are arguing for passage \nof this bill.\n  This amendment we proposed would have closed a major loophole in the \nbankruptcy law: a homestead exemption where a person gets to hide from \na bankruptcy court the value of their home. It is different in every \nState. In Illinois, it is $7,500. You cannot buy much of a home in my \nState for that amount. In other States, it is a lot more. Florida and \nTexas have no caps whatsoever. In a State such as Texas, wealthy \ndebtors are able to file for bankruptcy and keep their mansions. Is it \nfair? Absolutely not. If we are looking for real reform in bankruptcy, \nwhy haven't we addressed this? Keeping a home worth several hundreds of \nthousands of dollars, if not millions, out of bankruptcy is a ruse; it \nis a fraud.\n\n  I voted in support of Senator Kohl's amendment to close this \nloophole. He placed a hard cap on unlimited State homestead exemptions.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report guts this reform to permit \ndebtors to avoid any Federal homestead cap. Thus, in States such as \nFlorida and Texas, a homeowner who has equity in\n\n[[Page S11628]]\n\nher home that existed prior to the 2-year cut-off can keep all the \nequity, even if the home is valued in the millions of dollars. This \nprovision only benefits the wealthiest people in America, and this \nloophole is unacceptable.\n  When we consider that the average income of people who file for \nbankruptcy in America is under $30,000 a year, why in the world would \nwe pass a bill which allows folks who are millionaires to literally \nprotect their assets and not provide protection for the women and \nchildren who are most vulnerable going into bankruptcy court because of \na lost job, a divorce, or medical bills?\n  That just tells us what this bill is about. It tells us why so many \npeople are so anxious to see it pass. They want to protect the \nwealthiest in our society, and they do not care much about those who \nare on the other end.\n  Also, the bill we have before us today fails to include an amendment \nby my colleague, Senator Schumer, known as the clinic violence \namendment. This Chamber is well aware that the Schumer amendment \nprevented documented abuse of the bankruptcy system by those who \nviolated the FACE Act or an equivalent State law. The Senate \noverwhelmingly passed the Schumer amendment 80-17. There is no reason \nnot to include it in this bill.\n  By failing to include the Schumer amendment, the bill allows many \nperpetrators of health clinic violence to seek shelter in the Nation's \nbankruptcy courts.\n  By failing to include the Schumer clinic violence amendment, this \nbill says if someone injures or even kills someone outside an abortion \nclinic or other health care clinic, they can hide under the bankruptcy \ncode and have their debts discharged under chapter 13 bankruptcy. \nStudent loans are not even dischargeable under chapter 13.\n  Why would we allow perpetrators of this violence to usurp our clinic \nprotection laws by feigning bankruptcy? The amendment says, no, we will \nnot.\n  This Senate voted in favor of it. No matter what your position on the \nissue of abortion, I am sure my colleagues will again agree, as they \ndid on a vote of 80-17, that perpetrators of clinic violence should not \nbe permitted to circumvent our clinic protection laws. Failing to \ninclude the Schumer amendment that has strong bipartisan support does \nnot make sense. It is not balanced.\n  So there is no mistake and the record is clear, I support and I am \ncommitted to bankruptcy reform. I have heard from many groups and my \nconstituencies in Illinois urging opposition to this bill.\n  Labor organizations, representing a lot of working men and women \nacross this country, middle-income workers from virtually every type of \ntrade and background, have come out in opposition to the bill. NARAL, \nthe National Partnership for Women and Children, the leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, the Religious Action Center, the Consumers \nUnion, the Bankruptcy Center in Illinois, and the 116 nonpartisan law \nprofessors I mentioned earlier have all urged Members of the Senate to \nvote against it. They are right. We should leave it and work together \nin the 107th Congress for a much more balanced approach.\n\n  Yesterday, I received a letter from the American Academy of \nMatrimonial Lawyers urging Congress to oppose the bill. Its press \nrelease out of Chicago as of yesterday says:\n\n       The Nation's top divorce and matrimonial attorneys called \n     today for Congress not to approve a little-debated, but \n     heavily lobbied bankruptcy provision currently pending final \n     approval in the lame duck session of Congress, that would \n     take monies away from child support payments for credit card \n     debts when individuals declare bankruptcy.\n       ``Children should come before credit card companies,'' said \n     Charles C. Shainberg of Philadelphia, the Academy's new \n     president.\n       The provision, part of H.R. 2415, and which has quietly \n     passed both the House and Senate, affects Federal bankruptcy \n     filings. Under Chapter 13 filings, a common form of \n     individual bankruptcy, the individual works out a court-\n     approved payment program to pay down debt. However, currently \n     child support and alimony have priority status, meaning that \n     all child support and alimony need to be paid before credit \n     card companies can collect their debts.\n       Under this new bill--\n\n  Which we are currently debating--\n\n     the deferral or relief from credit card payments, technically \n     known as their dischargeability, would be limited, so that \n     children and credit card payments would have the same \n     priority and payments would be split between [a child and a \n     MasterCard.]\n       There currently are some 1.4 million bankruptcy filings in \n     the United States each year, and more are expected if an \n     anticipated cooling of the economy occurs.\n       The bill is backed primarily by Republicans and some \n     Democrats [as the vote showed yesterday]. President Clinton \n     has said he will veto the bill, but it is unclear from the \n     election results what will happen under a new administration.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       ``The way for the credit card companies to improve their \n     receivables is to limit the millions of cards they offer to \n     poor credit risks, not take money from women and children,'' \n     said Linda Lea Viken of Rapid City, S.D., who chairs the \n     Academy's Federalization of Family Law Committee.\n       Another problem presented by the bill, Academy attorneys \n     say, is that past due child support payments and alimony are \n     not dischargeable, so the person who has to make credit card \n     payments in addition to alimony and child support will keep \n     falling farther and farther behind in his or her total \n     payments, eventually resulting in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \n     filing, or total insolvency.\n       The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers is comprised of \n     the nation's top 1,500 matrimonial attorneys who are \n     recognized experts in the specialized field of matrimonial \n     law, including divorce, prenuptial agreements, legal \n     separation, annulment, custody, property valuation and \n     division, support and the rights of unmarried cohabitors.\n       The purpose of the Academy is to encourage the study, \n     improve the practice, elevate the standards and advance the \n     cause of matrimonial law.\n\n  Yesterday, this letter arrived and made it clear to me that this bill \nhas problems that will be felt not by credit card companies but by a \nlot of people in very tragic circumstances for a long time to come.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to mention something curious that \nhas happened.\n  The Administrative Office of the United States Courts recently \nreleased its statistics regarding bankruptcy filings for the fiscal \nyear 2000 that ended September 30 of this year. They report that \nbankruptcy filings continue to decline. Personal bankruptcy filings \nwere down 6.8 percent from the 1,354,376 bankruptcy filings for fiscal \nyear 1999. For businesses, filings were down 6.6 percent.\n  This is great news for the American people--creditors and debtors \nalike. As the University of Maryland's Department of Economics notes in \ntheir recent study:\n\n       Not only have personal bankruptcies stopped their explosive \n     growth, but the trend has reversed, and the U.S. per capita \n     bankruptcy rate is actually lower than it was at the time \n     that the bankruptcy bill was introduced.\n\n  I said it before, and I will say it again: I support balanced \nbankruptcy reform. But the momentum and impetus behind this reform was \nthe complaints of the credit industry that so many people were filing \nfor bankruptcy. It was a curiosity, when they came with this complaint, \nwe were in the midst of the largest economic expansion in the history \nof this country. You would wonder, if we are doing better as a nation, \nwhy are more people filing for bankruptcy?\n  I am not sure it is the right answer, but it is the one that may be \nright. People tend to believe, in good times, there will never be bad \ntimes. They overextend themselves. They see their neighbors doing well \nand buying things, and they may want to join them, when they should \nthink twice, and then they find themselves in bankruptcy court.\n\n  When the national mood starts to change, people worry a little about \nthe economy. They take care in terms of their credit responsibilities \nand their credit obligations. That may account for this decline in the \nfiling of bankruptcies. It certainly should give pause to those who \nthink this is an emergency measure which should be considered by a lame \nduck Congress.\n  I believe any serious reform must be balanced and take into \nconsideration the people behind all the statistics.\n  Unfortunately, the bankruptcy bill before us today--the one \nmasquerading as a so-called State Department authorization conference \nreport--falls short of the Senate effort. The bankruptcy bill before us \ntoday, like its predecessor in the 105th Congress, has been decimated \nin a partisan conference. This bill should meet the same fate as that \nearlier bill.\n  I will oppose this report and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n[[Page S11629]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, for 4 years, my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, has shown extraordinary leadership in addressing the failings \nof the current bankruptcy system. He has enormous patience and has \nexhibited extraordinary leadership. I have been very proud to be his \npartner in this effort which now comes to a critical phase. This has \nnot always been a popular fight. But it is certain to be a very \nimportant one.\n  I think everyone agrees that our bankruptcy system is in need of \nrepair. It is only over the question of how to fix the bankruptcy \nsystem that there is any issue at all.\n  In the last Congress, efforts to pass bankruptcy reform legislation \ncame extremely close. It failed simply in the waning days of the \nsession. Having come so close in the 105th Congress, I inherited the \nrole of the ranking member on the subcommittee with jurisdiction over \nthe legislation. I felt some considerable optimism that this time we \nwould be successful.\n  The bill passed the floor by very wide margins. The issues had \nnarrowed. There was an overwhelming sense that there was a need to \nreform bankruptcy. I think that my optimism was well placed.\n  Since that time, I have spent countless hours working with Senator \nGrassley and many other Members of the Senate on both sides of the \naisle dealing with very difficult issues in crafting this bill. I am \nvery grateful to Senator Grassley. I am very grateful to the Members on \nboth sides of the aisle for having brought us to this point with this \nbipartisan bill that commands the support of over two-thirds of the \nMembers of the Senate on both sides of the aisle.\n  I do not contend that it is a perfect bill. No bill that commands \nsuch broad support and that is this controversial could be perfect. \nIndeed, if I were drafting the bill on my own, or if any Member of the \nSenate were drafting this bill on their own, it would be different in \nsome ways and in some fundamental respects.\n  But is it a fair and balanced bill? Yes. Does it deserve the support \nof the Senate? Absolutely. Will it improve the functioning of the \nbankruptcy system without injuring vulnerable Americans who need \nbankruptcy protection? Yes, it will. If it didn't, it wouldn't have my \nname on it.\n  For these reasons, I believe the bill deserves--as indeed clearly it \nwill have--broad bipartisan support.\n  There is obviously speculation that although the bill will pass the \nSenate by a wide margin--it passed the House of Representatives by very \nwide margins--it might be vetoed when it reaches the White House.\n  I want to take a moment to outline for you, Mr. President, the \nreasons I believe a veto on this legislation would be a very serious \nmistake.\n  First, as I mentioned before, the bill is a product of extensive \nbipartisan negotiations--negotiations in which the White House has been \na vocal and integral part. Many of the improvements that we have seen \nin the bill have been concessions to the White House demand that it be \nmore consumer friendly. The President appropriately asked that consumer \nprotection from credit card abuse--particularly for the young, the \nuninformed, and for the elderly--be in this bill. It is in this bill, \nand the President can take great pride in it.\n  We should not forget that there is also a very real possibility that \nthe next administration may not have as strong a commitment to consumer \nissues as this administration, thus rendering the bankruptcy bill to \nemerge in the next Congress potentially significantly worse.\n  This is critical for the Clinton administration to understand. No one \nknows how this Presidential election is going to be resolved, and we \nmay not know before this Congress leaves. There is a real chance that \nthe next President of the United States is not going to share Bill \nClinton's commitment to consumer protection or other objectives in the \nbill, meaning that from the administration's perspective this bill may \nbe the best that we can get. And to veto it is to lose a real chance \nfor meaningful consumer protection in bankruptcy law.\n  On substance, this bill provides a very important fix in our flawed \nbankruptcy system. Indeed, it may be tougher than current law. As I \nthink the administration will concede, it also includes fair changes.\n  At a time when people in the United States are enjoying the most \nprosperous economic period in our history, there has been a rapid rise \nin consumer bankruptcy. In 1998 alone, 1.4 million Americans sought \nbankruptcy protection. That is a 20-percent increase from 1996 and a \nstaggering 350 percent increase since 1980.\n  While filings dipped by 100,000 in 1999 to just 1.3 million, they are \nstill far too high. It is estimated that 70 percent of those filings \nwere done under chapter 7, which provides relief from most unsecured \ndebt. Conversely, just 30 percent of petitions filed under chapter 13 \nrequire a repayment plan.\n  A study released last year by the Department of Justice indicated as \nmany as 13 percent of debtor filings under chapter 7. A staggering \n182,000 people each year could afford to repay a significant amount of \ntheir debts. They could, but they won't because they are indeed using \nthose chapters of the bankruptcy code to allow them to escape debt that \nthey are capable of paying.\n  If, indeed, this were not the case, and if the bankruptcy reform that \nwe are offering the Senate were in place, an extraordinary $44 billion \nwould be returned to creditors--banks, to be sure; credit card \ncompanies, obviously; but also small businesses, small contractors, \nfamily companies, mom-and-pop stores, companies that cannot afford to \nhave the bankruptcy system of our country misused. The larger banks and \nthe credit card companies will always cover this abuse. They have the \nfinancial resources. They can absorb the loss. It is not for them that \nI stand here today supporting this bill. It is for the thousands of \nsmall businesses that cannot afford to absorb $4 billion of \ninappropriate bankruptcy. This bill before the Senate ensures that \nthose debtors with the ability to repay these debts will do exactly \nthat.\n\n  Despite what we hear from opponents of the bill, the core of the bill \nnow before the Senate is a bipartisan agreement reached in May after \nmonths of informal negotiations. It is very similar to a bill that \npassed this body by a vote of 83-14, but in my judgment is a better \nbill than that legislation that commanded 83 votes in this Senate. \nCritics of bankruptcy reform have charged that the bill denies poor \npeople the protection of the bankruptcy system. This is simply untrue. \nNo American is denied access to bankruptcy under this bill--nobody.\n  What this legislation does is assure that those with the ability to \nrepay a portion of their debts do so by establishing clear and \nreasonable criteria to determine repayment obligations. But it also \nprovides judicial discretion to ensure that no one genuinely in need of \ndebt cancellation will be prevented from receiving a fresh start. \nBankruptcy protection allowing all Americans a clean slate, a second \nchance at their economic lives, should not lose that chance and, under \nthis bill, will not lose that chance. Judicial discretion remains where \na good case can be made.\n  To ensure that this will remain the case, the bill before the Senate \ncontains a means test virtually identical to that passed in the Senate \nbill. Under current law, virtually anyone who files for complete debt \nrelief under chapter 7 receives it. This bill simply changes that \ncriterion to a needs-based system which establishes a presumption that \nchapter 7 filings should be either dismissed or converted to chapter 13 \nwhen the debtor has sufficient income to repay at least $10,000 or 25 \npercent of their outstanding debt.\n  Isn't that fair? If some small business has provided a product or a \nservice, you are the recipient of it, and you have demonstrated ability \nto pay $10,000 of your obligation or demonstrated the ability to pay \nthat percentage of your obligation, shouldn't you have to pay it? That \nis the test that is being applied. I think it is fair.\n  Even so, the presumption may be rebutted if the debtor demonstrates \nspecial circumstances requiring expenses\n\n[[Page S11630]]\n\nabove and beyond those the court has considered in applying the means \ntest. We give an escape clause: Yes, you have the ability to pay this, \nbut you have special circumstances. We will still exempt you. This is a \nflexible, yet efficient screen to move debtors with the ability to \nrepay a portion of their debt into a repayment plan, while at the same \ntime ensuring judicial discretion for a review of the debtor's \ncircumstances.\n  In addition to this flexible means test, the bill before the Senate \nalso includes two key protections for low-income debtors that were part \nof the Senate-passed bill. The first is an amendment offered by Senator \nSchumer to protect low-income debtors from coercive motions. This will \nensure that creditors cannot strong-arm debtors into promising to make \npayments they simply cannot afford to make. Poor debtors will not be \nforced to reaffirm these debts if they cannot afford to make them. That \nwas asked to be put in the bill to protect low-income people, and it is \nin the bill.\n  The second is an amendment offered by Senator Durbin, a mini screen, \nto reduce the burden of the means test on debtors between 100 and 150 \npercent of the median income. This is a preliminary, less intrusive \nlook at the debts and expenses of the middle-income debtors, to weed \nout those with no ability to repay those debts and move them more \nquickly to a fresh start.\n\n  So it is a special category and a mini screen, if you are in that 100 \nto 150 percent of the poverty level, to ensure that you are given this \nextra degree of protection.\n  In addition to a flexible means test, in addition to the Schumer safe \nharbor and the Durbin mini screen, the bill contains other provisions \nnot a part of the original Senate bill to protect low-income debtors:\n  One, a safe harbor to ensure that all debtors earning less than the \nState median income will have access to chapter 7 without \nqualification. Less than median income, no question, no qualifications, \nyou are in chapter 7. We are not interested in denying protections to \nparticularly low-income people.\n  Two, a floor to the means test to guarantee the debtors unable to \nrepay less than $6,000 of their outstanding debt will not be moved into \nchapter 13. If that is the limit of your resources, that is all you can \npay back, we are not interested in you; you get full protection.\n  Three, additional flexibility in the means test to take into account \na debtor's administration expenses and allow additional moneys for food \nand clothing expenses. So even if you have the money, even if on the \nbill's face you can pay back that portion of your debt, if indeed that \nmoney is needed for basic human items--food, clothing--we are removing \nyou from provisions of the bill. You will not be paying back those \nbills. You will be subject to full, complete protection.\n  This should convince my colleagues that it will not make it more \ndifficult for those in dire need to sweep away their debts and obtain a \nfresh start. It will not be more difficult; it will be easier. The bill \nhas been drafted very carefully to protect people in exactly these \ncircumstances. Absolutely no one--no one--will be denied, therefore, \naccess to bankruptcy and the discharge of their obligations. But every \none of these additional five provisions makes that even less likely for \npeople with low income.\n  All the bill does, therefore, is establish a process to move debtors \nwho can afford to repay a substantial portion of their debt from \nchapter 7, where they can now sweep away all those debts, into chapter \n13, where they have a repayment plan. That is the bill. Demonstrated \nability to pay; a repayment plan for your debts.\n  Critics, however, have also argued that the bill places an unfair \nburden on women and single-parent families. This is the most important \nemphasis that must be made about this bill. That is not true. I \nwouldn't vote for this bill, I wouldn't cosponsor this bill, I wouldn't \nhave worked for this bill for 2 years, I wouldn't stand here today if \nthere was anything to the argument that women, single-parent families, \nchildren, have any vulnerability because of this legislation. Nothing \nwould be more important to me than protecting these vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  Indeed, the bill contains the following: An amendment that I offered \nwith Senator Hatch to facilitate the collection of child support by \nrequiring the bankruptcy trustee to give the person to whom support is \nowed information on the debtor's whereabouts. Fine for bankruptcy; \nthere is a chance this can impact, obviously, a single mother or a \nchild. We are now affording the ability to locate the person who has \nthe obligation in order to help the single mother or the child.\n  Most important, the bill protects single-parent families by elevating \nchild support from its current seventh position in line seeking the \nresources of the person in bankruptcy to first. The single mother, the \nchild, who right now is behind financial institutions, behind the \nGovernment, will now be behind no one; they are the first claim on \nassets.\n  Finally, the bill requires that a chapter 13 plan provide for full \npayment of all child support payments that became due after the \npetition was filed. Meeting family obligations must be in the repayment \nplan, which is not required under current law. These provisions put \nboth families and the States in a better position than under current \nlaw.\n  But it doesn't stop there. The bill also includes a number of other \nprovisions designed to ensure protections for other vulnerable people \nin American society. It protects the rights of nursing home patients \nwhen a nursing home goes bankrupt. The bill requires that an omsbudsman \nbe appointed to act as an advocate for the patient and provide clear \nand specific rules for disposing of patient records, a protection not \nnow available for people in nursing homes.\n  The bill includes a permanent extension of chapter 12 programs to \nprovide expedited bankruptcy relief for farmers, a provision not now in \nthe bankruptcy law.\n  Finally, and most importantly, I have always said it is critical the \nbill not only address debtor abuse of the bankruptcy system, but also \noverreaching by the credit card industry. From the beginning, we \ninsisted that consumer protection from abuse in credit card \nsolicitation and sales must be in any balanced bill. The credit card \nindustry now has more than 3.5 billion solicitations a year. That is \nmore than 41 mailings for every American household, 14 for every man, \nwoman, and child in the Nation.\n  We recognize it is out of control and in some cases irresponsible. \nThe bill addresses the problem. Vetoing the bill accomplishes nothing. \nVoting against the bill means voting against consumer protections that \notherwise will never be in the law. This is the chance to do something \nabout credit card abuse. Opposing the bill and vetoing the bill means \nwe do nothing about credit card abuse.\n  The problem is substantial because it is not the sheer volume of \nsolicitations, it is also who is targeted. High school and college \nstudent solicitations are at record levels. Since the decade began, \nAmericans with incomes below the poverty line have doubled their uses \nof credit. The result is not surprising. Mr. President, 27 percent of \nfamilies earning less than $10,000 a year have consumer debt that is \nmore than 40 percent of their income.\n  I in no way advocate that less credit should be made available to \nlow-income and moderate-income consumers, but rather that consumers be \ngiven more complete information so they can better understand and \nmanage their debts. That is what this bill does. The bill contains \nprovisions, which I authored with the help of Senators Schumer, Reed, \nand Durbin, to ensure consumers have the information necessary to help \nthem better understand and manage their debts. The bill now requires \nlenders to prominently disclose: First, the effects of making only the \nminimum payment on your account each month. That is not in the current \nlaw. It will be in the law if this bill becomes law. Next, that \ninterest on loans secured by dwellings is tax deductible only to the \nvalue of the property. That is not in current law. It will be if this \nbill is signed. Also, when late fees will be imposed, and the date on \nwhich introductory or teaser rates will expire and what the permanent \nrate will be after that time.\n  In addition, the bill prohibits the cancelling of an account because \nthe consumer pays the balance in full each month and thus avoids \nincurring a finance charge.\n\n[[Page S11631]]\n\n  Indeed, there is one other issue we will also hear discussed on the \nfloor--the question of debtors who seek to discharge the judgments they \nowe because of their violence against abortion clinics. This is the \nfinal issue. And for many Members of the Senate it may be the central \nissue in deciding whether or not to vote for this bill. It may be \ndeterminative of whether or not the President signs this bill.\n  Let me personally, therefore, begin a discussion of it by making \nclear that I support Senator Schumer in his efforts to have his \namendment included in the bill. I voted for it. Given the opportunity, \nI will vote for it again. I believe it is a provision that is both \nnecessary and appropriate.\n  But I also recognize the reality of the situation. The Republican \nleadership is not going to include Senator Schumer's amendment in this \nbill. It is not going to happen. That leaves the Senate with a very \nreal choice. The family businesses, the financial institutions, the \nfamily contracting companies that face bankruptcy every day because \nthey cannot collect debts owed to them will be jeopardized. The \nconsumer protection that was put in this bill for people who have \nproblems with the credit card industry, who cannot manage their debts, \nwho need more information, will be lost without this bill. Bankruptcy \nreform will simply not occur for yet another Congress. Indeed, if \nGeorge W. Bush becomes President of the United States, our best chance \nat balanced, bipartisan bankruptcy legislation will be lost for 4 \nyears. That is a high price to pay for Mr. Schumer's amendment on \nabortion clinics.\n\n  Since the bill only maintains the status quo, it may not improve the \nsituation on abortion clinics but it does not worsen it either. We live \nto fight another day on that narrow issue, but we make all this \nprogress on so many other issues. Enactment of this legislation will \nimpact many people involved in so many parts of our economy. I urge my \ncolleagues to think carefully about this bill. Overwhelmingly, you have \nvoted for it before. It is now better than it was when you voted for it \npreviously, and 84 Senators voted for it previously. I urge the \nPresident to think very carefully about vetoing this legislation for \nthe most narrow of provisions.\n  The FACE legislation that was offered and adopted previously by this \nCongress did much to protect abortion rights. If it needs to be \nstrengthened again, we can do so again. But to lose bankruptcy reform \nprotections that I believe are contained in this bill for women and \nchildren, for small businesses, to lose the restraints on the credit \nindustry and credit card solicitations--that is a high price to pay; to \nlose 4 years of work for this balanced bipartisan approach.\n  I urge adoption of the bill. I am proud to be its coauthor with \nSenator Grassley, proud of the work we have done together. I urge its \nadoption and I urge its signature.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on the \npending business, which is the bankruptcy bill. I had an opportunity to \nhear about one-fourth of the presentation of my good friend, the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli. I heard him compliment my \nefforts as author of this legislation. In fact, this bill has been so \nsuccessful in the Senate only because Senator Torricelli, as ranking \nDemocrat on the Courts Subcommittee, has been so cooperative, \nrecognizing there is a problem that should be addressed and working in \na bipartisan way to make sure such a bill was put together and \nintroduced by me and him, and then working through a long hearing \nprocess in the subcommittee and the full committee to develop a bill \nthat would be reported out of the Judiciary Committee, a committee that \ntends to be very evenly divided on a lot of issues, by a very wide \nmargin. Our bill came out with a fair sized majority. Then it passed \noverwhelmingly in the Senate with only 14 dissenting votes.\n  We had a very difficult time conferencing this bill, but there was \nfinally an effort to go to conference. Senator Torricelli was very \nhelpful in working out the details of the conference.\n  This afternoon, I saw, and the people of this country saw, through \nhis remarks that continued cooperation, and that continued cooperation \nevidently goes way beyond what is going on in this Chamber on \nbankruptcy reform. It continues, through his own admission, through his \nrecommendation to the President, when the President gets this bill, \nthat the President should sign this bill. There will be people from the \nother side requesting the President not sign this bill.\n  I hope the President knows this bill has broad bipartisan support. We \nnot only saw it in that vote of only 14 dissenting votes when it passed \nthe Senate several months ago, but we also saw it yesterday in the vote \non cloture where there were 67 Senators, 7 more than needed, to stop \ndebate on this bill.\n  That brings me to the issue of how this bill has finally been \nconferenced and brought to the floor and has passed through the House \nof Representatives already, to be presented to the President hopefully \nafter a successful vote tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock under the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  We had an opportunity yesterday and today to hear the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, and we also heard others complain about the \nparliamentary process of getting this bankruptcy bill to the floor. It \nis an unbelievable thing for him and other Senators to condemn the way \nthis bill finally got to conference. The Senate passed the bankruptcy \nbill after weeks of debate and after disposing of hundreds of \namendments. On the issue of disposing of hundreds of amendments, I \ncompliment Senator Harry Reid for his work in helping us work through \nthose amendments.\n  The Senator from Minnesota still continues to object to the way in \nwhich this conference was handled saying it was not handled in the \nregular order of doing business in the Senate. The fact is, not only \nSenator Torricelli and the Senator from Iowa worked to get this bill to \nconference, but we also had many meetings between Senator Daschle, the \nDemocratic leader, and Senator Lott, the Republican leader, on how to \nget the bill before the Senate.\n  In every respect, on the motions it would take to accomplish that \nunder the regular order, the Senator from Minnesota was in a position \nto object saying he was going to object and, consequently, then \nconferees could never be appointed in the way they are for most bills.\n  So it is misleading, it seems to me, for the Senator from Minnesota \nto pretend that he is not the reason this bill has not moved in the \nconventional way that bills ought to move, and then to blame others for \nfinding a way of bringing a conference report.\n  It seems to me that if we did not find another way, it would be \nirresponsible on our part not doing our duty to the 83 Senators who \nvoted for this bill the first time it passed the Senate. So we found a \nway to conference this bill with an unrelated piece of legislation.\n  By the way, very rarely are conference committees three Republicans \nand three Democrats, but this committee was made up that way. So for \nthis bill to move to the floor of the Senate, there had to be members \nof Senator Wellstone's political party, the Democrat Party, who agreed \nthat this is such an important piece of legislation, with 83 or 84 \nSenators voting for it in the first place, that it had to happen and it \nhad to come to the floor. So we got this bill out of conference with \nthe help of Senators on the other side of the aisle. I thank them for \ntheir cooperation.\n  Also earlier in this debate, Senator Wellstone referred to the fact \nthat there seems to be no evidence at all that you can decrease the \nnumber of bankruptcies filed by the usual stigma against bankrupts that \nhas been traditional throughout American society. I have to admit in \nrecent years that has not been true. That is one of the very basic \nreasons we have had a dramatic increase in the number of bankruptcies \nsince the last bankruptcy reform legislation that was passed in the \nlate 1970s.\n  In the early 1980s, we had about 300,000 bankruptcies filed. It did \nnot go up very dramatically until about the early 1990s, when it shot \nup very dramatically from maybe reaching 700,000\n\n[[Page S11632]]\n\nto almost doubling that amount, and continuing to rise until it got to \na high of 1.4 million bankruptcies.\n  There is some evidence that it has come down just a little bit, but I \nam also going to be speaking shortly about evidence showing that the \nnumber of bankruptcies is going to shoot up again this year by 15 \npercent. But I think there is not the stigma in our society against \npeople going into bankruptcy that there used to be. And that is one \nreason. But Senator Wellstone has spoken to the point that there is no \nevidence at all that the decrease in stigma associated with bankruptcy \nis related to this increase in bankruptcy filings. This is simply not \ntrue.\n  I have before me a study from 1998, from the University of Michigan, \nentitled ``The Bankruptcy Decision: Does Stigma Matter?'' by Scott Fay, \nErik Hurst, and Michelle J. White, economists at the University of \nMichigan. They concluded--and I will read just one sentence from the \nabstract--\n\n       We show that the probability of debtors filing for \n     bankruptcy rises when the level of bankruptcy stigma falls.\n\n  I am not going to spend the taxpayers' money to put this entire \ndocument in the Record, but the address is the Department of Economics, \nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, if people want to refer \nto this and read from it. I advise them to do it because they will see, \nin a very statistical way, in a very in-depth way, that when there is \nstigma associated with bankruptcy--the societal disapproval of people \nfiling for bankruptcy--we do not have as high a number of bankruptcy \nfilings as we do now.\n  Mr. President, with that somewhat pointed reaction to some of the \nstatements the Senator from Minnesota legitimately brought to the \nfloor--but I think he is wrong in his approach in what he is saying--I \nhopefully have put another side of the coin out there for people to \nconsider. That is a strong basis for why this legislation should be \nbefore us, why it is before us, and why it needed to come here in a \nfairly unconventional way.\n\n  I am glad we are having a chance to debate the merits of the \nbankruptcy reform conference report today, and for a short time \ntomorrow, before we vote tomorrow on sending it to the President.\n  When the Senate last considered this bill, we heard a lot about the \ndeclining number of bankruptcies. Our opponents pointed to a temporary \ndownward spike in the number of bankruptcies to say that this bill is \nnot needed. They have said the economics have taken care of the \nsituation. Not so. Even with a slight downturn, having 1.3 million \nbankruptcies, when we are in our 9th or 10th year of recovery, is an \nunconscionable index for bankruptcies. That is why the very liberal \nbankruptcy legislation that was passed in 1978 has to be changed \nsomewhat, so that the legislation does not encourage bankruptcies, so \nthat, in fact, it encourages those who have the ability to repay to \nknow that they are never going to again get off scot-free.\n  I said just a few minutes ago that I was going to point to a study \nthat would take away any weight to the arguments that we do not need \nthis bill because there has been a downturn in the number of \nbankruptcies in the last year. This new study predicts that \nbankruptcies will rise by 15 percent next year. This was reported in \nthe December 1st Wall Street Journal. The research was done by SMR \nResearch Corporation, a consumer-debt research firm in Hackettstown, \nNJ. The SMR Research president, Stuart Feldstein, said this as a result \nof their study:\n\n       But now that we've caught our breath, they're [meaning \n     bankruptcies] about to go way up again. We're on the verge of \n     another flood.\n\n  The suggestion is that they will increase by 15 percent.\n  That is what we are facing: Another flood of bankruptcies. We have \nour critics, with their heads in the sand, acting as if there is \nnothing for us to worry about. The fact that we have a bankruptcy \ncrisis on our hands--and have had for several years--and it looks as if \nthings are going to get even worse, is an unconscionable situation when \nwe can do something about it.\n  That is why we need to pass this bill, and we need to pass it right \nnow. The bankruptcy reform bill will do a lot of good for the American \npeople. More importantly, it is going to do a lot of good for our \neconomy.\n  This bill will avert a disaster for our economy. There are signs that \nthe economy is slowing down. There are signs that we are in the middle \nor at the beginning of a Clinton era recession. Remember, President \nClinton is President of the United States. The manufacturing sector is \nalready in a recession. Several other indices in the last couple months \nhave shown downward trends. If they continue, obviously, we will be in \na recession. That recession is probably apt to happen when we have a \nPresident Bush.\n  I want to make it clear right now: We are not going to let that be a \nBush recession, if the downturn started in a Clinton administration. We \nare not going to let the Democrats get away with taking credit for a \nrecovery in 1993 that started 8 months before the election of President \nClinton in 1992. That is when the recession of 1990-1991 turned around. \nIt was 1992. Yet from February through the middle of November 1992, \nsomehow we were still in a Bush recession, not in a recovery that \nhappened in February 1992. But just as soon as Clinton was elected, it \nwas all over.\n  The media weren't doing their job or it would never have been \nreported that way or the hysteria Clinton provided the country in 1992 \nwould have never taken root. But we are in a situation now where there \nwill be some people, if there is a downturn next year, who are going to \nwant to blame the new President for that. They won't be able to, if it \nstarted now.\n  I hope these indices will turn around. I think we have an \nopportunity, under a new President with the proper economic policies in \nplace and fair tax cuts that the working men and women of America are \nentitled to, to do some things to make sure that such a situation \ndoesn't happen. But right now, we have had 9 years of growth, starting \nat the tail end of the last Bush administration. Yet we have the \nhighest number of bankruptcies over a long period of time, and it is \npresumably going to get worse. If we have a recession, they are going \nto get a lot worse. That is why we need this legislation.\n  We have also seen quite a fall in the stock market recently, and we \nknow that Americans are anxious about their economic future. If we hit \na recession without fixing the bankruptcy system, we could face a \nsituation of bankruptcies spiraling out of control. The time to act is \nnow before any recession is in full swing.\n  As I did earlier this year, when we voted on cloture on this bill, I \nwill summarize a few of the things that are in the bill that my \ncolleagues may not know are there as a result of the disinformation \ncampaign waged by our liberal opponents.\n  Right now, farmers in my State and in Minnesota--maybe in every State \nbut particularly in the upper Midwest where it is a grain growing \nregion and we have a 25-year low in grain prices--have no chapter of \nthe bankruptcy code that fits them and their own special needs. They \ndid from 1933 to 1949. Then they didn't have it. They have had it as a \nresult of my getting it passed in 1986, a chapter 12 for farmers. But \nit has lapsed now because the people on the other side of the aisle, \nwho every day talk about helping the American farmer, are voting \nagainst this bill or stalling it. And chapter 12 has lapsed, so there \nis no chapter 12 to help farmers. Yet we have farmers \nfacing foreclosure and forced auctions just because chapter 12 of the \nbankruptcy code, which gives essential protections for the family \nfarmers, expired in June of this year. It expired for the reasons I \ngave.\n\n  Shame on those who are blocking us from doing the right thing by \nreinstituting chapter 12 and going beyond how we have normally done it, \njust do it for a few years at a time. In this bill we say that farmers \nare entitled to the same permanency of their chapter in the bankruptcy \ncode as the big corporations have in chapter 11, as small business and \nindividuals have in chapter 13. We are not going to leave farmers then \nwith this last ditch effort.\n  We went beyond that because we have also changed the tax laws so that \nfarmers will be able to avoid capital gains taxes when they are forced \nto sell something by the referee of bankruptcy. This will free up \nresources then to be invested in a farming operation that would \notherwise go down the black hole of the IRS.\n\n[[Page S11633]]\n\n  We have a fundamental choice. The Senate could vote as the Senator \nfrom Minnesota wants us to vote, and the Senate would then kill this \nbill and leave farmers without this safety net, or we can stand up for \nthe farmers. We can do our duty and make sure that the family farmers \nare not gobbled up by giant corporate farms when they are forced into \nforeclosure. We can give farmers in Iowa and Minnesota a fighting \nchance.\n  I hope the Senate will stand with the farmers of Iowa and Minnesota \nand other farmers around the United States on supporting this \nlegislation. I hope the Senate doesn't give in to the liberal \nestablishment which has decided to fight bankruptcy reform no matter \nwho gets hurt or what the cost is to the farming operators.\n  There are a lot of other things in this conference report. The bill \nwill give badly needed protection for patients in bankrupt hospitals \nand nursing homes. The Senate adopted this as an amendment. I offered \nit. It was accepted unanimously. Again, my colleagues may be unaware of \nthe fact that there aren't any provisions in the bankruptcy code to \nprotect people in nursing homes, if that nursing home goes into \nbankruptcy. By killing this bill, they are killing some of that \nprotection.\n  I had hearings on the fate of patients in bankrupt nursing homes in \nmy judiciary subcommittee. As my colleagues know, Congress is still \ntrying to put more money into nursing homes through the Medicare \nReplenishment Act that is now before the Senate because of nursing \nhomes being in bankruptcy. So the potential for real harm to nursing \nhome residents is there. I would like to provide an example of that.\n  Without the patient protections contained in this conference report, \nwe learned, through our hearing process, of a situation in California \nwhere the bankruptcy trustee just showed up at the nursing home on a \nFriday evening and evicted residents. The bankruptcy trustee didn't \nprovide any notice that this was going to happen. There was no chance \nto relocate the residents of the nursing homes. The bankruptcy trustee \nliterally put these frail elderly people out onto the street and \nchanged the locks on the doors so they couldn't get back into the \nnursing home. But this bankruptcy bill will prevent that from ever \nhappening again.\n  If we don't stand up and say that residents of nursing homes can't be \nthrown out onto the street, then Congress will fail in its duty to \nthese people.\n  Again, we have no choice. We can vote this bill down and tell nursing \nhome residents and their families that it just doesn't matter to \nanybody in the Senate. That is the end result of the position advanced \nby the Senator from Minnesota. I hope the Senate is much better at \nhumanitarian responsibilities than that. I hope the Senate stands for \nnursing home residents and not for the inside Washington liberal \nspecial interest groups that don't care about some nursing home \nresident being out on the street on a Friday night.\n  There is more to this bill. The bankruptcy reform bill contains \nparticular bankruptcy provisions advocated by Federal Reserve Chairman \nAlan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. I think both of \nthese people--for the benefit of the Senator from Minnesota--are \nappointees of President Clinton. They have good things to say about the \nneed for bankruptcy reform. These particular provisions I am talking \nabout will strengthen our financial markets and lessen the possibility \nof domino-style collapses in the financial sector of our economy.\n  According to both Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Summers, these \nprovisions will address significant threats to our prosperity. As I \nsaid earlier, we are seeing the early warning signs of a recession. We \nneed to put these safeguards into place so that the financial markets, \nwhich are the key components of our economy, don't face the unnecessary \nrisk of what might be the beginning of a Clinton recession.\n  Again, we have a very fundamental choice: We can strengthen our \nfinancial markets by passing this bill or we can side with the liberal \nestablishment and fight reform no matter what the cost is to our \nsociety. So I think the American people do in fact want us to \nstrengthen the economy, not turn a deaf ear to pleas for help from the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Secretary. I hope the \nSenate decides to vote to safeguard our prosperity and not put it at \nrisk.\n  At this point, I will talk about the issue of how the bankruptcy bill \nwill impact people with high medical expenses. I am going to refer to a \nnearby chart. Earlier this year, I had an opportunity to address this \nvery issue. I want to assure my colleagues with any remaining questions \nabout the full deductibility of health care costs to a person going \ninto bankruptcy, whether or not those are factored into the ability to \nrepay, and the answer is, yes, 100 percent. I know the Senator from \nMinnesota has heard my explanation on that. I haven't heard him \ncontradict anything I have had to say that the General Accounting \nOffice has said to back this up. Yet he will continually come to the \nfloor of the Senate and make the same point that it could be possible \nfor people with high medical expenses not to be able to go into \nbankruptcy and get those considered as part of the process of discharge \nor not.\n  The bankruptcy bill says people who can repay a certain amount of \ntheir debt can't file for chapter 7, the point being that they are then \nchanneled into a repayment plan under chapter 13. At this time, the \nquestion of medical expenses comes into play when determining whether \nsomeone has the ability to repay their debt. According to the \nnonpartisan General Accounting Office, the conference report before the \nSenate allows for 100-percent full deductibility for medical expenses \nbefore examining repayment ability.\n  Right here you have it, from the IRS--other necessary expenses that \nare deducted. It says that no standard other than expense must be \nnecessary and reasonable. But it says it includes such expenses as \ncharitable contributions, child care, dependent care, health care. \nRight now I emphasize the words ``health care'' because that is what we \nare being told by the Senator from Minnesota--that that would not be \ndeductible. It says payroll deductions such as union dues and life \ninsurance.\n  So maybe all of those things together would tell people that there \nare assurances way beyond just the health care expense issue of the \ndeductibility. But it also emphasizes in this General Accounting Office \nreport that we take care of all of the concerns anybody ought to have \nin that particular area. So, bottom line: If you have huge medical \nbills, you get to deduct them in full before even looking at whether \nyou get channeled into a repayment plan. So I don't know what could be \nmore fair and how it could be any clearer.\n\n  The Senator from Minnesota has told us he wants to learn more about \nthis bankruptcy bill. It is quite obvious that he needs to know more \nabout this bankruptcy bill. So I hope he does, and I hope he will let \nme talk to him, because once we look into this bill in its totality, I \nam confident that Members of the Senate will do the responsible thing \nand will vote for final passage tomorrow at 4 o'clock.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Wall Street Journal \npreviously referred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 1, 2000]\n\n            Bankruptcy Pace for Individuals Is Accelerating\n\n                         (By Yochi J. Dreazen)\n\n       When the nation's bankruptcy rate started to drop last \n     year, John Garza felt the impact almost immediately. Business \n     at his suburban Maryland bankruptcy law slowed so much that \n     he was forced to let half of his 15 attorneys go, and several \n     of the survivors quit in frustration over their reduced \n     earnings. Mr. Garza, for his part, had time for other \n     pursuits. ``I played a ton a golf,'' he remembers.\n       These days, tee times are down and court time is up. The \n     caseload of Mr. Garza's firm rose more than 15% last month \n     alone, leading him to hire a new attorney. ``We're like \n     vultures perched on the telephone pole, waiting for the \n     disaster so that we can eat,'' he says of his firm, which \n     handles both personal and business bankruptcies. ``Well, the \n     vultures are about to spread their wings.''\n       With interest rates up and the economy slowing, many \n     households are discovering that their bills for years of \n     torrid spending are coming due just as they are ill prepared \n     to pay them. As a result, growing numbers of Americans are \n     seeking court protection from\n\n[[Page S11634]]\n\n     their creditors. Personal bankruptcies, as measured by a 12-\n     week moving average of filings, have increased nearly 10% \n     since January. The moving average hit 24,288 for the week \n     ending Nov. 4, up from 22,291 in the week ending Jan. 1, \n     according to data from Visa.\n       Extended over an entire year, that pace would translate \n     into about 1.26 million personal bankruptcy filings, a notch \n     lower than the 1.28 million filings recorded last year. \n     Indeed, after rising steadily for most of the past decade, \n     personal bankruptcies fell in 1999 amid low interest rates \n     and solid wage gains associated with the nation's ultratight \n     labor market.\n       But what concerns many analysts is that the pace of \n     bankruptcies appears to be accelerating. SMR Research Corp., \n     a consumer-debt research firm in Hackettstown, N.J., \n     estimates that bankruptcy filings will rise as much as 15% \n     next year, easily surpassing 1998's record 1.4 million \n     filings.\n       ``We've just finished one of the plateau periods for \n     bankruptcies, which hit a peak in 1998 and then fell a bit,'' \n     says SMR President Stuart Feldstein. ``But now that we've \n     caught our breath, they're about to go way up again. We're on \n     the verge of another flood.''\n       If the projections hold up, an increase of that size would \n     probably bolster congressional efforts to tighten the \n     nation's Bankruptcy Code. Legislation making it harder for \n     Americans to discharge their debts passed the House this year \n     but got tangled up in partisan wrangling in the Senate. \n     Supporters have promised to try again next year.\n       Bankruptcy takes a heavy human toll, and many of those seek \n     protection from their debts see it as a humiliating admission \n     of failure. But the economic costs can also be substantial. \n     Creditor losses from debts erased by bankruptcy run into the \n     tens of billions of dollars each year. The filings, \n     meanwhile, may be the harbinger of a significant slowdown in \n     consumer spending that could make a ``soft landing'' for the \n     U.S. economy nearly impossible.\n       Here's why: The consumer-spending binge of the early 1990s \n     was built on a fragile foundation of massive household \n     borrowing, so for spending to keep pace going forward, \n     borrowing would have to continue to increase as well. But the \n     current increase in the number of bankruptcies means that \n     many households are having a hard time repaying existing \n     debts, suggesting they'll be far less eager to amass new \n     ones. And with Americans already spending every dollar they \n     earn, a reluctance to borrow more money means the pace of \n     consumer spending can only slow, serving as a significant \n     drag on the broader economy.\n       Yesterday, a new government report on personal income \n     suggested that consumer spending will advance at an annual \n     rate of just 3% this quarter, far slower than the 4.5% pace \n     recorded a quarter earlier. The weaker pace could easily \n     translate into a relatively weak holiday season for the \n     nation's retailers.\n       Micole Farley, a 25-year-old single mother from Houston, \n     will be one of those doing a lot less shopping this holiday \n     season. As a teenager in the early 1990s, she was surprised \n     to find herself quickly approved for numerous credit cards, \n     part of the seemingly endless stream of easy credit that \n     continues to wash over many Americans. (With credit \n     plentiful, consumers owed $591 billion in revolving credit \n     debt in 1999, nearly double the $276.8 billion in debt \n     amassed in 1992.)\n       Young and in love, Ms. Farley had run up $1,500 in credit-\n     card debts by 1994, buying clothing, shoes and housewares for \n     herself and her then-boyfriend. When she got pregnant and had \n     to quit her job a short time later, though, Ms. Farley \n     watched with alarm as finance charges and high interest rates \n     sent her bills spiraling higher. By 1999, she was divorced \n     and the debt had ballooned to nearly $5,000.\n       ``I just can't afford to shop like I used to,'' says Ms. \n     Farley, who's trying to avoid bankruptcy. ``I have enough \n     bills as it is.''\n       Although many households are struggling to repay their \n     debts, low-income Americans have been among the first to feel \n     the strain. About 10% of households making less than $50,000 \n     were more than 60 days late on at least one loan payment, a \n     recent survey showed, compared with less than 4% of the \n     families earning more than that amount. With the labor market \n     easing, moreover, it's becoming harder for low-income \n     Americans to work the extra hours or second jobs needed to \n     earn the money to repay their debts.\n       Americans are also feeling the sting of higher interest \n     rates. The Federal Reserve has increased them six times since \n     June 1999 in an effort to cool the economy. Mr. Feldstein \n     argues that the number of bankruptcy filings has actually \n     been increasing steadily since around 1985, with the only \n     exceptions coming immediately after periods in which interest \n     rates fell sharply, reducing the cost of borrowing money. \n     When the Fed cut interest rates in 1998 in the wake of the \n     Asian currency crisis, for example, bankruptcies dutifully \n     fell a year later.\n       ``Interest rates quell the bankruptcy rate temporarily, but \n     when rates go back up, bankruptcies resume their climb,'' Mr. \n     Feldstein says.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since I don't see any colleagues here on \nthe floor wanting to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like the opportunity to address \nthe bankruptcy issue, and I am here to say that I am very disappointed \nthat the majority leader chose to bring this bankruptcy bill back to \nthe floor.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the House passed this conference \nreport on October 12, and the majority leader first moved to proceed to \nthe conference report on October 19--well before the election. He could \nhave sought and invoked cloture on the bill and had this final debate \nany time in the month before the election. Instead, he waited until \nright before the election, and then was unable to get cloture because \nmany Senators, of course, were back home in their States campaigning.\n  In this lame duck session when we ought to be doing only the business \nthat is essential to keep the Government running and leave substantive \nlegislation to the representatives of the people who were duly elected \non November 7, only now has cloture been invoked and we are headed for \na vote on final passage. We are here in a lame-duck session, taking \nfinal action on an extraordinarily important and controversial and far-\nreaching substantive legislation.\n\n  The American people didn't vote for this Senate on November 7. With \nall due respect, they voted for a new Senate, with a decidedly \ndifferent makeup. Why did the majority leader bring up this bill again? \nWhy is he trying to put this bill through in this lame-duck session? \nThe Senate is going to have a very different makeup in a month, and \nthis legislation might turn out very differently in the next Congress. \nI suppose because we are all eager to finally bring this Congress to a \nclose he thought there would be pressure on those Members who oppose \nthe bill to relinquish the debate time the Senate rules provide for and \nlet the bill go to final passage without a fight.\n  The supporters of this bill want to get this over with, pass the \nbill, and send it to the President where it will certainly meet a veto \npen or perhaps a veto pocket, depending on when the other business of \nthe Senate is completed.\n  Before we recessed for the election, I spoke at some length about the \nvery regrettable procedure that was used to bring this bankruptcy bill \nback to the floor. I continue to believe that allowing four Senators \nmeeting in secret in a conference committee to write the final version \nof the bill that we are now considering is a terrible affront to the \ntradition of reasoned deliberation in this body. As I said before, this \nprocedure diminishes the Senate floor in favor of the backroom \nconference committee chosen to address these issues by none but \nthemselves, accountable to none but themselves and open to observations \nby none but themselves. This procedure sets a terrible precedent for \nour work, and I sincerely hope it will never be used again.\n  I would be remiss in my responsibilities as a Senator if I did not \nalso speak about the terrible damage that this bill will do to the \nbankruptcy system in our country and, even more importantly, to so many \nhard-working American families who will bear the brunt of the unfair \nso-called reforms that are included in this bill. It is a good thing \nthat this bill will not become law.\n  The President's veto, whether by pocket or by pen, will protect our \ncountry's most vulnerable citizens from a harsh and unfair measure \npushed through this Congress by the most powerful and wealthy lobbying \nforces in this country. President Clinton will do a service to those \ncitizens by standing up to powerful special interests and vetoing this \nbill in the waning days of his administration.\n  First, let me talk about what is not in this bill, which is directly \nrelated to the fact that powerful special interests have had the chance \nto shape it. As I have discussed on this floor before a number of \ntimes, this bill is not a balanced piece of legislation. The interests \nthat are the strongest supporters of this bill--the credit card \ncompanies\n\n[[Page S11635]]\n\nand the big banks--succeeded in limiting the provisions that will have \nany effect on the way they do business. These interests gave us and our \npolitical parties millions of dollars of campaign contributions and \nthey like the results they achieved in this bill.\n  Billions of credit card solicitations go out each year to consumers--\nnot millions but billions. Most experts agree that part of the rise in \nbankruptcy filings over the past decade, although the number is \nactually now on the way down, is due to credit card companies and the \nbanks irresponsibly extending credit to people who have already shown \nthey cannot handle additional debt.\n\n  I have next to me a pile of credit card solicitations. This pile of \nsolicitations was collected by just one of my staff members over the \npast year and a half since this bill was marked up in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. These were sent to his home. This pile of \nsolicitations, 85 in all, came in the mail to one person--one person--\nin the last 19 months. I am sure that the member of my staff is a very \ncreditworthy individual, but 85 offers for a new credit card--and these \ndirect mail offers don't include the constant invitations for credit \ncards that people see every day on the Internet and on the TV.\n  This industry's sales techniques are out of control. The credit card \ncompanies are making bad decisions every day, and now they are here \nbefore this Congress asking for our help. Boy, did we give it to them. \nThis bill is a bailout for the credit card industry. It is going to \nmake it easier for credit card companies to collect more on the bad \ndecisions they have made, the credit they have extended to people who \nalready have maxed out on 2, 5, even 10 credit cards. Make no mistake, \ngiving the credit card companies more power will work to the detriment \nof women and children trying to collect alimony and child support.\n  If we are going to pass a credit card industry bailout bill, the \nleast we should do is help save the industry from itself by taking some \nsteps to make sure consumers are made more aware of the consequences of \ntaking on ever-increasing amounts of debt. We had the chance in this \nbill to require credit card companies to be more open with consumers \nabout the consequences of running a balance on a card, but we didn't do \nit. We need more prevalent and more detailed disclosures on credit card \nstatements and solicitations. There are limited disclosure requirements \nin the bill, but they don't go far enough, in my opinion. I think it is \nclear that the main reason they don't is the power of the credit card \ncompanies.\n  A few days ago the Wisconsin State Journal, a newspaper in my home \narea which is generally perceived as a conservative, quite probusiness \nnewspaper, summarized well my concern about the extent to which this \nbill gives the credit card industry what it wants. I ask unanimous \nconsent the Wisconsin State Journal editorial from December 4 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Wisconsin State Journal, Dec. 4, 2000]\n\n   Bankruptcy Reform Bill Is a Bust; Let Credit Card Issuers Protect \nThemselves With Sound Lending Practices, Not by Rigging Bankruptcy Law \n                             in Their Favor\n\n       When the credit card industry came to Congress to ask for \n     help in collecting debts from deadbeats, Congress should have \n     said:\n       It's not government's job to bail you out. Why don't you \n     tighten up your own lending practices?\n       Instead, Congress let the industry turn a bankruptcy reform \n     bill into a debt collection assistance plan.\n       That's why, when the Senate goes back to work this week, it \n     should vote down the bankruptcy reform bill and spare \n     President Clinton from following through with his threat to \n     veto it.\n       The bill, already passed by the House, is touted as an \n     answer to the questions created by a rapid rise in the number \n     of petitions for bankruptcy filed annually. The surge in \n     annual bankruptcy filings from about 300,000 in the early \n     1980s to 1.4 million in 1998 occurred during relatively good \n     economic times, prompting complaints that abuse of bankruptcy \n     law had become too common.\n       Indeed, there was evidence that some people were using the \n     law to escape debts while living it up on wealth protected \n     from creditors' reach.\n       In response, Congress began to work on bankruptcy reform \n     legislation. For guidance, the House and Senate had before \n     them 172 recommendations from the National Bankruptcy Reform \n     Commission, which was led by Madison attorney Brady \n     Williamson. The commission had stressed that bankruptcy law \n     must remain balanced: It must work for creditors and debtors.\n       But the congressmen also had before them lobbyists for the \n     credit card industry and similar lenders. Quickly, bankruptcy \n     reform legislation became a campaign fund-raising bonanza for \n     the politicians, with the lending industry ``investing'' $20 \n     million in contributions. Just as quickly, bankruptcy reform \n     turned into the credit card industry's bill.\n       The industry's goal was to tilt bankruptcy law in its \n     favor. The banks and retailers that issue credit cards make \n     money when their card holders run up large balances and pay \n     the card's high interest rates. That's why the card issuers \n     try to put the cards in the hands of as many people as \n     possible, even people who are poor credit risks.\n       But there's a consequence: Sometimes people file for \n     bankruptcy, and their debts are reduced or discharged.\n       The industry wanted to use bankruptcy reform to escape that \n     consequence of their risk taking--they wanted to rig the law \n     to keep people out of bankruptcy court so the debts could be \n     collected. Moreover, they wanted to escape the expense of \n     being careful about whom they issued cards to.\n       So, the House and Senate included in their reform bills \n     provisions to make it harder for people to file under Chapter \n     7 of bankruptcy law, which basically allows a filer to wipe \n     away debts, or harder to file for bankruptcy at all.\n       The bill is atop the Senate's agenda for its lame-duck \n     session this month. Wisconsin Sens. Herb Kohl and Russ \n     Feingold are prepared to oppose the bill, but the Republican \n     leadership believes it has the votes to pass it.\n       Bankruptcy law does need some reform. But this bill is not \n     it. Furthermore, there's no rush. Bankruptcy filings have \n     declined more than 10 percent since 1998, suggesting that the \n     sense of urgency. Congress had when it took on the reform may \n     be out of date.\n       The proposal should be killed, and Congress should start \n     anew next year.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will quote from the editorial:\n\n       When the credit card industry came to Congress to ask for \n     help in collecting debts from deadbeats, Congress should have \n     said: It's not government's job to bail you out. Why don't \n     you tighten up your own lending practices? Instead, Congress \n     let the industry turn a bankruptcy reform bill into a debt \n     collection assistance plan.\n\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       The House and Senate had before them 172 recommendations \n     from the National Bankruptcy Reform Commission, which was led \n     by Madison attorney Brady Williamson. The commission had \n     stressed that bankruptcy law must remain balanced: It must \n     work for creditors and debtors.\n       But the Congressmen also had before them lobbyists for the \n     credit card industry and similar lenders. Quickly, bankruptcy \n     reform legislation became a campaign fund-raising bonanza for \n     the politicians, with the lending industry ``investing'' $20 \n     million in contributions. Just as quickly, bankruptcy reform \n     turned into the credit card industry's bill.\n\n  My colleagues are well aware of my concern about the influence of \nmoney on politics and policy. As I have said a number of times on this \nfloor over this past year, this bankruptcy bill is really a poster \nchild for the need for campaign finance reform. You only have to look \nat what the credit card industries get in this bill and, just as \nimportantly, the disclosure that consumers don't get to understand \nthat.\n  There is another thing missing in this bill. Remember, this bill is \nsupposedly designed to end the abuses of the bankruptcy system by \npeople who really can't afford to pay off more of their debts. But the \nbiggest abuses, and all the experts agree on this, come when wealthy \npeople in certain States file for bankruptcy by taking advantage of \nvery large or unlimited homestead exemptions that are available in \ntheir States. Some people with large debts even move to a State such as \nFlorida or Texas where there is an unlimited homestead exemption \nspecifically for the purpose of filing for bankruptcy.\n  The National Bankruptcy Review Commission and virtually all leading \nacademics believe that homestead exemptions are being abused and that a \nnational standard is, indeed, needed. And, by a vote of 76-22, the \nSenate adopted a very good amendment from my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, which would have closed the loophole. That \namendment would have put a $100,000 cap on the amount of money that a \ndebtor shield from creditors through the homestead exemption.\n  But almost unbelievably, after that overwhelming bipartisan vote in \nthe Senate, that amendment was stripped out of the bill by a group of \nSenators--again working in secret--and it was replaced by a weak \nsubstitute. The bill\n\n[[Page S11636]]\n\nthat has been stuffed into this conference report limits the homestead \nexemption to $100,000 but only for property purchased within 2 years of \nfiling for bankruptcy. That means that wealthy debtors can plan for \nbankruptcy by moving to an unlimited homestead exemption State, buying \na palatial estate and putting off their creditors for 2 years before \nfiling bankruptcy. If they do that, they can continue to shield \nmillions of dollars in assets and throw off their debts with the \nbankruptcy discharge.\n  The bill will have no effect on this abuse of the bankruptcy system. \nThis bill will not close the homestead exemption loophole of people \nlike Burt Reynolds and Bowie Kuhn have used in the past. Supporters of \nthis bill have chosen to ignore reforms that would give this bill real \nbalance. Somehow the interests of wealthy debtors who use the homestead \nexemption to abuse the bankruptcy system are more important than the \ninterests of hard-working Americans who, through no fault of their own, \nwhether from a medical catastrophe or the loss of a job or a divorce, \nare forced to seek the financial fresh start that bankruptcy has made \npossible since the beginning of our Republic.\n  It is interesting, and very revealing, to contrast the treatment by \nthis bill of wealthy homeowners who abuse the bankruptcy system with \nhow it treats poor tenants who need the protection of the bankruptcy \nsystem to keep from being thrown out on the street while they try to \nget their affairs in order. As I mentioned, the provision dealing with \nthe homestead exemption is virtually meaningless. At the same time, the \nbill includes a draconian provision that denies the bankruptcy stay to \ntenants trying to hold off eviction proceedings, even if they are able \nto pay their rent while the bankruptcy is pending. I think this \nprovision--I hesitate to use this language--has become something that \nis purely punitive. It will have no impact at all on getting debtors to \npay past due rent. It will result in people being evicted who are not \nabusing the bankruptcy system, but who are trying to use it for exactly \nthe purpose for which it was intended--to get a fresh start and become \nonce again productive members of our society.\n  When the bankruptcy bill was before the Senate at the beginning of \nthis year, I tried very hard to pass an amendment that would have made \nthe bill less harsh on tenants while at the same time denying the \nprotection of the automatic stay to repeat filers who are abusing the \nsystem, and who, as I understand it, were the whole reason why they \nwant to change the provision. I listened to the arguments of the \nSenator from Alabama who had concerns about my original amendment. What \nI did then was to modify the amendment to take account of some \nreasonable hypothetical situations that the Senator from Alabama came \nup with in our debates in committee and then here on the floor. But the \nrealtors strongly opposed my amendment and the Senate rejected it by a \nnearly party line vote. That was unfortunate. It confirmed my view that \nthis bill is not balanced. It is not rational. It is about punishing \npeople, not just stopping the abuses that we all agree should be \nstopped.\n  Shortly before the election, the Senator from Alabama was on the \nfloor once again arguing that this bill is necessary to crack down on \ntenants abusing the bankruptcy system to live rent free. My amendment \nwould have cracked down on those abusers too, but without harming good \nfaith debtors who need the automatic stay of an eviction to avoid \nhomelessness and be able to pay some of their debts. The failure of the \nmajority to recognize the harshness of the bill on this point and \naccept a reasonable amendment that deals with the abuse just as \neffectively was a great disappointment to me. It reinforced by judgment \nthat this bill is not balanced, it is not fair.\n  Let me turn to what proponents view as the central feature of this \nbill, the means test. After much work, I believe this feature of the \nbill is still flawed and unfair. The means test is the mechanism that \nthe bill's proponents believe will force people who can really some \nportion of their debts into Chapter 13 repayment plans instead of \nChapter 7 discharges. The means test requires every debtor to file \ndetailed information on their expenses and income which is then \nanalyzed according to a formula. Those who pass the means test can file \na Chapter 7 case; those who fail would have to file under Chapter 13.\n  The bill that is now before us includes an important ``safe harbor'' \nfor debtors who are below the median income. The means test does not \napply to them. That is a good thing, since studies show that only 2 or \n3 percent of debtors would be required to move from Chapter 7 to \nChapter 13 under the means test. But even with that ``safe harbor,'' \nthe bill has significant problems. First, the bill specifies that for \npurposes of determining the safe harbor, the median income for each \nindividual state should be used, rather than the higher of the state or \nnational median income. This will unfairly disadvantage people who live \nin high cost areas of low median income states. In the Senate bill, we \nincluded a safe harbor from creditor motions that applied to people \nwith income less than either the national or the median income. The \npeople who drafted this final bill ignored that standard. I doubt they \nreally believe it will mean that more abusers of the system will be \ncaught by the means test. But they did it anyway, giving further \nevidence of the arbitrary nature of this bill.\n  In addition, the means test still employs standards of reasonable \nliving expenses developed by the Internal Revenue code for a wholly \ndifferent purposes. These standards are too inflexible to be fair in \ndetermining what families can live on as they go through a bankruptcy. \nThey are arbitrary. And they are also ambiguous with respect to things \nlike car payments because they were not designed to be used in this \ncontext. We have pointed this out repeatedly over the past few years, \nbut the sponsors of the legislation have insisted on using these \ninflexible IRS standards.\n\n  The safe harbor from the means test also inexplicably counts a \nseparated spouse's income as income available to a mother with children \nwho has filed for bankruptcy, even if the spouse is not paying any \nchild support. This can't be fair. Let me repeat that. Mothers filing \nfor bankruptcy because their spouses have left them are treated for \npurposes of the safe harbor as if the spouse's income is still \navailable to them. That is what the bill we are about to vote on does. \nIt makes no sense. It is arbitrary and punitive.\n  But perhaps the thing that is most curious about the means test is \nthat while we now have a safe harbor for lower income people, they \nstill have to fill out all the same paperwork, doing all of means test \ncalculations using the IRS expense standards. Why is that? If the \nintent is to exempt lower income debtors from the means test, why have \nthem go through the means test anyway? The burden of the means test for \nthese people is not the result--a tiny percentage would ever be sent to \nChapter 13 because of it. No, it is the burdensome paperwork that is \nthe problem. This bill makes it more difficult to file for bankruptcy. \nBy leaving the paperwork requirements in place, the means test remains \na barrier for low income debtors, even with the safe harbor.\n  Let me give you one example. This bill would deny the protection of \nbankruptcy to a single mother with income well below the State median \nincome if she does not present copies of income tax returns for the \nlast 3 years, even if those returns are in the possession of her ex-\nhusband. I can see no justification for this result whatsoever.\n  So for those supporters of the bill who trumpet the safe harbor, I \nask you: Why doesn't the bill apply the same safe harbor to creditor \nmotions as the Senate bill did, and why doesn't it exempt people who \nfall within the safe harbor from the paperwork requirements? I have yet \nto hear reasonable answers to those questions, which leads me to \nbelieve that there are no reasonable answers. This bill is arbitrary, \nand it is punitive.\n  This bill also includes a number of ``presumptions of \nnondischargeability'' provisions, which basically say, ``these debts \ncan't be discharged in bankruptcy because we think they look like \npeople are running up bills in contemplation of bankruptcy.'' In other \nwords, they are abusing the system. They are accumulating debt with no \nintention of paying it off.\n  The problem is that these presumptions are unfair. So instead of \nbeing a\n\n[[Page S11637]]\n\ndeterrent to abuse of the system, they are simply a gift to the credit \nindustry, and a harsh punishment to hard working people trying to do \nthe best they can to meet their obligations to their families. One such \nprovision creates a presumption of nondischargeability if a debtor \ntakes $750 of cash advances within 70 days of bankruptcy. Seven hundred \nfifty dollars in a little more than two months. That is not much. I \nthink all of us can imagine a single mother with children who loses her \njob or has unexpected medical bills for her kids and has to use cash \nadvances to buy food and for her family or pay her rent. But if that \nwoman files for bankruptcy, the debt to the credit card company is \npresumed to be fraudulent. That means that the debt from those cash \nadvances will not be discharged by bankruptcy. It will still hang over \nher head as she tries to get back on her feet and support her family \nafter the bankruptcy proceeding is over. That is not balanced. Once \nagain, this bill gives special treatment to credit card companies at \nthe expense of the most vulnerable members of our society. It is \narbitrary and punitive.\n  This example shows how empty the proponent's arguments are when they \nclaim that the bill gives first priority to alimony and child support. \nThe chairman of the Judiciary Committee had a big chart listing all the \nways that the bill supposedly helps women and children. But, as has \nalready been mentioned by other Senators on the floor, 116 law \nprofessors have written to us to contest that claim.\n  Let me quote from their letter because I think it is very important \nto hear these arguments in some detail. The letter says:\n\n       Granting ``first priority'' to alimony and support claims \n     is not the magic solution the consumer credit industry claims \n     because ``priority'' is relevant only for distributions made \n     to creditors in the bankruptcy case itself. Such \n     distributions are made in only a negligible percentage of \n     cases. More than 95 percent of bankruptcy cases make no \n     distributions to any creditors because there are no assets to \n     distribute. Granting women and children a first priority for \n     bankruptcy distributions permits them to stand first in line \n     to collect nothing.\n       Women's hard-fought battle is over reaching the ex-\n     husband's income after bankruptcy. Under current law, child \n     support and alimony share a protected post-bankruptcy \n     position with only two other recurrent collectors of debt--\n     taxes and student loans. The credit industry asks that credit \n     card debt and other consumer credit share that position, \n     thereby elbowing aside the women trying to collect on their \n     own behalf. . . . As a matter of public policy, this country \n     should not elevate credit card debt to the preferred position \n     of taxes and child support.\n\n  Mr. President, what the law professors point out so convincingly is \nthat the key issue is not how the limited assets of a debtor are \ndistributed in bankruptcy, but what debts survive bankruptcy and will \ncompete for the debtor's income when the bankruptcy is over. In a \nvariety of ways, this bill will encourage reaffirmation agreements and \nincrease nondischargeability claims which will lead to more debtors \nhaving more debt that continues after bankruptcy.\n  That is what hurts women and children, not the priority of child \nsupport claims in the bankruptcy itself. The priority of claims in the \nbankruptcy itself is almost meaningless since in the vast majority of \nbankruptcy cases there are no assets to distribute. People are broke, \nand they do not have anything to sell to satisfy their creditors. That \nis why they file for bankruptcy. You can't squeeze blood from a stone.\n  One of the most interesting things about this bill, as I have seen in \nother legislation as well in recent years, is the almost Orwellian \nnames of some of its provisions. There are a number of them. For \nexample, there is a title of this bill with the name ``Enhanced \nConsumer Protection,'' but many of the provisions in this title \nactually offer little, if any, protection at all. The weak credit card \ndisclosure provisions are an example. Yes, those may be enhanced \nconsumer protections, enhanced from nothing, but they are not \nconsidered sufficient by any organization, not one organization, whose \nprimary concern is consumer protection.\n  There is another section with the so-called ``Enhanced Consumer \nProtection'' title called ``Protection of Retirement Savings in \nBankruptcy.'' That sounds pretty good. What the provision actually does \nis put a cap on the amount of retirement savings that is put out of \nreach of creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding. Before this bill, there \nwas no limit at all on the amount of retirement savings that can be \nprotected. So this bill is not an enhanced consumer protection at all. \nIt is a step backward for consumers and hard-working Americans who \ntried to put aside some money for their golden years.\n\n  Incidentally, this provision is nowhere to be found in either the \nbankruptcy bill that passed the Senate or the bill that passed the \nHouse. This is one of those provisions that appeared out of nowhere. In \nfact, before a firestorm of criticism forced him to reconsider, the \nSenator who proposed this provision wanted to let consumers waive the \nexisting protection of retirement savings in boilerplate consumer \ncredit agreements. So the $1 million cap is an improvement over what \nthe sponsors of this bill tried to do, but it is hardly a protection.\n  Here is another sort of Orwellian title. Section 306 is called \n``Giving Secured Creditors Fair Treatment Under Chapter 13.'' It ought \nto be called ``Giving Certain Secured Creditors Preferred Treatment \nUnder Chapter 13'' because it favors those who make car loans over \nother secured creditors and over unsecured creditors.\n  Here is how it works. There is, of course, a concept in bankruptcy \nlaw currently called cramdown or stripdown. It recognizes the fact that \nthe collateral for some kinds of loans can lose value over time so it \nmay be worth significantly less than the debt owed. Remember that in a \nbankruptcy proceeding, secured creditors get paid first, but the \ncramdown concept says to those creditors that they only get paid first \nup to the amount of the value of the collateral for the loan. After \nthat, if they are still owed money, they have to get in line with the \nother unsecured creditors.\n  To give a more tangible example, if someone owes $10,000 on a car \nloan, but the car which is collateral for that loan is worth only \n$7,000 now, then only $7,000 of that loan is considered secured in a \nbankruptcy. That makes perfect sense since the maker of that loan has \nthe right to repossess the car, but if it does that, it can only get \n$7,000 when it sells the car.\n  What the bill does is eliminate the cramdown for any car that is \npurchased within 5 years of bankruptcy. That means that even though the \nvehicle that secures the loan has lost much of its value, the entire \namount of the debt must be repaid in a chapter 13 plan. This gives \nspecial treatment to the lender and, more importantly, it will make it \nmuch more difficult for a chapter 13 plan to work, and that will hurt \npeople who want to pay off their debts in an organized fashion under \nchapter 13.\n  Most people file chapter 13 cases because they want to keep their \ncars. The cramdown allows them to reduce their car payments to a \nreasonable amount, leaving enough money to pay off other secured \ncreditors and make a repayment plan work.\n  According to the chapter 13 trustees who know what they are talking \nabout since they deal with these cases day in and day out, this single \nprovision of the bill will increase the number of unsuccessful chapter \n13 plans by 20 percent.\n  Making it more difficult to get chapter 13 plans confirmed will lead \nto more repossessions of cars and ultimately to more chapter 7 filings. \nEven where a chapter 13 plan can be confirmed and is successful, the \nanticramdown provision will reduce the amount a creditor can pay to \nunsecured creditors or to child support or alimony. In essence, \npayments on a car worth far less than the debt are given priority over \nchild support, another example of how this bill is arbitrary and \npunitive and how the claims of the bill's proponents that the bill will \nhelp women and children are empty indeed.\n\n  The anticramdown provision undermines the efficacy of chapter 13. All \nthe experts tell us that. I have to point out the irony here. The \navowed purpose of proponents of this bill is to move people from \nchapter 7 discharges to chapter 13 repayment plans. Yet the bill \nactually has the effect of undermining chapter 13.\n  There is even another provision in this bill that undercuts chapter \n13. A small group of Senators who shaped\n\n[[Page S11638]]\n\nthis bill in a shadow conference accepted a provision from the House \nbill that says for those debtors with income above their State's median \nincome, chapter 13 plans must extend over 5 years rather than 3. That \nis a 66-percent increase in payments required to complete the plan. In \nview of the fact that the majority of 3-year plans fail, the \nrequirement that the debtor go 2 more years without an income \ninterruption or unexpected expenses will inevitably lead to an even \nhigher rate of chapter 13 plan failures and discourage even more \ndebtors from filing voluntarily under chapter 13.\n  As I have said before, this bill is really, in a way, at war with \nitself. Bankruptcy experts from around the country tell us clearly that \nit will not work. This bill will destroy chapter 13 as an option for \nmany debtors. If we pass it, I am convinced we will be back here trying \nto fix it once it starts to take its toll on the American people. In \nthe meantime, how many lives will be made harder? How much more \nheartache are we going to inflict on hard-working Americans?\n  I have spoken for quite awhile here about the problems with this \nbill. In fact, I am sorry to say, I have probably only just scratched \nthe surface. This is an immensely complicated bill about a very \ntechnical area of the law. There are provisions in this bill that I \nwould venture to guess that no one in this body really understands. \nIndeed, some of the statements by proponents of the bill indicate that \nthey don't understand bankruptcy law or this bill.\n  This is the kind of bill where we need to rely on the experts to give \nus some real guidance. And we just have not done that here. Once again, \nwe have a letter from 116 law professors. They are from all across the \ncountry. They are not debtors' lawyers, they are not all Democrats, \nthey do not have an ideological agenda. They just understand the law \nand care about how it operates. And they are pleading with us. Let me \nquote from their letter:\n\n       Please don't pass a bill that will hurt vulnerable \n     Americans, including women and children.\n\n  That is what the 116 law professors say.\n  This is extraordinary. The experts beg us to listen to them. They do \nnot have a financial interest here. They do not represent debtors. None \nof them is in danger of declaring bankruptcy. They just hate to see \nthis Congress make such a big mistake in writing the laws. They do not \nwant us to ruin the bankruptcy system, which dates back to the earliest \ndays of our country, by passing a bill that is so unbalanced, so \narbitrary, and so punitive.\n  We have one last chance to listen to these experts, one last chance \nto step back from the brink of passing a very bad law, a law that I \nbelieve we will come to regret. It is a matter of simple fairness and \nsimple justice.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that I am not opposed to reform of the \nbankruptcy laws. I know there are abuses that need to be stopped. I \nvoted for a bill here in 1998 that passed the Senate with only a \nhandful of votes in opposition. There are things we can do--and should \ndo--to improve the bankruptcy system. There are loopholes we can close \nand abuses we can address. We can do it in a bipartisan way. We can \nwrite a balanced bill that the Senate and the country can be proud of. \nWe can rely on the advice of experts, as we have always done in this \ncomplicated area in the past. But we did not do that here. We relied on \nthe credit card industry, which has showered Senators and the political \nparties with campaign contributions, and it shows.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this unfair bill. This Senate \ncan do better, and we will do better next year if this bill is \ndefeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take this time during the \ndebate on the bankruptcy bill to give a little bit of history on \nbankruptcy reform. I want to say a few words about how we thought about \nthe proper role of bankruptcy over the course of our Nation's history.\n  Congress' authority to create bankruptcy legislation derives from the \nbody of the Constitution, article I, section 8, clause 4, authorizing \nCongress to establish ``uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies \nthroughout the United States.''\n  Until 1898, we did not have permanent bankruptcy laws in our country. \nThe previous bankruptcy laws that were on the books throughout that \nearly 100 years were temporary reactions to particular economic \nproblems, and with each successive bankruptcy act and each major reform \nof our bankruptcy laws, we refined our conception of how bankruptcies \nshould promote the important social goal of giving honest but very \nunfortunate Americans a fresh economic start, while at the same time \nafter giving that fresh start guarding against the moral hazard of \nmaking bankruptcy too lax, easy, and in fact encouraging bankruptcy.\n  Right now, I think we have a situation where too many Americans see \nbankruptcy as an easy way out. A huge majority of Americans recently \ntold pollsters that bankruptcy is too easy and more socially acceptable \nthan a few years ago.\n  I refer to the chart from Penn and Schoen Associates. The question \nthey ask: ``Is bankruptcy more socially acceptable than a few years \nago?'' You get an overwhelming 84 percent who say, gee, it is more \nsocially acceptable. As few as 10 percent say that it is not more \nsocially acceptable, and 6 percent said they did not have an opinion.\n  A very dramatically high proportion of the American people know that \nthe present policies of bankruptcy in this country are not right, and \nthey tend to encourage people to file for bankruptcy.\n  The bill we are considering today and tomorrow and will hopefully \npass at 4 o'clock tomorrow under the unanimous consent agreement \nproposes fundamental reforms which are a logical outgrowth and an \nextension of our prior bankruptcy reform efforts.\n  From 1898 until 1938--a 40-year period of time--consumers had only \none way to declare bankruptcy. It was called in the terms of the \nprofession ``straight bankruptcy.'' Today we refer to it as ``chapter \n7'' bankruptcy. Under chapter 7, which is still in existence, bankrupts \nsurrendered some of their assets to the bankruptcy court. The court \nthen sold those assets--today, for that matter--and used the proceeds \nto pay creditors. Any deficiency then is automatically wiped out.\n  In 1932, the President recommended changes to the bankruptcy laws \nwhich would push wage earners into repayment plans. In the 1930s--in \nfact, specifically in 1938--Congress then created a chapter 13 in \naddition to a chapter 7. Chapter 13 permits but does not require a \ndebtor to repay a portion of his or her debts in exchange for limited \ndebt cancellation and protection for debt collectors' efforts.\n  Chapter 13 is still on the books to this day, although it has been \nmodified several times. Most notably, modification to it came in the \nyear 1978.\n  Under current law, the choice between chapter 7 and chapter 13 is \nentirely voluntary.\n  In the late 1960s, Senator Albert Gore, Sr.--the father of the Vice \nPresident of the United States--introduced legislation to push people \ninto the repayment plans. This proposal was reported to the Senate as a \npart of a bankruptcy tax bill passed by the Finance Committee. But it \nultimately died in the Senate.\n  Later, in the mid-1980s, Senator Dole on the part of the Senate and \nCongressman Mike Synar on the part of the House tried to steer higher \nincome bankrupts--those who could pay some of their debt--into chapter \n13. The efforts of Senator Dole and Congressman Synar ultimately \nresulted in the creation of section 707(b) of the bankruptcy code. This \nsection gives bankruptcy judges the power to dismiss the bankruptcy \ncase of someone who has filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy if that case is, \nin the words of the law, ``substantial abuse'' of the bankruptcy code.\n\n  While this idea sounds good and well intended, it has not worked well \nin the real world of people who do not pay their bills--and the people \nwho enforce the bankruptcy laws and the lawyers who work with them.\n\n[[Page S11639]]\n\n  First, the problem is that no one knows what the term ``substantial \nabuse'' actually means. We have conflicting court decisions around the \ncountry, and people just aren't sure what the rules are.\n  Second, creditors and private trustees are actually forbidden from \nbringing evidence of abuse to the attention of a bankruptcy judge.\n  Look at that situation.\n  No. 2, if somebody knows about abuse, and it is very obvious--and \neven if it isn't so obvious--they can bring it to the attention of the \nbankruptcy judge and something can be done about it. The law doesn't \nallow that to be done.\n  As well intentioned as what Senator Dole and Congressman Mike Synar \nended up doing--their original intentions were right but they had to \ncompromise to get it done in 707--it just hasn't accomplished what that \ncompromise was supposed to have accomplished.\n  The bill before the Senate now corrects these shortcomings. Under the \nbill, 707(b) now permits creditors and private trustees to file motions \nand bring evidence of chapter 7 abuses to the attention of the \nbankruptcy judge.\n  People who oppose this bill find fault with that. If somebody is \nusing the courts of the United States to help them along, and if they \ndon't deserve that help and there is abuse of power of government to \nthe detriment of creditors and particularly to the consumers, and as a \nresult of 1.4 million bankruptcies in America a family of four pays \n$400 more for goods and services than they would otherwise pay--and \nthat is wrong--what is wrong with that information being presented \nthrough the transparency process to the judge? We do that here. It \nshould be done. I don't know why anybody would find fault where there \nis outright abuse being presented.\n  The change is very important, since creditors have the most to lose \nfrom bankruptcy abuse, and private trustees are often in the very best \nposition to know which cases are abusive in nature. In certain types of \ncases where the probability of abuse is very high, the Department of \nJustice is required to bring evidence of abuse to the attention of \nbankruptcy judges. And they should be required to bring this abuse to \ntheir attention.\n  Additionally, the bill requires judges to dismiss or convert chapter \n7 cases where the debtor has a clear ability to repay his or her debts.\n  Taken together, these changes will bring the bankruptcy system back \ninto balance, particularly in relationship to the evolution of the \nbankruptcy code from an ad hoc sort of passage by Congress for the \nfirst 100 years--the last 100 years being more permanent, and in the \nlast 20 years it has been very liberalized--to make it a little more \nbalanced. It is a perfectly legitimate thing to do.\n  Importantly, these changes preserve the element of flexibility so \nthat each and every debtor can have his or her special circumstances \nconsidered. This means that each bankrupt will have his or her own \nunique circumstances taken into account at the time of judgment.\n  As we consider this bill, I hope my colleagues will keep in mind the \nremainder of the bill, and the fair nature of this legislation as well \nas its historical roots.\n  I see that the Senator from Alabama has come to the floor. I think he \nis waiting to speak. Soon I will yield the floor.\n  But I also take this opportunity to praise, as I have had the \nopportunity in times past, the efforts of the Senator from Alabama to \nhelp us bring this bill this far, and for his willingness to be \nflexible in some things where he would like to go further in making \nsure that debts are repaid that maybe otherwise would not be repaired \nbut understanding the extremes on both sides helping us to get to a \nmiddle so that a moderate bill such as this can become law. I thank, \npublicly, Senator Sessions of Alabama.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation and admiration \nto Senator Grassley for his extraordinary patience, steadfast \nleadership, and efforts in moving this bill forward over a period of \nyears.\n  Some say this has slipped through. We have had hearings for years. We \nhave had debates on this floor for the last 2 to 3 years. It has passed \nevery time overwhelmingly. But a small group is trying to identify \ncertain little things when they put a spin on it to make it sound as if \ndoing something about a bankruptcy system that is out of control is bad \nand is not a fair thing.\n  What we are saying fundamentally is, if you make above median \nincome--for a family of four, I believe the median income is $45,000--\nand a judge finds you can pay some of your debts back, you ought to be \nable to pay that.\n  We have examples all over this country. If you talk to any of your \nbankers and hospitals in your community, you find people with high \nincomes are just walking away, wiping out all their debts and not \npaying them. They think it is cool and clever. But it is wrong.\n  When a person receives a value, receives a loan, he or she ought to \npay it back if they can. America is very generous. If you cannot pay it \nback and you are in debt, you can file bankruptcy, wipe out all those \ndebts, and start over free and clear.\n  What this legislation says is, most historically, the small number--\nand it is far less than 50 percent--who make higher incomes, if they \ncan pay more, ought to. That is only fair and just.\n  Bankruptcy is a Federal court legal system. Bankruptcy judges are \nFederal judges. The whole bankruptcy code with which many lawyers have \nworked--and I have a bit over the years but never mastered; and as U.S. \nattorney, I had a couple of lawyers on my staff who worked bankruptcy \nregularly and we dealt with bankruptcy issues--this complex code states \nwho gets what in bankruptcy and how much should be paid.\n  We found we have had a doubling in filings in bankruptcy in the last \n10 years, during a time when the economy is doing exceedingly well. We \nhave also found that lawyers--and I don't really blame lawyers; I am a \nlawyer; I practiced law; if the bankruptcy code gives me a clause \nsomewhere that I can use to the advantage of my client to make them not \npay a debt that the client probably should pay--I am going to take \nadvantage of it. It is malpractice not to take advantage of that.\n  Whose responsibility is it if we create a bankruptcy code that has \nloopholes in it? It is our responsibility. If after over 20 years of \nthis current bankruptcy bill, after over 20 plus years of experience, \nwe see where the problem areas are, where the abuses are, it is our \nobligation, I think, to do something about it and fix it so that it \noperates fairly and so that people are treated as they should be \ntreated.\n  What we are saying and what bankruptcy does is say that a person who \nincurred a debt, a person who received a benefit, doesn't have to pay \nfor it. If you received a loan, they give you $10,000 and you go \nbankrupt, you don't pay your loan back. Sure, it hurts your brother-in-\nlaw who loaned it to you, your banker who loaned it to you, and it has \nfinancial repercussions. The bank has to charge higher interest rates \nwhen they have more defaults. Consumers pay for that, too.\n  It hurts that family who sits down on a weekly basis adding up their \nincome around the kitchen table, figuring how to pay their debts. Some \npeople don't; they go off gambling or they do other things. Or they \nhave, in fact, a serious financial problem they can't deal with--a huge \nmedical bill. Some families try to figure out a way to work through \nthat; they should. Some can't, and they file bankruptcy.\n\n  All we are saying is, that that small percentage who is making above \nmedian income, who a judge believes can pay some of it, ought to pay \nit. Maybe it is 25 percent of the debts they owe, but they ought to pay \nthat if they can.\n  It also does a number of things that Senator Hatch and Senator \nGrassley have mentioned to raise the level of protection and benefits \nfor children and divorced women through alimony. Alimony and child \nsupport become No. 1 protected items in this bill.\n  There have been some letters that Senator Kennedy and others read \nthat nobody supports this bill. He stated on the floor not one single \norganization that advocates for children supports this bill. These are \nhis words: Not one single organization that advocates for women \nsupports this legislation, there is not one single organization that \nrepresents working men and women that supports the bill, and that there \nis not\n\n[[Page S11640]]\n\none single organization that represents the interests of consumers that \nsupports the bill.\n  Well, that is not exactly correct. Interestingly, just yesterday I \nreceived four letters from organizations that represent the interests \nof all the groups referred to by Senator Kennedy who do support this \nbill. Those four organizations writing letters in support of this bill \ninclude the National Child Support Enforcement Association.\n  I was attorney general for 2 years in Alabama, and we worked all \nkinds of ways to utilize the power of the State's attorneys to help \nincrease child support collections. That is one of the main groups in \nAmerica that does this--the National Child Support Association, the \nWestern Interstate Child Support Enforcement Council, the California \nFamily Support Council, and Attorney General Betty Montgomery of Ohio.\n  I will now tell you a little bit about the contents of the letters. \nThe National Child Support Enforcement Association is committed to \nensuring parents fulfill their responsibility to provide emotional and \nfinancial support for their children, including honoring legally-owed \nchild support obligations. According to the organization, this bill \nwill ``significantly advance their goal.''\n  I do not see how any person can stand on the floor of this Senate and \nnot say this bill will enhance the ability of children to receive child \nsupport payments. In fact, it enhances it in a multiplicity of ways. It \neven puts the payments of child support above payments to the lawyers \nin the case, which may be one of the reasons we are having some \nobjection to this bill.\n  The Western Interstate Child Support Enforcement Council's primary \npurpose is to ensure that child support workers have effective \nenforcement tools to carry out their mandated responsibility to \nestablish and collect child support, feels that passage of this bill \nwill ``greatly enhance [their] efforts in this regard by establishing \nan equitable system of debt repayment and discharge in bankruptcy \nproceedings.''\n  This is a strong and clear statement from this organization that \ncares about children, is dedicated to them, and is working on a regular \nbasis.\n  According to Howard Baldwin, the president of WICSEC, the provisions \nof this bill:\n\n       will re-prioritize the elements in bankruptcy plans by \n     establishing child support as the debtor's primary \n     obligation, with all other debts assuming a secondary role.\n       As a result, our Nation's child support agencies will be \n     able to pursue collection efforts without encountering the \n     restrictions caused by existing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n  This is another strong statement that they will be able to pursue \ncollection efforts without encountering restrictions under the current \nbankruptcy laws.\n  The California Family Support Council also supports this bill.\n  At its Annual Training Conference held in February, 2000, the \norganization noted that:\n\n       based on [its] experience .  .  . bankruptcy remains an \n     impediment to [their] ability to collect support and [that is \n     serves as] a haven for those who want to avoid their familial \n     obligations.\n\n  As a result, the California Family Support Council's membership:\n\n       feels strongly that this legislation will strenghten \n     substantially the child support enforcement program and \n     improve the collection of child support.\n\n  So if we don't pass this bill we are going to be continuing under a \nrule of bankruptcy law far less favorable to children than the ones in \nexistence today.\n  Ohio Attorney General Betty D. Montgomery has strongly endorsed this \nbill. In her letter to Senators DeWine and Voinovich, and Congressman \nSteve Chabot, General Montgomery recounted the improvements this bill \nmakes over current law.\n  General Montgomery rightly notes that:\n\n       current law places domestic support obligations 7th on this \n     list of priorities. By providing that repayment of domestic \n     support obligations move to the head of the list of \n     priorities for debtors to pay in Section 212 of this bill, \n     Congress will ensure that the spouse and the children will \n     continue to collect support payments that are owed during the \n     bankruptcy case. Under the bill, debtors who owe child \n     support would have to keep paying after they file for \n     bankruptcy and creditors could not seize previous payments, \n     which is commendable.\n\n  What that means is this. Under current bankruptcy law, let's say \nthere is a deadbeat dad who files bankruptcy and he still owes a lot of \nchild support money. It is not dischargeable. He wipes out all his \ndebts but his child support is not wiped out, he still owes that. If he \nmoves off to another State, maybe halfway across the country, and they \ncan't find him, it's hard to make him pay. Under this legislation, if \nhe were certified as somebody with an income sufficient to be put into \nChapter 13 and not just wipe out all his debts but had to pay some of \nthose debts back, the first debts he must pay under bankruptcy court \nspecific supervision would be this child support. If it is up to a \nperiod of 5 years, which it normally would be, he would be under court \norder. The mother/wife wouldn't need to hire a lawyer to chase the \ndeadbeat dad all around the country, the bankruptcy judge would be \nthere making sure he paid it. The first moneys that came in would have \nto go to that child support.\n  This is a historic step for children and families, and I believe we \nought to recognize that. I am glad Attorney General Montgomery, the \nable Attorney General of Ohio who I was honored to know when I was \nAttorney General of Alabama, recognizes that and has stated it so \nclearly.\n  Finally, Phillip L. Strauss, assistant district attorney for the city \nand county of San Francisco, in a September 14, 1999, letter to members \nof the Judiciary Committee made known his unqualified support for this \nbill.\n  His 27 years in the DA's Office, Family Support Bureau, and his 10 \nyears' experience as a bankruptcy law professor, convince him that this \nbill is a real improvement over the current bankruptcy law.\n  In his letter, responding to a July 14, 1999 letter from the National \nWomen's Law Center, Strauss makes the point that none of the \norganizations opposing this bill in the NWLC letter have actually ever \nbeen engaged in the collection of support; Conversely, the largest \nprofessional organizations which do perform this function have endorsed \nthe child support provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act as \n``crucially needed modifications of the Bankruptcy Code which will \nsignificantly improve the collection of support during bankruptcy.''\n  Notes Professor Strauss:\n\n        Most of the concerns raised by the groups opposing [this] \n     bill do not, in fact, center on the language of the domestic \n     support provisions themselves. Instead they are based on \n     vague generalized statements that the bill hurts debtors, or \n     the women and children living with debtors, or the ex-wives \n     and children who depend on the debtor for support. It is \n     difficult to respond point by point to such claims when they \n     provide no specifics.\n\n  The crux of the main argument against this bill is:\n\n       by not discharging certain debts owned to credit and \n     finance companies, the institutions would be in competition \n     with women and children for scarce resources of the debtor \n     and that the bill fails ``to insure that support payments \n     will come first.''\n\n  According to Strauss, ``nothing could be further from the truth.''\n\n  Indeed, under this bill, there are many protections for women and \nchildren over powerful credit and finance companies that exist outside \nof bankruptcy. Moreover, support claims are given the highest priority \nunder this bill, while commercial debts do not have any statutory \npriority. Thus when there is competition between commercial and support \ncreditors, support creditors will be paid first. And, unlike commercial \ncreditors, support creditors must be paid in full when the debtor files \na case under chapter 12 or 13.\n  In addition, support creditors will benefit--again, unlike commercial \ncreditors--from Chapter 12 and 13 plans which must provide for full \npayment of on-going support and unassigned support arrears. Further \nbenefits to support creditors which are not available to commercial \ncreditors is the security in knowing that Chapter 12 and 13 debtors \nwill not be able to discharge other debts unless all post-petition \nsupport and pre-petition unassigned arrears have been paid in full.\n  In other words, you cannot get discharged from your bankruptcy until \nyou have paid your child support.\n  In conclusion, this bill is a much-welcomed improvement over current \nlaw--as noted by these five letters, written on behalf of organizations \nthat deal\n\n[[Page S11641]]\n\nwith these issues every day, in support of it.\n  The opponents should not oppose this bill just to oppose it--that is \ndisingenuous. Mere opposition to any change in the present law, and \nvague claims that any and all attempts to address such existing abuses \nas serial filings are oppressive and will harm women and children, and \ndoes nothing to advance the proper understanding of the problems we are \nfaced with, in my view.\n  I would just say, those things make it clear from professionals in \nthe field that the legislation is not harsh toward children but, in \nfact, provides greater protections than they have ever had before, a \nfact which I assert is indisputable. Somehow, though, there is a \nfeeling here that you just ought to have an untrammeled right, an \nunlimited right to not pay anybody you don't want to pay; that somehow \nthere is no cost to society when people don't pay their debts.\n  There is a cost to society. There is a cost to you, to me, to \neveryone in this Chamber, and to everyone in this country because when \nmore people do not pay their debts, the interest rate you pay for your \nloan has to go up because a part of the reason for an interest rate is \nthe uncollectibility rate, and if a bank makes 100 loans and they \ncollect 99 out of 100, they only have to factor in that percentage of \nthat amount to pay for that one bad loan they write.\n  If only 95 out of 100 are being paid, or 90 out of 100, we will feel \nit in the interest rates. Who will be paying the higher interest rates? \nThe ones who will be paying the higher interest rates are the people \nwho manage their money, do the right thing, serve their country, train \ntheir children, and pay their debts, and we do not want them to feel \nlike they are chumps, that they somehow are not smart. And a really \nsmart person is the one who knows how to run up a bunch of debt and \ndeclare bankruptcy.\n  There is a problem into which this country is sliding. The real \nreason for the increase in bankruptcy filings in America is television \nadvertisement. Turn on your TV. Do you have debt problems? Call old Joe \nthe lawyer. It is 11 or 12 o'clock at night, people cannot sleep, they \nare worried about their debt. There it is. That is the answer. They go \ndown, and the lawyer says: Give me $1,000.\n  Well, I don't have $1,000.\n  How much do you make?\n  My check is $500.\n  Save up two of those checks and bring them to me. Don't pay any other \ndebt. Don't pay a dime on your credit card. Bring all that money to me. \nAs soon as you bring it to me, I will file bankruptcy. I will wipe out \nall these debts. You can forget this.\n  That is what is happening. Do not think I am exaggerating. That is \nwhat is happening in America today. If their debts are high, they \ncannot pay their way out of it, it is hopeless for them and they have a \nlow income, they ought to be able to start over again. Anybody who \nloans money to people who have low incomes and excessive debt--they \nhave to be careful about loaning money. They know they are going to \nlose sometimes. Understand that.\n  I am not saying we will change that. In fact, I suspect that as high \nas 90 percent of the people who filed bankruptcy under straight \nbankruptcy, chapter 7, before this new bill was passed, would be able \nto do it afterwards. This bill will catch a lot of people who are \nabusing the system, and it will be a signal that Congress does care and \ndoes believe that if you can pay some of your debts, you should pay \nthem.\n  We are going to insist you do, and we are not going to have a court \nsystem that allows wealthy people to just walk away from debts they \nhonorably signed up to pay and dishonorably declined to make good on. \nWe can do better.\n  There are a number of things I will say about this bill perhaps \ntomorrow. I do believe Senator Grassley has done a superb job. It has \nbeen a matter of great debate. It came out of the Judiciary Committee \nby a vote of 16-2 on one occasion, maybe with only three dissenting \nvotes on another occasion. It has passed this Senate with 80 or 90 \nvotes more than once. Somehow always it comes up at the end of a \nsession. It is dragged out. A small group fights it, and at the end \nthey say: We are really for bankruptcy reform, but we are just not for \nthis bill. We know there are abuses, but this bill is not fair. Or, the \nbill I voted on last time was changed in conference, so it is now bad; \nI am not voting for it now.\n  I do not think that is legitimate. If they study what is in here, \nthey will see this is a fair bill, that it does close somewhat the \nhomestead loophole about which some Senators have complained. Senator \nKohl and I led the fight to eliminate the homestead loophole entirely. \nI thought it was an abuse, but we just did not have the votes to do \nentirely eliminate it, so resolved to make significant progress toward \ntightening it--and we have.\n  Not passing this bill is going to leave us with a total lack of \ncontrol over the homestead issue. Passing this bill will eliminate \nfraud totally in the most extreme cases and tighten up the process. It \nwill be a significant step forward, in my view, to controlling that \nabuse. That is what compromise is about.\n  Chairman Grassley has done a great job working this bill to this \npoint. I believe it is a piece of legislation that should pass, and I \nremain hopeful the President will sign it. If not, I am hopeful this \nSenate will be able to override that veto. Yesterday, we had a vote \nwell into the sixties to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter dated October 19 \nfrom the NCSEA, the letter dated October 18 from Howard Baldwin, Jr., \nand the letter dated October 17 from the California Family Support \nCouncil be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Child Support\n\n\n                                      Enforcement Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 2000.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: As President of the National Child \n     Support Enforcement Association (NCSEA), representing over \n     60,000 child support professionals across America, I'm \n     writing to urge you to support the Bankruptcy Reform Act of \n     2000 (Conference Report 106-970 accompanying HR 2415). This \n     legislation includes NCSEA's recommendations to restrict the \n     dischargeability of child support obligations. NCSEA is \n     committed to ensuring that both parents fulfill their \n     responsibilities to provide emotional and financial support \n     to their children--including honoring legally-owed child \n     support obligations. The pending legislation will forward \n     this goal significantly.\n       Specifically, NCSEA supports the child support bankruptcy \n     provisions that: (1) exempt mandated child support \n     enforcement tools from the effect of an automatic stay; (2) \n     eliminate the dischargeability of all child support debt and \n     treat all support debt in a similar manner; (3) give child \n     support debt a high priority in bankruptcy payment plans; and \n     (4) prevent confirmation of a bankruptcy plan or prevent \n     discharge if a debtor's support payments are not current \n     after a bankruptcy petition is filed.\n       Under current law, children are disadvantaged when the \n     parent who owes child support seeks protection in the \n     bankruptcy court. These families find themselves competing \n     with other creditors for the debtor-parent's limited assets. \n     Being on the losing end of this competition can have dire \n     economic consequences. The family may be forced to seek \n     public assistance. Families who have left welfare and are \n     struggling to make ends meet are especially vulnerable, as \n     illustrated by recent findings that for poor families not on \n     welfare, child support represents fully 35% of household \n     income, a critical supplement to the 48% earned from work.\n       The proposed bankruptcy reforms would also complement \n     current efforts, which your Administration strongly supports, \n     to distribute more child support to families rather than \n     retaining such collections as reimbursement for government \n     welfare benefits received. If bankruptcy reform is not \n     passed, these collections will continue to be distributed to \n     creditors ahead of the vulnerable families struggling to \n     responsibly support their children by working instead of \n     collecting welfare.\n       Back in the previous Congress, the same child support \n     provisions as in the present bankruptcy legislation failed to \n     be enacted when the overall bill (HR 3150) stalled due to \n     disagreements over other bankruptcy provisions. Attached is \n     the policy resolution NCSEA passed in 1998 supporting \n     bankruptcy reform that will strengthen the collection of \n     child support debt. The bill now under consideration \n     accomplishes the goals of our resolution. We urge you to \n     support the bill for that reason.\n       Thank you for your consideration. If you have questions, \n     please contact NCSEA's Government Relations Director, Ken \n     Laureys, at 202-624-5878 (klaureys@sso.org).\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Laura Kadwell,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S11642]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                          Western Interstate Child\n\n\n                                  Support Enforcement Council,\n\n                                     Austin, TX, October 18, 2000.\n     Re Bankruptcy reform conference report for H.R. 2415.\n\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As President of the Western Interstate \n     Child Support Enforcement Council (WICSEC), an organization \n     comprised of child support professionals from the private and \n     public sectors west of the Mississippi River, I would like to \n     express our membership's unqualified support of H.R. 2415. \n     The primary purpose of WICSEC is to ensure that child support \n     workers have effective enforcement tools to carry out our \n     mandated responsibility to establish and collect child \n     support. The passage of H.R. 2415 will greatly enhance our \n     efforts in this regard by establishing an equitable system of \n     debt repayment and discharge in bankruptcy proceedings.\n       The current structure of the bankruptcy process allows \n     child support obligors who file for protection under the \n     Bankruptcy Code to repay debts to customary collectors, but \n     does not hold them accountable for the ongoing financial \n     support of their children. The provisions of H.R. 2415 will \n     reprioritize the elements in bankruptcy plans by establishing \n     child support as the debtor's primary obligation, with all \n     other debts assuming a secondary role. As a result, our \n     nation's child support agencies will be able to pursue \n     collection efforts without encountering the restrictions \n     caused by existing bankruptcy proceedings.\n       We greatly appreciate your demonstrated support of \n     legislation which benefits families and children. At this \n     time, we respectfully ask you to continue that commitment by \n     signing H.R. 2415.\n           Sincerely.\n                                           Howard G. Baldwin, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            California Family Support Council,\n\n                                 Sacramento, CA, October 17, 2000.\n     Re Bankruptcy reform conference report for H.R. 2415.\n\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing you on behalf of the \n     California Family Support Council, an organization of \n     professionals who are responsible for carrying out the \n     federal child support program in California pursuant to Title \n     IV-D of the Social Security Act. Our membership consists of \n     approximately 2,500 persons employed by county and state \n     agencies which administer the program.\n       Support of the bankruptcy reform legislation by the Council \n     is reflected in the attached resolution, approved by the \n     general membership at our Annual Training Conference in \n     February of this year. It is based on our experience that \n     bankruptcy remains an impediment to our ability to collect \n     support and a haven for those who want to avoid their \n     familial obligations. Our membership feels strongly that this \n     legislation will strengthen substantially the child support \n     enforcement program and improve the collection of child \n     support.\n       Bankruptcy should no longer interfere with the payment of \n     collection of support. This legislation is the first major \n     revision of the treatment of support during bankruptcy since \n     the Banruptcy Code was enacted in 1978. We strongly urge you \n     to sign this legislation.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      Kris Reiman,\n                                                        President.\n\n         California Family Support Council 2000--Resolution II\n\n       Whereas the California Family Support Council is composed \n     of state and local professionals who have the responsibility \n     of operating the federal child support enforcement program in \n     the State of California; and\n       Whereas the filing of a bankruptcy petition by debtors \n     owing child support substantially impairs the ability of \n     government and private child support creditors to enforce \n     support obligations; and\n       Whereas the Bankruptcy Code conflicts in many significant \n     ways with federally mandated child support program \n     requirements; and\n       Whereas the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Act of 1996 provided child support obligees with \n     a new and considerable right to child support arrearages \n     which were previously assigned to the government, and under \n     current law these arrears are treated unfavorably in \n     bankruptcy; and\n       Whereas in 1999 both houses of Congress passed bankruptcy \n     reform bills, each of which contained child support \n     provisions which would accomplish the following:\n       a. Give support debts a very high priority in payment from \n     the bankruptcy estate;\n       b. Eliminate the distinction between support owed to a \n     spouse or parent and support assigned to the government;\n       c. Insure that support in any form would not be \n     dischargeable in bankruptcy;\n       d. Allow federally mandated support enforcement procedures \n     such as wage withholding orders, license revocations \n     processes, credit reporting, and medical support enforcement, \n     to be unaffected by automatic bankruptcy stays;\n       e. Eliminate the conflicts between provisions of the \n     Bankruptcy Code and the Social Security Act which affect the \n     treatment of a support arrearage debt; and\n       Whereas the California Family Support Council is on record \n     in support of both the House and Senate 1998 bankruptcy \n     reform bills; and\n       Whereas the support provisions were improved and \n     strengthened in the 1999 House and Senate Bankruptcy Reform \n     bills; and\n       Whereas the support provisions in the 1999 House and Senate \n     bills contain all improvements for collecting support during \n     bankruptcy as approved by the California Family Support \n     Council; now therefore be it\n       Resolved that the California Family Support Council:\n       1. Supports both the House and Senate Bankruptcy Reform \n     Bills as passed by their respective bodies; and\n       2. Urges the House and Senate to preserve the current child \n     support provisions in conference; and\n       3. Urges the President to sign the bankruptcy reform \n     legislation if the final conference report maintains the \n     current child support provisions; and\n       4. Directs the President of the California Family Support \n     Council to convey to the California Congressional Delegation \n     and to the President its enthusiastic endorsement of the \n     Bankruptcy Reform Bills.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, It has come to my attention that \na young man, Todd Porterfield, was struck by a car and killed over the \nsummer while he was participating in a philanthropy event for Pi Kappa \nPhi social fraternity, of which I am an alumnus. Todd, a senior at the \nUniversity of Washington, was on a cross-country bike ride called the \nJourney of Hope. Each year, the Journey of Hope raises approximately \n$300,000 for the national organization Push America that supports \npeople with disabilities. Todd's commitment to service was remarkable \nin someone so young. He not only helped lead philanthropy efforts \nwithin his fraternity, but also traveled to Mexico to build homes for \nthe disadvantaged and volunteered for three different shelters and \noutreach programs for the homeless in Seattle. Todd had a bright future \nand no doubt would have continued to be an active and caring member of \nhis community. My thoughts are with his friends and family, members of \nPi Kappa Phi fraternity and the University of Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/06/senate-section/article/S11642-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11642-S11643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-11744.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE OBLIGATION OF \n                   GRANTEE STATES TO ENSURE ACCESS TO POST-\n                   CONVICTION DNA TESTING AND COMPETENT COUNSEL IN \n                   CAPITAL CASES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) over the past decade, deoxyribo-nucleic acid testing \n     (referred to in this section as ``DNA testing'') has emerged \n     as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying \n     criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene;\n       (2) because of its scientific precision, DNA testing can, \n     in some cases, conclusively establish the guilt or innocence \n     of a criminal defendant;\n       (3) in other cases, DNA testing may not conclusively \n     establish guilt or innocence, but may have significant \n     probative value to a finder of fact;\n       (4) DNA testing was not widely available in cases tried \n     prior to 1994;\n       (5) new forensic DNA testing procedures have made it \n     possible to get results from minute samples that could not \n     previously be tested, and to obtain more informative and \n     accurate results than earlier forms of forensic DNA testing \n     could produce, resulting in some cases of convicted inmates \n     being exonerated by new DNA tests after earlier tests had \n     failed to produce definitive results;\n       (6) DNA testing can and has resulted in the post-conviction \n     exoneration of more than 75 innocent men and women, including \n     some under sentence of death;\n       (7) in more than a dozen cases, post-conviction DNA testing \n     that has exonerated an innocent person has also enhanced \n     public safety by providing evidence that led to the \n     apprehension of the actual perpetrator;\n       (8) experience has shown that it is not unduly burdensome \n     to make DNA testing available to inmates in appropriate \n     cases;\n       (9) under current Federal and State law, it is difficult to \n     obtain post-conviction DNA testing because of time limits on \n     introducing newly discovered evidence;\n       (10) the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence, \n     a Federal panel established by the Department of Justice and \n     comprised of law enforcement, judicial, and scientific \n     experts, has urged that post-conviction DNA testing be \n     permitted in the relatively small number of cases in which it \n     is appropriate, notwithstanding procedural rules that could \n     be invoked to preclude such testing, and notwithstanding the \n     inability of an inmate to pay for the testing;\n       (11) only a few States have adopted post-conviction DNA \n     testing procedures;\n       (12) States have received millions of dollars in DNA-\n     related grants, and more funding is needed to improve State \n     forensic facilities and to reduce the nationwide backlog of \n     DNA samples from convicted offenders and crime scenes that \n     need to be tested or retested using upgraded methods;\n       (13) States that accept such financial assistance should \n     not deny the promise of truth and justice for both sides of \n     our adversarial system that DNA testing offers;\n       (14) post-conviction DNA testing and other post-conviction \n     investigative techniques have shown that innocent people have \n     been sentenced to death in the United States;\n       (15) a constitutional error in capital cases is incompetent \n     defense lawyers who fail to present important evidence that \n     the defendant may have been innocent or does not deserve to \n     be sentenced to death; and\n       (16) providing quality representation to defendants facing \n     the loss of liberty or life is essential to fundamental due \n     process and the speedy final resolution of judicial \n     proceedings.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress should condition forensic science-related \n     grants to a State or State forensic facility on the State's \n     agreement to ensure post-conviction DNA testing in \n     appropriate cases; and\n       (2) Congress should work with the States to improve the \n     quality of legal representation in capital cases through the \n     establishment of standards that will assure the timely \n     appointment of competent counsel with adequate resources to \n     represent defendants\n\n[[Page S11644]]\n\n     in capital cases at each stage of those proceedings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       ALLARD AMENDMENT NO. 4360\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for Mr. Allard) proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. \n5630) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2001 for intelligence \nand intelligence-related activities of the United States Government, \nthe Community Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \nRetirement and Disability System, and for other purposes;

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the obligation of \n  grantee States to ensure access to post-conviction DNA testing and \n                  competent counsel in capital cases)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE OBLIGATION OF \n                   GRANTEE STATES TO ENSURE ACCESS TO POST-\n                   CONVICTION DNA TESTING AND COMPETENT COUNSEL IN \n                   CAPITAL CASES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) over the past decade, deoxyribo-nucleic acid testing \n     (referred to in this section as ``DNA testing'') has emerged \n     as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying \n     criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene;\n       (2) because of its scientific precision, DNA testing can, \n     in some cases, conclusively establish the guilt or innocence \n     of a criminal defendant;\n       (3) in other cases, DNA testing may not conclusively \n     establish guilt or innocence, but may have significant \n     probative value to a finder of fact;\n       (4) DNA testing was not widely available in cases tried \n     prior to 1994;\n       (5) new forensic DNA testing procedures have made it \n     possible to get results from minute samples that could not \n     previously be tested, and to obtain more informative and \n     accurate results than earlier forms of forensic DNA testing \n     could produce, resulting in some cases of convicted inmates \n     being exonerated by new DNA tests after earlier tests had \n     failed to produce definitive results;\n       (6) DNA testing can and has resulted in the post-conviction \n     exoneration of more than 75 innocent men and women, including \n     some under sentence of death;\n       (7) in more than a dozen cases, post-conviction DNA testing \n     that has exonerated an innocent person has also enhanced \n     public safety by providing evidence that led to the \n     apprehension of the actual perpetrator;\n       (8) experience has shown that it is not unduly burdensome \n     to make DNA testing available to inmates in appropriate \n     cases;\n       (9) under current Federal and State law, it is difficult to \n     obtain post-conviction DNA testing because of time limits on \n     introducing newly discovered evidence;\n       (10) the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence, \n     a Federal panel established by the Department of Justice and \n     comprised of law enforcement, judicial, and scientific \n     experts, has urged that post-conviction DNA testing be \n     permitted in the relatively small number of cases in which it \n     is appropriate, notwithstanding procedural rules that could \n     be invoked to preclude such testing, and notwithstanding the \n     inability of an inmate to pay for the testing;\n       (11) only a few States have adopted post-conviction DNA \n     testing procedures;\n       (12) States have received millions of dollars in DNA-\n     related grants, and more funding is needed to improve State \n     forensic facilities and to reduce the nationwide backlog of \n     DNA samples from convicted offenders and crime scenes that \n     need to be tested or retested using upgraded methods;\n       (13) States that accept such financial assistance should \n     not deny the promise of truth and justice for both sides of \n     our adversarial system that DNA testing offers;\n       (14) post-conviction DNA testing and other post-conviction \n     investigative techniques have shown that innocent people have \n     been sentenced to death in the United States;\n       (15) a constitutional error in capital cases is incompetent \n     defense lawyers who fail to present important evidence that \n     the defendant may have been innocent or does not deserve to \n     be sentenced to death; and\n       (16) providing quality representation to defendants facing \n     the loss of liberty or life is essential to fundamental due \n     process and the speedy final resolution of judicial \n     proceedings.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress should condition forensic science-related \n     grants to a State or State forensic facility on the State's \n     agreement to ensure post-conviction DNA testing in \n     appropriate cases; and\n\n[[Page S11646]]\n\n       (2) Congress should work with the States to improve the \n     quality of legal representation in capital cases through the \n     establishment of standards that will assure the timely \n     appointment of competent counsel with adequate resources to \n     represent defendants in capital cases at each stage of those \n     proceedings.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4359) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to hail the impending passage \nof H.R. 4640--the DNA Backlog Elimination Act. This is a House \ncompanion bill to S. 903--the Violent Offender DNA Identification Act \nof 1999--which I introduced with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator \nKohl.\n  While existing anticrime technology can allow us to solve many \nviolent crimes that occur in our communities, in order for this \ntechnology to work, it must be used. I have been a longtime advocate \nfor use of the Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS), which serves as a \nnational DNA data base to profile convicted offender DNA. In fact, \nduring consideration of the Anti-Terriorism Act of 1996, I proposed a \nprovision under which Federal convicted offenders' DNA would be \nincluded in CODIS. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice never \nimplemented this law, though currently all 50 States collect DNA from \nconvicted offenders.\n  One of the purposes of this legislation is to expressly require the \ncollection of DNA samples from federally convicted felons and military \npersonnel convicted of similar offenses. Collection of convicted \noffender DNA is crucial to solving many of the crimes occurring in our \ncommunities. Statistics show that many of these violent felons will \nrepeat their crimes once they are back in society. Since the Federal \nGovernment does not collect DNA from these felons, however, the ability \nof law enforcement to rapidly identify likely suspects is slowed. \nCollection of such data is critical.\n  The case of Mrs. Debbie Smith of Virginia underscores the importance \nof collection of DNA from convicted offenders. Debbie Smith was at her \nhome in the middle of the day when a masked intruder entered her \nunlocked back door. Her husband, a police lieutenant, was upstairs \nsleeping. The stranger blindfolded Mrs. Smith and took her to a wooded \narea behind her house where he robbed and repeatedly raped her. After \nwarning Mrs. Smith not to tell, the assailant let her go. She told her \nhusband, who reported the incident, then took her to the hospital where \nevidence was collected for DNA analysis.\n  Debbie Smith's rape experience was so terrible that she contemplated \ntaking her own life. She continued to live in constant fear until 6\\1/\n2\\ years later when a State crime laboratory found a CODIS match with \nan inmate then serving in jail for abduction and robbery. In fact, the \noffender was jailed on another offense 1 month after raping her. There \nare thousands of other crimes the DNA database can solve. With CODIS we \ncan grant countless victims, like Mrs. Smith, peace of mind and bring \ntheir attackers swiftly to justice.\n  We need to do everything we can to make sure law enforcement has \naccess to these tools. A major obstacle facing State and local crime \nlaboratories are the backlogs of convicted offender samples. The \nFederal Bureau of Investigation estimates that there are almost one-\nhalf million convicted offender samples in State and local laboratories \nawaiting analysis. Increasing demand for DNA analysis in active cases, \nand limited resources, are reducing the ability of State and local \ncrime laboratories to analyze their convicted offender backlogs. While \nI introduced, and Congress passed, the Crime Identification Technology \nAct of 1998 to address the long-term needs of crime laboratories, many \ncrime laboratories need immediate assistance to address their short-\nterm backlogs that will help law enforcement solve crime.\n  H.R. 4640 would provide $170 million over 4 years to help State and \nlocal crime laboratories address their convicted offender backlogs. \nViolent criminals should not be able to evade responsibility simply \nbecause a State lacks the resources to analyze their DNA samples, or \nbecause a loophole excludes certain Federal offenders from our national \ndatabase. This legislation will be a huge asset for our local law \nenforcers in their day-to-day fight against crime.\n  I thank Representative McCollum for his efforts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the past decade DNA analysis has \nemerged as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying \ncriminals when biological material is left at a crime scene. Because of \nits scientific precision, DNA testing can, in some cases, conclusively \nestablish a suspect's guilt or innocence. In other cases, DNA testing \nmay not conclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have \nsignificant probative value for investigators.\n  While DNA's power to root out the truth has been a boon to law \nenforcement, it has also been the salvation of law enforcement's \nmistakes--those who for one reason or another, are prosecuted and \nconvicted of crimes that they did not commit. In more than 75 cases in \nthe United States and Canada, DNA evidence has led to the exoneration \nof innocent men and women who were wrongfully convicted. This number \nincludes at least 9 individuals sentenced to death, some of whom came \nwithin days of being executed. In more than a dozen cases, moreover, \npost-conviction DNA testing that has exonerated an innocent person has \nalso enhanced public safety by providing evidence that led to the \napprehension of the real perpetrator.\n  Clearly, DNA testing is critical to the effective administration of \njustice in 21st century America.\n  As DNA testing has moved to the front lines of the war on crime, our \nNation's forensic labs have experienced a significant increase in their \ncaseloads, both in number and complexity. In the six years since \nCongress established the Combined DNA Index System. States have been \nbusy collecting DNA samples from convicted offenders for analysis and \nindexing. Increased Federal funding for State and local law enforcement \nprograms has resulted in more and better trained police officers who \nare collecting immense amounts of evidence that can and should be \nsubjected to crime laboratory analysis.\n  Funding has simply not kept pace with this increasing demand, and \nState crime laboratories are now seriously bottlenecked. Backlogs have \nimpeded the use of new technologies like DNA testing in solving cases \nwithout suspects--and reexamining cases in which there are strong \nclaims of innocence --as laboratories are required to give priority \nstatus to those cases in which a suspect is known. In some parts of the \ncountry, investigators must wait several months--and sometimes more \nthan a year--to get DNA test results from rape and other violent crime \nevidence. Solely for lack of funding, critical evidence remains \nuntested while rapists and killers remain at large, victims continue to \nanguish, and statutes of limitation on prosecution expire.\n  Let me describe the situation in my home State. The Vermont Forensics \nLaboratory is currently operating in an old Vermont State Hospital \nbuilding in Waterbury, Vermont. Though it is proudly one of only two \nfully-accredited forensics labs in New England, it is trying to do 21st \ncentury science in a 1940's building. The lab has very limited space \nand no central climate control--both essential conditions for precise \nforensic science. It also has a large storage freezer full of untested \nDNA evidence from unsolved cases, for which there are no other leads \nbesides the untested evidence. The evidence is not being processed \nbecause the lab does not have the space, equipment or manpower.\n\n  I commend the scientists and lab personnel at the Vermont Forensics \nLaboratory for the fine work they do everyday under difficult \ncircumstances. But the people of the State of Vermont deserve better. \nThis is our chance to provide them with the resources they deserve.\n  Passage of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, H.R. \n4640, will give States like Vermont the help they desperately need to \nreduce the backlog of untested crime scene evidence from unsolved \ncrimes and untested convicted offender samples. It allocates $170 \nmillion over the next four years for grants to States to increase the \ncapacity of their forensic laboratories and carry out DNA analyses of \nbacklogged evidence. Senator Schumer and\n\n[[Page S11647]]\n\nI have pressed for increased appropriations for these purposes. This \nauthorization bill is a step in the right direction.\n  In addition to the problem of unanalyzed crime scene and convicted \noffender evidence, there is an urgent need to address the gap in \ncoverage of the national DNA index that has left out Federal, military, \nand District of Columbia offenders. The inability to include these \noffenders in the national index has seriously frustrated efforts to \nsolve crimes and prevent further crimes. The bill that the Senate \npasses today eliminates the gap in coverage by authorizing the Bureau \nof Prisons and other Federal agencies to collect, analyze, and index \nDNA samples from individuals who have been convicted of Federal \noffenses of a violent or sexual nature. The bill also authorizes needed \nfunding for these purposes, which Senator Schumer and I have been \nworking to include in this years' appropriations bills.\n  While I support H.R. 4640, I believe it falls short in one critical \nrespect: It fails to address the urgent need to increase access to DNA \ntesting for prisoners who were convicted before this truth-seeking \ntechnology became widely available. Prosecutors and law enforcement \nofficers across the country use DNA testing to prove guilt, and rightly \nso. By the same token, however, it should be used to do what is equally \nscientifically reliable to do--prove innocence.\n  I was greatly heartened earlier this month when the Governor of \nVirginia finally pardoned Earl Washington, after new DNA tests \nconfirmed what earlier DNA tests had shown: He was the wrong guy. He \nwas the 88th wrong guy discovered on death row since the reinstatement \nof capital punishment. His case only goes to show that we cannot sit \nback and assume that prosecutors and courts will do the right thing \nwhen it comes to DNA. It took Earl Washington years to convince \nprosecutors to do the very simple tests that would prove his innocence, \nand more time still to win a pardon. And he is still in prison today.\n  States like Virginia continue to stonewall on requests for DNA \ntesting. They continue to hide behind time limits and procedural \ndefault rules to deny prisoners the right to present DNA test results \nin court. They are still destroying the DNA evidence that could set \ninnocent people free. These sorts of practices must stop. We should not \npass up the promise of truth and justice for both sides of our \nadversarial system that DNA evidence offers.\n\n  By passing H.R. 4640, we substantially increase funding to increase \nthe capacity of State and local forensic labs to carry out DNA analysis \nof crime scene evidence and convicted offender samples. That is an \nappropriate use of Federal funds. But we at least ought to require that \nthis truth-seeking technology be made available to both sides.\n  I proposed a modest Sense of Congress amendment to H.R. 4640, which \nthe Senate is passing today. It describes how DNA testing can and has \nresulted in the post-conviction exoneration of scores of innocent men \nand women, including some under sentence of death, and expresses the \nsense of Congress that we should condition forensic science-related \ngrants to a State or State forensic facility on the State's agreement \nto ensure post-conviction DNA testing in appropriate cases. Because \npost-conviction DNA testing has shown that innocent people are \nsentenced to death in this country with alarming frequency, and because \nthe most common constitutional error in capital cases is egregiously \nincompetent defense lawyering, my amendment also calls on Congress to \nwork with the States to improve the quality of legal representation in \ncapital cases through the establishment of counsel standards.\n  I introduced legislation in this Congress that would have \naccomplished both of these things. The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 \ncontains meaningful reforms that I believe could save innocent lives. \nAs the 106th Congress winds down, we have 14 cosponsors in the Senate, \nand about 80 in the House. We have Democratic and Republican \ncosponsors, supporters of the death penalty and opponents. President \nClinton, Vice President Gore, and Attorney General Reno have all \nexpressed support for the bill.\n  Tragically, real reform of our nation's capital punishment system \nfoundered on the shoals of election-year politics. But with the Sense \nof Congress provision that we pass today, at least we have agreed on a \nblueprint for effective reform legislation in the 107th Congress.\n  The law enforcement issues addressed by H.R. 4640 are important, but \nas FBI Director Louis Freeh has acknowledged, ``Post-conviction relief \nis an equally important issue that requires a solution.'' In a recent \nletter, Director Freeh pledged to work with me on post-conviction \nrelief issues in the next Congress and I look forward to working with \nthe Director.\n  Each day that DNA evidence goes uncollected and untested, solvable \ncrimes remain unsolved, and people across the country are needlessly \nvictimized. I hope that the House will move quickly to pass H.R. 4640 \nas amended before it winds up its work for the year.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 4640, the \nDNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, which is the companion \nbill to my Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999. This \nbipartisan measure will put more criminals behind bars by correcting \npractical and legal shortcomings that leave too much crucial DNA \nevidence unused and too many violent crimes unsolved.\n  Currently, all 50 states require DNA samples to be obtained from \ncertain convicted offenders, and these samples increasingly can be \nshared through a national DNA database established by Federal law. This \nnational database--part of the Combined Database Index System (CODIS)--\nenables law enforcement officials to link DNA evidence found at a crime \nscene with any suspect whose DNA is already on file. By identifying \nrepeat offenders, this DNA sharing can and does make a difference. \nAlready the FBI reports that almost 1400 investigations have been aided \nby the DNA database, solving numerous crimes. And in my home state of \nWisconsin, experience proves that DNA ``sharing'' pays off. In fact, \njust a week before the statute of limitations ran out in a multiple \nrape investigation, DNA matching helped identify a serial rapist \nresponsible for three rapes in Kenosha and a fourth in Racine. As a \nresult, he's currently serving an 80-year sentence. Without DNA \ndatabases, suspects like this otherwise might never be discovered--or \nconvicted.\n  As valuable as this system is, it is not as effective as it could--or \nshould--be. The effectiveness of the database is directly related to \nthe number of DNA profiles it contains. For every 1,000 new profiles, \nwe can expect to find at least one match, and with every new profile \nadded, the odds for a match increase. However, there are currently two \nmajor obstacles to the effective functioning of the database. Our \nmeasure would correct these problems and make the database far more \nproductive.\n  First, thousands of DNA samples that have already been collected \nstill must be analyzed before they can be entered into the national \ndatabase. The FBI estimates that there is a backlog of over 700,000 DNA \nsamples from convicted offenders languishing, unanalyzed, in state \ncrime laboratories for simple lack of funding.\n  Our measure will reduce the backlog of unanalyzed samples by \nproviding the funding necessary to analyze them and put them ``on-\nline.'' It provides $45 million over three years to erase the backlog \nof the 700,000 unanalyzed samples and the almost-as-pressing backlog of \napproximately 220,000 more samples that need to be reanalyzed using \nstate-of-the-art methods.\n  Indeed, easing this backlog was the lead recommendation of the \nNational Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence appointed by the \nAttorney General. As the Commission explained, ``the power of the CODIS \nprogram lies in the sheer numbers of convicted offender samples that \nare processed and entered into the database.''\n  Second, for some inexplicable reason, we do not collect samples from \nFederal and D.C. offenders. So while the database can identify a \nsuspect whose DNA is on file in one of the 50 states, it generally \nwon't catch a Federal or D.C. offender. Under current law, that suspect \nwill not be identified; his crime may not be solved; and he could get \noff scot-free. We thought we already closed this loophole through 1996 \nlegislation which provides that the FBI ``may expand\n\n[[Page S11648]]\n\n[the database] to include Federal crimes and crimes committed in the \nDistrict of Columbia,'' but Federal officials claim more express \nauthority is necessary. We are not so sure they're right, but there is \nno need to wait any longer.\n\n  Our measure closes once and for all this loophole that allows DNA \nsamples from Federal (including military) and Washington, D.C. \noffenders to go uncollected. Under our proposal, DNA samples would be \nobtained from any Federal offender--or any D.C. offender under Federal \ncustody or supervision--convicted of a violent crime or other \nqualifying offense. And it would require the collection of samples from \njuveniles found delinquent under Federal law for conduct that would \nconstitute a violent crime if committed by an adult. Our proposal was \nprepared with the assistance of the FBI, the Administrative Office of \nthe U.S. Courts, the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Parole Commission, \nagencies within the District of Columbia responsible for supervision of \nreleased felons, and the Department of Defense.\n  Modern crime-fighting technology like DNA testing and DNA databases \nmake law enforcement much more effective. But in order to take full \nadvantage of these valuable resources, we need this measure to make the \ndatabase as comprehensive--and as productive--as possible. Violent \ncriminals should not be able to evade arrest simply because a state \ndidn't analyze its DNA samples or because an inexcusable loophole \nleaves Federal and D.C. offenders out of the DNA database. This measure \nwill ensure that we apprehend violent repeat offenders, regardless of \nwhether they originally violated state, Federal or D.C. law. And, by \ncollecting more DNA evidence and utilizing the best of DNA technology, \nwe also can help exonerate individual suspects whose DNA does not match \nwith particular crime scenes.\n  Mr. President, this measure will help police use modern technology to \nsolve crimes and prevent repeat offenders from committing new ones. Let \nme credit Senators DeWine, Hatch, Leahy and Congressman McCollum for \ntheir hard work which is finally paying off.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4640), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/06/senate-section/article/S11648-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11648-S11649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ICCVAM AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of H.R. 4281, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4281) to establish, wherever feasible, \n     guidelines, recommendations, and regulations that promote the \n     regulatory acceptance of new or revised scientifically valid \n     toxicological tests that protect human and animal health and \n     the environment while reducing, refining, or replacing animal \n     tests and ensuring human safety and product effectiveness.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to support passage of H.R. \n4281, the ``ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000.'' This bill would make \npermanent the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of \nAlternative Methods, otherwise known as ``ICCVAM.'' Doing so would give \ncompanies and federal agencies a sense of certainty and would encourage \nthem to make the long-term research investments necessary to develop \nnew, revised, and alternative toxicology test methods for ICCVAM to \nreview. This would decrease and ultimately could lead to the end of \nanimal use in testing shampoos, pesticides, and other products, while \nensuring that human safety and product effectiveness remain protected.\n  ICCVAM was created pursuant to the 1993 National Institutes of Health \nRevitalization Act's mandate that the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) recommend new processes for \nfederal agencies' acceptance of new, revised, or alternative toxicology \ntest methods. ICCVAM is composed of representatives of various federal \nagencies that use or regulate the use of animals in toxicity testing.\n  ICCVAM evaluates and recommends improved test methods and makes it \npossible for more uniform testing to be adopted across federal \nagencies. Ultimately, ICCVAM streamlines the test method validation and \napproval process by evaluating methods of interest to multiple \nagencies, thus reducing the need for companies to perform multiple \nanimal tests to meet the requirements of different federal agencies. \nThis bill and ICCVAM do not apply to regulations related to medical \nresearch.\n  Recent advances in analytical chemistry and computer modeling have \ncreated new opportunities for the development of more accurate, faster, \nand less expensive test methods--methods that use fewer animals or \nbypass the need to use any animals in toxicity testing. This is a \n``win-win'' situation for the public, industry, animal protection \ngroups, and agencies.\n  This is a truly bipartisan and cooperative effort among industry, \nanimal protection groups, and various federal agencies. It simply makes \nsense to make permanent a process that is currently working so well. \nThis bill is supported by the Doris Day Animal League, Procter & \nGamble, the Colgate-Palmolive Company, the Humane Society, the American \nHumane Association, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of \nCruelty to Animals, the Gillette Company, the Chemical Specialties \nManufacturers Association, the American Chemistry Council, the Soap and \nDetergent Association, the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers \nAssociation, and the American Crop Protection Association.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy, Murray, Smith of New Hampshire, Abraham, \nSantorum, and Boxer for their support of ICCVAM and for their work in \nthis bipartisan effort. I also thank Chairman Jeffords for his help in \nmoving forward the Senate counterpart bill I introduced--S. 1495--upon \nwhich we based our bipartisan negotiations.\n\n\n chemical testing programs and creating a scientific advisory committee\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of my colleague from \nOhio, Mr. DeWine on S. 1495, the ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000, and \nwas pleased to cosponsor that legislation. The measure will help ensure \nthat we improve the review of chemical test methods employed by federal \nagencies with the ultimate goal of reducing the unnecessary use of \nanimals in testing.\n  The bill we consider here today is the House-passed version, H.R. \n4281, which is somewhat different than S. 1495. Would the Senator from \nOhio be willing to clarify a few important points about this \nlegislation for our colleagues?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would be pleased to clarify aspects of \nthis legislation for my colleagues.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am concerned that this legislation could be used to \ndelay the EPA's chemical testing programs including the proposed \nEndocrine Disruptor Screening Program, the agency's children's health \ntesting initiatives, and EPA's pesticide registration/re-registration \nprocess. Can my colleague from Ohio assure me that nothing in this bill \nis intended to prevent or slow the implementation of existing statutory \nmandates under the Food Quality Protection Act and the Safe Drinking \nWater Act for these important programs?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I can assure my colleague from Montana that nothing in \nthis legislation is intended to prevent or slow the implementation of \nexisting statutory mandates under the FQPA and SDWA.\n  In fact, the EPA is currently exercising its discretion to submit \ntest methods to be used in the EDSP to the ICCVAM for assessment of \nvalidation. Nothing in this legislation challenges a Federal agency's \nauthority to choose which screens and tests to send to ICCVAM for \nreview, and an agency's decision whether to refer a test to ICCVAM and \nwhether to follow ICCVAM recommendations is within the agency's \ndiscretion.\n  Furthermore, the bill will not have an impact on existing animal \ntests in existing federal regulatory programs. Its goal is to \nfacilitate the appropriate validation of new, revised and alternative \ntest methods for future use. using the ICCVAM to assess validation of \nthese test methods can streamline\n\n[[Page S11649]]\n\nindividual assessment by multiple agencies and enhance the scientific \nvalidity of these programs, thereby better protecting public health, \nand ensuring that laboratory animals used in these programs are not \nused in vain.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have one additional question for my colleague from \nOhio. The legislation also creates a Scientific Advisory Committee, \nSAC, to advise ICCVAM, and provides that the SAC should be comprised of \nat least one representative from industry and one representative of a \nnational animal protection organization.\n  My understanding of this provision is that it is not exclusive, and \nthat the SAC will also include at least one representative from the \nenvironmental community and one member from the public health community \nas equal voting members. I along with my colleague from Montana view \nthis issue of equal representation as essential to this legislation.\n  Can we have the commitment of the Senator from Ohio that at least one \nvoting member of the SAC will be from the environmental or public \nhealth community?\n  Mr. DeWINE. The Senator from California is correct that this \nprovision is not meant to be exclusive, and she has my commitment this \nis the intent of this legislation and that the SAC can be comprised of \nat least one voting member from the environmental and one voting member \nfrom the public health community, in addition to the other members \nexplicitly specified in the legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4281) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/06/senate-section/article/S11649-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11649-S11651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4360) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am disappointed, but perhaps not \nsurprised, to be back on the floor with the Intelligence Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2001.\n  After 8 years of subordinating national security to political \nconcerns, the Clinton-Gore administration now exits on a similar note. \nThree days before the election, in the face of hysterical, largely \ninaccurate, but extremely well-timed media lobbying blitz, the \nPresident overruled his national security experts and vetoed this bill \nover a provision designed to reduce damaging leaks of classified \nnational security information.\n  Ironically, the White House--with the full knowledge of Chief of \nStaff John Podesta--had previously signed off on section 304 of the \nIntelligence bill, the anti ``leaks'' provision that prompted the veto. \nSection 304, which has been public since May and which represents the \nproduct of extensive consultations with the Justice Department and the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, would have filled gaps in existing law by \ngiving the Justice Department new authority to prosecute all \nunauthorized disclosures of classified information.\n  Section 304 and the rest of the intelligence authorization bill were \nunanimously approved by the Intelligence Committee on April 27, and \nadopted by the full Senate without dissent on October 2. The \nPresident's Executive Office submitted to the Congress a ``Statement of \nAdministration Policy'' in support of the leaks provision. The \nconference report was adopted by the Senate on October 12.\n  Let me take a minute to explain why the committee decided, after \nextensive consultations with the Justice Department, to adopt this \nprovision.\n  While current law bars unauthorized disclosure of certain categories \nof information, for example, cryptographic or national defense \ninformation, many other sensitive intelligence and diplomatic secrets \nare not protected. And the U.S. Government, in the words of Director of \nCentral Intelligence George Tenet, ``leaks like a sieve.''\n  While leakers seldom if ever face consequences for leaks, our \nintelligence professionals do. These range from the very real risks to \nthe lives and freedom of U.S. intelligence officers and their sources, \nto the compromise of sensitive and sometimes irreplaceable intelligence \ncollection methods. Human or technical, these sources won't be there to \nwarn of the next terrorist attack, crisis, or war.\n  If someone who is providing us intelligence on terrorist plans or \nforeign missile programs asks, ``If I give you this information, can \nyou protect it,'' the honest answer is often ``no.'' So they may \nrethink, reduce, or even end their cooperation. Leaks also alienate \nfriendly intelligence services and make them think twice before sharing \nsensitive information, as the National Commission on Terrorism recently \nconcluded.\n  Some of section 304's opponents downplay the seriousness of leaks \ncompared to traditional espionage. Yet leaks can be even more damaging. \nWhere a spy generally serves one customer, media leaks are available to \nanyone with 25 cents to buy the Washington Post, or access to an \nInternet connection.\n  As important as what this legislation does is what it doesn't do. \nMedia organizations and others have conjured up a parade of dire \nconsequences that would ensue if section 304 had become law. Yet this \ncarefully drafted provision would not have silenced whistle blowers, \nwho would continue to enjoy current statutory protections, including \nthose governing the disclosure of classified information to appropriate \ncongressional oversight committees. Having led the move to enact \nwhistleblower protection for intelligence community employees, I am \nextremely sensitive to this concern.\n  It would not have criminalized mistakes: the provision would have \napplied only in cases where unauthorized disclosures are made both \nwillfully and knowingly. That means that the person both intends and \nunderstands the nature of the act. Mistakes could not be prosecuted \nsince they are, by definition, neither willful nor knowing.\n  It would not have eroded first amendment rights. In particular, \nsection 304 is not an Official Secrets Act, as some critics have \nalleged. Britain's Official Secrets Act authorizes the prosecution of \njournalists who publish classified information. Section 304, on the \nother hand, criminalizes the actions of persons who are charged with \nprotecting classified information, not those who receive or publish it. \nEven under existing statutes, the Department of Justice rarely seeks to \ninterview or subpoena journalists when investigating leaks. In fact, \nthere has never been a prosecution of a journalist under existing \nespionage or unauthorized disclosure statutes, despite the fact that \nsome of these current laws criminalize the actions of those who receive \nclassified information without proper authorization.\n\n[[Page S11650]]\n\n  Critics also cite--correctly--the Government's tendency to \noverclassify information, especially embarrassing information, the \ndisclosure of which would not damage national security, the standard \nfor classification. But these practices are already prohibited under \nthe current Executive order on classification, E.O. 12958, which not \nonly provides a procedure for government employees to challenge a \nclassification determination they believe to be improper, but \nencourages them to do so.\n  The real issue is: who decides what should be classified? With \ncommendable honesty, critic Steven Aftergood of the Federation of \nAmerican Scientists went beyond ritual denunciation to spell out his \nreal concern: Section 304, as he told the Washington Post, ``turns over \nto the executive branch the right to determine what will be \nprotected.''\n  In fact, designated officials within the executive branch have always \nexercised that authority. What Mr. Aftergood and the media want is to \narrogate that authority to themselves and their sources. While \ndesignated classification officials may err, they--not disgruntled mid-\nlevel employees--are the ones charged under our laws and procedures \nwith balancing the protection of our nation's secrets with the need for \ngovernment openness.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that President Clinton chose to veto \nthe Intelligence Authorization Act over this provision, and I am \nespecially disappointed at the manner in which this occurred.\n  I believe, however, that it is in our national interest that the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 be enacted into \nlaw. Therefore, the bill before the Senate is identical to the \nconference report vetoed by the President, but for the ``leaks'' \nprovision.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last month the Senate and House \napproved the conference report to the fiscal year 2001 intelligence \nauthorization bill. Title VIII of the conference report is based on \nlegislation I introduced along with Senators Wellstone, Grams, Boxer, \nLevin, and Hatch that would create an interagency process to declassify \nrecords on activities of the Japanese Imperial Government. \nSpecifically, title VIII is based on the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure \nAct, a law written by my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator \nDeWine, and our House colleague from new York, Representative Carolyn \nMaloney. This law requires the federal government to search through its \nrecords and disclose any classified materials it has on Nazi war \ncrimes, the Nazi Holocaust and the looting of assets and property by \nthe Nazis. Leading what has become the largest declassification of U.S. \ngovernment records in American history is the Nazi War Criminal Records \nInteragency Working Group, or IWG, which consists of representatives of \nkey government departments and agencies and three public members \nappointed by the President. The work done by the IWG and a team of \nhistorians and experts at the National Archives has been nothing less \nthan extraordinary. However, the law only gives the IWG just until the \nend of next year to complete this enormous task. After discussing this \nwith the Senator from Ohio, we agreed that the best course of action \nwas to extend the authorization of the existing IWG until the end of \n2003, and give it additional authority to oversee the declassification \nof Japanese Imperial Government records. In that way, the IWG will be \nable to undertake an effort to search through U.S. Government records \nand disclose any classified materials it has on the Japanese Imperial \nGovernment similar to the declassification effort underway on Nazi war \ncrimes. In addition, we also thought it was important to ensure that \nthe IWG had a funding authorization to carry out its activities, \nincluding the preservation of records that are being declassified. I \nsee the Senator from Ohio on the floor, and I ask if he has anything he \nwishes to add at this point.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Senator from California for her comments. She \nis correct. The Nazi War Criminal Records IWG has done an outstanding \njob. It only made sense, given the work the IWG already has done, to \nexplicitly expand its current requirements to cover activities of the \nJapanese Imperial Government. Mr. President, I see the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the floor, \nand would like to ask the chairman if the provisions of title VIII \napply only to the work done by the IWG with respect to the \ndeclassification of records exclusively relating to the Japanese \nImperial Government?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator from Ohio is correct. The House and Senate \nintelligence committees agreed to combine the working groups for both \nthe Nazi and Japanese Imperial Government declassifications in order to \nobtain economies of scale from both a substantive and financial \nperspective. However, the requirements set forth in the Japanese \nImperial Government Disclosure Act in no way impact on the requirements \nset forth in the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act.\n  Mr. DeWINE. It is my assessment that title VIII does not change any \nof the provisions in the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act that govern the \ndeclassification of records required under that Act, most notably but \nnot limited to Nazi war crimes committed in the European theater of \nwar, including Northern Africa. Therefore, title VIII refers only to \nactivities exclusively of the Japanese Imperial Government and does not \nattempt to change any procedures relating to the declassification of \nall records under section 3(a)(1) and (2) of the Nazi War Crimes \nDisclosure Act.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I agree with the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the chairman for this clarification. I understand \nthe Senator from California also would like to clarify several points \nin title VIII, so I yield to her.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Ohio and also thank the \nchairman for taking the time to clarify title VIII. Specifically, would \nthe chairman agree that the records covered in this title are U.S. \nGovernment records?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes. Title VIII covers any still-classified U.S. \nGovernment records that are related to crimes committee by the Japanese \nImperial Government during World War II.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As I understand it, the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure \nAct effectively creates a process of review of records, and then a \nprocess to determine which of these records are to be declassified \nunder the criteria provided in the act. The act contains exceptions \nthat could be cited to justify a decision not to declassify. However, \nthese exceptions apply only to decisions relating to declassification, \nand are not to be used as a reason to not review records for relevancy. \nAs the author of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, would the Senator \nof Ohio agree with my interpretation?\n  Mr. DeWINE. The Senator from California is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. With that said, some people have raised concerns that \nthe removal of the National Security Act of 1947 exemption in title \nVIII, which was included in the original legislation, could impede the \nability of the IWG in its declassification efforts. It is my \nunderstanding, however, that the intent of title VIII, like the Nazi \nWar Crimes Disclosure Act, requires all U.S. Government classified \nrecords be reviewed for relevancy, including intelligence records. Is \nthat also the understanding of the chairman of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Under title VIII, all still-classified records likely to \ncontain such information should be surveyed to determine if they \ncontain relevant information. If records are found to contain \ninformation related to actions by the Japanese Imperial Government \nduring the Second World War, those records would be reviewed for \ndeclassification by the IWG under the criteria provided in the title. \nHowever, in the interests of safeguarding legitimate national security \ninterests, the Director of Central Intelligence still maintains the \ndiscretion to protect the disclosure of operational files under section \n701 of the National Security Act of 1947. Given the nature and age of \nthe files it is unlikely he will need to exercise this authority. Title \nVIII requires an agency head who determines that one of the exceptions \nfor disclosure applies to notify the appropriate congressional \ncommittees of a determination that disclosure and release of records \nwould be harmful to a specific interest. It is the intent of title VIII \nthat the IWG will be able to undertake an effort to search through U.S. \nGovernment records and disclose classified\n\n[[Page S11651]]\n\nmaterials under statutory guidelines regarding the activities of the \nJapanese Imperial Government during the Second World War.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished chairman for his \nclarification of the language contained in the conference report.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering H.R. 3048, the Presidential Threat Protection Act. This is \nimportant legislation that will benefit both the Secret Service and the \nMarshals Service, and I hope it becomes law without further delay.\n  I have fought this entire year to pass legislation that will help the \nMarshals Service place an increased focus on fighting dangerous \nfugitives. It has been estimated that 50 percent of the crime in \nAmerica is caused by 5 percent of the offenders. It is these hard-core, \nrepeat criminals, many of whom are fugitives, that law enforcement must \naddress today. As we discussed at a hearing that I chaired earlier this \nyear before the Judiciary Criminal Justice Oversight Subcommittee on \nthis matter, the number of dangerous fugitives is rising, even as crime \nrates continue to decline. There are over 525,000 felony or other \nserious Federal and State fugitives listed in the database of the \nNational Crime Information Center. This number has doubled just since \n1987.\n  The act we are considering today helps make these criminals a top \npriority by requiring the Attorney General to establish permanent \nfugitive apprehension task forces to be run by the Marshals Service. \nThe task forces will be a combined effort of Federal and State law \nenforcement agencies, each bringing their own expertise to this \ncritical task.\n  These task forces will operate across district lines in the areas of \nthe country where the problem is most acute. They will be operated by \nthe Marshals Service as a national effort, rather than through \nparticular districts, so that other activities cannot interfere in \nthese efforts to apprehend fugitives. Also, the task forces should not \nduplicate existing fugitive work of the Marshals Service or other \nFederal and State law enforcement agencies. Moreover, as was discussed \nduring our hearing on this matter, they should work closely with other \ngovernment agencies. Everyone who is involved in or can contribute to \nfugitive apprehension must work together to make these specialized \nfugitive initiatives efficient and effective.\n  H.R. 3048 provides important, limited administrative subpoena \nauthority for the Secret Service to track down those who threaten the \nPresident. I worked hard this year to try to create similar \nadministrative subpoena authority for the Department of Justice to \nbetter enable the Marshals Service and others to locate fugitives.\n  In the Senate, we passed S. 2516, the Fugitive Apprehension Act, \nwhich I sponsored, as a free-standing bill to accomplish this task. \nLater, in the Senate, we also passed a more limited version of S. 2516 \nas part of H.R. 3048. I thought it was most appropriate that we expand \nadministrative subpoena authority as part of one combined bill.\n  Unfortunately, the House did not include the administrative subpoena \nauthority for fugitives when passing H.R. 3048 again last week. Some \nclaims were made about the fugitive subpoena authority late in the \nsession that were misinformed or incorrect. We worked closely with our \ncounterparts in the House and tried very hard to alleviate any \nlegitimate concerns by narrowing the scope of the bill and creating \neven more checks on its use. However, we were not fully able to reach a \nconsensus on this provision this year. We must continue our efforts in \nthe next Congress.\n  Subpoena authority has existed for years to help authorities \ninvestigate drug offenses, child abuse, and even health care fraud. \nAfter H.R. 3048 passes, the authority will also exist regarding certain \nthreats against the President. As law enforcement continues to use the \nsubpoena authority in these areas in a responsible, targeted manner, I \nhope those who have concerns about subpoena authority will come to \nrealize that it is a critical law enforcement tool in certain \ncircumstances. This should be especially clear when law enforcement \nmust track down dangerous fugitives who have warrants out for their \narrest and are evading justice.\n  In closing, I am pleased that this year we have made progress in \nhelping law enforcement address dangerous fugitives. The task forces \nare one part of this vital larger bill that will benefit Federal law \nenforcement in their tireless efforts to fight crime.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, The Presidential Threat Protection Act, \nH.R. 3048, is a high priority for the Secret Service and the Service's \nrespected Director, Brian Stafford, and I am pleased that this \nlegislation is passing the Senate today, along with legislation that \nSenators Thurmond, Hatch\n\n[[Page S11652]]\n\nand I have crafted to establish task forces, under the direction of the \nU.S. Marshals Service, to apprehend fugitives.\n  H.R. 3048 would expand or clarify the Secret Service's authority in \nfour ways. First, the bill would amend current law to make clear it is \na federal crime, which the Secret Service is authorized to investigate, \nto threaten any current or former President or their immediate family, \neven if the person is not currently receiving Secret Service protection \nand including those people who have declined continued protection, such \nas former Presidents, or have not yet received protection, such as \nmajor Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates and their families.\n  Second, the bill would incorporate in statute certain authority, \nwhich is currently embodied in a classified Executive Order, PDD 62, \nclarifying that the Secret Service is authorized to coordinate, design, \nand implement security operations for events deemed of national \nimportance by the President ``or the President's designee.''\n  Third, the bill would establish a ``National Threat Assessment \nCenter'' within the Secret Service to provide training to State, local \nand other Federal law enforcement agencies on threat assessments and \npublic safety responsibilities.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue \nadministrative subpoenas for investigations of ``imminent'' threats \nmade against an individual whom the Service is authorized to protect. \nThe Secret Service has requested that the Congress grant this \nadministrative subpoena authority to expedite investigation procedures \nparticularly in situations where an individual has made threats against \nthe President and is en route to exercise those threats.\n  ``Administrative subpoena'' is the term generally used to refer to a \ndemand for documents or testimony by an investigative entity or \nregulatory agency that is empowered to issue the subpoena independently \nand without the approval of any grand jury, court or other judicial \nentity. I am generally skeptical of administrative subpoena power. \nAdministrative subpoenas avoid the strict grand jury secrecy rules and \nthe documents provided in response to such subpoenas are, therefore, \nsubject to broader dissemination. Moreover, since investigative agents \nusually issue such subpoenas directly, without review by a judicial \nofficer or even a prosecutor, fewer ``checks'' are in place to ensure \nthe subpoena is issued with good cause and not merely as a fishing \nexpedition.\n  Current law already provides for administrative subpoena authority in \ncertain types of cases. Specifically, the FBI has been granted \nauthority granted to issue administrative subpoenas to obtain \ninformation that may be relevant in investigations of child abuse, \nchild sexual exploitation, or Federal health care offenses. See 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. Sec.  3486 and 3486A. In child abuse and child exploitation \ncases, the FBI is authorized to use an administrative subpoena to \nrequire an Internet Service Provider to disclose the name, address, \nlocal and long distance telephone toll billing records, telephone \nnumber or other subscriber number or identity, length of service of a \nsubscriber to or customer of the service and the types of services used \nby the subscriber or customer. 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3486A(a)(1)(A). Pursuant \nto those provisions in current law, the Attorney General is authorized \nto compel compliance with the administrative subpoena in federal court \nand any failure to obey is punishable as contempt of the court. Current \nlaw also provides blanket immunity from civil liability to any person \nwho complies with the administrative subpoena and produces documents, \nwithout disclosing that production to the customer to whom the \ndocuments pertain.\n  I have over the years resisted persistent law enforcement requests \nfor additional administrative subpoena authority. The House bill grants \nthe request of the Secret Service for new, limited administrative \nsubpoena authority and simultaneously imposes the following new \nprocedural safeguards on both the FBI's current administrative subpoena \nauthority and the Secret Service's new authority:\n  The new administrative subpoena authority in threat cases may only be \nexercised by the Secretary of the Treasury upon determination of the \nDirector of the Secret Service that the threat is ``imminent,'' and the \nSecret Service must notify the Attorney General of the issuance of each \nsubpoena. I should note that these requirements will help ensure that \nadministrative subpoenas will be used in only the most significant \nSecret Service investigations. In most cases, for which the threshold \nshowing of ``imminent'' threat cannot be established, the Secret \nService will not be authorized to use administrative subpoenas and will \ninstead simply go to the local U.S. Attorney's office to get a grand \njury subpoena, as is current practice and law.\n  The bill would allow a person who receives an administrative subpoena \nto contest the subpoena in court by petitioning a federal judge to \nmodify or set aside the subpoena and any order of nondisclosure of the \nproduction.\n  The bill would authorize a court to order nondisclosure of the \nadministrative subpoena to for up to 90 days (and up to a 90 day \nextension) upon a showing that disclosure would adversely affect the \ninvestigation in enumerated ways.\n  Upon written demand, the agency must return the subpoenaed records or \nthings if no case or proceedings arise from the production of records \n``within a reasonable time.''\n  The administrative subpoena may not require production in less than \n24 hours after service so agencies may have to wait for at least a day \nbefore demanding production.\n\n  As originally passed by the House of Representatives, H.R. 3048 \nprovided that violation of the administrative subpoena is punishable by \nfine or up to five years' imprisonment. The Senate eliminated this \nprovision in an amendment that passed the Senate on October 13, 2000 \nand I am glad to see that the House has approved that Senate amendment \nin the version of this bill returned by the House and considered by the \nSenate today. This penalty provision in the House version of the bill \nwas both unnecessary and excessive since current law already provides \nthat failure to comply with the subpoena may be punished as a contempt \nof court--which is either civil or criminal. See 18 U.S.C. Sec.  \n3486(c). Under current law, the general term of imprisonment for some \nforms of criminal contempt is up to six months. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \nSec.  402.\n  The House has approved the part of the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment \nto H.R. 3048 requiring the Attorney General to report for the next \nthree years to the Judiciary Committees of both the House and Senate on \nthe following information about the use of administrative subpoenas, \nincluding information on the number of such subpoenas issued and by \nwhich agency. In this way, the Congress will be able to monitor the use \nby federal law enforcement officials within the Justice and Treasury \nDepartments of administrative subpoenas.\n  Finally, the House has approved the part of the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond \namendment to H.R. 3048 requiring the Attorney General to provide a \nreport on the use of administrative subpoenas by executive branch \nagencies. I am not aware of any recent effort to compile an overview or \ninventory of the current administrative subpoena powers in the Federal \ngovernment, but understand that the United States Code contains more \nthen 700 references to subpoena powers, many subject to various forms \nof administrative delegation. In addition, there are various \ncommissions and other independent and quasi-judicial components of the \nfederal government, which are also vested with subpoena powers not \nrequiring grand jury or federal court involvement. In short, a variety \nof administrative subpoena authorities exist in multiple forms in \nmultiple agencies, without uniform rules on scope, enforcement, or \nother due process safeguards. It is time for the Congress to review \nthis situation, and this report by the Attorney General will be a good \nstart.\n  On the fugitive apprehension task forces, the House has approved in \nthe version of H.R. 3048, which the Senate considers today, parts of \nthe Thurmond-Biden-Leahy amendment that passed the Senate on October \n13, 2000.\n  As a former prosecutor, I am well aware that fugitives from justice \nare an important problem and that their capture is an essential \nfunction of law enforcement. According to the FBI, nearly 550,000 \npeople are currently fugitives from justice on federal, state, and\n\n[[Page S11653]]\n\nlocal felony charges combined. This means that there are almost as many \nfugitive felons as there are citizens residing in my home state of \nVermont.\n  The fact that we have more than one half million fugitives from \njustice, a significant portion of whom are convicted felons in \nviolation of probation or parole, who have been able to flaunt court \norder and avoid arrest, breeds disrespect for our laws and poses \nundeniable risks to the safety of our citizens.\n  Our Federal law enforcement agencies should be commended for the job \nthey have been doing to date on capturing Federal fugitives and helping \nthe States and local communities bring their fugitives to justice. The \nU.S. Marshals Service, our oldest law enforcement agency, has arrested \nover 120,000 Federal, State and local fugitives in the past four years, \nincluding more Federal fugitives than all the other Federal agencies \ncombined. In prior years, the Marshals Service spearheaded special \nfugitive apprehension task forces, called FIST Operations, that \ntargeted fugitives in particular areas and was singularly successful in \narresting over 34,000 fugitive felons.\n  Similarly, the FBI has established twenty-four Safe Streets Task \nForces exclusively focused on apprehending fugitives in cities around \nthe country. Over the period of 1995 to 1999, the FBI's efforts have \nresulted in the arrest of a total of 65,359 state fugitives. \nNevertheless, the number of outstanding fugitives is too large.\n  The House has approved in the version of H.R. 3048, which the Senate \nconsiders today the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment authorizing the \nAttorney General to establish fugitive task forces. This amendment \nwould authorize $40,000,000 over 3 years for the Attorney General to \nestablish multi-agency task forces, which will be coordinated by the \nDirector of the Marshals Service, in consultation with the Secretary of \nthe Treasury and the States, so that the Secret Service, BATF, the FBI \nand the States are able to participate in the Task Forces to find their \nfugitives.\n  The Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 will help law \nenforcement with increased resources for regional fugitive apprehension \ntask forces to bring to justice both federal and state fugitives who, \nby their conduct, have demonstrated a lack of respect for our nation's \ncriminal justice system.\n  Regarding the Secret Service protective function privilege, while \npassage of this legislation will assist the Secret Service in \nfulfilling its critical mission, this Congress is unfortunately coming \nto a close without addressing another significant challenge to the \nSecret Service's ability to fulfill its vital mission of protecting the \nlife and safety of the President and other important persons. I refer \nto the misguided and unfortunately successful litigation of Special \nCounsel Kenneth Starr to compel Secret Service agents to answer \nquestions about what they may have observed or overheard while \nprotecting the life of the President.\n  As a result of Mr. Starr's zealous efforts, the courts refused to \nrecognize a protective function privilege and required that at least \nseven Secret Service officers appear before a federal grand jury to \nrespond to questions regarding President Clinton, and others. In re \nGrand Jury Proceedings, 1998 W.L. 272884 (May 22, 1998 D.C.), affirmed \n1998 WL 370584 (July 7, 1998 D.C. Cir)(per curiam). These recent court \ndecisions, which refused to recognize a protective function privilege, \ncould have a devastating impact upon the Secret Service's ability to \nprovide effective protection. The Special Counsel and the courts \nignored the voices of experience--former Presidents, Secret Service \nDirectors, and others--who warned of the potentially deadly \nconsequences. The courts disregarded the lessons of history. We cannot \nafford to be so cavalier; the stakes are just too high.\n\n  In order to address this problem, I introduced the Secret Service \nProtective Privilege Act, S. 1360, on July 13, 1999, to establish a \nSecret Service protective function privilege so Secret Service agents \nwill not be put in the position of revealing private information about \nprotected officials as Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr compelled the \nSecret Service to do with respect to President Clinton. Unfortunately, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee took no action on this legislation in \nthis Congress.\n  Few national interests are more compelling than protecting the life \nof the President of the United States. The Supreme Court has said that \nthe Nation has ``an overwhelming interest in protecting the safety of \nits Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties without \ninterference from threats of physical violence.'' Watts v. United \nStates, 394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969). What is at stake is not merely the \nsafety of one person: it is the ability of the Executive Branch to \nfunction in an effective and orderly fashion, and the capacity of the \nUnited States to respond to threats and crises. Think of the shock \nwaves that rocked the world in November 1963 when President Kennedy was \nassassinated. The assassination of a President has international \nrepercussions and threatens the security and future of the entire \nNation.\n  The threat to our national security and to our democracy extends \nbeyond the life of the President to those in direct line of the Office \nof the President--the Vice President, the President-elect, and the Vice \nPresident elect. By Act of Congress, these officials are required to \naccept the protection of the Secret Service--they may not turn it down. \nThis statutory mandate reflects the critical importance that Congress \nhas attached to the physical safety of these officials.\n  Congress has also charged the Secret Service with responsibility for \nprotecting visiting heads of foreign states and foreign governments. \nThe assassination of a foreign head of state on American soil could be \ncatastrophic from a foreign relations standpoint and could seriously \nthreaten national security.\n  The bill I introduced, S. 1360, would enhance the Secret Service's \nability to protect these officials, and the nation, from the risk of \nassassination. It would do this by facilitating the relationship of \ntrust between these officials and their Secret Service protectors that \nis essential to the Secret Service's protective strategy. Agents and \nofficers surround the protectee with an all-encompassing zone of \nprotection on a 24-hour-a-day basis. In the face of danger, they will \nshield the protectee's body with their own bodies and move him to a \nsecure location.\n  That is how the Secret Service averted a national tragedy on March \n30, 1981, when John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan. \nWithin seconds of the first shot being fired, Secret Service personnel \nhad shielded the President's body and maneuvered him into the waiting \nlimousine. One agent in particular, Agent Tim McCarthy, positioned his \nbody to intercept a bullet intended for the President. If Agent \nMcCarthy had been even a few feet farther from the President, history \nmight have gone very differently.\n  For the Secret Service to maintain this sort of close, unremitting \nproximity to the President and other protectees, it must have their \ncomplete, unhesitating trust and confidence. Secret Service personnel \nmust be able to remain at the President's side even during confidential \nand sensitive conversations, when they may overhear military secrets, \ndiplomatic exchanges, and family and private matters. If our Presidents \ndo not have complete trust in the Secret Service personnel who protect \nthem, they could try to push away the Secret Service's ``protective \nenvelope'' or undermine it to the point where it could no longer be \nfully effective.\n  This is more than a theoretical possibility. Consider what former \nPresident Bush wrote in April, 1998, after hearing of the independent \ncounsel's efforts to compel Secret Service testimony:\n\n       The bottom line is I hope that [Secret Service] agents will \n     be exempted from testifying before the Grand Jury. What's at \n     stake here it the protection of the life of the President and \n     his family and the confidence and trust that a President must \n     have in the [Secret Service]. If a President feels that \n     Secret Service agents can be called to testify about what \n     they might have seen or heard then it is likely that the \n     President will be uncomfortable having the agents near by. I \n     allowed the agents to have proximity first because they had \n     my full confidence and secondly because I knew them to be \n     totally discreet and honorable. . . . I can assure you that \n     had I felt they would be compelled to testify as to what they \n     had seen or heard, no matter what the subject, I would not \n     have felt comfortable having them close in. . . . I feel very\n\n[[Page S11654]]\n\n     strongly that the [Secret Service] agents should not be made \n     to appear in court to discuss that which they might or might \n     not have seen or heard. What's at stake here is the \n     confidence of the President in the discretion of the [Secret \n     Service]. If that confidence evaporates the agents, denied \n     proximity, cannot properly protect the President.\n\n  As President Bush's letter makes plain, requiring Secret Service \nagents to betray the confidence of the people whose lives they protect \ncould seriously jeopardize the ability of the Service to perform its \ncrucial national security function.\n  The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be compelled to \ntestify about their protectees could have a particularly devastating \naffect on the Service's ability to protect foreign dignitaries. The \nmere fact that this issue has surfaced is likely to make foreign \ngovernments less willing to accommodate Secret Service both with \nrespect to the protection of the President and Vice President on \nforeign trips, and the protection of foreign heads of state traveling \nin the United States.\n  The security of our chief executive officers and visiting foreign \nheads of state should be a matter that transcends all partisan politics \nand I regret that this legislation does not do more to help the Secret \nService by providing a protective function privilege.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nrecede from its amendments numbered 2 and 4 and agree to the House \namendment to the Senate amendment numbered 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3514 which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3514) to amend the Public Health Service Act \n     to provide for a system of sanctuaries for chimpanzees that \n     have been designated as being no longer needed in research \n     conducted or supported by the Public Health Service, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to clarify some \nissues related to the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance and \nProtection Act by entering into a colloquy with my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Bob Smith. Senator Smith, as my fellow prime sponsor \nof the Senate version of this legislation, S. 2725, I would first like \nto address the House amendment to the bill, which would allow for the \npossibility of temporarily removing certain chimpanzees from a \nsanctuary for medical research? Is it your understanding that the \npurpose of the CHIMP Act is still to provide a permanent lifetime \nsanctuary for chimpanzees who have been designated as no longer useful \nor needed in scientific research?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. My colleague from Illinois is correct. \nThe bill calls on the scientists themselves to make the determination \nthat a chimpanzee is no longer useful for research and to formally \nrelease the chimpanzee to the sanctuary system for permanent cessation \nof scientific experimentation.\n  The amended version of the legislation allows one exception: In that \nrare, unforeseen circumstance, where a specific sanctuary chimpanzee \nmay be required because a research protocol he endured in the past, \ncombined with a technological advance that was not available or \ninvented at the time he was released, could provide extremely useful \ninformation essential to address an important public health need, then \nthat chimpanzee may be used in research if, and only if, the proposed \nresearch involves minimal pain and distress to the chimpanzee, as well \nas to other chimps in the social group, as evaluated by the board of \nthe sanctuary. Of course, if a chimpanzee currently in a lab setting \nmeets the same criteria, then the bill requires that the sanctuary \nchimpanzee not be used.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The amended version also requires that the research can \nonly be sought by an applicant who has not previously violated the \nAnimal Welfare Act, does it not? And it requires that if a chimpanzee \nis ever to be removed from a sanctuary for research, the chimpanzee \nmust be returned to the sanctuary immediately afterward and all \nexpenses associated with the departure, such as travel and ongoing \ncare, must be borne by the research applicant. The chimpanzee should \nspend as little time away from the sanctuary as possible.\n  Additionally, before any proposed research use can be approved, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services must publish in the Federal \nRegister the Secretary's findings on each of these criteria, including \nthe board's evaluation regarding pain and distress, and seek public \ncomment for at least 60 days.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator is correct on each of those \npoints, which will serve to further limit the possibility of sanctuary \nchimpanzees being recalled for research. It is my intention, and the \nintent of the amended legislation, that any such research would rarely, \nif ever, take place.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with my colleague from New Hampshire that the \nresearch exception is intended only to be exercised, if at all, under \ntruly extraordinary and rare circumstances. There have also been \nconcerns expressed by some that the CHIMP Act is too expensive. I think \nit would be helpful for us to address those concerns for the record.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I agree, it would be good to set the \nrecord straight on this issue. The federal government now spends \nmillions of dollars each year for the maintenance and care of \nchimpanzees who are no longer used in medical research, but are being \nwarehoused in expensive taxpayer-funded laboratory cages. The CHIMP Act \nwill actually save taxpayers money because the sanctuary setting is so \nmuch less expensive to build and operate than laboratory facilities.\n  The Congressional Budget Office prepared a cost estimate for S. 2725, \nthe legislation that you and I introduced in June. H.R. 3514, the House \ncounterpart that is now pending in the Senate, is identical to S. 2725 \nin terms of the cost issues. The CBO concluded that ``the cost of \ncaring for a chimpanzee in an external sanctuary would be less \nexpensive on a per capita basis than if the government continued to \nhouse the animals in federally owned and operated facilities. \nTherefore, the government would realize a savings in the care and \nmaintenance of the chimpanzees after 2002.'' CBO estimated the annual \nsavings after initial sanctuary construction costs to be an average of \n$4 million per year after 2002.\n  It costs $8-$15 per day per animal to care for chimpanzees in a \nsanctuary, where they live in groups in a naturalized setting. That is \ncompared to the $20-$30 per day per animal that the federal government \nis now spending to maintain the chimpanzees in laboratory cages.\n  Even in terms of sanctuary start-up costs, taxpayers will benefit \nbecause sanctuaries are two to three times less costly to build than \nlaboratory facilities for chimpanzees. While the federal government is \nnow squandering very high-priced laboratory space warehousing surplus \nchimpanzees, the CHIMP Act will allow this space to be utilized for \nanimals in research, reducing the need to fund new laboratory \nconstruction.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In addition, the CHIMP Act caps overall multi-year \nfederal expenditures related to building and operating the sanctuary \nsystem at $30 million, compared to the $7 million spent now each year \nby the federal government for the care of chimpanzees in laboratories, \nas estimated by the CBO.\n  And this legislation creates a public-private partnership, to \ngenerate non-federal dollars that will help pay for the care of these \nchimpanzees. Right now, their care is financed strictly through \ntaxpayer dollars. Under the bill, the private sector will cover 10 \npercent of the start-up costs and 25 percent of the operating costs of \nthe sanctuary system.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nraising those points. I'd also like to address one other issue that may \nbe on the minds of some of our colleagues. That is the question of \neuthanasia. Fiscal conservatives may question why we\n\n[[Page S11655]]\n\nshould worry at all about the long-term care of chimpanzees no longer \nused in medical research. The answer is: it's basically a cost of doing \nbusiness. If the federal government wants to keep using chimpanzees for \nmedical research, it has to assume the responsibility for their care \nafter the research is done. This isn't just my opinion, as someone who \ncares about animals. It was the conclusion of the National Research \nCouncil, an esteemed body under the National Academy of Sciences, which \nwas asked by NIH to investigate the problem of chimpanzees no longer \nused for biomedical research.\n\n  The NRC conducted a thorough three-year study and issued a report in \n1997--Chimpanzees in Research: Strategies for Their Ethical Care, \nManagement, and Use--which recommended sanctuaries as an ``integral \ncomponent of the strategic plan to achieve the best and most cost-\neffective solutions to the current dilemma.'' The NRC report clearly \nrejects the option of euthanizing surplus chimpanzees, based on views \nstrongly conveyed to the NRC by members of the scientific community as \nwell as the public. ``Many members of the public and the scientific \ncommunity have called for continuing support for chimpanzees in an \nacceptable environment, rather than euthanizing them, even when they \nare no longer wanted for breeding or research. The committee fully \nrecognizes the financial implication of this position in regard to \nlifetime funding for all animals and for additional space and \nfacilities for an aging population.'' The report cites the close \nsimilarities between chimpanzees and humans, noting that ``[t]here are \npractical as well as theoretical reasons to reject euthanasia as a \ngeneral policy. Some of the best and most caring members of the support \nstaff, such as veterinarians and technicians would, for personal and \nemotional reasons, find it impossible to function effectively in an \natmosphere in which euthanasia is a general policy, and might resign. A \nfacility that adopted such a policy could expect to lose some of its \nbest employees.'' In other words, because chimpanzees and humans are so \nsimilar, those who work directly in chimpanzee research would find it \nuntenable to continue using these animals if they were to be killed at \nthe conclusion of the research.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Therefore, if the Federal government is to keep using \nchimpanzees to advance human health research goals, long-term care of \nthe animals is a pre-requisite. This legislation will help ensure that \nthe Federal government fulfills that responsibility in a more cost-\neffective and humane way than is currently done. I thank Senator Smith \nfor the opportunity to work together to enact this fiscally sound \nlegislation that will better serve the taxpayers as well as the \nanimals.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank Senator Durbin and the rest of \nour colleagues for helping to get this legislation enacted before \nCongress adjourns. It is time to improve the lot of these animals and \ndo right by taxpayers at the same time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to ask the prime sponsor of the \nCHIMP Act if it is his intention that the federal share of funding for \nestablishing and operating the national chimpanzee sanctuary system is \nto come out of NIH's budget?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes, it is my intention and the intent of \nthe legislation that these funds will be drawn from the budget for the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  Mr. ENZI. So this legislation will not require additional funding \nover and above the NIH's annual appropriation?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Will the Chair be kind enough to let me know when I have \n3 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to urge the Senate to reject the \nflawed bankruptcy bill. For 3 years, the proponents and opponents of \nthe so-called bankruptcy reform bill have disagreed about the merits of \nthe bill. The credit card industry argues that the bill will eliminate \nfraud and abuse without denying bankruptcy relief to Americans who \ntruly need it. But scores of bankruptcy scholars, advocates for women \nand children, labor unions, consumer advocates, and civil rights \norganizations agree that the current bill is so flawed that it will do \nfar more harm than good. Every Member of the Senate should analyze \nthese arguments closely. We can separate the myths from the facts and \ndetermine the winners and the losers.\n  A fair analysis will conclude that this bankruptcy bill is the credit \ncard industry's wish list, a blatant effort to increase their profits \nat the expense of working families. We know the specific circumstances \nand market forces that so often push middle-class Americans into \nbankruptcy. Layoffs are a major part of the problem. In recent years, \nthe rising economic tide has not lifted all boats. Despite low \nunemployment, a soaring stock market, and large budget surpluses, Wall \nStreet cheers when companies, eager to improve profits by downsizing, \nlay off workers in large numbers.\n  During the period of January to October in the year 2000, the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics reported that there were a total of 11,364 layoffs \nresulting in more than 1.29 million Americans who were unemployed. In \nOctober 2000 alone, there were 874 mass layoffs--a layoff of at least \n50 people--and 103,000 workers were affected.\n  Often when workers lose a good job, they are unable to recover. In a \nstudy of displaced workers in the early 1990s, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics recorded that only about a quarter of previously laid-off \nworkers were working at full-time jobs paying as much as or more than \nthey had earned at the job they lost. Too often, laid-off workers are \nforced to accept part-time jobs, temporary jobs, or jobs with fewer \nbenefits or no benefits at all.\n  I am always reminded that if you were to compare the economic growth \nin the immediate postwar period, from 1948 up to 1972, and broke the \nincome distribution into fifths in the United States, virtually every \ngroup moved up together. All of them moved up at about the same rate. \nIf you looked at the 1970s, and particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, \nand if you broke the income distribution down into five economic \ngroups, you would see that the group that has enhanced its economic \ncondition immeasurably is the top 20 percent. The lower 20 percent are \nindividuals who have actually fallen further and further behind in \nterms of their economic income. The next group has fallen still further \nbehind.\n  It is really only when you get to about the top 40 percent of the \nincomes for American families that you see any kind of increase. It is \nthe group in the lower 60 percent who, by and large, have been affected \nby these significant layoffs. They have found it difficult to make very \nimportant and significant adjustments in their economic condition. They \nare hard-working men and women who are trying to provide for a family, \nready and willing to work, want to work, but they see dramatic changes \nin terms of their income and they are forced into bankruptcy.\n  We see that many bankrupt debtors are reporting job problems. There \nare various types of adverse conditions. Many have been fired and some \nare victims of downsizing. We also find that more women are in the \nworkforce and contributing significantly to the economic stability of \nthe family. If they are victims of a job interruption, it has a \nsignificant, important, and dramatic impact on the income of the \nfamily.\n\n  If you look at the principal reasons for bankruptcies, more than 67 \npercent of debtors talk about employment problems. So these are hard-\nworking Americans who are trying to make ends meet and we find that the \neconomic conditions are of such a nature that they are forced into \nbankruptcy. Nobody is saying they should not pay or meet their \nresponsibilities. But we also ought to recognize that in many of these \ncircumstances it is not necessarily the individual's personal spending \nhabits that force them into bankruptcy.\n  Another factor in bankruptcy is divorce. Divorce rates have soared \nover the past 40 years. For better or worse, more couples than ever are \nseparating, and the financial consequences are particularly devastating \nfor women. Divorced women are four times more likely to file for \nbankruptcy than married women or single men. In 1999, 540,000 women who \nheaded their own households filed for bankruptcy to try to stabilize \ntheir economic lives, and 200,000 of them were also creditors trying to \ncollect child support or alimony. The rest were debtors struggling to \nmake ends meet. This bankruptcy bill is anti-woman, and this Republican \nCongress should be ashamed of its attempt to put it into law.\n  This chart shows the changes between the men and women in bankruptcy. \nYou see that in 1981 a relatively small percentage of the bankruptcies \nwere by single women. The red reflects the men and women going into \nbankruptcy. The yellow represents men alone. That was in 1981. In 1991, \nyou see joint bankruptcy is continuing at a relatively slow pace. What \nyou see is the men gradually going up. What happens with women is that \nit goes up exponentially. Over the period of the last 8 years, it is \nthe women, by and large, who have been going into bankruptcy.\n  Is that to say that these women in 1999 aren't willing to work like \nthe ones in 1991 or 1981, that they are unwilling to pull their fair \nshare? No, Mr. President. There is another explanation.\n  The other explanation is, when we have the tragic circumstances of \ndivorces, more likely than not the women are unable to get the alimony \nand unable to get the child support, through no fault of their own, and \nthey end up going into bankruptcy. That is a primary reason for the \nincrease in bankruptcies--although the total numbers of bankruptcies \nnow have basically flattened out or have been reduced.\n  We are pointing out that economic conditions are responsible for \nabout half of the bankruptcies. The fact is that downsizing has taken \nplace. In spite of the fact that others who have invested in these \ncompanies have made enormous amounts of money, many of those employees \nhave been laid off and have been pushed to the side.\n  These are hard-working men and women. The interesting fact to me is \nthat people filing for bankruptcy are often middle-class people who \nwant to work. These are not Americans trying to get by without playing \nby the rules. They are working, and they want to work, but there are \ncircumstances that undermine their financial stability. As a result of \nthese circumstances, there is an increase in the number of \nbankruptcies. It may be because of the inability to get child support \nor alimony, through no fault of their own.\n\n[[Page S11657]]\n\n  So we have a responsibility to make sure, if we are going to pass \nlegislation, that we are going to be fair to these individuals, rather \nthan to be unduly harsh and penalize them. That is what I believe this \ncurrent legislation does. It holds them to an unduly harsh standard. \nThat is not only my assessment, it is the assessment of virtually all \nof the groups --advocates either for children or women or workers or \nthose who fight for basic civil rights. These are organizations and \ngroups that have spent a great deal of time advocating for children or \nwomen. They have reached the same conclusion as the 116 bankruptcy \nprofessors in law schools all over the country--not located in any \nparticular area--who have examined this bill.\n\n  In the few moments before we voted yesterday, I asked the other side \nif they could name one single organization advocating for women and \nchildren and working families that supports this legislation and thinks \nit is fair to them. There isn't a single one. That ought to say \nsomething. It is not only those of us who are opposed to it who say it \nis grossly unfair, it is everyone. When you have a piece of legislation \non the floor and there is a division, generally certain organizations \nsupport it and certain organizations don't. Not on this one. All the \nadvocacy groups oppose it. Virtually all of them oppose it because they \nknow it is unduly harsh and unfair to children, women, and workers, and \nunfair to consumers.\n  Mr. President, another major factor in the bankruptcy is the high \ncost of health care. 43 million Americans have no health insurance, and \nmany millions more are underinsured. Each year, millions of families \nspend more than 20 percent of their income on medical care, and older \nAmericans are hit particularly hard. A 1998 CRS report states that even \nthough Medicare provides near-universal health coverage for older \nAmericans, half of this age group spend 14 percent or more of their \nafter-tax income on health costs, including insurance premiums, \ncopayments, and prescription drugs.\n  Does that have a familiar ring to it? We just had a national debate, \nand the Presidential candidates were asked about prescription drugs. \nWhy? Because of the escalation of the cost of prescription drugs. How \ndoes that actually impact and affect families? Well, it is a principal \ncause of bankruptcy for many families. They just cannot afford to pay \nfor prescription drugs and meet the other kinds of needs they have in \nterms of paying rent or putting food on the table. They go in a \ndeclining spiral and they end up in bankruptcy.\n  These are individuals in families from whom the credit card industry \nbelieves it can squeeze another dime. The industry claims they are \ncheating and abusing the bankruptcy system and are irresponsibly using \ntheir charge cards to live in a luxury they can't afford.\n  I think these charts are enormously interesting, and I find them so \ncompelling when you see what is happening and what is driving so many \nof these families into bankruptcy.\n  The high cost of prescription drugs: the Presidential candidates \nspoke about it and are talking about the importance of it. Every \ncandidate across this country in this last campaign was saying what \nthey were going to try to do to relieve the cost of prescription drugs.\n  There are millions and millions of senior citizens who can't afford \nto wait for an answer by Congress. What has happened to them? They go \ninto bankruptcy. Similarly, we see the very tragic growth of the \nbreakups of families and the fact that too many of those involved in \nthose relationships are unwilling to meet their responsibilities to \ntheir children or to pay alimony.\n  What has been the result to women? They go into bankruptcy. Or, as we \nhave seen as a result of the developing of our economy and these \nextraordinary mergers--fortunes are being made, on the one hand, by \ncertain investors, but others who have given their lives to these \ncompanies and have received good compensation suddenly are cast aside. \nThey are unable to quickly adjust to their changed economic conditions. \nWhat happens to them? They go into bankruptcy.\n  Certainly we need to have bankruptcy legislation. But we also ought \nto have bankruptcy legislation that is going to be fair and that is \ngoing to be just and not punitive. We say that this legislation is \npunitive. It isn't only myself and many of our colleagues, but it is \nalso those who have spent their lives studying bankruptcy, teaching \nbankruptcy. Judges on the bankruptcy courts are dealing with it every \nsingle day and have virtually uniformly come to the conclusion that \nthis legislation is unfair, unjust, unwise, and doesn't deserve to pass \nthe Senate.\n  This legislation unfairly targets middle-class and poor families. It \nleaves flagrant abuses in place.\n  Time and time again, President Clinton has told the Republican \nleadership that the final bill must include two important provisions--a \nhomestead provision without loopholes for the wealthy, and a provision \nthat requires accountability and responsibility for those who \nunlawfully and often violently bar access to legal health services. The \ncurrent bill includes neither of those provisions.\n  The conference report includes a half-hearted, loophole filled \nhomestead provision. It will do little to eliminate fraud.\n  That is another failing of this legislation. It creates a loophole \nfor wealthy individuals to effectively hide their income. That kind of \nloophole will not be available for hard-working Americans who run into \nthe kinds of problems I have outlined. But the homestead provision that \nis left in this bill still can be abused by hiding millions in assets \nfrom creditors.\n  For example, Allen Smith of Delaware, a State with no homestead \nexemption, and James Villa of Florida, a State with an unlimited \nhomestead exemption, were treated very differently by the bankruptcy \nsystem. One man eventually lost his home. The other was able to hide \n$l.4 million from his creditors by purchasing a luxury mansion in \nFlorida.\n  The Senate passed a worthwhile amendment to eliminate this inequity. \nBut that provision was stripped from the conference report.\n  Do we understand? The Senate adopted a provision to deal with the \nkind of inequity which I have just outlined--listen to this--Allen \nSmith of Delaware, a State with no homestead exemption, and James Villa \nof Florida, a State with an unlimited homestead exemption, were treated \ndifferently. One man eventually lost his home. The other was able to \nhide $l.4 million from his creditors by purchasing a luxury mansion in \nFlorida.\n  The Senate passed a worthwhile amendment to eliminate this inequity. \nBut that provision was stripped from the conference report.\n  Why? Why was it stripped? Who had the influence? Who authored that \namendment? It would be interesting to find out. We don't know because \nthe final conference didn't include members of our party or individuals \nwho are against it. The provision just happened to show up in the \nconference report. Obviously, it is going to benefit some individuals \nto the tune of millions of dollars.\n  Surely, a bill designed to end fraud and abuse should include a \nloophole-free homestead provision. The President thinks so. In an \nOctober 12, 2000 letter, White House Chief of Staff, John Podesta says, \n``The inclusion of a provision limiting to some degree a wealthy \ndebtor's capacity to shift assets before bankruptcy into a home and in \na State with an unlimited homestead exemption does not ameliorate the \nglaring omission of a real homestead cap.''\n  The homestead loophole should be closed permanently. It should not be \nleft open just for the wealthy. Yet this misguided bill's supporters \nrefuse to fight for such a responsible provision with the same \nintensity they are fighting for the credit card industry's wish list, \nand fighting against women, against the sick, against laid-off workers, \nand against other average individuals and families who will have no \nsafety net if this unjust bill passes.\n  This legislation flunks the test of fairness. It is a bill designed \nto meet the needs of one of the most profitable industries in America--\nthe credit card industry. Credit card companies are vigorously engaged \nin massive and unseemly nation-wide campaigns to hook unsuspecting \ncitizens on credit card debt. They sent out 2.87 billion--2.87 \nbillion--credit card solicitations in 1999. And, in recent years, the \nindustry has begun to offer new lines of credit\n\n[[Page S11658]]\n\ntargeted at people with low incomes--even though the industry knows \nfull well that these persons cannot afford to pile up credit card debt.\n  Supporters of the bill argue that the bankruptcy bill isn't a credit \ncard industry bill. They argue that we had votes on credit card \nlegislation, and, that some amendments passed and others did not. But, \nto deal effectively and comprehensively with the problem of bankruptcy, \nwe have to deal with the problem of debt. We must ensure that the \ncredit card industry doesn't abandon fair lending policies to fatten \nits bottom line, or ask Congress to become its federal collector for \nunpaid credit card bills.\n  I have this letter from the American Bankruptcy Service in St. Paul, \nMN. It references the ``fresh start Visa Card.''\n  They offer a unique opportunity that could be of great benefit to \nfirms and their clients. By becoming a debtor, they will have the \nability to market an unsecured Visa credit card--the fresh start card--\nto their clients who have filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy, if they have \ncompleted the ``341 meeting'' of creditors with no outstanding issues \nwith the trustees, have not yet received a discharge in bankruptcy, or \nhave attached a copy of the bankruptcy notice to their Visa \napplication.\n  They say several law firms, especially those representing consumer \ndebtors in bankruptcy, have requested the ability to distribute the \n``fresh start Visa'' application to their clients. For each credit card \nissued, their firm will receive $10.\n  The credit card industry is marketing to people who are already in \nbankruptcy.\n  Do we understand that? We heard all of the very pious speeches and \nstatements--what we want is accountability; get those hard-working \npeople and teach them the value of the dollar; teach them a lesson. \nWell, boy, this is apparently teaching someone a lesson here because \nthey are already going to be eligible, according to the American \nBankruptcy Service, to get another Visa card even though they have been \nin bankruptcy.\n  They are out there trying to tempt them, bring them in one more time, \nand squeeze out a few extra dollars. Where is the responsibility of the \ncredit card industry in this area? Where is their accountability? Why \nis this all one way?\n  This bill is tough on women. It is tough on children. It is tough on \nworkers who have had severe medical problems and had to get \nprescription drugs. It is tough on older workers who haven't gotten \ntheir Medicare and do not have health insurance. It is tough on all of \nthem. But it is not very tough at all on the credit card industry that \nhas contributed to the fact that this particular family or individual \nwill be in bankruptcy.\n  Where is the fairness in this? It is not there.\n  Two years ago, the Senate passed good credit card disclosure \nprovisions that added fair balance to the bankruptcy bill. It's \ndisturbing that the provisions in the bill passed by the Senate this \nyear were watered down to pacify the credit card industry. Even worse, \nsome of the provisions passed by the Senate were stripped from the \nconference report.\n  The hypocrisy of this bill is transparent. We hear a lot of pious \nRepublican talk about the need for responsibility when average families \nare in financial trouble, but we hear no such talk of responsibility \nwhen the wealthy credit card companies and their lobbyists are the \nfocus of attention.\n  The credit card industry and congressional supporters of the bill \nattempt to argue that the bankruptcy bill will help--not harm--women \nand children. That argument is laughable.\n  Proponents of the bill say that it ensures that alimony and child \nsupport will be the number one priority in bankruptcy. That rhetoric \nmasks the complexity of the bankruptcy system--but it doesn't hide the \nfact that women and children will be the losers if this bill becomes \nlaw.\n  Under the current law, an ex-wife trying to collect support enjoys \nspecial protection. But under this pending bill, credit card companies \nare given a new right to compete with women and children for the \nhusband's limited income after bankruptcy.\n  It is true that this bill moves support payments to the first \npriority position in the bankruptcy code, but that only matters in the \nlimited number of cases in which the debtor has assets to distribute to \na creditor. In most cases, over 95 percent, there are no assets and the \nlist of priorities has no effect.\n  This issue has been debated and debated and debated. It is amazing to \nme, as we work in the remaining few hours of this session, that we are \nnot considering increasing the minimum wage for workers who have waited \na long time to get a $1 increase from $5.15 an hour. No, we are not \nwilling to pass that legislation. We are not willing to come back and \npass and give consideration to reauthorizing an elementary and \nsecondary education bill. We are not being asked when we come back to \neven deal with the Patients' Bill of Rights. No, we are being asked to \nlook out for the credit card industry in a very significant and massive \ngiveaway. It is wrong. This bill does not deserve to pass. I hope it \nwill not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota is to be recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, on November 23 the Washington Post had a \nstory about a murderer that I want to call to my colleagues' attention. \nThis is the picture of the alleged murderer, Elmer Spencer, Jr. The \nheadline of the story reads: ``Sex Offender's Arrest Makes an Issue of \nMandatory Release.''\n  Let me describe for a moment what I read in the story and how I \nrelated it to things I have spoken about on the floor of the Senate \nbefore and how disappointed I am that nothing ever seems to change.\n  The young boy who was murdered a couple of weeks ago was a 9-year-old \nfrom Frederick, MD. His name was Christopher Lee Ausherman. He attended \nfourth grade at the South Frederick Elementary School. He had two \nbrothers. The story said he liked Pokemon cards and was developing a \nreal passion for fishing. He was apparently in his neighborhood, very \nclose to his home on the street or sidewalk, and then a maintenance \nfound his badly beaten, naked body in a dugout at McCurdy Field in \nFrederick, MD. Christopher Lee Ausherman had been sexually assaulted \nand strangled.\n  The story described how the arrest was made. I want to talk about the \nfellow who has been arrested and charged with this murder. The fact \nthat he was on the streets in this country to murder anyone is \nunconscionable and shameful.\n  Elmer Spencer, Jr. was sentenced to 5 years for assault and battery \nin 1977, 23 years ago, and released 3 years later. Within a year of his \nrelease, he raped and attempted to strangle an 11-year-old boy. He paid \nhim $20 to drink liquor and then tried to strangle him with shoelaces. \nSpencer left him unconscious after raping him. The boy regained \nconsciousness as Elmer Spencer's attention was diverted, and \nmiraculously escaped. Elmer Spencer was sentenced to 22 years in prison \nfor that crime and released in 1994 after serving 14 years in prison.\n  In 1996, Elmer Spencer, Jr. was charged with attempted rape and three \ncounts of assault. He attacked the police officers responding to the \ncries for help from a woman whom he was attempting to rape. He was \nsentenced to 10 years, and, amazingly, released on November 14 of this \nyear, after serving just 3 and a half years.\n  Five days later, Christopher Lee Ausherman, a 9-year-old boy from \nFrederick, MD, was murdered by this man. Five days after being released \nfrom prison, having served 3 and a half years of 10-year sentence, this \npedophile, this man who had attempted murder previously, killed this 9-\nyear-old boy.\n  The question is, When will we learn in this country? We know who is \ncommitting the crimes, especially the violent crimes, in most cases. It \nis someone who has committed other violent crimes, been put in prison, \nand often released early.\n\n[[Page S11659]]\n\n  I spoke to the family of this 9-year-old boy. There is not much you \ncan do to console that family. They are grieving, obviously, for the \nloss of this young boy. But I told them some Members are working very \nhard to try to change the circumstances of release for violent \nprisoners.\n  I have spoken many times on this floor about other crimes that are \nexactly the same--different victims, but exactly the same. Young \nBettina Pruckmayr--I brought her picture to the floor of this Senate--a \n26-year-old human rights attorney who moved to this town with such \ngreat expectations and passion to do work in this area. On December 16, \n1995, she was at an ATM machine and a man named Leo Gonzales Wright \napprehended her there. He was a man who should have been in prison. He \nhad committed many previous crimes.\n\n  At the age of 19, Leo Gonzales Wright was sentenced to 15 to 60 years \nfor armed robbery and murder. He was released after 17 years. During \nthose 17 years, he compiled a record of 38 disciplinary reports and \ntransfers due to drug use, lack of program involvement, weapons \npossession in prison, and assaults on inmates and staff. Despite all \nthat, he was let out early, so that in December of 1995 he was on the \nstreets here in Washington, DC. He was able to stab young Bettina \nPruckmayr 38 times. It wasn't that we didn't know he was a violent \noffender. He had used a butcher knife just four days earlier to rob and \ncarjack a female motorist. While on probation and parole, he was picked \nup for drugs and let right back out on the streets. As a result, \nBettina Pruckmayr was killed.\n  Jonathan Hall. I have spoken about Jonathan Hall here on the floor of \nthe Senate; it is exactly the same story. Jonathan was a 13-year-old \nfrom Fairfax, VA. The boy had some difficulties, but in the newspaper \nstories I read about young Jonathan neighbors described him as a smart \nyoung boy, starved for affection. His mother reported him missing in \nDecember, 1995. Twelve days later, his body was found at the bottom of \na pond near his home. He had been stabbed over 60 times with a \nphillips-head screwdriver. After this young boy had died, they found \ngrass between his fingers. Despite being stabbed 60 times, he was not \ndead when his attacker left him. This young boy tried to claw his way \nout of that pond, and they found grass and mud between his fingers, but \nhe didn't make it. James Buck Murray, who lived right there in the \nneighborhood, killed him. Why was he living there? In 1970, Murray was \nsentenced to 20 years for slashing the throat of a cab driver, stealing \nthe cab, and leaving the driver for dead. But a mere 3 years later, \nwhile on work-releasee, he abducted a woman, was convicted of \nkidnapping, and sent back to prison. But again he was let out. And then \nyoung Jonathan Hall, of course, was murdered. By someone we knew? Of \ncourse. By someone violent? Of course. Murray had been put in prison \nand released early.\n\n  Shame on those who run our prison system. Shame on the laws that \nexist, that allow this to happen.\n  I have asked, in this recent case in Maryland with Christopher Lee \nAusherman, how could it be that a man who has been involved in such \nviolent crimes--how could it be that, when sentenced to 10 years, he is \nreleased after 3\\1/2\\? This is after many other crimes, mind you, and 5 \ndays after his release, he kills a 9-year-old boy. How can it be he is \nreleased that early?\n  The answer? Unforgivable ignorance in the construction of public \npolicy. I am sorry to say that about those who did it, but I cannot \ncontain myself. Those who did it say those who served in prison for \nprevious convictions can accumulate additional good-time credits at an \naccelerated pace against their current sentence because they have been \nin prison before. That is ignorance. We ought not reward anyone with \nample or better good-time benefits because they served in prison \nbefore. Violent offenders ought to be put in prison and that ought to \nbe their address until the end of their prison term. End of story.\n  I am so sick and tired of reading stories about innocent people--and \nI have mentioned just three. I have many more. I am so sick and tired \nof reading the stories about state governments that allow violent \noffenders out of prison to walk up and down the streets of this country \nand kill again.\n  Do you know, if you live in the United States of America you are \nseven times more likely to be murdered than if you live in France? The \nmurder rate in our country is 7 times that of Germany, 6 times that of \nIsrael, 10 times that of Japan, 7 times that of Spain. Is there \nsomething wrong here? I think so.\n  Let me show you what is happening in our prison system. For all the \ntalk about truth in sentencing, if state convicts you of murder in this \ncountry on average you are going to be in prison 10 years. You are \ngoing to get sentenced for 21 years but you are going to be serving \nabout 10 years in prison for murder. Rape? You can expect to serve \nabout 5 years in prison. They will sentence you to 10 on average, but \nyou are only going to be there about 5. For robbery you are going to be \nsentenced to a littel over 8 years, perhaps, and you will serve 4 \nyears.\n  What is the answer to all this? Why are these folks let out early? \nWhy would we decide in this country that a murderer should only serve \nhalf of his or her sentence? The prison authorities and others who \nconstruct these laws tell us the reason they have to dangle good-time \nbenefits in front of these prisoners, including violent offenders, is \nbecause it allows the authorities to better manage them while in \nprison. In other words, if they behave while in prison they can get out \nearly. That is a terrific incentive, they say, for prison inmate \nmanagement.\n  I wonder, I ask the question about the management of Elmer Spencer, \nJr. I wonder if I could get names of the people who decided the best \nway to manage Elmer Spencer, Jr.'s time in prison was to dangle in \nfront of him the opportunity to be released 7 years early, so he could \nbe on the streets in late November of this year and murder a 9-year-old \nboy? I guess the word is ``allegedly murdered him'' because he is now \ncharged with the crime, but am told there is little question about the \nguilt in this case.\n  I wonder if we could have the names of those who have decided it is \nappropriate for James ``Buck'' Murray to be on the streets, or Leo \nGonzales Wright to be on the streets after being convicted of murder, \nonly to murder again; violent criminals to be back on the streets so \nBettina and young Jonathan and all the others are victims.\n\n  What is the answer? The answer is simple. This is not rocket science. \nIt is simple. It is to decide as a policy--as I have advocated for some \nwhile, regrettably unsuccessfully--that in this country we distinguish \nbetween those who commit violent crimes and those who commit nonviolent \ncrimes. In my judgment, we ought to have a judicial system in America \nthat says: If you commit a violent act, understand this. All over \nAmerica, understand this and listen well: If you commit a violent act, \nthere will be no good time, there will be no parole, there will be no \ntime off for good behavior. You will go to prison and the sentence \nadministered by the judge in your trial will be the sentence that you \nserve in prison. No time off for good behavior--period.\n  We need to do that in this country. I have tried and tried and tried \nagain in this Senate to advance that public policy, unsuccessfully. But \nI am not going to quit. This 106th Congress is ending without great \ndistinction. We didn't even discuss the issue of violent crime. We \nshould. I hope we will in the 107th Congress. I hope perhaps there are \nRepublicans and Democrats who understand that there is nothing partisan \nabout this issue. But there is a crying need in this country to decide \nthat violent offenders must be put away and kept away for their entire \nterm of incarceration.\n  In 1991, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found there were 156,000 \npeople in State prisons for offenses that they committed while they \nwere on parole from a previous conviction.\n  Let me say that again because it is important: 156,000 people were \nincarcerated for criminal offenses that they committed while they were \nout on parole from a previous prison sentence.\n  That is exactly the case in the description of the murder I started \nwith today. It is exactly the case with Elmer Spencer, Jr., out early \nand a 9-year-old is dead. This is not an unusual story. I could speak \nfor 2 hours and more, and not just about Maryland or Virginia or the \nDistrict of Columbia. There is a courageous young woman\n\n[[Page S11660]]\n\nfrom North Dakota named Julie Schultz. Julie Schultz is a friend of \nmine, a mother of three from Burlington, ND. She was going to a League \nof Cities meeting in Williston, ND, on a quiet North Dakota highway on \nan afternoon with very little traffic and stopped at a rest stop. At \nthis rest stop Julie Schultz, mother of three, encountered a man named \nGary Wayne Puckett, who should have been in prison but was released \nearly in the State of Washington. This issue knows no State boundaries. \nHe assaulted Julie Schultz and then slit her throat and left her for \ndead.\n  I won't describe the events that allowed her to survive, but they \nwere quite miraculous. But Gary Wayne Puckett should never have been \nnear a rest stop on a highway in North Dakota on that day. He was \nreleased early.\n  Again, we know better than that. State governments should know better \nthan that. Public policy should know better than that. We can do better \nthan that.\n  It is my intention to reintroduce in the coming Congress, in January \nin the coming Congress, legislation that I have introduced previously. \nThat is legislation that would provide financial penalties in the \ntruth-in-sentencing grants that are given from the Federal Government \nto the State government, for those States that fail to enact laws that \neliminate good-time credits, eliminate the dangling of time off for \ngood behavior. My legislation will use these funds to provide financial \nincentives for states that say, instead, by statute: If you are \nconvicted of a violent crime, understand your address will be your jail \ncell until the end of your term.\n  When and if we do that in this country, finally, innocent people \nwalking up and down the streets of America will not be threatened by a \nviolent murderer, a kidnaper, a killer, a rapist, someone who is let \nout early, and poses a severe threat to innocent citizens like \nChristopher Lee Ausherman.\n  Mr. President, my understanding is the Senate is now in morning \nbusiness but there will be additional debate on bankruptcy; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the conclusion of the Senator's remarks, \nSenator Grassley will be recognized to speak on the bankruptcy bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as soon as Senator Grassley comes to the \nfloor, I will be happy to relinquish the floor. I want to speak for 2 \nminutes on another subject. As soon as he comes, I will suspend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/06/senate-section/article/S11660-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I worry very much that we are facing a \nslowdown in our economy that could be very significant. I hope Mr. \nGreenspan and the Federal Reserve Board in December will decide they \nshould begin to cut interest rates. Six increases in interest rates \nsince June 1999 have clearly slowed growth in this country in a way, in \nsome respects, that put us in a perilous position, with the liquidity \ncrisis and a range of other issues that could very well derail the \nlongest and strongest period of economic growth in American history.\n  I will speak more about this later because I see Senator Grassley is \nabout ready to speak on bankruptcy. I do want to say this. I have come \nto the floor previously when the Federal Reserve Board was searching \nfor evidence of inflation--searching in closets, under beds, in \nvirtually every crevice, trying to find some evidence of inflation, and \nused that fear to increase interest rates six times. We have had the \nhighest real interest rates for many years in this country, and they \nthreaten, in my judgment, to derail this economic growth.\n  I hope the Fed in December will think seriously about beginning to \nreduce interest rates to preserve an opportunity for continued growth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/06/senate-section/article/S11660-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MAJORITY COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprevious debate time with respect to the bankruptcy bill begin at 1:45 \np.m. on Thursday, with a vote then to occur on passage at 3:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak yet again on the \ntopic of bankruptcy reform. Yesterday, we invoked cloture on the \nBankruptcy Reform Conference Report with 67 votes. That's a solid \nbipartisan level of support. We have a conference report where both the \nmajority leader and the minority leader voted to cut off debate. At \nlong last, Congress is on the verge of enacting fundamental bankruptcy \nreform. Earlier this year, the Senate passed bankruptcy reform by an \noverwhelming vote of 83-14. Almost all Republicans voted for the bill \nand about one-half of the Democrats voted for it as well. Despite this, \na tiny minority of Senators used unfair tactics to prevent us from \ngoing to conference with the House of Representatives in the usual way. \nSo, we put the bankruptcy bill into another conference report. The \nimportant thing about this conference committee--which I have said \nbefore but want to reiterate now--is that the committee was evenly \ndivided between three Democrats and three Republicans. There was no \nRepublican majority on the conference committee. We would not be here \nif not for support from Democrats on the conference committee. So all \nof these objections to the effect that Republicans used some procedural \ntrick to avoid dealing with the minority is simply and flat out false.\n  As I am speaking, the House passed the bankruptcy conference report \nby a voice vote. We are almost there. And with the level of bipartisan \nsupport demonstrated in yesterday's vote, I am confident we'll send the \nbest bill we can to the President.\n  As I have stated before on the Senate floor on numerous occasions, \nevery bankruptcy filed in America creates upward pressure on interest \nrates and prices for goods and services. The more bankruptcies filed, \nthe greater the upward pressure. I know that some of our more liberal \ncolleagues are trying to stir up opposition to bankruptcy reform by \ndenying this point and saying that tightening bankruptcy laws only \nhelps lenders be more profitable. This just is not true. Even the \nliberal Clinton administration's own Treasury Secretary Larry Summers \nindicated that bankruptcies tend to drive up interest rates, \nMr. President, if you believe Secretary Summers, bankruptcies are \neveryone's problem. Regular hardworking Americans have to pay higher \nprices for goods and services as a result of bankruptcies. That's a \ncompelling reason for us to enact bankruptcy reform during this \nCongress.\n\n  Of course, any bankruptcy reform bill must preserve a fresh start for \npeople who have been overwhelmed by medical debts or sudden, unforeseen \nemergencies. That is why this conference agreement allows for the full, \n100 percent deductibility of medical expenses. This is according to the \nnonpartisan, unbiased General Accounting Office. Bankruptcy reform must \nbe fair, and the bicameral agreements on bankruptcy preserves fair \naccess to bankruptcy for people truly in need.\n  These have been good times in our Nation. Thanks to the fiscal \ndiscipline initiated by Congress, and the hard work of the American \npeople, we have a balanced budget and budget surplus. Unemployment is \nlow and so is inflation. But in the midst of this incredible \nprosperity, about 1\\1/2\\ million Americans declared bankruptcy in 1998 \nalone. And in 1999, there were just under 1.4 million bankruptcy \nfilings. To put this in some historical context, since 1990, the rate \nof personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 100 percent.\n  Now we see signs of slowing in the economy. We see consumer \nconfidence declining. We see the stock market losing value. We need to \nfix our bankruptcy system before a recession comes\n\n[[Page S11661]]\n\nand we're overwhelmed with huge numbers of bankruptcies. According to a \nrecent article in the New York Post, we as a nation are looking down \nthe barrel of a new and larger epidemic of bankruptcies. This article \nquoted a recent study from a New Jersey research firm that predicts a \n10-20 percent increase in bankruptcies next year. Another expert quoted \nin the article indicates that the increases may be much greater. We \nneed to act now.\n  As I indicated earlier, we have been doing pretty well lately as a \ncountry. With large numbers of bankruptcies occurring at a time when \nAmericans are earning more than ever, the only logical conclusion is \nthat some people are using bankruptcy as an easy out. The basic policy \nquestion we have to answer is this: Should people with means who \ndeclare bankruptcy be required to pay at least some of their debts or \nnot? Right now, the current bankruptcy system is oblivious to the \nfinancial condition of someone asking to be excused from paying his \ndebts. The richest captain of industry could walk into a bankruptcy \ncourt tomorrow and walk out with his debts erased. And, as I described \nearlier, the rest of America will pay higher prices for goods and \nservices as a result.\n\n  I ask my liberal friends to think about that for a second. If we had \nno bankruptcy system at all, and we were starting from scratch, would \nwe design a system that lets the rich walk away from their debts and \nshift the costs to society at large, including the poor and the middle \nclass? That would not be fair, but that is exactly the system we have \nnow. Fundamental bankruptcy reform is clearly in order.\n  I want my colleagues to know that the conference agreement preserves \nthe Torricelli-Grassley amendment to require credit card companies to \ngive consumers meaningful information about minimum payments on credit \ncards. Consumers will be warned against making only minimum payments, \nand there will be an example to drive this point home. As with the \nSenate-passed bill, the bicameral agreement will give consumers a toll-\nfree phone number to call where they can get information about how long \nit will take to pay off their own credit card balances if they make \nonly the minimum payments. This new information will truly educate \nconsumers and improve the financial literacy of millions of American \nconsumers.\n  Yesterday's vote shows that the mainstream of opinion in the Senate \nsupports bankruptcy reform. But that has not stopped the tiny handful \nof liberals who oppose bankruptcy reform have waged a campaign to \nspread disinformation about the bankruptcy bill. The article in Time \nmagazine that Senator Wellstone constantly refers to is a case in \npoint. This article purports to prove that bankruptcy reform will harm \nlow-income people or people with huge medical bills. This article is \nsimply false. I spoke about this on the floor last summer but a little \nreminder might be helpful for some of my colleagues who don't follow \nthis bill as closely as I do.\n\n  What is most interesting about this Time article is what it fails to \nreport. Time, for instance, fails to mention that the means test, which \nsorts people who can repay into repayment plans, doesn't apply to \nfamilies below the median income for the State in which they live. The \nTime article then proceeds to give several examples of families who \nwould allegedly be denied the right to liquidate if bankruptcy reform \nwere to pass. Each of these families, however, would not even be \nsubjected to the means test since they earn less than the median \nincome. While this sounds technical, it's important--not even one of \nthe examples in the Time article would be affected by the means test.\n  The Time article fails to mention the massive new consumer \nprotections in our bankruptcy reform bill. The Time article fails to \nmention the new disclosure requirements on credit cards regarding \ninterest rates and minimum payments. In short, the Time article fails \nto tell the whole truth. I think that the American peopled deserve the \nwhole truth.\n  The truth is that these bankruptcies represent a clear and present \ndanger to America's small businesses. Growth among small businesses is \none of the primary engines of our economic success. With the \npredictions of a new tidal wave of bankruptcies next year, we have to \nbe concerned about a domino effect. As more and more consumers use \nbankruptcy to escape paying their debts, more and more small businesses \nwill face unsustainable losses. And if we don't act to protect small \nbusinesses, then one of the main sources or our prosperity will be in \nserious jeopardy. As responsible legislators, we cannot let that \nhappen.\n  The truth is that bankruptcies hurt real people. Sometimes that is \ninevitable, but it is not fair to permit people who can repay to skip \nout on their debts. I think most people, including most of us in \nCongress, have a basic sense of fairness that tells us bankruptcy \nreform is needed to restore balance.\n  I will share with you what some of my constituents are telling me \nabout bankruptcy reform. I will not go through all of these quotes. But \na constituent from Des Moines, IA, said:\n\n       It is insane that such a practice has been allowed to \n     continue, only causing higher prices to consumers. . . . \n     Debtors should be required to pay their debt.\n\n  A lady from Keokuk, IA:\n\n       Bankruptcies are out of hand. It's time to make people \n     responsible for their actions--do we need to say this?\n\n  I could go on and on. But I have given you two examples of many I \nhave gotten from my State. Considering the fact that there were 83 \npeople who voted for this bill when it passed the Senate the first \ntime, this message must be getting through loud and clear in almost all \nof the 50 States in America or we would not have had that overwhelming \nvote.\n  We are merely saying, if you have the ability to repay your debt and \nyou go into bankruptcy court, you are not going to get off scot-free.\n  The time has come to get this bill on the President's desk. That is \nwhat I hope we do tomorrow afternoon at 3:45.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/06/senate-section/article/S11661-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL 10 A.M.
