SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe \n     Equitable Compensation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) by enacting the Act of December 22, 1944, (58 Stat. \n     887, chapter 665; 33 U.S.C. 701-1 et seq.), commonly known as \n     the ``Flood Control Act of 1944'', Congress approved the \n     Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Pick-Sloan program'')--\n       (A) to promote the general economic development of the \n     United States;\n       (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, Iowa;\n       (C) to protect urban and rural areas from devastating \n     floods of the Missouri River; and\n       (D) for other purposes;\n       (2) the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project--\n       (A) is a major component of the Pick-Sloan program, and \n     contributes to the economy of the United States by generating \n     a substantial amount of hydropower and impounding a \n     substantial quantity of water;\n       (B) overlies the eastern boundary of the Cheyenne River \n     Sioux Indian Reservation; and\n       (C) has not only contributed little to the economy of the \n     Tribe, but has severely damaged the economy of the Tribe and \n     members of the Tribe by inundating the fertile, wooded bottom \n     lands of the Tribe along the Missouri River that constituted \n     the most productive agricultural and pastoral lands of the \n     Tribe and the homeland of the members of the Tribe;\n       (3) the Secretary of the Interior appointed a Joint Tribal \n     Advisory Committee that examined the Oahe Dam and Reservoir \n     project and concluded that--\n       (A) the Federal Government did not justify, or fairly \n     compensate the Tribe for, the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project \n     when the Federal Government acquired 104,492 acres of land of \n     the Tribe for that project; and\n       (B) the Tribe should be adequately compensated for the land \n     acquisition described in subparagraph (A);\n       (4) after applying the same method of analysis as is used \n     for the compensation of similarly situated Indian tribes, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States (referred to in this \n     title as the ``Comptroller General'') determined that the \n     appropriate amount of compensation to pay the Tribe for the \n     land acquisition described in paragraph (3)(A) would be \n     $290,723,000;\n       (5) the Tribe is entitled to receive additional financial \n     compensation for the land acquisition described in paragraph \n     (3)(A) in a manner consistent with the determination of the \n     Comptroller General described in paragraph (4); and\n       (6) the establishment of a trust fund to make amounts \n     available to the Tribe under this title is consistent with \n     the principles of self-governance and self-determination.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are as follows:\n       (1) To provide for additional financial compensation to the \n     Tribe for the acquisition by the Federal Government of \n     104,492 acres of land of the Tribe for the Oahe Dam and \n     Reservoir project in a manner consistent with the \n     determinations of the Comptroller General described in \n     subsection (a)(4).\n       (2) To provide for the establishment of the Cheyenne River \n     Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund, to be managed by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury in order to make payments to the \n     Tribe to carry out projects under a plan prepared by the \n     Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Cheyenne River \n     Sioux Tribe, which is comprised of the Itazipco, Siha Sapa, \n     Minniconjou, and Oohenumpa bands of the Great Sioux Nation \n     that reside on the Cheyenne River Reservation, located in \n     central South Dakota.\n       (2) Tribal council.--The term ``Tribal Council'' means the \n     governing body of the Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 104. CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBAL RECOVERY TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund.--There \n     is established in the Treasury of the United States a fund to \n     be known as the ``Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust \n     Fund'' (referred to in this title as the ``Fund''). The Fund \n     shall consist of any amounts deposited into the Fund under \n     this title.\n       (b) Funding.--On the first day of the 11th fiscal year that \n     begins after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury shall, from the General Fund of the Treasury, \n     deposit into the Fund established under subsection (a)--\n       (1) $290,722,958; and\n       (2) an additional amount that equals the amount of interest \n     that would have accrued on the amount described in paragraph \n     (1) if such amount had been invested in interest-bearing \n     obligations of the United States, or in obligations \n     guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United \n     States, on the first day of the first fiscal year that begins \n     after the date of enactment of this Act and compounded \n     annually thereafter.\n       (c) Investment of Trust Fund.--It shall be the duty of the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Fund \n     as is not, in the Secretary of Treasury's judgment, required \n     to meet current withdrawals. Such investments may be made \n     only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or \n     in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest \n     by the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     deposit interest resulting from such investments into the \n     Fund.\n       (d) Payment of Interest to Tribe.--\n       (1) Withdrawal of interest.--Beginning on the first day of \n     the 11th fiscal year after the date of enactment of this Act \n     and, on the first day of each fiscal year thereafter, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall withdraw the aggregate amount \n     of interest deposited into the Fund for that fiscal year and \n     transfer that amount to the Secretary of the Interior for use \n     in accordance with paragraph (2). Each amount so transferred \n     shall be available without fiscal year limitation.\n       (2) Payments to tribe.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of the Interior shall use \n     the amounts transferred under paragraph (1) only for the \n     purpose of making payments to the Tribe, as such payments are \n     requested by the Tribe pursuant to tribal resolution.\n       (B) Limitation.--Payments may be made by the Secretary of \n     the Interior under subparagraph (A) only after the Tribe has \n     adopted a plan under subsection (f).\n       (C) Use of payments by tribe.--The Tribe shall use the \n     payments made under subparagraph (B) only for carrying out \n     projects and programs under the plan prepared under \n     subsection (f).\n       (e) Transfers and Withdrawals.--Except as provided in \n     subsections (c) and (d)(1), the Secretary of the Treasury may \n     not transfer or withdraw any amount deposited under \n     subsection (b).\n       (f) Plan.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the governing body of the Tribe shall \n     prepare a plan for the use of the payments to the Tribe under \n     subsection (d) (referred to in this subsection as the \n     ``plan'').\n       (2) Contents of plan.--The plan shall provide for the \n     manner in which the Tribe shall expend payments to the Tribe \n     under subsection (d) to promote--\n       (A) economic development;\n       (B) infrastructure development;\n       (C) the educational, health, recreational, and social \n     welfare objectives of the Tribe and its members; or\n       (D) any combination of the activities described in \n     subparagraphs (A) through (C).\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\n       (3) Plan review and revision.--\n       (A) In general.--The Tribal Council shall make available \n     for review and comment by the members of the Tribe a copy of \n     the plan before the plan becomes final, in accordance with \n     procedures established by the Tribal Council.\n       (B) Updating of plan.--The Tribal Council may, on an annual \n     basis, revise the plan to update the plan. In revising the \n     plan under this subparagraph, the Tribal Council shall \n     provide the members of the Tribe opportunity to review and \n     comment on any proposed revision to the plan.\n       (C) Consultation.--In preparing the plan and any revisions \n     to update the plan, the Tribal Council shall consult with the \n     Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services.\n       (4) Audit.--\n       (A) In general.--The activities of the Tribe in carrying \n     out the plan shall be audited as part of the annual single-\n     agency audit that the Tribe is required to prepare pursuant \n     to the Office of Management and Budget circular numbered A-\n     133.\n       (B) Determination by auditors.--The auditors that conduct \n     the audit described in subparagraph (A) shall--\n       (i) determine whether funds received by the Tribe under \n     this section for the period covered by the audit were \n     expended to carry out the plan in a manner consistent with \n     this section; and\n       (ii) include in the written findings of the audit the \n     determination made under clause (i).\n       (C) Inclusion of findings with publication of proceedings \n     of tribal council.--A copy of the written findings of the \n     audit described in subparagraph (A) shall be inserted in the \n     published minutes of the Tribal Council proceedings for the \n     session at which the audit is presented to the Tribal \n     Council.\n       (g) Prohibition on Per Capita Payments.--No portion of any \n     payment made under this title may be distributed to any \n     member of the Tribe on a per capita basis.\n\n     SEC. 105.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the Act of March 2, 1936 (Chapter 113; 49 Stat. \n     1155; 16 U.S.C. 423j), Congress authorized the establishment \n     of the Richmond National Battlefield Park, and the boundaries \n     of the battlefield park were established to permit the \n     inclusion of all military battlefield areas related to the \n     battles fought during the Civil War in the vicinity of the \n     City of Richmond, Virginia. The battlefield park originally \n     included the area then known as the Richmond Battlefield \n     State Park.-\n       (2) The total acreage identified in 1936 for consideration \n     for inclusion in the battlefield park consisted of \n     approximately 225,000 acres in and around the City of \n     Richmond. A study undertaken by the congressionally \n     authorized Civil War Sites Advisory Committee determined that \n     of these 225,000 acres, the historically significant areas \n     relating to the campaigns against and in defense of Richmond \n     encompass approximately 38,000 acres.\n       (3) In a 1996 general management plan, the National Park \n     Service identified approximately 7,121 acres in and around \n     the City of Richmond that satisfy the National Park Service \n     criteria of significance, integrity, feasibility, and \n     suitability for inclusion in the battlefield park. The \n     National Park Service later identified an additional 186 \n     acres for inclusion in the battlefield park.\n       (4) There is a national interest in protecting and \n     preserving sites of historical significance associated with \n     the Civil War and the City of Richmond.\n       (5) The Commonwealth of Virginia and its local units of \n     government have authority to prevent or minimize adverse uses \n     of these historic resources and can play a significant role \n     in the protection of the historic resources related to the \n     campaigns against and in defense of Richmond.\n       (6) The preservation of the New Market Heights Battlefield \n     in the vicinity of the City of Richmond is an important \n     aspect of American history that can be interpreted to the \n     public. The Battle of New Market Heights represents a premier \n     landmark in black military history as 14 black Union soldiers \n     were awarded the Medal of Honor in recognition of their valor \n     during the battle. According to National Park Service \n     historians, the sacrifices of the United States Colored \n     Troops in this battle helped to ensure the passage of the \n     Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to \n     abolish slavery.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title--\n       (1) to revise the boundaries for the Richmond National \n     Battlefield Park based on the findings of the Civil War Sites \n     Advisory Committee and the National Park Service; and\n       (2) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to work in \n     cooperation with the Commonwealth of Virginia, the City of \n     Richmond, other political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, \n     other public entities, and the private sector in the \n     management, protection, and interpretation of the resources \n     associated with the Civil War and the Civil War battles in \n     and around the City of Richmond, Virginia.\n\n     SEC. 503.

The map \n     shall be on file in the appropriate offices of the National \n     Park Service.\n       (b) Boundary Adjustments.--The Secretary may make minor \n     adjustments in the boundaries of the battlefield park \n     consistent with section 7(c) of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-9(c)).\n\n     SEC. 504.

Upon \n     acquisition of the easement, the Secretary shall revise the \n     boundaries of the battlefield park to include the property \n     subject to the easement.\n       (2) Inside boundaries.--To the extent practicable, and if \n     preferred by a willing landowner, the Secretary shall use \n     permanent conservation easements to acquire interests in land \n     in lieu of acquiring land in fee simple and thereby removing \n     land from non-Federal ownership.\n       (c) Visitor Center.--The Secretary may acquire the Tredegar \n     Iron Works buildings and associated land in the City of \n     Richmond for use as a visitor center for the battlefield \n     park.\n\n     SEC. 505. PARK ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) Applicable Laws.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     Director of the National Park Service, shall administer the \n     battlefield park in accordance with this title and laws \n     generally applicable to units of the National Park System, \n     including the Act of August 25, 1916 (16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) \n     and the Act of August 21, 1935 (16 U.S.C. 461 et seq.).\n       (b) New Market Heights Battlefield.--The Secretary shall \n     provide for the establishment of a monument or memorial \n     suitable to honor the 14 Medal of Honor recipients from the \n     United States Colored Troops who fought in the Battle of New \n     Market Heights. The Secretary shall include the Battle of New \n     Market Heights and the role of black Union soldiers in the \n     battle in historical interpretations provided to the public \n     at the battlefield park.\n       (c) Cooperative Agreements.--The Secretary may enter into \n     cooperative agreements with the Commonwealth of Virginia, its \n     political subdivisions (including the City of Richmond), \n     private property owners, and other members of the private \n     sector to develop mechanisms to protect and interpret the \n     historical resources within the battlefield park in a manner \n     that would allow for continued private ownership and use \n     where compatible with the purposes for which the battlefield \n     is established.\n       (d) Technical Assistance.--The Secretary may provide \n     technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Virginia, its \n     political subdivisions, nonprofit entities, and private \n     property owners for the development of comprehensive plans,\n\n[[Page S10899]]\n\n     land use guidelines, special studies, and other activities \n     that are consistent with the identification, protection, \n     interpretation, and commemoration of historically significant \n     Civil War resources located inside and outside of the \n     boundaries of the battlefield park.

Mr. President, both the Senator from Wyoming and I are \ngratified that the Senator from Oklahoma is presiding today. We \ncertainly look forward to closing this session.\n  From the minority's perspective, we are ready to vote as soon as \npossible. We know how Senator Stevens has worked very hard to wrap up \nthese final three appropriations bills. We hope it can be done \nexpeditiously.\n  In recognition of the fact that once we agree on what the final plan \nis going to be, it usually takes a day or so to understand, that people \nneed that time to read the bill and to make sure that final legislation \nis what we want, I hope tomorrow can be a full, complete day. We look \nforward to moving on a day-by-day basis with 24-hour continuing \nresolutions. The only way we are going to get out of here is to \ncontinue working. I hope if we don't make the Friday deadline, as the \nSenator from Wyoming indicated, which I hope we can do, that we will \ncontinue working through the weekend until we finish with the election \non the national level and the State level only 2 weeks from now.\n  What we are doing here doesn't seem to be getting a lot of attention \nanyway, with all the problems around the world, the Presidential \nelection, Middle East problems. It seems to me it would be to \neveryone's benefit to try to resolve some of the outstanding issues \nwhich are important at this stage only to Members who serve in \nCongress. I hope that is wrong, but it appears that is the case.\n  I repeat, for the third time today, the minority is willing and able \nto do whatever is possible to move these bills along to finality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10899-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10899-S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMPLETING THE WORK OF THE 106TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I, too, am anxious that we complete the \nwork we have before us. We still have three important appropriations \nbills to put together. I hope we can deal with respect to the issues \nand move away from some of what has happened, where we have sought, in \nsome cases, to make an issue more than to reach a solution.\n  In fairness to the Congress and to our associates, since Labor Day \nthere has been a substantial amount of progress made. I will review \nsome of it to assure you that we have been doing some very helpful and \nuseful work.\n  For example, repeal of the telephone excise tax: This was a tax that \nwas implemented during the Spanish-American War on telephones. I \nsuspect it had exhausted itself by this time and finally was repealed.\n  The Safe Drug Reimportation Act, which, of course, is a part of a \nsolution to pharmaceutical costs: In the case of Canada, for example, \npharmaceuticals that are exported there are under price controls by the \nGovernment and therefore are less expensive than they are in the United \nStates. This authorizes those drugs to be reimported and hopefully to \nbe resold at a price less than what we have had in the United States. \nOne of the issues is to ensure that those drugs are indeed bona fide \nand are indeed safe and will be the kinds of drugs that we would \nreceive absent the reimportation.\n  Permanent normal trade relations with China: An interesting issue, \none that is sometimes thought to be a big gift for China. The fact is, \nin terms of our trade with China, the restrictions they have had \nagainst our goods have been much greater than the restrictions we have \nhad against theirs; in agriculture, for example, a 40-percent tariff on \nbeef.\n  If this is implemented, we will have a reduction in the barriers for \nus to be shipping goods to China. We have had a good deal of discussion \nin some campaigns about trade and whether or not the effects of trade \nare valuable to the United States. Of course, about 40 percent of \nagricultural products are sold overseas. Obviously, those markets are \nvery important to us, but we need to ensure that it is done as fairly \nas can be and that we are treated well in this exchange. That, of \ncourse, is the reason for organizations such as WTO.\n  Legislation on H-1B visas was passed which allows for more high-tech \npeople to enter this country to take jobs we are not able to fill. I \nthink one of the very important things that goes with that is it \nemphasizes and funds some additional training for students in this \ncountry so that rather than hiring foreign people to fill these jobs, \nwe will also be training people here to be hired for those jobs. I \nthink that is terribly important.\n  We have done some things with the Children's Health Act; for \ninstance, the Cancer Prevention Treatment Act, which is one bill that \nis particularly important to me. My wife is very involved in the Race \nFor A Cure and doing things as to breast cancer.\n  The Rural Schools and Communities Health Determination Act is one \nthat I think is very important. The real issue we have had on education \nin this Chamber has not been the amount of money the Federal Government \nspends but, rather, how it can be spent, and one of the obstacles has \nbeen that this administration has insisted that as the Federal money \ngoes out, there are certain things tied to it that are required to be \ndone. We on this side of the aisle have said, yes, we want to \nstrengthen education, but we believe local educators, school boards, \nand State school departments should have the authority\n\n[[Page S10900]]\n\nto make those kinds of decisions. Certainly, the needs in Wyoming are \ndifferent from those in New York. So we certainly needed to do that, \nand we have indeed done that.\n  The Violence Against Women Act was an act we passed again so that it \nstays in effect, which is one of the most important aspects. We have \ndone some things with the Water Resource Development Act, which is \nstill in play but has been passed through this Congress. It has water \ndevelopment projects in it, the emphasis being on the Everglades. A \ngood deal of authorization money is made available to the Everglades, \nwhich is one of our very important ecological activities.\n  NASA authorization and DOD authorization are continued, and we have \ndone the Interior appropriations, which took into account some of the \ndiscussion involved with the CARA Act, but it didn't make it in defined \nspending--not with 15 years of mandatory spending, but it did provide \nadditional funds for activities such as stateside parks and maintenance \nof Federal parks.\n  It was kind of disappointing to me when we received the budget from \nthe administration. I happen to be chairman of the Parks Subcommittee. \nDespite our acknowledgment of the need for infrastructure for parks, \nthe budget provided more money for acquisition of new parks than for \nthe maintenance of the parks we have now. So we need to make sure we \ndeal with those issues.\n  We have had energy and water and Treasury-Postal.\n  My point is that we have done a great deal this year. Of course, \nthere are always many more things to do. The issues that probably have \ndominated more time than anything are the issues that most people are \nconcerned about, such as education. We talked about education for 5 \nweeks here this year. I have already indicated the different view. I \nwas disappointed, frankly, in the way that progressed. We could have \nresolved that long ago. But the difference in view was on who has \ncontrol of the spending, and it really was held up more as an issue for \nthis election. That is too bad. I think we have a substantial amount of \nthat taking place.\n\n  Social Security: It is interesting that Social Security now becomes \none of the prime issues in the election--and indeed it should be. It is \nsomething that is extremely important to most everyone, of course. The \nproposal out there would ensure that those receiving benefits now would \ncontinue to receive them and those close to receiving benefits would \nhave no change. But when you take a long look at Social Security, it is \nclear that unless something is done over time, then young people, such \nas these pages, who will pay taxes in their first paycheck, probably \nwill not be able to line up for benefits. A change must be made.\n  It is interesting that that is one of the Presidential issues talked \nabout the most. But during the past 8 years, really nothing has been \ndone about it by this administration. That is interesting. The options, \nof course, are to do nothing or to try to make changes. One of the \nchanges could be to increase taxes. That is not a very popular \nproposal. Reducing benefits is equally unpopular.\n  We can take a portion of those dollars and let them be in the account \nof people for themselves, let them invest it in the private sector and \nraise the return from about 2 percent to whatever it would be in the \nmarket, which would be substantially more than 2 percent. It is too bad \nthat hasn't been changed. We have talked about keeping all the money \nthere, and we are determined to do that. I think we have had five or \nsix votes on a lockbox. All of that has been turned down because it \nseemed to be more important at that point to make an issue rather than \nfind a solution.\n  We have had a good deal of discussion over a Patients' Bill of \nRights, of course. We have had it before a conference committee. The \nPresiding Officer is a leader in that, and he has worked very hard to \nfind a solution. But really, it turns on a relatively singular issue, \nand that is, where do you go with your appeal? Some would like to go \ndirectly to court. Others of us would like to see in the interim a \nprofessional medical person be able to make those choices, and make \nthem quickly, rather than the trial lawyers. So that has been a \ndifficult issue.\n  Tax relief is something that, of course, is very important to all \npeople. I find a lot of folks in Wyoming who are very interested in the \nrepeal of the estate tax because we have lots of farms, ranches, and \nsmall businesses which people have spent their lives developing. The \nestate tax comes along and pretty well wipes out the profits they have \nmade on efforts that have already been taxed. We passed that measure \nand the marriage penalty repeal. The marriage penalty clearly needed to \nbe repealed. It provided that two people, singly, on the same salary, \npaid less taxes than they would if they were married. That isn't right. \nThese, of course, were both vetoed by the President. So we didn't solve \nthose issues. They are still there to be considered.\n  So I think in many ways we have had a very successful session. The \namount of activity by the Congress is not always the measurement of \nsuccess. I am one who believes there ought to be a limited role in the \nFederal Government and that that role is reasonably well defined, of \ncourse, in the Constitution. This is a United States of America. The \nimplication, and I believe the better purpose, was for a limited role \nof the Federal Government. Obviously, there are things that are very \nappropriate--not only appropriate, but necessary--for the Federal \nGovernment to do.\n  On the other hand, I find as I move around in my State more and more \npeople are saying, wait a minute, there are a lot of things here the \nFederal Government is involved in that it need not be involved. This \neconomy that we have, which has been good to us over the last 12, 13 \nyears, is a result of people being able to do things for themselves in \nthe private sector, being able to have more of their own money to \ninvest, using their initiative to compete.\n  So I think we ought to really examine in each of our minds what we \nthink the role of the Federal Government ought to be and where we want \nto be over a period of time with respect to the division of power among \nthe Federal Government, State governments, local governments and, most \nof all, of individuals. And then, as we move forward through all these \nprograms, we ought to measure those things against that goal and see \nif, indeed, they are the kinds of things that contribute to the \nattainment of the way we see it.\n  Are there different views about that? Of course. There are people who \nbelieve the Federal Government should be involved in many things, and \nwe have seen over the last decade sort of a turn to the Federal \nGovernment on most every issue that arises. We have found that the \nFederal Government is not the best place to resolve many things.\n  I don't mean to be in opposition to better government; certainly the \nrole of defense; no one else can do that; interstate types of things we \nhave to do; research we have to do. But there is a measure of balance \nthat we should have.\n  I am hopeful as we complete this year and move into another cycle \nafter this year that we can take time to really evaluate where we want \nto go and where we want to be when it is over.\n  I look forward to a very productive week. I, too, hope we are able to \nput together our packages and over the period of the next 3 days come \nto some conclusions. I hope we can basically try to stay within the \nspending limits that we have set for ourselves. The fact that we have a \nsurplus seems to be an incentive to spend more money for whatever is \nthere. And obviously we have to take a look at all kinds of issues. But \nwe ought to really take a look at that surplus. Where does it belong? \nIt seems to me that the surplus very clearly needs to be set aside. The \nmoney that goes to Social Security ought to be left in Social Security.\n  I think we have to certainly fund adequately those things that we \ndetermine are legitimate activities of the Federal Government. I think \nthen we ought to really address ourselves to paying down the debt. I \nhope we will take a look at paying down the debt the way all of us take \na look at home mortgages, and say we have--whatever it is--$3 trillion \nof publicly held debt that we want to pay off. Let's set it up to pay \nit off in 15 years. It takes so much every year, and that is part of \nbudgeting. If we just say we will pay it off whenever we get a good \nopportunity, it never happens. I hope we can continue that effort.\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\n  Finally, there is, hopefully, money left from that surplus. That \nought to go back to the people who paid it. We ought not to be asking \ntaxpayers to pay in more money than really is necessary to perform the \nfunctions of government. It ought to be spent in the private sector so \nwe can continue this fairly prosperous society.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Elizabeth Hanahan Oliver was born in Rocky \nMount, NC and grew up in Washington, DC where she graduated from George \nWashington University.\n  ``Beth'' Shotwell, as she was known during much of the time that she \nworked on Capitol Hill, began her employment in the office of \nRepresentative Horace R. Kornegay of North Carolina in the early \n1960's. She then joined the staff of Senator Mike Mansfield, later \nbecoming Chief Clerk of the Democratic Policy Committee. She served in \nthat post through the terms of three Democratic Majority Leaders, \nSenator Mansfield, myself, and Senator George Mitchell. After her \nmarriage to G. Scott Shotwell ended in divorce, she married former \nSecretary of the Senate, Francis R. ``Frank'' Valeo, in 1985.\n  In 1989, after 27 years of service to the Congress, Beth Shotwell \nretired. This year on September 22, she passed away at her home in \nChevy Chase, Maryland. She had been battling cancer for several years.\n  ``Beth'' Shotwell Valeo was an excellent employee of the Senate. She \nwas a dependable, reliable asset to the members of this body. Her staff \nloved her and worked hard under her direction. ``Beth'' relished her \nwork and she revered the Senate.\n  She was probably proudest of her contribution to the Commission on \nthe Operation of the Senate, and the efficiency that the \nrecommendations of that Commission brought to this institution. Beth \nalso had a large hand in computerizing the compilation of members' \nvoting records, an innovation which has helped Members and staff \nimmeasurably.\n  On the personal side, Beth was a lover of life with varied interests \nand a curious intellect. She appreciated music. She liked to \nneedlepoint. She often rescued homeless animals. What a noble person. \nShe enjoyed boating. She liked scuba diving, and she delighted in \ntravel.\n  I shall always remember her as a tall, attractive woman, who seemed \ndisciplined, polite, and very dedicated to her work in the Senate. In \nher life and in her work she was the best of the best. I was shocked \nand saddened to hear of her passing at far too young an age. My wife \nand I extend our deepest condolences to her daughters Rebecca and \nAbigail, her two sisters Abbie Smith and Ann Duskin, her brother Skip \nOliver, Jr. of Fairfax Station, and her husband Frank.\n  In this autumn time of falling leaves, some words from Robert Frost \ncome to mind:\n\n       Nature's first green is gold,\n       Her hardest hue to hold.\n       Her early leaf's a flower;\n       But only so an hour.\n       Then leaf subsides to leaf.\n       So Eden sank to grief,\n       So dawn goes down to day.\n       Nothing gold can stay.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to comment today on this issue of \ncredibility with respect to the Presidential race in our country. I \nknow there has been a lot of discussion about credibility on one side \nor another. I wish to talk about the issue of credibility with respect \nto Social Security.\n  Some while ago, Governor Bush of Texas, who is running for President, \nsuggested we should take about $1 trillion--about one-sixth of the tax \nmoneys that are coming into the Social Security system--and invest it \nin private individual accounts in the stock market.\n  On May 30th, Senator Schumer and I were joined by twenty of our \ncolleagues in sending a letter to Governor Bush asking how that added \nup and how he would replace the $1 trillion that would be a shortfall \nin the Social Security trust fund used to pay the Social Security \nbenefits of those who are retired. We have not yet received a reply in \nthe intervening months. And the Presidential debates did nothing to \nilluminate what might or might not be on the mind of the Governor with \nrespect to that $1 trillion.\n  But this is not a case of double-entry bookkeeping, as understood by \npoliticians, where you can use the same money twice. You cannot use the \nsame money twice. If you take $1 trillion--or one-sixth of the tax \nmoney that would go into the Social Security trust fund--and say, we \nare going to take that money and invest it in private accounts in the \nstock market, then you have $1 trillion less in the Social Security \ntrust fund with which to pay benefits for those who are retired. The \nquestion is, How do you make up that difference?\n  A great many studies have been done on this issue. Let me cite one. \nLast week, a distinguished group of Social Security experts--one of my \nfavorites, Henry Aaron, at the Brookings Institution, who I think is a \nremarkable and wonderful economist, Alan Blinder, Alicia Munnell, and \nPeter Orszag--released an update to their report about what this plan \nwould mean of diverting Social Security trust fund money into private \naccounts.\n  They point out that it could very well mean less in Social Security \nbenefits for those who have the private accounts later, and that some \n$1 trillion in the Social Security system, that would be expected to be \navailable, would no longer be available because that $1 trillion was \nmoved.\n  There is an interesting comment from Governor Bush about this \nproposal. This is not a question of whether he proposes to do this. He \nsays:\n\n       . . . and one of my promises is going to be Social Security \n     reform. And you bet we need to take a trillion dollars --a \n     trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.\n\n  So he says he is going to take $1 trillion out of the Social Security \ntrust fund and use that to establish private accounts for current \nworkers.\n  Now, Allan Sloan had an article in today's Washington Post which I \nthought was interesting. He said:\n\n       If you ever wanted living proof of what a fool you would be \n     to entrust your personal financial fate--or the nation's--to \n     the stock market, you sure got it last week. On Wednesday the \n     Dow plummeted more than 400 points before you could finish \n     your first cup of coffee.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Sorry to disappoint you, but if you're looking for \n     rationality, don't look at the stock market. At least not on \n     a day-to-day basis. And don't look to the markets to bail out \n     the Social Security ``trust fund'' or to make everyone in \n     the United States rich.\n\n  He says:\n\n       If we put a big chunk of the Social Security trust fund \n     into stocks, as many people suggest, the national budget will \n     be hostage to short-term stock movements.\n\n  Aside from the issue of the credibility of saying to our senior \ncitizens, ``It is going to be in the Social Security trust fund'' and \nthen saying to the younger workers, ``I will take the same $1 trillion \nand allow you to have private accounts in the stock market with it''--\naside from the credibility of having $1 trillion that is missing and no \none forcing Governor Bush to answer the questions: What are you going \nto do with the $1 trillion? What is it going to be? How are you going \nto fill a hole that exists in Social Security if you take the $1 \ntrillion and allow private accounts to be invested in the stock\n\n[[Page S10902]]\n\nmarket?--aside from that question, which I think is very important, the \nother point is this: If you look at 20-year periods in this country, \nthere have been 108 20-year periods in which one can calculate a rate \nof return on a dollar invested in U.S. securities. In six of those \nperiods, the return was less than 2 percent; and in only eight of those \nperiods, the return was 11 percent or more.\n  The point is, instead of having a Social Security plan that provides \nsome security of income when you retire, you might find--with Governor \nBush's plan, assuming that the $1 trillion was made up someplace, \nassuming you did not have a $1 trillion hole, which now exists in the \nGovernor's proposal--you might still find yourself having retired and \nhaving private accounts in your name and having much less money than \nyou ever expected or ever would have received under the Social Security \nsystem because you don't retire on an average date, you retire on an \nactual date. You retire on a specific day. Who knows what the stock \nmarket is going to be doing in that particular period. It is not the \ncase, as economists have demonstrated, that there will always be good \nnews for everyone with respect to these private accounts.\n  But let me, again, go back to the central question: What about the $1 \ntrillion? If someone in this Chamber said they would like to take $1 \ntrillion out of this trust fund and use it for something else, \nlogically someone would stand on the floor of the Senate and say, but \nif you are going to take it out of this trust fund and use it for \nsomething else, what are you going to do for this trust fund where the \nmoney is needed? That is the logical question to ask Governor Bush. And \nwe did. And there has been no answer. Because the $1 trillion will be \ngone from the trust fund. He knows it. We know it.\n  So if there is a question of credibility on these issues, it seems to \nme it would be wise to at least question the credibility of someone who \nwants to take $1 trillion out of the Social Security trust fund and use \nit for private accounts and then say: Oh, by the way, it all adds up. \nIt does not add up.\n  I went to a high school with only nine seniors in my senior class. We \ndid not necessarily take advanced mathematics, but we took enough math \nto understand how to add these numbers. We did not discuss \n``trillions'' in my school, but we discussed it enough to understand \nthat if you take one-something here and move it over here, it is gone \nin the first location.\n  Politics, apparently, these days does not require one to reconcile; \nit does not require one to add and subtract in a traditional way. I \nthink the American people will want to know the consequences of that. \nYou cannot do both. You cannot promise that which you promised to \nsenior citizens for their retirement and then say: By the way, that \nmoney is going to be promised to workers for private accounts in the \nstock market under your name. You cannot promise both. To those who do \nso, I would say, retake your accounting exam, and remember double-entry \nbookkeeping does not mean you can use the same money twice. That's a \npretty simple lesson, it seems to me, for political dialog in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 1996, the Congress passed the \nTelecommunications Act. I was involved in the passage of that act. I \nserved on the Commerce Committee, and we wrote the first rewrite of the \ntelecommunications law in some 60 years.\n  One of the contentious areas in that debate was the ownership limits \non television and radio stations. The ownership limits on television \nand radio stations in this country were established over the years \nbecause we wanted to promote localism in radio and television stations, \nlocal ownership, local control, so that people living in an area would \nhave some notion that those who were distributing information over \ntheir television and radio stations would have some idea of local \nresponsibility.\n  It is interesting what has happened since 1996. When we had that \ndebate in 1996, the Commerce Committee took all the limits off radio \nstations. You could own as many as you want. They took the limits that \nexisted on television stations and increased it.\n  I authored an amendment on the floor of the Senate to change what \nhappened inside the Commerce Committee. I offered an amendment saying I \ndidn't think that was the right way to go. We didn't need bigger \nownership groups owning the radio and television stations. The \namendment would have restored the ownership limits on television \nstations in this country.\n  We had a rollcall vote, and I won with Senator Dole leading the \nopposition. It was a surprise to everyone, but I won. Then a Senator on \nthe other side asked for permission to change his vote. He changed his \nvote because he wanted it to be reconsidered at some point. That was at \n4 o'clock in the afternoon. And then dinner intervened. About 7 or 8 \no'clock that evening, as I recall, they asked for reconsideration of \nthe vote, and four or five Members of the Senate had some sort of \nepiphany over the dinner hour and discovered their earlier vote was \nwrong and they really had to change their vote, so I lost.\n  I understand how things work here. I understand what happened over \nthe dinner hour. People didn't have bandages and visibly broken arms, \nbut clearly pressure was applied because over a period of 3 or 4 hours \npeople changed their votes, and I lost. We have no ownership national \nlimits on radio stations, and the ownership limits on television \nstations have been dramatically relaxed. The number of television \nstations you could own has increased.\n  Let me show a chart on radio stations. In 1996, we had the top 10 \ncompanies in this country owning roughly 400 radio stations. Clear \nChannel had 57 stations. This total was about 400 radio stations for \nthe top 10 companies. Let me show you what this looks like today on \nthis chart. These are the top 10. Between them, they now own well over \n2,000 radio stations. Clear Channel owns over a thousand by itself \nfollowing its merger with AM/FM. I won't go through the rest of them. \nYou can see what is happening--a massive concentration. They are buying \nup radio stations all over the country.\n  In 1996, Clear Channel wasn't in North Dakota. Now they own numerous \nstations in the State. In Minot, ND, a former broadcaster called me and \nsaid: Do you know what is happening? They own all the radio stations \nexcept the two religious ones. I said: How could that be?\n  It was approved because the Minot service area was considered the \nsame as the service area with Bismarck because their signals overlap. \nTherefore, it was one market and in a community like Minot, with 40,000 \npeople, one company can essentially own all the radio stations.\n  The question is: What do they do with those? What kind of localism \nexists when you have a company whose headquarters is somewhere else \ncontrolling a thousand radio stations? Does that matter? It sure does \nto me. It ought to matter to the Senate. How about television stations?\n\n  On this chart, the yellow bar represents the situation in 1996 when \nwe passed the Telecommunications Act. For example, the number of \nstations Paxson had was 11, and now Paxson has 60 as the red bar \nindicates. That doesn't describe, incidentally, the management \nalliances that existed. It is much more aggressive than this chart \nindicates.\n  In television and radio stations, we are galloping toward \nconcentrated ownership in a very significant way. I think this Congress \nought to ask itself: Is this what we intend? Is this what we want to \nhave happen? Don't we want local ownership in this country with radio \nand television stations? Do people in our communities not have a voice \nin what is broadcast on their radio stations? Does their voice have to \nextend to a city 2,000 miles away where the owner of their radio \nstation resides?\n  I think the Congress ought to have a good discussion about that. \nWhere does\n\n[[Page S10903]]\n\nit end? Do we end up with several companies owning almost all the radio \nstations? In one of our largest cities, two companies will bill over 80 \npercent of all the billing from radio stations--two companies. Is that \ncompetition? I don't think so.\n  I raise the question because I intend to meet with the FCC and send \nthem a letter and meet with others. I don't mean to be pejorative with \nClear Channel. I've never met with them, but they are the largest group \nin radio ownership. They were approved for the merger with AM/FM. They \nhave well over a thousand stations. Where does this end? Is it good for \nthis country to demolish the notion of localism in broadcasting? I \ndon't think so. I don't think it is good for television or radio. These \nare public airwaves and they attach to it, in my judgment, the \nresponsibility of certain kinds of public good that must be presented \nby broadcasters when they accept the responsibility of using the \nairwaves.\n  So I raise that question today, and I intend to visit with the \nNational Association of Broadcasters, and especially with the Federal \nCommunications Commission, to ask them if this is really what was \nintended, is this what Congress wants, and is it something that we \nthink marches in the right direction? Frankly, I don't think so. I hope \nwe can discuss this as we turn the corner next year and talk about \npublic policy and whether we think concentration of radio and \ntelevision stations is something that should alarm all of us. I believe \nit should.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent to speak for the next 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota has just \nleft the floor. I was off the floor for a few moments, but I know he \ntalked about the Presidential campaign and the proposal by the Governor \nfrom Texas to reform Social Security, especially for the young people \nof our country as it relates to their future participation in it and \nthe amount of money they will ultimately pay into it versus that which \nthey get out.\n  I thought I would come to the floor for a few moments to share with \nthe Senate several experiences I have had over the last couple of years \ndealing with Social Security. About a year ago, I did a series of town \nmeetings across my State called senior-to-senior. I invited high school \nseniors and senior citizens to come together in the same place to talk \nabout Social Security.\n  Every time you go to a high school, one of the top two or three \nquestions asked is about Social Security. Now, my guess is that the \naverage American would not believe a senior in high school would be \nthat interested in Social Security. But they have probably heard their \nmom or dad saying you really ought to not plan on Social Security; it \nis certainly not going to be there when you get to be your \ngrandparents' age. That has been a fairly standard refrain across \nAmerica for the last decade. Why? Why would parents of today suggest to \ntheir young people not to expect to get a Social Security \nbenefit? Largely because they have been told it would go bankrupt, that \nit would create so much liability that it could never pay for itself.\n\n  What I think they failed to recognize is that since the Social \nSecurity reforms of the mid-1980s, Social Security has been building a \nreserve trust fund and we are taking in more than we are paying out. \nBut sometime in the near future--sometime in the future of the Senator \nfrom Idaho and the Senator from North Dakota--when we get to be Social \nSecurity age along with other baby boomers, there is going to be a peak \nof Social Security liability, or Social Security obligation. It will be \nsome $7 trillion-plus. That is a fact. We know that.\n  But we also know that the seniors of today and immediately tomorrow, \nat least for the next decade or two, are well protected because of the \nreforms we made in that system in the mid-1980s and the very dramatic \ntax increases that workers and employers have paid since that time. \nSocial Security is strong today. But we didn't do it by cutting \nbenefits very much, we did it by dramatically raising taxes on the \nworking men and women of this country.\n  If you want to keep this cycle up, if you do not want to make it \nself-supporting, and if you do not want it to yield what the other \nannuities and private annuities are yielding, then you keep it up and \nyou say to the young people: You are going to pay in hundreds of \nthousands of dollars of your wages in taxes, and for every dollar you \nput in during your lifetime, you are going to get only three quarters \nback.\n  Is that being very honest with the young people of America today? \nThey are going to work all of their lives and put all of their money \nin, and they are going to be taxed at an even higher rate. And in \nreturn, even the likelihood of getting back a 5-, 4-, or 3-percent \nreturn just isn't going to be there.\n  Yet you can say to them: If you invest in private investment funds, \nthe average return over the last 100 years invested in the industry of \nthis country is about a 10-percent analyzed rate.\n  Young people aren't dumb. They are pretty darned bright. With today's \nInternet and their ability to calculate, to communicate, and to invest \nindependently, they pretty well understand that what their parents are \ntelling them has some truth, makes some sense.\n  Social Security may be there. But it is not a very good investment \nunless you are paying for your parents' retirement--or, should I say \n``enhanced income,'' because your parents paid for your grandparents. \nThe only problem is that every senior in high school today can expect a \n20-percent increase in their taxes over what their parents are paying \ntoday, when they get to be their parents' age, to fund the current \nSocial Security system.\n  That is why Social Security has become a debate issue in this \nPresidential campaign. And it darned well should be. No responsible \nPresidential candidate is going to stand out there and say all is well. \nIt is well for the immediate future--for the next decade or two. But \nfor young people today to invest in this system without significant \nreform in it is not only bad policy, it is bad politics.\n  But I hope we reside on the side of good policy and ultimately good \npolitics. It tends to go hand in hand.\n  It has been fascinating for me to watch the debate between Governor \nBush and Vice President Gore, with Gore saying Bush is going to \nbankrupt Social Security and Bush suggesting that what Gore might do \nwould simply increase the system's liability and increase the debt \nburden on future citizens. Where does the balance lie?\n  I really believe it is time for this Senate and this Government to \ninvestigate the opportunity to take a small piece of Social Security \ntaxes and allow taxpayers to invest them in what we call personal \nsavings accounts.\n  I always notice when the Senator from North Dakota or others talk \nabout this issue, they only talk about investments in the stock market. \nBut that is not Governor Bush's proposal. It was Bill Clinton who said \ninvest it in the stock market.\n  What Governor Bush has consistently said for the last month is \npersonal accounts invested somewhat like the Federal retirees have--\nlike the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Idaho have, \nwhich means they don't invest their individual accounts in individual \nstocks. They have categories of investment that are high risk, moderate \nrisk, and low risk. Yes, some of that money is invested in the stock \nmarket, because that is where you invest money--you invest it in the \neconomy of this country--but some is also invested in private and \ngovernment bonds and other less risky investments.\n  We all know the demographics. We will soon have a record number of \nseniors in this country. What we are suggesting is that, as we shift \nback and forth, as older people get older and younger people move into \nthe system, that over the next few decades we transform the system; we \nadjust it. Over that period of time, we can create less dependency on \nthe American taxpayer and as future retirees--if we adjust it \nproperly--increasingly rely on their individualized account. That makes \nawfully good sense.\n\n[[Page S10904]]\n\n  Here is what doesn't make good sense to me. When Vice President began \nto talk about his Social Security proposals--increasing benefits for \nwidows, and increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents by attributing \nearnings to them while they stay at home--oh, did that sound like good \npolitics in an election year. My guess is it is pretty good politics in \nan election year. But the question is, Is it good policy for the Social \nSecurity system? Does it keep Social Security stable? Does it keep it \nwell funded? Or down the road does Mr. Gore--if he becomes President \nand long after he has left--create such a liability that the person who \nwill be serving here from Idaho long after I am gone has to say to the \nyoung people and wage earners of this country that we are either going \nto have to cut your benefits or raise your taxes? My guess is that is \nexactly what is going to happen. Let me for a few moments suggest why.\n  Everybody wants to help moms and widows, especially during election \nyears. But, Mr. President, let me suggest to you that Social Security \nis the wrong tool for that job.\n  The Gore Social Security surplus scheme would fail to provide \nmeaningful assistance to the people they are targeting to aid. Worse, \nit would increase the Social Security's unfunded liability by almost a \nthird; reduce Social Security trust fund balances by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars; and simply accelerate the cash-flow problem in \nwhich Social Security will find itself in the near decades if we don't \nmake reasonable reforms.\n  Social Security is one of the few Federal programs that already takes \nstay-at-home parents into account. In the current system, married \nspouses generally receive about the same Social Security benefits \nregardless of whether they worked full time, part time, or took a break \nin child rearing and did not work at all.\n  For example, in 1996, women who received Social Security benefits \nbased upon their own work record received an average of $675 in \nbenefits while women whose benefits were based on their husbands' work \nrecord received $569. What I am saying is women who stayed at home \nreceived almost the same benefit.\n  Let's remember that Social Security is not designed to be the sole \nsource of retirement income. It was designed to be supplemental income, \nand it should be understood to be just that. Nevertheless, for many \nseniors, Social Security is their sole source of income. For those \nseniors, our first priority should be to ensure we don't further \nendanger the program by adding additional obligations on top of the \nones we already cannot afford.\n  If the Vice President wants to help mothers, why didn't he embrace \nthe tax relief the Senate Marriage Tax Relief Act would have provided? \nThat would have been immediate relief. Instead, his proposal takes a \nprogram already under financial stress, and it would put it, in my \nestimation, at substantially greater financial risk.\n  What does it cost? Everybody has seen what the Vice President has \nproposed for Social Security. And yet, while the short-term cost of \nGovernor Bush's proposal has been discussed--there has been a trillion \ndollar figure floated around--Nobody wants to talk about what the Vice \nPresident's plan will cost.\n  This is what we believe and this is what others believe the Vice \nPresident's plan will cost. The Vice President said it would just cost \na few billion over the next 10 years. While the Social Security \nAdministration has not estimated the motherhood proposal, economist \nHenry Aaron offered a seat-of-your-pants estimate in Slate Magazine of \nabout 0.25 percent of taxable wages. That is about $150 billion over \nthe next 10 years. Meanwhile, Vice President's Gore's proposal to \nincrease widow's benefits would constitute about 0.32 percent of \ntaxable wages, according to the report of the 1994 through 1996 \nAdvisory Council on Social Security, Volume 1: ``Findings and \nRecommendations.'' That translated into about $166 billion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Now the Vice President has put a limit on his benefits so it would \ncost maybe a little bit less than that. The bottom line is, if you \nspread this concept out over the lifetime of the beneficiary, we truly \nare talking about these proposals costing trillions of dollars. He \ndoesn't propose to raise taxes. He proposes a finance scheme which \nsimply advances the liability and expands the liability into future \ngenerations.\n  If you are going to raise benefits in Social Security, at least have \nthe political integrity to propose a tax increase to offset the \nbenefits so you don't stress out the trust funds beyond where they \ncurrently are and you don't create outyear liabilities.\n  But then again, how could you be all things to all people and propose \nthis great benefit, if on the backside you looked the worker in the eye \nand said, ``And now you are going to have to pay for it''?\n  So, once again, it is a Ponzi scheme. We shift a little around and we \nmove a little over here. Now, the Governor from Texas has different \napproach. He clearly recognizes that by setting aside a couple of \npercentage points and allowing them to be invested within a fixed \nuniverse of investments, that we begin to build for the future of \nSocial Security by compounding our investment income instead of \ncompounding our liabilities and our debts by adding to the benefit \nstructure.\n  If we are going to improve the condition of widows and spouses, let's \ndo it in a way that is realistic and honest. If we want to use Social \nSecurity as that vehicle, then at least provide a revenue flow that \neffectively justifies those benefits in the outyears, the several \nhundreds of billions of dollars that ultimately the motherhood proposal \nand the proposal that relates to widow's benefits would cost. That is \nwhat we ought to be talking about. That is the fair way to do it.\n  The amount of new liabilities required under the Vice President's \nproposal is truly staggering. Some economists have suggested it is in \nthe trillions of dollars. A trillion here, a trillion there adds up to \nbe real money. In the past, those involved in public policy--and, more \nimportantly, those involved in the electorial process--said that Social \nSecurity is off limits unless you are willing to increase benefits. \nDon't talk about new taxes, only add to the benefit structure.\n  Thank goodness, a few years ago Congress stopped that. We reformed \nSocial Security, and we said we are going to leave it alone.\n  As a result, we stabilized it. We made the tough votes in the mid-\n1980s. We raised the taxes dramatically on the working men and women of \nthis country--but we stabilized the system. So today, I say don't add \nbenefits to that system unless you are clearly willing to offset those \nbenefits by revenue flows.\n\n  The Governor is talking about an idea, a concept that he would work \nwith the Congress of the United States. Recognizing we are in historic \nsurpluses at this moment, there is a unique opportunity to reform the \nSocial Security system so we can go to the young men and women entering \nthe workforce in this country and say, in your lifetime, your Social \nSecurity annuity will amount to something very significant instead of \ngetting back just three quarters for every $1 you pay in.\n  For my parents, Social Security has been a tremendous benefit. For \ntheir parents, it was a windfall. For me, it will be about a break even \nfor the amount of money I have invested my lifetime. For my children, \nunless we reform it as the Governor from Texas has proposed, it will be \none very bad investment. I don't want to ask that of my children. \nCertainly the Senator from North Dakota and I are better thinkers than \nthat. We ought to be able to come together to devise a system that \ndoesn't create outyear liabilities of the kind the Vice President is \nproposing.\n  Those are the real issues. Sure, it is worthy of a Presidential \ndebate. That is where it ought to be debated. Clearly, the facts and \nfigures ought to be well established. At the same time, I am pleased \nthere is a candidate out there who isn't willing to live in the shell \nof the past and the concept of a system that was crafted way back in \nthe 1930s, under a Bismarckian plan that simply said it is going to \nwork because you will never live out its benefit cycle. Thank goodness \nmy parents will live it out. People are living longer.\n  Because of the demographics of this country today, it is critically \nimportant that the Congress develop the political will to reform Social \nSecurity,\n\n[[Page S10905]]\n\nto establish personal savings accounts underneath a governing body to \nensure sound investments and the security of the system. That makes \ngood sense to me. And it sounds, by the numbers out there, it is making \neven better sense to Americans.\n  I want my children to have a strong Social Security supplemental \nincome system for them so they receive a healthy return instead of a \nthree quarters for the dollar. That makes good sense. They can do it in \nthe private sector. Why aren't we smart enough to design a plan so we \ncan do it in the public sector?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this, I think, is the debate we ought to \nhave in this country on the subject of Social Security. I am pleased to \nhear the Senator from Idaho describe the plan proposed by Governor Bush \nand describe the proposal by Vice President Gore on the issue of Social \nSecurity.\n  If you read history, you will find there are people for the last \nnearly 70 years who have predicted that Social Security won't work, \nwill go broke, and won't be there when they retire. Decade after \ndecade, people predicted that in every community around this country, \nespecially the small towns of North Dakota.\n  There are people living better lives because the Social Security \nProgram provided them something called ``security.'' Does it provide \nfor all their needs? No. But it is a bedrock security for their \nretirement years. They invested in it when they were working and now \nthey have Social Security in their retirement years. The word \n``security'' in Social Security is not some accident. People understood \nthat the purpose of Social security is just that--security. It is the \neconomic baseline of retirement, the one means of financial support \nthat Americans can count on.\n  As I indicated, there are people who, every decade, have said the sky \nis falling with respect to this program. There are some who never \nsupported this program in the first place. They wouldn't have supported \nSocial Security because philosophically they didn't believe Government \nought to do anything, and they didn't support Medicare because \nphilosophically they thought the Government shouldn't do anything.\n  What would America be like today if we had an aging population \nwithout Medicare or Social Security? This country would not be as good \na country as it is without those two important programs.\n  People are living longer and better lives. That has placed some \nstress on both Social Security and Medicare, but do not let anybody \ntell anybody else that the problem is that these programs do not work. \nThese programs work and work well. People are growing older and living \nbetter lives in this country. This is a problem born of success.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield, of course.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I know proper procedure, Mr. President, is to ask the \nquestion, but it is important to suggest this Senator did not say \nSocial Security does not work. Quite the opposite. I believe it has \nworked.\n  What I talked about today is who pays for it because what the Senator \nfrom North Dakota is suggesting, I think--and I agree with him, the \ntremendous benefit that has come, but he has also seen the doubling and \nthe quadrupling of taxes on the working people to pay for that benefit.\n  I suggest this to the Senator from North Dakota. I think it is \nimportant. CBO has just scored the Gore transfers within his plan. They \nhave suggested those transfers are around $40 trillion over the next 54 \nyears. If that is true, 40 trillion bucks would have to flow out of \nother sources, such as the general fund, because we know the Vice \nPresident is not talking about a tax increase. The question is, How do \nyou handle it? Do you create higher Government debt? Do you do direct \ninvestments? The Senate voted 99-0 against Government investments.\n  So the legitimate question in this debate is not whether Social \nSecurity has successfully benefitted current and past retirees. The \nSenator from North Dakota and I just flat agree that it has. Senator \nDorgan and I know of too many cases of individual citizens who find \nthat Social Security is almost their sole source of income. Thank \ngoodness it is there. I am talking about is the growing tax burden on \nour children. We are imposing a 20-percent payroll tax liability on the \nyoung working men and women in this country and we have to be extremely \ncautious.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I reclaim my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, $40 trillion in 54 years. Where do we get \nit, and how do we handle it?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reclaim my time. Mr. President, $40 trillion --I do not \nknow how big the school of the Senator from Idaho was. I assume he did \nnot study a trillion, nor did I. There ought to be rules when one \nstarts talking about trillions of dollars. If you extend it for two \ncenturies, you can probably come up with hundreds and hundreds of \ntrillions of dollars, but it is largely irrelevant.\n  The issue is this: We have a Social Security program and a Medicare \nprogram. Both of them have some funding challenges in the outyears--not \nnext year, not in the next 10 years. For Social Security, it is well \nbeyond the next three decades, but there are challenges.\n  Why do we have these challenges? This is good news. Let's not grit \nour teeth and wring our hands and wipe our brow over good news. People \nare living longer and better lives. Good for them and good for us. This \nis good news. This is born of success.\n  If you want to solve the Social Security problem and Medicare \nproblem, go back to the old mortality rates. At the turn of the last \ncentury in 1900, if you lived in this country, you were expected to \nlive on average to age 48. Now people are going to live 30 years longer \non average. That is good news. Good for us. That causes some \ndifficulties in Social Security and Medicare. This is not a big \nproblem. We can solve this problem.\n  Let me describe something the Senator from Idaho needs to know. The \nSenator from Idaho never did address the question of the $1 trillion \nhole. He sort of went over it like: ``Well, people say a trillion \ndollars but'' and then went on.\n\n  If you are going to take money out of the current revenue base for \nSocial Security and say to young people who are now working--you can \nuse it for private accounts, then what happens to the estimated $1 \ntrillion over 10 years you took from over here which was to be used to \npay benefits for current beneficiaries of Social Security?\n  I have served in this Congress with my colleague from Idaho and \nothers. Over the years, we have put in place $100 billion a year in \nincentives for private savings and private investments. We have SEPs. \nWe have traditional and Roth IRAs and 401(k)s. We have them all, and \nmore. We say to people: If you put some money away in savings under \ncertain conditions, you will have a tax benefit, a tax credit, a tax \ndeduction. We spend $100 billion a year in reduced taxes by providing \nincentives for people to create and open private accounts, to invest in \nthe stock market, and to invest in other things. We do that. I support \nit. I think it makes good sense for this country. But that is not the \nsame as Social Security.\n  The word ``security'' ought to mean something. That is the bedrock, \nthe foundation of retirement funds that we do as a country. The Senator \nfrom Idaho asks the question--I want to answer it--he asks the question \nabout the issues that the Vice President has raised on the widow's \nbenefit to surviving spouses and also of the issue of the motherhood \npenalty.\n  The Vice President proposes to solve those, which I think makes some \nsense. I assume the Senator from Idaho will agree that the issue of the \nwidow's benefit, to increase the widow's benefit to 75 percent of the \ncouple's previously combined Social Security benefit, makes sense. He \nknows and I know all kinds of retired women around this country living \nby themselves who are struggling mightily to make ends meet with a \npittance in their assistance check, and we need to do better than that. \nThe Vice President proposes we do better than that.\n  The Senator from Idaho asks: Where does he get the money? I will tell \nhim where he gets the money. Then I will ask where does George Bush get \nthe $1 trillion because I would like to hear an answer to that.\n  Where does Vice President Gore get the money? He does not propose a \nmassive $1.5 trillion in tax breaks, most of which goes to upper income \nfolks. He\n\n[[Page S10906]]\n\nproposes a smaller tax cut to working families and uses the difference \nto reduce the Federal debt. When we reduce the Federal debt every year, \nwe have a surplus and will get to the point when we wipe out the \nindebtedness. When we wipe out the Federal debt, the third largest \nexpenditure in the Federal budget, which is interest on the debt, will \nno longer exist. And that money which we now pay for interest on the \nFederal debt, the Vice President proposes be put into the Social \nSecurity system to help pay for the two issues the Senator from Idaho \njust described and provide increased solvency for the Social Security \nsystem. The answer is very simple. The Senator asks where does the \nmoney come from? It comes from reducing the Federal debt, eliminating \ninterest on the debt as cost to the Federal budget, plowing that back \ninto the Social Security system to help mothers, widows, and to \nincrease and promote solvency in the system. That is the answer. It is \na very simple answer.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator \nfrom Iowa. I will try to finish before 5 minutes. I want to finish this \npoint. The Senator from Iowa is on the floor and I know wants to speak. \nLet me finish this point because I think it is so important.\n  The difference in priorities here is a priority. I am not saying one \ncandidate is a bad person and the other candidate is a good person. \nThose who aspire to be President of this country have different \npriorities. Governor Bush says he supports a very large tax cut right \nup front even before we have the surpluses. We have all these \neconomists telling us we are going to have 10 years of surpluses. Most \ncannot remember their telephone numbers, and they are telling us what \nis going to happen in this country 8 years down the road. Nonsense.\n  We would be very smart to be more conservative than that. What we \nought to do, as Vice President Gore suggests, is use a substantial \nportion of that estimated surplus to pay down indebtedness. If during \ntough times you run up the Federal debt, during good times you ought to \npay it down. One of the advantages of doing that is you reduce the \nthird largest item in the Federal budget--that is interest on the \ndebt--and use that for another purpose. That is exactly the answer to \nthe question the Senator raises.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to make one additional point. What brought me to \nthe floor today was this discussion of $1 trillion that is proposed to \nbe taken from the trust funds of Social Security that is now used to \npay benefits to those who are now retired and to be used instead for \nprivate accounts for working men and women. My point is this: We \nalready spend $100 billion a year to incentivize private investment \naccounts. I am all for that.\n  In fact, as far as I am concerned, we can increase that and probably \nwill. Vice President Gore suggests Social Security-plus to keep Social \nSecurity, do not threaten the base of Social Security at all, do not \ntake money and divert it, but then on top of Social Security say we are \ngoing to provide even more incentives for those who want to invest in \nprivate savings accounts.\n  My point is this, very simple: When the issue of credibility is \nraised about all of these claims and counterclaims, there is a serious \ncredibility issue of taking $1 trillion out of the current trust fund \nover the next 10 years, $1 trillion that would otherwise go into the \ntrust funds to pay current benefits to those who are retired, and \nsaying at the same time: It is available for private accounts for other \npeople. As I said before, when you take bookkeeping in high school or \ncollege, they do not teach you ``double entry'' means you can use the \nsame money twice. Yet that is exactly what has happened with this \nproposal.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will yield just for a moment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. For 1 minute only.\n  The Vice President starts the benefit, accrues the debt into the \ntrust fund, and then you have an increased debt over in the trust fund \nof Social Security. An increased debt because the new benefits are \ngoing out.\n  On the other hand, I believe Governor Bush is proposing the \nfollowing: He will take $1 trillion out of a $2.4 trillion surplus to \ncreate these personal accounts. It is not current money to pay for \ncurrent programs. No. No. The Senator from North Dakota and I agree \nthat under current law, and under current benefit rates, Social \nSecurity is building a trust fund surplus that will peak at $2.4 \ntrillion.\n  Therein lies the difference. Those are the facts. The Gore plan is a \nPonzi scheme, Mr. President. It is a Ponzi scheme.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me reclaim my time. I am generous to yield and always \nyield when asked to yield. But this notion of a Ponzi scheme--the \ndefinition of ``Ponzi,'' it seems to me, is a description that says: \nThe surplus that is going to go into the Social Security system each \nyear, for a while, is somehow available for some other purpose.\n  We have a deliberate surplus going into Social Security. Why? Because \nit is needed, as the Senator from Idaho knows, to meet the day when \nbaby boomers retire. We are going to need that money.\n  What is going to happen is, if you follow his proposal, or the \nGovernor's proposal, and you take that money out, when you need it \nlater, it is not going to be there.\n  So I do not want anybody to stand up on the floor and say: Oh, yes, \nthere is a surplus right now. By the way, that is unobligated. Somebody \ncan come and grab that, and it will not matter. That surplus is \ndelivered.\n  I happened to be on the Ways and Means Committee in the House when we \npassed the Social Security reform plan. We did it to deliberately \ncreate a surplus to meet the needs when the baby boomers retire.\n  When the Second World War ended, the folks came back from fighting \nfor this country's liberty and freedom, and they created the largest \nbaby crop in the history of our country. They are called ``war \nbabies.'' There was this outpouring of love and affection, I guess, and \nwe had the largest baby crop in American history.\n  When that largest baby crop in American history retires, we are going \nto have a substantial need for all of the surplus we have designed to \nput into that trust fund now.\n  My point is, if you take that out now, by saying it is not obligated, \nthat we do not need it, I just say you are wrong. You can stand up and \nholler ``Ponzi'' all you want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But you are wrong if you take that position.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to add to what the Senator from North Dakota is \nsaying. I am sorry the Senator from Idaho has left.\n  Basically, the Senator from Idaho said Vice President Gore's \nproposals would--I do not know if he used the word ``bankrupt,'' but \nthey would destroy the Social Security surplus, et cetera.\n  I say to the Senator from North Dakota, the actuaries of the Social \nSecurity Administration did a study. They said the Gore plan that would \napply the interest savings, improve the widow's benefits, and end the \nmotherhood penalty, would, in total--when you take the total package--\nextend the Social Security trust fund solvency to over 50 years. That \nis from the actuaries themselves.\n  So if my friend from Idaho were here, I would make sure he heard \nthat. Maybe he did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10906-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10906-S10908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EDUCATION IN TEXAS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today a very interesting release was made \nof a study on education in Texas by the Rand Corporation. I will read \nsome parts from this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary of the Rand \nCorporation's study that was released today be printed in the Record \nafter my remarks.\n\n[[Page S10907]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. What did this Rand study show? Let me read the first \ncouple paragraphs:\n\n       What Do Test Scores in Texas Tell Us?\n       Do the scores on high-stakes, statewide tests accurately \n     reflect student achievement? To answer this critical \n     question, a team of RAND researchers examined the results on \n     the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS), the highest-\n     profile state testing program and one that recorded \n     extraordinary gains in math and reading scores.\n       The team's report, an issue paper titled ``What Do Test \n     Scores in Texas Tell Us?'', raises ``serious questions'' \n     about the validity of those gains [in Texas]. It also \n     cautions about the danger of making decisions to sanction or \n     reward students, teachers and schools on the basis of test \n     scores that may be inflated or misleading.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       To investigate whether the dramatic math and reading gains \n     on the TAAS [the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills] \n     represent actual academic progress, the researchers compared \n     these gains to score changes in Texas on another test, \n     the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The NAEP \n     tests were used as a benchmark because they reflect \n     standards endorsed by a national panel of experts, they \n     are not subject to pressures to boost scores, and they are \n     generally considered the nation's single best indicator of \n     student achievement. Both the TAAS and the NAEP tests were \n     administered to fourth and eighth graders during \n     comparable four-year periods.\n\n  According to the Rand study: The ``stark differences'' between the \nstories told by NAEP and TAAS are especially striking when it comes to \nthe gap in average scores between whites and students of color. \nAccording to the NAEP results, that gap in Texas is not only very large \nbut increasing slightly. According to TAAS scores, the gap is much \nsmaller and decreasing greatly.\n  ``We do not know the source of these differences,'' the researchers \nstate. But one reasonable explanation, consistent with survey and \nobservation data, is that ``many schools are devoting a great deal of \nclass time to highly specific TAAS preparation.'' While this \npreparation may improve TAAS scores, it may not help students develop \nnecessary reading and math skills. The authors suspect that ``schools \nwith relatively large percentages of minority and poor students may be \ndoing this more than other schools.''\n  Then it went on to say: Other features of the Texas test also may \ncontribute to the false sense that the racial gaps are closing.\n  Let me read now what Governor Bush has said about the Texas tests. \nAccording to Governor Bush:\n\n       One of my proudest accomplishments is I worked with \n     Republicans and Democrats to close that achievement gap in \n     Texas.\n\n  Bush said that on ``Larry King Live.''\n  The Rand study shows this claim is false. The achievement gap is not \nclosing; it is actually increasing in Texas.\n  Bush says that:\n\n       Without comprehensive regular testing, without knowing if \n     children are really learning, accountability is a myth, and \n     standards are just slogans.\n\n  That is from a George Bush press conference.\n  The Rand study shows that the tests cited by Bush to support this \nclaim are biased, the gains are the product of teaching to the test, \nand that claims of success far exceed the actual results.\n  Here is another Bush quote:\n\n       And our State provides some of the best education in the \n     nation, not measured by us, but measured by the Rand \n     Corporation, or other folks who take an objective look as to \n     how states are doing when it comes to educating children.\n\n  Bush said this in a live web chat on August 30.\n  Governor Bush was citing the Rand Corporation as an independent, \noutside organization to look at what States are doing and what they are \ndoing in educating their children.\n  Here the Rand Corporation came out with their finding today. ``I \nthink the, quote, `Texas miracle' is a myth,'' Stephen Klein, a senior \nRand researcher who helped lead the study, told Reuters in a phone \ninterview. He said: the ``Texas miracle'' is a myth.\n  So much for what George Bush is saying about the ``Texas miracle'' in \neducation. What it shows is that Texas set up its own tests, called the \nTAAS, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. They administered those, \nput rewards out there for how well you do on these tests.\n  So what did they start doing in those schools? They taught to the \ntest, especially in schools that had a high proportion of minority \nstudents. But when measured against the national test --that is not \nbiased, that is generally accepted around the Nation as the test to \nmeasure achievement--the Texas test falls short. It showed that the gap \nis not closing. It is actually widening, especially when it comes to \nthe gap between white students and students of color.\n\n  George Bush's claim that great progress in education has been made in \nTexas is simply a myth. I am glad the Rand Corporation study came out \nat this time. The American people deserve to know this, that the \nexaggerations of George Bush on education are clearly just that--\nterrible, gross exaggerations of what is actually happening in Texas, \nwhen he cites the Rand Corporation and then the Rand Corporation comes \nout and says, wait a minute, this is a myth. There are serious \nquestions about the validity of the gains in Texas, stark differences \nbetween the stories told by Texas and by national testing.\n  It is obvious to me. George Bush keeps talking about taking tests and \ntaking tests, but when you measure against the nationally respected \nNAEP test, Texas falls far short. So much for that exaggeration. Mr. \nBush believes so much in taking tests; he should take an exaggeration \ntest. He would flunk it. So much for education.\n  We were down at the White House earlier. We are sitting here now, \nalmost a month into the new fiscal year. We have not passed our \nappropriations bills that fund education. We have no money for class \nsize reduction, no money for rebuilding and modernizing our schools, no \nmoney for building new schools, no money for teacher training, no money \nfor job training. We are a month into the new fiscal year. The last \nbill to be worked on is our education bill. The leadership on the \nRepublican side said this year that education was their No. 1 priority. \nYet it is the last bill to get through the Congress.\n  Finally, the Governor of Texas was quoted in today's Washington Post \nas saying that the Vice President has blocked reform for the past 7\\1/\n2\\ years. This is the exact quote from the newspaper:\n\n       ``For 7\\1/2\\ years the vice president has been the second \n     biggest obstacle to reform in America,'' Bush added. ``Now he \n     wants to be the biggest, the obstacle in chief.''\n\n  That is kind of a cute line, I have to admit. He says that the Vice \nPresident and President Clinton have blocked reform for the last 7\\1/2\\ \nyears. He has his little chant: They have had their chance. They have \nnot led. We will. It is a catchy little phrase.\n  I have been watching George Bush. He has a lot of catchy phrases. It \nmakes one wonder: What country has George Bush been living in for the \nlast 8 years? Look at the record. During the Reagan and Bush years, we \nhad record deficits. Our debt quadrupled in this country during those \nyears, low job growth, low economic growth. Bill Clinton and Al Gore \ntook us from the depths of a Republican-made recession to the heights \nof the longest peacetime economic expansion in this Nation's history, \nbalanced our budgets; it took us from record deficits of $290 billion a \nyear--that is what it was in 1992, a $290 billion deficit--and the \nsurplus this year will be $237 billion, the largest surplus in our \nNation's history.\n  We are now on track to eliminate the public debt by 2012. The Clinton \nand Gore team, in contrast to what George Bush is saying, created 22.2 \nmillion new jobs, an average of 242,000 new jobs every month. That is \nthe highest number of jobs ever created under a single administration. \nUnemployment is now at the lowest rate in 30 years. Under the Reagan \nand Bush years, the number of people on welfare rose by 2.5 million, an \nincrease of 22 percent. But under Bill Clinton and Al Gore, we ended \nwelfare as we knew it. We have moved 7.5 million people off of welfare, \na decrease of 50 percent. Today we have the lowest number of welfare \nrecipients since 1968.\n\n  George Bush is saying: They are big spenders; they wanted to spend \nall this money. The size of Government has grown.\n  Let's look at the record.\n  Bill Clinton and Al Gore have shrunk spending. Today, Federal \nGovernment spending as a share of the economy, of our gross product, \nhas\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\ndropped to its lowest level since 1966. It is right at about 18.5 \npercent, the lowest level since 1966.\n  Al Gore was the head of reinventing government, which has saved us \napproximately $136 billion since he took over. How? There are now \n377,000 fewer Federal Government employees than in 1993. We now have \nthe smallest Federal workforce since 1960. Yet under George Bush in \nTexas, the size of the Texas government has grown. They have more \npeople working for government. Under Clinton and Gore, we have reduced \nthe size of the Government by 377,000 people to the lowest level since \n1960. Those are the irrefutable facts.\n  Crime has been reduced. It has dropped for 7 years in a row, the \nlongest consecutive decline in crime ever recorded. The environment has \nimproved. During this time of economic growth, our environment has \nimproved. They have set the toughest smog and soot standards ever. We \nhave cleaned up over 500 toxic waste dumps. We have protected over 650 \nmillion acres of public lands, more than any administration since \nFranklin Roosevelt was President.\n  We have made new investments in our schools. We have begun an \ninitiative to hire 100,000 more teachers to reduce class size. We have \nopened up slots for 200,000 new Head Start students. We have connected \nclassrooms across America to the Internet. We have expanded \nafterschool, summer school, and college prep programs.\n  Evidently, George Bush does not think much of these results. Maybe \nthese aren't the kinds of reforms in which he is interested. I guess \nGovernor Bush would rather take us back to the old days of deficits, \ndebts, and recession. Tax breaks for the rich; tough breaks for \neveryone else.\n  In essence, what Governor Bush wants to do is return to the failed \npolicies of the past. Let's move beyond that. Those failed policies of \nthe past brought us deficits, brought us more debt, brought us \nrecession, but the economic programs of the Clinton-Gore administration \nhave brought us the greatest prosperity we have known since World War \nII.\n  That is the record. Those are the facts. No amount of catchy little \nphrases or platitudes uttered by Governor Bush can erase that record.\n  Lastly on education, the Rand study shows that the Texas miracle is \nreally a Texas myth.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                 What Do Test Scores in Texas Tell Us?\n\n       Do the scores on high-stakes, statewide tests accurately \n     reflect student achievement? To answer this critical \n     question, a team of RAND researchers examined the results on \n     the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS), the highest-\n     profile state testing program and one that has recorded \n     extraordinary gains in math and reading scores.\n       The team's report, an issue paper titled What Do Test \n     Scores in Texas Tell Us? raises ``serious questions'' about \n     the validity of those gains. It also cautions about the \n     danger of making decisions to sanction or reward students, \n     teachers and schools on the basis of test scores that may be \n     inflated or misleading. Finally, it suggests some steps that \n     states can take to increase the likelihood that their test \n     results merit public confidence and provide a sound basis for \n     educational policy.\n       To investigate whether the dramatic math and reading gains \n     on the TAAS represent actual academic progress, the \n     researchers compared these gains to score changes in Texas on \n     another test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress \n     (NAEP). The NAEP tests were used as a benchmark because they \n     reflect standards endorsed by a national panel of experts, \n     they are not subject to pressures to boost scores, and they \n     are generally considered the nation's single best indicator \n     of student achievement. Both the TAAS and the NAEP tests were \n     administered to fourth and eight graders during comparable \n     four-year period.\n       The RAND team--Stephen P. Klein, Laura Hamilton, Daniel \n     McCaffrey and Brian M. Stecher--generally found only small \n     increases, similar to those observed nationwide, in the Texas \n     NAEP scores. Meanwhile, the TAAS scores were soaring. Texas \n     students did improve significantly more on a fourth-grade \n     NAEP math test than their counterparts nationally. But again, \n     the size of this gain was smaller than their gains on TAAS \n     and was not present on the eighth-grade math test.\n       The ``stark differences'' between the stories told by NAEP \n     and TAAS are especially striking when it comes to the gap in \n     average scores between whites and students of color. \n     According to the NAEP results, that gap in Texas is not \n     only very large but increasing slightly. According to TAAS \n     scores, the gap is much smaller and decreasing greatly.\n       ``We do not know the source of these differences,'' the \n     researchers state. But one reasonable explanation, consistent \n     with survey and observation data, is that ``many schools are \n     devoting a great deal of class time to highly specific TAAS \n     preparation.'' While this preparation may improve TAAS \n     scores, it may not help students develop necessary reading \n     and math skills. The authors suspect that ``schools with \n     relatively large percentages of minority and poor students \n     may be doing this more than other schools.'' Other features \n     of the TAAS also may contribute to the false sense that the \n     racial gaps are closing.\n       Problems with statewide tests are not confined to the TAAS \n     or Texas, the authors observe. To lessen the likelihood of \n     invalid scores on such tests, they recommend that states:\n       Reduce the pressure associated with high-stakes testing by \n     using one set of measures for decisions about individual \n     students and another set for teachers and schools;\n       Replace traditional paper-and-pencil multiple choice exams \n     with computer-based tests that are delivered over the \n     Internet and draw on banks of thousands of questions;\n       Peridocially conduct audit testing to validate score gains; \n     and\n       Examine the positive and negative effects of the testing \n     programs on curriculum and instruction.\n       In July, RAND released a detailed analysis by David \n     Grissmer and colleagues that compared the NAEP scores of 44 \n     states, including Texas. That study and today's issue paper \n     are not directly comparable. They differ in scope, focus and \n     data. Grissmer et al. found that Texas ranked high in \n     achievement when comparing children from similar families. \n     Both found at least some gains in the NAEP scores in Texas. \n     Grissmer et al. suggested that the Texas accountability \n     regime, of which TAAS is a part, might be a ``plausible'' \n     explanation for the state's NAEP gains, but added that more \n     research is needed before a linkage can be made. What Do Test \n     Scores in Texas Tell Us? represents an important contribution \n     to that research effort. It is also the latest in a \n     continuing series of RAND analyses involving high-stakes \n     testing issues.\n\n\n         STATEMENT OF RAND PRESIDENT AND CEO, JAMES A. THOMSON\n\n       The issue paper on Texas Education and Test Scores that \n     RAND issued today is already the subject of intense \n     controversy, as we expected. I want to underscore several \n     points:\n       This research was thoroughly reviewed by distinguished \n     external and internal experts. We stand behind the quality of \n     both this paper and of our July report on the meaning of \n     national test scores across the country, which also sparked \n     considerable controversy.\n       The timing of the release of both reports was based on the \n     same, constant RAND standard; we release our work as soon as \n     the research, review and revision processes are complete. We \n     don't produce findings for political reasons, we don't \n     distribute them for political reasons and we don't sit on \n     them for political reasons. This is a scrupulously \n     nonpartisan institution.\n       The July study--Improving Student Achievement: What State \n     NAEP Scores Tell Us--also touched on Texas schools and \n     received widespread press play. Both efforts draw on NAEP \n     scores. The new paper suggests a less positive picture of \n     Texas education than the earlier effort. But I do not believe \n     that these efforts are in sharp conflict. Together in fact \n     they provide a more comprehensive picture of key education \n     issues.\n       The July report differed in scope (it covered almost all \n     states, not just Texas), in methodology (it adjusted states' \n     NAEP scores for family characteristics, such as racial and \n     socioeconomic differences), and most of all in focus. It \n     sought to explain why student achievement scores vary so \n     widely across the states even after those demographic \n     adjustments are made. The team that researched the new Issue \n     Paper on the other hand focused on Texas and its statewide \n     testing program. Texas was studied because the state \n     exemplifies a national trend toward using statewide exams as \n     a basis for high-stakes educational decisions.\n       From the Texas standpoint, the good news is that the state \n     ranks high in adjusted student achievement. Our July study \n     correlates this with specific ways that resources are \n     allocated to high-leverage programs, such as pre-\n     kindergarten, one of the features of the Texas reform effort. \n     The bad news is that the statewide testing system in Texas \n     needs improvement. The Issue Paper team suggests ways this \n     can be done in Texas and other states.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I was recently given a copy of an \nexcerpt from a yet unpublished book written by South Carolina native \nand former Citadel graduate, Mr. Pat Conroy. This essay is an \ninsightful tribute to the men and women who served their country in \ntimes of conflict, and I would like to take this opportunity to bring \nthis exceptional essay to the attention of my colleagues.\n  Mr. Conroy's composition recounts the experiences of a courageous man \nwho answered his nation's call to serve in the armed forces during a \ntime of conflict, and the intense pride he had in his country even \nduring the most dire of circumstances as a POW. It also recounts how, \nthrough the author's interaction with this patriotic individual, Mr. \nConroy arrived at the realization that duty to one's country is an \nobligation that comes with the privilege of being a citizen.\n  This dramatic composition honors those who accepted their duty with \ncourage and dignity, and I ask unanimous consent that this poignant \nessay be inserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           My Heart's Content\n\n                            (By Pat Conroy)\n\n       The true things always ambush me on the road and take me by \n     surprise when I am drifting down the light of placid days, \n     careless about flanks and rearguard actions. I was not \n     looking for a true thing to come upon me in the state of New \n     Jersey. Nothing has ever happened to me in New Jersey. But \n     came it did, and it came to stay.\n       In the past four years I have been interviewing my \n     teammates on the 1966-67 basketball team at the Citadel for a \n     book I'm writing. For the most part, this has been like \n     buying back a part of my past that I had mislaid or shut out \n     of my life. At first I thought I was writing about being \n     young and frisky and able to run up and down a court all day \n     long, but lately I realized I came to this book because I \n     needed to come to grips with being middle-aged and having \n     ripened into a gray-haired man you could not trust to handle \n     the ball on a fast break.\n       When I visited my old teammate Al Kroboth's house in New \n     Jersey, I spent the first hours quizzing him about his \n     memories of games and practices and the screams of coaches \n     that had echoed in field houses more than 30 years before. Al \n     had been a splendid forward-center for the Citadel; at 6 feet \n     5 inches and carrying 220 pounds, he played with \n     indefatigable energy and enthusiasm. For most of his senior \n     year, he led the nation in field-goal percentage, with UCLA \n     center Lew Alcindor hot on his trail. Al was a battler and a \n     brawler and a scrapper from the day he first stepped in as a \n     Green Weenie as a sophomore to the day he graduated. After we \n     talked basketball, we came to a subject I dreaded to bring up \n     with Al, but which lay between us and would not lie still.\n       ``Al, you know I was a draft dodger and antiwar \n     demonstrator.''\n       ``That's what I heard, Conroy,'' Al said. ``I have nothing \n     against what you did, but I did what I thought was right.''\n       ``Tell me about Vietnam, big Al. Tell me what happened to \n     you,'' I said.\n       On his seventh mission as a navigator in an A-6 for Major \n     Leonard Robertson, Al was getting ready to deliver their \n     payload when the fighter-bomber was hit by enemy fire. Though \n     Al has no memory of it, he punched out somewhere in the \n     middle of the ill-fated dive and lost consciousness. He \n     doesn't know if he was unconscious for six hours or six days, \n     nor does he know what happened to Major Robertson (whose name \n     is engraved on the Wall in Washington and on the MIA bracelet \n     Al wears).\n       When Al awoke, he couldn't move. A Viet Cong soldier held \n     an AK-47 to his head. His back and his neck were broken, and \n     he had shattered his left scapula in the fall. When he was \n     well enough to get to his feet (he still can't recall how \n     much time had passed), two armed Viet Cong led Al from the \n     jungles of South Vietnam to a prison in Hanoi. The journey \n     took three months. Al Kroboth walked barefooted through the \n     most impassable terrain in Vietnam, and he did it sometimes \n     in the dead of night. He bathed when it rained, and he slept \n     in bomb craters with his two Viet Cong captors. As they moved \n     farther north, infections began to erupt on his body, and his \n     legs were covered with leeches picked up while crossing the \n     rice paddies.\n       At the very time of Al's walk, I had a small role in \n     organizing the only antiwar demonstration ever held in \n     Beaufort, South Carolina, the home of Parris Island and the \n     Marine Corps Air Station. In a Marine Corps town at that \n     time, it was difficult to come up with a quorum of people who \n     had even minor disagreements about the Vietnam War. But my \n     small group managed to attract a crowd of about 150 to \n     Beaufort's waterfront. With my mother and my wife on either \n     side of me, we listened to the featured speaker, Dr. Howard \n     Levy, suggest to the very few young enlisted marines present \n     that if they get sent to Vietnam, here's how they can help \n     end this war: Roll a grenade under your officer's bunk when \n     he's asleep in his tent. It's called fragging and is becoming \n     more and more popular with the ground troops who know this \n     war is bullshit. I was enraged by the suggestion. At that \n     very moment my father, a marine officer, was asleep in \n     Vietnam. But in 1972, at the age of 27, I thought I was \n     serving America's interests by pointing out what massive \n     flaws and miscalculations and corruptions had led her to \n     conduct a ground war in Southeast Asia.\n       In the meantime, Al and his captors had finally arrived in \n     the North, and the Viet Cong traded him to North Vietnamese \n     soldiers for the final leg of the trip to Hanoi. Many times \n     when they stopped to rest for the night, the local villagers \n     tried to kill him. His captors wired his hands behind his \n     back at night, so he trained himself to sleep in the center \n     of huts when the villagers began sticking knives and bayonets \n     into the thin walls. Following the U.S. air raids, old women \n     would come into the huts to excrete on him and yank out hunks \n     of his hair. After the nightmare journey of his walk north, \n     Al was relieved when his guards finally delivered him to the \n     POW camp in Hanoi and the cell door locked behind him.\n       It was at the camp that Al began to die. He threw up every \n     meal he ate and before long was misidentified as the oldest \n     American soldier in the prison because his appearance was so \n     gaunt and skeletal. But the extraordinary camaraderie among \n     fellow prisoners that sprang up in all the POW camps caught \n     fire in Al, and did so in time to save his life.\n       When I was demonstrating in America against Nixon and the \n     Christmas bombings in Hanoi, Al and his fellow prisoners were \n     holding hands under the full fury of those bombings, singing \n     ``God Bless America.'' It was those bombs that convinced \n     Hanoi they would do well to release the American POWs, \n     including my college teammate. When he told me about the C-\n     141 landing in Hanoi to pick up the prisoners, Al said he \n     felt no emotion, none at all, until he saw the giant American \n     flag painted on the plane's tail. I stopped writing as Al \n     wept over the memory of that flag on that plane, on that \n     morning, during that time in the life of America.\n       It was that same long night, after listening to Al's story, \n     that I began to make judgments about how I had conducted \n     myself during the Vietnam War. In the darkness of the \n     sleeping Kroboth household, lying in the third-floor guest \n     bedroom, I began to assess my role as a citizen in the '60s, \n     when my country called my name and I shot her the bird. \n     Unlike the stupid boys who wrapped themselves in Viet Cong \n     flags and burned the American one, I knew how to demonstrate \n     against the war without flirting with treason or \n     astonishingly bad taste. I had come directly from the warrior \n     culture of this country and I knew how to act. But in the 25 \n     years that have passed since South Vietnam fell, I have \n     immersed myself in the study of totalitarianism during the \n     unspeakable century we just left behind. I have questioned \n     survivors of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, talked to Italians \n     who told me tales of the Nazi occupation, French partisans \n     who had counted German tanks in the forests of Normandy, \n     and officers who survived the Bataan\n\n[[Page S10910]]\n\n     Death March. I quiz journalists returning from wars in \n     Bosnia, the Sudan, the Congo, Angola, Indonesia, \n     Guatemala, San Salvador, Chile, Northern Ireland, Algeria. \n     As I lay sleepless, I realized I'd done all this research \n     to better understand my country. I now revere words like \n     democracy, freedom, the right to vote, and the grandeur of \n     the extraordinary vision of the founding fathers. Do I see \n     America's flaws? Of course. But I now can honor her basic, \n     incorruptible virtues, the ones that let me walk the \n     streets screaming my ass off that my country had no idea \n     what it was doing in South Vietnam. My country let me \n     scream to my heart's content--the same country that \n     produced both Al Kroboth and me.\n       Now, at this moment in New Jersey, I come to a conclusion \n     about my actions as a young man when Vietnam was a dirty word \n     to me. I wish I'd led a platoon of marines in Vietnam. I \n     would like to think I would have trained my troops well and \n     that the Viet Cong would have had their hands full if they \n     entered a firefight with us. From the day of my birth, I was \n     programmed to enter the Marine Corps. I was the son of a \n     marine fighter pilot, and I had grown up on marine bases \n     where I had watched the men of the corps perform simulated \n     war games in the forests of my childhood. That a novelist and \n     poet bloomed darkly in the house of Santini strikes me as a \n     remarkable irony. My mother and father had raised me to be an \n     Al Kroboth, and during the Vietnam era they watched in horror \n     as I metamorphosed into another breed of fanatic entirely. I \n     understand now that I should have protested the war after my \n     return from Vietnam, after I had done my duty for my country. \n     I have come to a conclusion about my country that I knew then \n     in my bones but lacked the courage to act on: America is good \n     enough to die for even when she is wrong.\n       I looked for some conclusion, a summation of this trip to \n     my teammate's house. I wanted to come to the single right \n     thing, a true thing that I may not like but that I could live \n     with. After hearing Al Kroboth's story of his walk across \n     Vietnam and his brutal imprisonment in the North, I found \n     myself passing harrowing, remorseless judgment on myself. I \n     had not turned out to be the man I had once envisioned myself \n     to be. I thought I would be the kind of man that America \n     could point to and say, ``There. That's the guy. That's the \n     one who got it right. The whole package. The one I can depend \n     on.'' It had never once occurred to me that I would find \n     myself in the position I did on that night in Al Kroboth's \n     house in Roselle, New Jersey: an American coward spending the \n     night with an American hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10910-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CLAYTON O. MITCHELL, JR., CIVIL \n                   ENGINEER CORPS, UNITED STATES NAVY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I take this \nopportunity to recognize and bid farewell to an outstanding naval \nofficer, Lieutenant Commander Clayton O. Mitchell, Jr., upon his \ndeparture from my staff. Lieutenant Commander Mitchell has truly \nepitomized the ``Can Do'' spirit of the Seabees and Navy core values of \nhonor, courage, and commitment during his assignment as a Navy \nLegislative Fellow on my staff. He has been a valued team member who \nhas had an enduring impact upon the State of Mississippi. He will be \nsorely missed.\n  Lieutenant Commander Mitchell reported to my staff from Naval Mobile \nConstruction Battalion Seventy Four, a Seabee battalion homeported in \nmy home State of Mississippi. As operations officer for the \n``Fearless'' Seabees of NMCB 74, he directed the military and \nconstruction operations for the unit at 11 deployment sites throughout \nthe Atlantic coast, Caribbean, and Central America in addition to \nleading disaster recovery efforts in the aftermath of hurricane \nGeorges. He spearheaded recovery operations which helped clear roads \nand restore vital services at Construction Battalion Center Gulfport \nand the Mississippi Gulf Coast within 24 hours.\n  Lieutenant Commander Mitchell is a 1985 industrial engineering \ngraduate of California Polytechnic State University (Cal-Poly), San \nLuis Obispo. He was commissioned as an Ensign through the Officer \nCandidate School at Newport, Rhode Island after working two years as an \nengineer for Rockwell International. He began his career as a Navy \nCivil Engineer Corps officer with Chesapeake Division, Naval Facilities \nEngineering Command as the Assistant Resident Officer in Charge of \nConstruction, Andrews AFB, Maryland. He then reported to Naval Mobile \nConstruction Battalion Forty for two nine month deployments which \nincluded Assistant Officer in Charge, Detail Sigonella, Sicily and \nOfficer in Charge, Detail Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean \nTerritories.\n  After his first Seabee tour with NMCB Forty, Lieutenant Commander \nMitchell then attended the University of California at Berkeley, \nearning a Master of Science degree in civil engineering. He followed \nBerkeley with an assignment to the United States Naval Academy as Shops \nEngineer in the Public Works Department, directing a 270 member \nworkforce responsible for the Academy's facilities maintenance, \ntransportation, and utilities operations.\n  His next challenge was as Facilities Planning Officer, Public Works \nCenter, Yokosuka, Japan. In this capacity, he directed a host nation \nconstruction program with over $1.7 billion in projects under design \nand/or construction. He spearheaded execution of some of the Navy's \nmost critical projects in Japan, including the delivery of 854 family \nhousing units with the completion of the $1 billion Ikego family \nhousing complex and a $41 million carrier pier at Yokosuka. For nine \nmonths during this tour, Lieutenant Commander Mitchell also served as \nStaff Civil Engineer to the Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Japan, where \nhe was the Navy's ``go to'' man for facilities and civil engineering \nissues.\n  Lieutenant Commander Mitchell has also made a significant impact in \nthe various communities in which he has served. He directed a \nMids'N'Kids tutorial/mentorship program, providing Annapolis youth with \na midshipman sponsor and access to Naval Academy facilities on a weekly \nbasis during the school year. As treasurer for the Samuel P. Massie \nEducational Endowment, he distributed over $35,000 in scholarship \nawards to Maryland college and university students. In 1995, he was \nrecognized as the ``Volunteer of the Week for Father's Day'' by the \nAnnapolis Capitol newspaper for his contributions in the community. In \n1997, he was recognized by Black Engineer magazine with an ``Engineer \nof the Year: Special Recognition Award'' as one of the nation's \npromising young engineers of the future.\n  On my staff, he has established himself as a consummate professional \nproviding guidance and oversight on a plethora of Department of Defense \nissues ranging from Defense health care, military construction, \nshipbuilding, and various weapons systems programs. His efforts also \nyielded over $100 million in research, development, test, and \nevaluation funds for Mississippi Universities.\n  Lieutenant Commander Mitchell is married to the former Karen Elaine \nBlackwell of Washington, D.C. and their family includes daughter, \nKendra and son, Austin. He is a registered professional engineer in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia and a Seabee Combat Warfare qualified officer \nwho enthusiastically returns to his Navy. I have appreciated greatly \nLieutenant Commander Mitchell's contributions to my team and wish him \nfair winds and following seas in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10910-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10910-S10911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN C. NUNEZ, NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE \n                         ADMINISTRATION (NASA)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding NASA Manager, Stephen C. Nunez, upon his \ndeparture from my staff. Mr. Nunez was selected as a NASA Congressional \nFellow to work in my office because of his knowledge of the aerospace \nindustry, NASA programs, and NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center in my \nhome state of Mississippi. It is a privilege for me to recognize the \nmany outstanding achievements he has provided for the United States \nSenate, NASA, and our great Nation.\n  During his NASA fellowship, Mr. Nunez worked on legislation affecting \nNASA, the aerospace industry, and veterans. He worked hard to ensure \nthe NASA Authorization Bill and the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies \nAppropriation Bill for fiscal year 2001 included legislative provisions \nthat will lead to the next generation of reusable launch vehicles. \nThese initiatives will reduce the cost of getting payloads into orbit \nby a factor of 10. These provisions also support specific programs \naimed at fostering the development of a robust U.S. propulsion \nindustry, which includes rocket engine testing at the Stennis Space \nCenter. Specifically, he helped ensure that NASA's Space Launch \nInitiative was fully funded in fiscal year 2001 at $290 million.\n  Mr. Nunez also worked to ensure that legislative provisions were \nincluded in\n\n[[Page S10911]]\n\nboth bills to support robust funding of the Commercial Remote Sensing \nProgram to enable a $10 billion commercial remote sensing industry by \n2010. He assisted greatly in the economic development in the State of \nMississippi by bringing Aerospace companies and Mississippi Economic \nDevelopment officials together.\n  Mr. Nunez worked with former Congressman G. V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery \nto enhance the educational benefits of the Montgomery G.I. bill through \nS. 1402, the ``Veterans and Dependents Millennium Education Act.'' He \nalso worked with the Veterans Administration to open more Community \nBased Outpatient Clinics in Mississippi.\n  Mr. Nunez began his aerospace career as a contract engineer \nsupporting the Space Shuttle Main Engine Test Program at NASA's Stennis \nSpace Center shortly after graduating from Mississippi State \nUniversity, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil \nEngineering. He joined NASA as a systems engineer supporting various \npropulsion development programs at Stennis Space Center, including the \nSpace Transportation Main Engine and Space Shuttle Main Engine. He then \ntook on additional responsibilities as Chief Engineer for various \ncomponent and hybrid motor development test programs, including the \nfirst ever successful tests of a turbopump-fed hybrid motor. His next \nchallenge was project lead for test program support of Boeing's Phase I \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Low Cost Concept Validation Program. \nThe test program support was completed under budget and ahead of \nschedule. This program demonstrated water recovery of a Space Shuttle \nMain Engine propulsion module and culminated in a successful hot fire \ntest after the propulsion module was dropped into the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Mr. Nunez is no stranger to Washington, D.C. where he served a one \nyear detail to the Associate Administrator for the Office of Space \nFlight at NASA Headquarters. Prior to starting his Congressional \nFellowship, Mr. Nunez served as X-33 Project Manager at Stennis Space \nCenter where he was responsible for all reusable launch vehicle \ninitiatives there totaling $35 million. As X-33 Project Manager, he led \na team of engineers and technicians in the successful test firing of \nthe X-33 Linear Aerospike Engine, whose success has been a major \nhighlight of the X-33 Program.\n  A native Mississippian, Mr. Nunez is married to the former Cynthia \nMarlene Cuevas of Leetown, Mississippi. They have one son, Stephen C. \nNunez, II. Mr. Nunez is a registered Professional Engineer in \nMississippi who looks forward to returning to the NASA team. I will \ntruly miss his talents and expertise, and wish him all the very best as \nhe helps NASA's efforts to advance human space flight in the 21st \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10911-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer sincere thanks and \ngratitude for the cooperation and leadership demonstrated this year in \nSouth Dakota by a large coalition of farm, conservation, wildlife, and \nenvironmental groups in my great State. These groups have taken an \nalmost unprecedented step to cooperate in solving a problem concerning \nthe treatment of wetlands in the context of production agriculture in \nSouth Dakota.\n  Their cooperation led to the adoption of a pilot project--the \nConservation of Farmable Wetland Act of 2000--negotiated through \nCongress by Senator Daschle and me whereby farmed wetlands in a six-\nstate region can become eligible for enrollment in the Conservation \nReserve Program (CRP).\n  When it comes to conservation policy and the federal farm program, \nmany issues are hotly debated. Perhaps nowhere has this become more \nevident than in the administration and policy implications of managing \nwetlands on farmground in South Dakota and the entire country. A real \nbattle over the management of farmed wetlands has waged over the years \nbetween farmers--who own and farm the productive land where these \nwetlands are located--and conservation groups--who believe these \nwetlands should be maintained in their natural state.\n  Earlier this year, over thirty South Dakota groups struck an \nagreement in principle regarding the treatment of wetlands with some \nconstructive ideas to signify a cease fire of sorts in this battle over \nthe management of wetlands. Their agreement in principle expressed \nsupport for financial assistance\n\n[[Page S10912]]\n\nfor farmers and landowners who voluntarily chose to commit the wetlands \non their private lands--primarily land in crop production--to \nconservation under CRP. The farmable wetlands targeted in their \nagreement are located in low-lying draws or waterways that run through \ncrop fields and carry runoff and topsoil into creeks and rivers in wet \nyears. In dry years, these wetlands are farmed. Currently, grass filter \nstrips surrounding these farmed wetlands qualify for CRP, but not the \nactual wetland acreage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement in \nprinciple and name of every group signing the agreement be printed at \nthis point in the Record, and that my statement continue in the Record \nat the conclusion of the agreement in principle and list of groups.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Agreement in Principle Between Central Plains Water Development \n District; Clay County Conservation District; Clay County Farm Bureau; \n Delta Waterfowl Foundation; Ducks Unlimited, Inc., East Dakota Water \n   Development District; Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe; Izaak Walton \n League, Kempeska Chapter; Izaak Walton League, South Dakota District; \n   James River Water Development District; National Audubon Society; \n  Sierra Club-East River Group; Sierra Club-Living River Group; South \nDakota Association of Conservation Districts; South Dakota Corn Growers \n   Association; South Dakota Department of Agriculture; South Dakota \n     Department of Environment and Natural Resources; South Dakota \n  Department of Game, Fish and Parks; South Dakota Farm Bureau; South \n Dakota Farmers Union; South Dakota Grassland Coalition; South Dakota \n   Lakes and Streams Association, Inc.; South Dakota Pork Producers \n    Council; South Dakota Resources Coalition; South Dakota Soybean \n Association; South Dakota Stock Growers; South Dakota Water Congress; \nSouth Dakota Wheat Inc.; South Dakota Wildlife Federation; The Wildlife \n  Society, South Dakota Chapter; Turner County Conservation District; \n  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Vermillion Basin Water Development \n          District; and Vermillion River Watershed Authority.\n\n\n                                purpose\n\n       This memorandum is made by the organizations listed above, \n     hereinafter called the partners, to express support for \n     financial assistance to landowners who voluntarily choose to \n     maintain wetlands on private lands and retire them from crop \n     production in the Prairie Pothole Region of South Dakota, \n     North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa and Montana. The people of this \n     partnership are united in their belief that programs should \n     be available that compensate landowners who voluntarily \n     commit their wetlands to conservation. We offer specific \n     suggestions that certain wetlands be eligible for enrollment \n     under the USDA Conservation Reserve Program, continuous sign \n     up for buffers and filter strips and that incidental, after \n     harvest grazing be better accommodated on these filter strips \n     and buffers.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The Prairie Pothole Region of South Dakota, North Dakota, \n     Minnesota, Iowa and Montana is a unique region of diverse \n     wetlands on an agricultural, prairie landscape. Wetlands in \n     this region function as habitat for wildlife and they retain \n     runoff waters, sediments and pollutants. They interact with \n     ground water and they play a role in protection of the \n     quality and quantity of water used in homes, farms, ranches \n     and industry throughout the region and beyond.\n       Most wetlands in the region are small, temporary wetlands. \n     They typically hold water for only a few weeks after spring \n     runoff and for short periods of time after heavy \n     precipitation events. Many non-depressional wetlands in the \n     region are the headwaters of major streams and rivers that \n     reach across the North American continent. When they are dry, \n     most temporary wetlands in agricultural fields are farmed.\n       The Prairie Pothole Region is also a region of deep rich \n     soils and is recognized worldwide for its strong, diverse \n     agricultural industry and abundant wildlife resources, which \n     are second to none.\n       For decades wetland interests have often differed with \n     agriculture and other development interests. While wetlands \n     are valuable to society for the functions they provide, the \n     cost of maintaining these values is often borne by those who \n     own or farm the land. In the Prairie Pothole Region, most of \n     the land is privately owned by farmers and ranchers, some \n     whom find wetlands to be a hindrance to the efficient use of \n     their land for cropping. In recent years they have been bound \n     by legislation which prevents them from converting wetlands \n     for agricultural development while retaining Federal farm \n     benefits.\n       The USDA Conservation Reserve Program, established by the \n     Food Security Act of 1985, provides annual payments to \n     landowners who voluntarily retire qualifying lands from \n     agricultural production for 10 or 15 years. Later farm acts \n     provided for continuous CRP sign ups for environmentally \n     sensitive lands and lands that contribute to water quality \n     improvement such as riparian buffers and filter strips around \n     wetlands.\n       In the Prairie Pothole Region, continuous sign up CRP for \n     filter strips and buffers has not been widely used. One major \n     obstacle to participation is that present USDA rules allow \n     enrollment of a buffer or filter strip around a wetland, but \n     have no provision for including the wetland acreage within \n     the buffer or filter strip to be enrolled for payment. While \n     this may be appropriate for lakes, rivers and deep permanent \n     wetlands, it is not a good fit for the small frequently \n     farmed wetlands of the Prairie Pothole Region.\n       In the prairie states, like elsewhere, farmers and ranchers \n     typically move livestock into harvested grain fields to feed \n     on waste grain and other crop residues. In fields where there \n     are CRP filter strips or buffers, livestock grazing after \n     harvest also graze the dormant grass of the filter strips and \n     buffers unless they are fenced out. To avoid the need for \n     this fencing, present USDA rules permit incidental grazing on \n     buffers and filter strips, in conjunction with after harvest \n     grazing of crop residues, for no more than two months. CRP \n     payments are reduced by 25% for years when such grazing takes \n     place.\n       In many years, winter weather sets in soon after harvest is \n     complete and two months is an adequate time limit for after \n     harvest grazing and incidental filter strip and buffer \n     grazing. During open winters, however, when little or no snow \n     falls, crop residue grazing may take place for more than two \n     months. During these winters, incidental livestock use of \n     those portions of fields enrolled in CRP filter strips and \n     buffers could put the operator out of compliance with CRP \n     rules.\n       Under the present rules, a person may enroll land around a \n     wetland in a filter strip or buffer, but the wetland within \n     must be excluded from the rental payment, even if that \n     wetland is one that is frequently farmed when dry and the \n     owner may be physically able to farm it, no payment is made \n     for the wetland acreage.\n       To make the wetland protection measures of the continuous \n     sign up CRP wetland buffer and filter strips more effective, \n     USDA rules need to be changed so that frequently farmed \n     wetlands are included in the continuous sign up CRP program \n     in addition to the surrounding filter strip or buffer.\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       The partners recommend to the USDA that continuous sign up \n     CRP rules be amended to allow wetlands with a cropping \n     history, regardless of size, to be enrolled in the CRP along \n     with adequate buffers and filter strips to protect the \n     quality of water entering and leaving the enrolled wetlands. \n     We also recommend that restrictions on duration of incidental \n     grazing of filter strips and buffers, associated with after \n     harvest grazing, be removed and that payment rates be \n     adjusted for those years when grazing occurs.\n       These rule changes will allow participating landowners to \n     realize a degree of compensation for income lost by leaving \n     these wetlands uncultivated when dry and will allow farm \n     operators to graze crop residues in certain years without \n     fencing out buffers and filer strips enrolled in continuous \n     enrollment CRP. This suggested change does not imply that \n     filter strip or buffer grazing be allowed during the growing \n     season, nor on other CRP acres.\n       We further recommend that USDA modify their specifications \n     for filter strips around wetlands and buffer strips along \n     riparian areas to make them more compatible with today's \n     farming practices and machinery. We recommend that maximum \n     allowable widths of these strips be adjusted with \n     consideration for farmability of adjacent cropland and to \n     protect wetlands and enhance wildlife habitat.\n       We recommend that USDA re-evaluate soil group rental \n     payments for wetlands, filter strips and buffers for the \n     continuous sign up CRP. Present rental rates do not \n     adequately address the true value of wetland soils which are \n     on the low end of rental payment schedules. Present soil \n     rental rates do not take into account severance factors \n     associated with the relatively small acreage that would be \n     enrolled in a wetland/filter strip continuous CRP.\n       We recommend that selected members of the partner agencies \n     and organizations listed in this agreement shall have input \n     into USDA policy before final CRP rules are issued to assure \n     that these recommendations are considered.\n\n\n      south dakota crp-wetlands agreement in principle signatories\n\n       Roger Strom, Clay County Conservation District.\n       Jerry Schmitz, Clay County Farm Bureau.\n       Lloyd Jones, Delta Waterfowl Foundation.\n       Jeff Nelson, Ducks Unlimited, Inc.\n       Jay Gilbertson, East Dakota Water Development District.\n       Wes Hansen, Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe.\n       Ken Madison, Izaak Walton League, Kempeska Chapter.\n       Chuck Clayton, Izaak Walton League, South Dakota Division.\n       Darrell Raschke, James River Water Development District.\n       Genevieve Thompson, National Audubon Society.\n       Jeanie Chamness, Sierra Club, East River Group.\n       John Davidson, Sierra Club, Living River Group.\n       Gerald Thaden, South Dakota Association of Conservation \n     Districts.\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\n       Ron Olson, South Dakota Corn Growers Association.\n       Darrell Cruea, South Dakota Department of Agriculture.\n       Nettie Myers, South Dakota Department of Environment and \n     Natural Resources.\n       John Cooper, South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and \n     Parks.\n       Michael Held, South Dakota Farm Bureau.\n       Dennis Wiese, South Dakota Farmers Union.\n       Ron Ogren, South Dakota Grassland Coalition.\n       Don Marquart, South Dakota Lakes and Streams Association, \n     Inc.\n       Mari Beth Baumberger, South Dakota Pork Producers Council.\n       Lawrence Novotny, South Dakota Resources Coalition.\n       Delbert Tschakert, South Dakota Soybean Association.\n       Bart Blum, South Dakota Stockgrowers.\n       Rick Vallery, South Dakota Wheat, Inc.\n       Chris Hesla, South Dakota Wildlife Federation.\n       Ron Schauer, Wildlife Society, South Dakota Chapter.\n       Dennis Johnson, Turner County Conservation District.\n       Carl Madsen, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n       Amond Hanson, Vermillion Basin Water Development District.\n       Lester Austin, Vermillion River Watershed Authority.\n       David Hauschild, Central Planes Water Development District \n     and South Dakota Water Congress.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, given that over thirty groups and several \nmore individuals were active participants in this historic agreement in \nSouth Dakota--it is impossible to aptly recognize every single one that \ndeserves credit for this achievement. However, I cannot overlook the \nefforts of two real champions of this agreement and pilot project--two \nindividuals who worked closely with me to make sure their idea \ndeveloped from a South Dakota agreement to a six-state pilot project \nthat the 106th Congress enacted and that the President will sign into \nlaw.\n  Paul Shubeck, a Centerville, South Dakota farmer and Carl Madsen, a \nBrookings, South Dakota private lands coordinator for the Fish and \nWildlife Service developed this plan and helped negotiate its path \nthrough Congress.\n  Paul Shubeck greatly impressed me with his ability to shepherd this \nproposal, not only within a diverse coalition of South Dakota groups \nwho normally do not tend to agree on wetlands matters, but also at the \nnational level where he consistently advocated on behalf of the \nAmerican family farmer who just wants a chance to produce a crop on his \nland and protect the environment all at the same time. Paul's drive and \nability to compromise were key to the success of our pilot project.\n  Carl Madsen was a real source of passion for this project and \nprovided us with a sense for the big picture--how our pilot would and \ncould work in South Dakota and other parts of the United States. Carl's \ndeep knowledge of wetlands and conservation policy provided us with \ncritical technical assistance to ensure this pilot project was a \ncredible, practical program.\n  Many, many more individuals and groups in South Dakota and the United \nStates provided direct assistance to this effort Mr. President, and I \nwant them all to know I am deeply grateful.\n  Earlier this year Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I urged \nSecretary Dan Glickman and the United States Department of Agriculture \n(USDA) to implement the South Dakota agreement in principle on an \nadministrative basis. While USDA was supportive of the concept, they \nwere reluctant to implement such a program without a clearer \nunderstanding of the purpose and implications of the program.\n  In response, on July 7, I brought a top USDA official to a farm near \nRenner, South Dakota where we met with several groups and individuals \nto discuss how to conserve these critical wetlands yet compensate \nfarmers for taking the wetlands out of crop production. It was there \nthat some suggested a pilot project would be the best route to take. \nThen, on July 27, Senator Daschle and I introduced S. 2980 to create a \nSouth Dakota pilot project permitting up to 150,000 acres of farmable \nwetlands into CRP.\n  Once S. 2980 was introduced, national conservation, wildlife, and \nfarm organizations took interest and requested that we expand the pilot \nto cover more than South Dakota. The proposal adopted by Congress is \nthe result of weeks of negotiations between Senator Daschle, myself, \nUSDA, Senator Lugar who serves as the Chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, and several national groups who now support the \npilot. The changes resulted in expanding this program to the Prairie \nPothole Region of the United States, including South Dakota, North \nDakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Montana. It is limited to \n500,000 acres in those states, with an assurance that access be \ndistributed fairly among interested CRP participants.\n  I truly believe this pilot project will provide landowners an \nalternative to farming these highly sensitive wetlands in order to \nachieve a number of benefits including; improved water quality, reduced \nsoil erosion, enhanced wildlife habitat, preserved biodiversity, flood \ncontrol, less wetland drainage, economic compensation for landowners \nfor protecting the sensitive wetlands, and diminished divisiveness over \nwetlands issues.\n  Moreover, the pilot project is consistent with the purpose of CRP, \nand, if successful, could serve as a model for future farm policy as we \nlook toward the next farm bill. I believe Congress will be unable to \ndevelop a future farm bill without the support of those in the \nconservation and wildlife community. I am a strong supporter of \nconservation programs that protect sensitive soil and water resources, \npromote wildlife habitat, and provide farmers and landowners with \nbenefits and incentives to conserve land. I have introduced the Flex \nFallow Farm Bill Amendment to achieve some of these objectives. It is \nmy hope that the success on our pilot project can serve as a model to \nonce again bring conservation groups together with farm interests in \norder to develop a well-balanced approach to future farm policy that \nprotects our resources while promoting family-farm agriculture.\n  Finally, I fully understand the successful adoption of this wetlands \npilot project--no matter how important--will not put an end to the \nongoing debate over the management of wetlands on farmland. Yet, I \nreally hope that everyone engaged in the debate considers how effective \nwe can be when we cooperate and compromise on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10913-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10913-S10919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PASSAGE OF CERTAIN LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we consider four bipartisan bills \noffered together as a package: the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor \nAct, H.R. 46, the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, which I introduced as \nS. 1314, on July 1, 1999, with Senator DeWine and is now also co-\nsponsored by Senators Robb, Hatch and Abraham; a Hatch-Leahy-Schumer \n``Internet Security Act'' amendment; and a Bayh-Grams-Leahy-Cleland \n``Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act'' amendment. I thank my colleagues \nfor their hard work on these pieces of legislation, each of which I \nwill discuss in turn.\n  I support the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor. I cosponsored the \nStevens bill, S. 39, to establish a Public Safety Medal of Valor Act. \nIn April and May, 1999, I made sure that the Senate acted on Senator \nStevens' bill, S. 39.\n  On April 22, 1999, the Senate Judiciary Committee took up that \nmeasure in regular order and reported it unanimously. At that time I \ncongratulated Senator Stevens and thanked him for his leadership. I \nnoted that we had worked together on a number of law enforcement \nmatters and that the senior Senator from Alaska is a stalwart supporter \nof the men and women who put themselves at risk to protect us all. I \nsaid that I looked forward to enactment of this measure and to seeing \nthe extraordinary heroism of our police, firefighters and correctional \nofficers recognized with the Medal of Valor.\n  In May, 1999, I was privileged to be on the floor of the Senate when \nwe proceeded to consider S. 39 and passed it unanimously. I took that \noccasion to commend Senator Stevens and all who had worked so hard to \nmove this measure in a timely way. That was over one year ago, during \nNational Police Week last year. The measure was sent to the House where \nit lay dormant for over the rest of last year and most of this one.\n  The President of the United States came to Capitol Hill to speak at \nthe Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Service on May 15, 2000, and said \non that occasion that if Congress would\n\n[[Page S10914]]\n\nnot act on the Medal of Valor, he was instructing the Attorney General \nto explore ways to award such recognition by Executive action.\n  Unfortunately, these calls for action did not waken the House from \nits slumber on this matter and the House of Representatives refused to \npass the Senate-passed Medal of Valor bill. Instead, over the past \nyear, the House has insisted that the Senate take up, fix and pass the \nHouse-passed version of this measure if it is to become law. House \nmembers have indicated that they are now prepared to accept the Senate-\npassed text, but insist that it be enacted under the House bill number. \nIn order to get this important measure to the President, that is what \nwe are doing today. We are discharging the House-passed version of that \nbill, H.R. 46, from the Judiciary Committee, adopting a complete \nsubstitute to bring it into conformance with the Stevens bill, S. 39, \nand sending it back to the House.\n  Senator Stevens' version of this bill which I cosponsored is \npreferable to the House-passed bill, H.R. 46, and I am pleased that the \nversion we pass today conforms to the Senate version.\n  For example, the House-passed version would limit the number of \npossible recipients of the Medal of Valor to 5 in any given year. The \nStevens bill had allowed for up to 10 in any year. There is no \nrequirement that the Board select the maximum possible recipients in \nany year, but I fear that 5 may be an artificially low ceiling for \nextraordinary valor across this country. I would not want officers from \nrural areas to be slighted because of such a low number. I would not \nwant firefighters or correctional officers to be slighted. In addition, \nI can imagine a year where an incident involves a group of officers, \nmaybe even a group numbering more than 5, and recognition of those \ninvolved in a single incident could consume all 5 of the awards allowed \nby the substitute that year and leave others, even others from that \nincident, without recognition. I believe that the Senate had it right \nthe first time and is getting it right in the version we pass today.\n  In addition, the House-passed version omits any reference to a role \nfor the Board in the creation of criteria and procedures for \nrecommendations of nominees. The Senate-passed bill would have required \nthe concurrence of the Board in the National Medal of Valor Office's \nestablishing of those criteria. Again, I believe the Senate had it \nright and that is the version we pass today.\n  I hope that the proponents of proceeding in this manner and of making \nthese changes in the language of the bill will explain to the Senate \nand the American people why we have had to wait over a year for action, \nwhy the Senate is being asked to act a second time on a bill strikingly \nsimilar to S. 39 but under a House number, and why each of these \nchanges are necessary. I wish the House would have just passed S. 39.\n  The information age is filled with unlimited potential for good, but \nit also creates a variety of new challenges for law enforcement. A \nrecent survey by the FBI and the Computer Security Institute found that \n62 percent of information security professionals reported computer \nsecurity breaches in the past year. These breaches in computer security \nresulted in financial losses of more than $120 million from fraud, \ntheft of information, sabotage, computer viruses, and stolen laptops. \nComputer crime has become a multi-billion dollar problem.\n  Many of us have worked on these issues for years. In 1984, we passed \nthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to criminalize conduct when carried \nout by means of unauthorized access to a computer. In 1986, we passed \nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA, which I was proud to \nsponsor, to criminalize tampering with electronic mail systems and \nremote data processing systems and to protect the privacy of computer \nusers. In 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \nincluded the Computer Abuse Amendments which I authored to make illegal \nthe intentional transmission of computer viruses.\n\n  In the 104th Congress, Senators Kyl, Grassley and I worked together \nto enact the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act to \nincrease protection under federal criminal law for both government and \nprivate computers, and to address an emerging problem of computer-age \nblackmail in which a criminal threatens to harm or shut down a computer \nsystem unless their extortion demands are met. In the 105th Congress, \nSenators Kyl and I also worked together on criminal copyright \namendments that became law to enhance the protection of copyrighted \nworks online.\n  The Congress must be constantly vigilant to keep the law up-to-date \nwith technology. The Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, and the \nHatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Internet Security Act'' amendment are part of \nthat ongoing effort. These complementary pieces of legislation reflect \ntwin-track progress against computer crime: More tools at the federal \nlevel and more resources for local computer crime enforcement. The fact \nthat this is a bipartisan effort is good for technology policy.\n  But make no mistake about it: even with passage of this legislation, \nthere is more work to be done--both to assist law enforcement and to \nsafeguard the privacy and other important constitutional rights of our \ncitizens. I wish that the Congress had also tackled online privacy in \nthis session, but that will now be punted into the next congressional \nsession.\n  The legislation before us today does not attempt to resolve every \nissue. For example, both the Senate and the House held hearings this \nsession about the FBI's Carnivore program. Carnivore is a computer \nprogram designed to advance criminal investigations by capturing \ninformation in Internet communications pursuant to court orders. Those \nhearings sparked a good debate about whether advances in technology, \nlike Carnivore, require Congress to pass new legislation to assure that \nour private Internet communications are protected from government over-\nreaching while protecting the government's right to investigate crime. \nI look forward to our discussion of these privacy issues in the next \nCongress.\n  The Computer Crime Enforcement Act is intended to help states and \nlocal agencies in fighting computer crime. All 50 states have now \nenacted tough computer crime control laws. They establish a firm \ngroundwork for electronic commerce, an increasingly important sector of \nthe nation's economy.\n  Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are \nstruggling to afford the high cost of enforcing their state computer \ncrime statutes.\n  Earlier this year, I released a survey on computer crime in Vermont. \nMy office surveyed 54 law enforcement agencies in Vermont--43 police \ndepartments and 11 State's attorney offices--on their experience \ninvestigating and prosecuting computer crimes. The survey found that \nmore than half of these Vermont law enforcement agencies encounter \ncomputer crime, with many police departments and state's attorney \noffices handling 2 to 5 computer crimes per month.\n  Despite this documented need, far too many law enforcement agencies \nin Vermont cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes. \nIndeed, my survey found that 98 percent of the responding Vermont law \nenforcement agencies do not have funds dedicated for use in computer \ncrime enforcement. My survey also found that few law enforcement \nofficers in Vermont are properly trained in investigating computer \ncrimes and analyzing cyber-evidence.\n  According to my survey, 83 percent of responding law enforcement \nagencies in Vermont do not employ officers properly trained in computer \ncrime investigative techniques. Moreover, my survey found that 52 \npercent of the law enforcement agencies that handle one or more \ncomputer crimes per month cited their lack of training as a problem \nencountered during investigations. Without the necessary education, \ntraining and technical support, our law enforcement officers are and \nwill continue to be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down on \ncomputer crimes.\n  I crafted the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to address \nthis problem. The bill would authorize a $25 million Department of \nJustice grant program to help states prevent and prosecute computer \ncrime. Grants under our bipartisan bill may be used to provide \neducation, training, and enforcement programs for local law enforcement \nofficers and prosecutors in\n\n[[Page S10915]]\n\nthe rapidly growing field of computer criminal justice. Our legislation \nhas been endorsed by the Information Technology Association of America \nand the Fraternal Order of Police. This is an important bipartisan \neffort to provide our state and local partners in crime-fighting with \nthe resources they need to address computer crime.\n  The Internet Security Act of 2000 makes progress to ensure that we \nare properly dealing with the increase in computer crime. I thank and \ncommend Senators Hatch and Schumer for working with me and other \nMembers of the Judiciary Committee to address some of the serious \nconcerns we had with the first iteration of their bill, S. 2448, as it \nwas originally introduced.\n  Specifically, as introduced, S. 2448 would have over-federalized \nminor computer abuses. Currently, federal jurisdiction exists for a \nvariety of computer crimes if, and only if, such criminal offenses \nresult in at least $5,000 of damage or cause another specified injury, \nincluding the impairment of medical treatment, physical injury to a \nperson or a threat to public safety. S. 2448, as introduced, would have \neliminated the $5,000 jurisdictional threshold and thereby criminalized \na variety of minor computer abuses, regardless of whether any \nsignificant harm resulted.\n  For example, if an overly-curious college sophomore checks a \nprofessor's unattended computer to see what grade he is going to get \nand accidently deletes a file or a message, current Federal law does \nnot make that conduct a crime. That conduct may be cause for discipline \nat the college, but not for the FBI to swoop in and investigate. Yet, \nunder the original S. 2448, as introduced, this unauthorized access to \nthe professor's computer would have constituted a federal crime.\n\n  Another example is that of a teenage hacker, who plays a trick on a \nfriend by modifying the friend's vanity Web page. Under current law, no \nfederal crime has occurred. Yet, under the original S. 2448, as \nintroduced, this conduct would have constituted a federal crime.\n  As America Online correctly noted in a June, 2000 letter, \n``eliminating the $5,000 threshold for both criminal and civil \nviolations would risk criminalizing a wide range of essentially benign \nconduct and engendering needless litigation. . . .'' Similarly, the \nInternet Alliance commented in a June, 2000 letter that ``[c]omplete \nabolition of the limit will lead to needless federal prosecution of \noften trivial offenses that can be reached under state law. . . .''\n  Those provisions were overkill. Our federal laws do not need to reach \neach and every minor, inadvertent and harmless computer abuse--after \nall, each of the 50 states has its own computer crime laws. Rather, our \nfederal laws need to reach those offenses for which federal \njurisdiction is appropriate.\n  Prior Congresses have declined to over-federalize computer offenses \nas proposed in S. 2448, as introduced, and sensibly determined that not \nall computer abuses warrant federal criminal sanctions. When the \ncomputer crime law was first enacted in 1984, the House Judiciary \nCommittee reporting the bill stated:\n\n       the Federal jurisdictional threshold is that there must be \n     $5,000 worth of benefit to the defendant or loss to another \n     in order to concentrate Federal resources on the more \n     substantial computer offenses that affect interstate or \n     foreign commerce. (H. Rep. 98-894, at p. 22, July 24, 1984).\n\n  Similarly, the Senate Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of \nSenator Thurmond, rejected suggestions in 1986 that ``the Congress \nshould enact as sweeping a Federal statute as possible so that no \ncomputer crime is potentially uncovered.'' (S. Rep. 99-432, at p. 4, \nSeptember 3, 1986).\n  The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer substitute amendment to S. 2448, which was \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on October 5th, \naddresses those federalism concerns by retaining the $5,000 \njurisdictional threshold in current law. That Committee-reported \nsubstitute amendment, with the additional refinements reflected in the \nHatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46, which \nthe Senate considers today, makes other improvements to the original \nbill and current law, as summarized below.\n  First, titles II, III, IV and V of the original bill, S. 2448, about \nwhich various problems had been raised, are eliminated. For example, \ntitle V of the original bill would have authorized the Justice \nDepartment to enter into Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLAT) with \nforeign governments that would allow the Attorney General broad \ndiscretion to investigate lawful conduct in the U.S. at the request of \nforeign governments without regard to whether the conduct investigated \nviolates any Federal computer crime law. In my view, that discretion \nwas too broad and troubling.\n  Second, the amendment includes an authorization of appropriations of \n$5 million to the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property (CCIP) \nsection within the Justice Department's Criminal Division and requires \nthe Attorney General to make the head of CCIP a ``Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General,'' which is not a Senate-confirmed position, in order \nto highlight the increasing importance and profile of this position. \nThis authorized funding level is consistent with an amendment I \nsponsored and circulated to Members of the Judiciary Committee to \nimprove S. 2448 and am pleased to see it incorporated into the Internet \nSecurity Act amendment to H.R. 46.\n  Third, the amendment modifies section 1030 of title 18, United States \nCode, in several important ways, including providing for increased and \nenhanced penalties for serious violations of federal computer crime \nlaws, clarifying the definitions of ``loss'' to ensure that the full \ncosts to a hacking victim are taken into account and of ``protected \ncomputer'' to facilitate investigations of international computer \ncrimes affecting the United States, and preserving the existing $5,000 \nthreshold and other jurisdictional prerequisites for violations of \nsection 1030(a)(5)--i.e., no Federal crime has occurred unless the \nconduct (1) causes loss to 1 or more persons during any 1-year period \naggregating at least $5,000 in value, (2) impairs the medical care of \nanother person, (3) causes physical injury to another person, (4) \nthreatens public health or safety, or (5) causes damage affecting a \ncomputer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of \nthe administration of justice, national defense, or national security.\n  The amendment clarifies the precise elements of the offense the \ngovernment must prove in order to establish a violation by moving these \nprerequisites from the current definition of ``damage'' to the \ndescription of the offense. In addition, the amendment creates a new \ncategory of felony violations where a hacker causes damage to a \ncomputer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of \nthe administration of justice, national defense, or national security.\n  Currently, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act provides for federal \ncriminal penalties for those who intentionally access a protected \ncomputer or cause an unauthorized transmission to a protected computer \nand cause damage. ``Protected computer'' is defined to include those \nthat are ``used in interstate or foreign commerce.'' See 18 U.S.C. \n1030(e)(2)(B). The amendment would clarify the definition of \n``protected computer'' to ensure that computers which are used in \ninterstate or foreign commerce but are located outside of the United \nStates are included within the definition of ``protected computer'' \nwhen those computers are used in a manner that affects interstate or \nforeign commerce or communication of this country. This will ensure \nthat our government will be able to conduct domestic investigations and \nprosecutions against hackers from this country who hack into foreign \ncomputer systems and against those hacking through the United States to \nother foreign venues. Moreover, by clarifying the fact that a domestic \noffense exists, the United States will be able to use speedier domestic \nprocedures in support of international hacker cases, and create the \noption of prosecuting such criminals in the United States.\n\n  The amendment also adds a definition of ``loss'' to the Computer \nFraud and Abuse Act. Current law defines the term ``damage'' to include \nimpairment of the integrity or availability of data, programs, systems \nor information causing a ``loss aggregating at least $5,000 in value \nduring any 1-year period to one or more individuals.'' See 18 U.S.C. \nSec.  1030(e)(8)(A). The new definition of ``loss'' to be added as \nsection 1030(e)(11) will ensure that the full\n\n[[Page S10916]]\n\ncosts to victims of responding to hacking offenses, conducting damage \nassessments, restoring systems and data to the condition they were in \nbefore an attack, as well as lost revenue and costs incurred because of \nan interruption in service, are all counted. This statutory definition \nis consistent with the definition of ``loss'' appended by the U.S. \nSentencing Commission to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (see \nU.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1 Commentary, Application note 2), and will help \nreconcile procedures by which prosecutors value loss for charging \npurposes and by which judges value loss for sentencing purposes. \nGetting this type of true accounting of ``loss'' is important because \nloss amounts can be used to calculate restitution and to determine the \nappropriate sentence for the perpetrator under the sentencing \nguidelines.\n  Fourth, subsection 3(e) of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security \nAct amendment to H.R. 46 clarifies the grounds for obtaining damages in \ncivil actions for violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. \nCurrent law authorizes a person who suffers ``damage or loss'' from a \nviolation of section 1030 to sue the violator for compensatory damages \nor injunctive or other equitable relief, and limits the remedy to \n``economic damages'' for violations ``involving damage as defined in \nsubsection (e)(8)(A),'' relating to violations of 1030(a)(5) that cause \nloss aggregating at least $5,000 during any 1-year period. To take \naccount of both the new definition of ``loss'' and the incorporation of \nthis jurisdictional threshold into the description of the offense \n(rather than the current definition of ``damage''), the amendment \nstrikes the reference to subsection (e)(8)(A) in the current civil \naction provision and retains Congress' previous intent to allow civil \nplaintiffs only economic damages for violations of section 1030(a)(5) \nthat do not also affect medical treatment, cause physical injury, \nthreaten public health and safety or affect computer systems used in \nfurtherance of the administration of justice, the national defense or \nnational security.\n  The Congress provided this civil remedy in the 1994 amendments to the \nAct, which I originally sponsored with Senator Gordon Humphrey, to \nenhance privacy protection for computer communications and the \ninformation stored on computers by encouraging institutions to improve \ncomputer security practices, deterring unauthorized persons from \ntrespassing on computer systems of others, and supplementing the \nresources of law enforcement in combating computer crime. [See The \nComputer Abuse Amendments Act of 1990: Hearing Before the Subcomm. On \nTechnology and the Law of the Senate Comm. On the Judiciary, 101st \nCong., 2nd Sess., S. Hrg. 101-1276, at pp. 69, 88, 92 (1990); see also \nStatement of Senator Humphrey, 136 Cong. Rec. S18235 (1990) (``Given \nthe Government's limited capacity to pursue all computer crime cases, \nthe existence of this limited civil remedy will serve to enhance \ndeterrence in this critical area.'')]. The ``new, civil remedy for \nthose harmed by violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act'' was \nintended to ``boost the deterrence of the statute by allowing aggrieved \nindividuals to obtain relief.'' [S. Rep. No. 101-544, 101st Cong., 2d \nSess., p. 6-7 ( 1990); see also Statement of Senator Leahy, 136 Cong. \nRec. S18234 (1990)]. We certainly and expressly did not want to ``open \nthe floodgates to frivolous litigation.'' [Statement of Senator Leahy, \n136 Cong. Rec. S4614 (1990)].\n  At the time the civil remedy provision was added to the Computer \nFraud and Abuse Act, this Act contained no prohibition against \nnegligently causing damage to a computer through unauthorized access, \nreflected in current law, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(5)(C). That \nprohibition was added only with subsequent amendments made in 1996, as \npart of the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. \nNevertheless, the civil remedy has been interpreted in some cases to \napply to the negligent manufacture of computer hardware or software. \nMost notably See, e.g., Shaw v. Toshiba America Information Systems, \nInc., NEC, 91 F. Supp. 2d 926 (E.D. TX 1999) (court interpreted the \nterm transmission to include sale of computers with a minor design \ndefect).\n  The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment adds a new \nsentence clarifying that civil actions may not be brought ``for the \nnegligent design or manufacture of computer hardware, computer \nsoftware, or firmware.'' This change should ensure that the civil \nremedy is a robust option for private enforcement actions, while \nlimiting its applicability to cases that are more appropriately \ngoverned by contractual warranties, state tort law and consumer \nprotection laws.\n  Fifth, sections 104 and 109 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet \nSecurity Act amendment to H.R. 46 authorize criminal and civil \nforfeiture of computers, equipment, and other personal property used to \nviolate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as real and personal \nproperty derived from the proceeds of computer crime. Property, both \nreal and personal, which is derived from proceeds traceable to a \nviolation of section 1030, is currently subject to both criminal and \ncivil forfeiture. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 981(a)(1)(C) and 982(a)(2)(B). \nThus, the amendment would clarify in section 1030 itself that \nforfeiture applies and extend the application of forfeiture to property \nthat is used or intended to be used to commit or to facilitate the \ncommission of a computer crime. In addition, to deter and prevent \npiracy, theft and counterfeiting of intellectual property, the section \n109 of the amendment allows forfeiture of devices, such as replicators \nor other devices used to copy or produce computer programs to which \ncounterfeit labels have been affixed.\n  The forfeiture amendments are based on the procedures set forth in \nsection 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act \nof 1970 (21 U.S.C. Sec. 853) and chapter 46 of title 18, as revised \nthis year by the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, and thereby \nbuild in all of the existing due process protections in existing law.\n  In particular, these provisions protect innocent property owners. \nSections 104 and 109 subject to forfeiture only property which belongs \nto the person who knowingly violated the law, not innocent third \nparties whose property unbeknownst to them was used to violate the law. \nUnder existing law, for example, a drug trafficker may avail herself of \nthe facilities of a telephone company to communicate with her source of \nnarcotics, send pager messages to drug confederates and signal the \nbuyer by beeper when the sale is ready to be consummated, but the law \ndoes not authorize forfeiture of the facilities of the telephone \ncompany which was neither aware of nor intended the drug deal. \nLikewise, a rogue employee of an Internet access provider or other \ncomputer hacker or cyber-criminal will almost necessarily use the \nfacilities of an Internet access provider to commit her violation, but \nSections 104 and 109 do not authorize forfeiture of the provider's \nfacilities simply because its facilities were used.\n\n  The criminal forfeiture provision in section 104 specifically states \nthat only the ``interest of such person,'' referring to the defendant \nwho committed the computer crime, is subject to forfeiture. Moreover, \nthe criminal forfeiture authorized by Sections 104 and 109 is made \nexpressly subject to Section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse \nPrevention and Control Act of 1970, but subsection (d) of section 413 \nis expressly exempted from application to Section 104 and 109. That \nsubsection (d) creates a rebuttable presumption of forfeiture in favor \nof the government where a person convicted of a felony acquired the \nproperty during the period that the crime was committed or within a \nreasonable time after such period and there was no likely source for \nsuch property other than the criminal violation. Thus, by making \nsubsection (d) inapplicable, Sections 104 and 109 make it more \ndifficult for the government to prove that the property should be \nforfeited.\n  Chapter 46 of title 18, to which the civil forfeiture provision of \nsection 104 is expressly made subject, provides property owners with \nimportant safeguards from unwarranted forfeitures and government \noverreaching. First, the civil forfeiture law states that ``[n]o \nproperty shall be forfeited . . . to the extent of the interest of an \nowner or lien holder by reason of any act or omission . . . to have \nbeen committed without the knowledge of that owner or lien holder.'' 18 \nU.S.C. Sec.  981(a)(2).\n\n[[Page S10917]]\n\nFurthermore, the chapter puts the burden on the government to prove \nforfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence, permits courts to \nappoint counsel to represent indigent owners where the owner is \nrepresented by a court-appointed attorney in a related federal criminal \ncase, and permits recovery of attorney fees and costs for property \nowners not appointed counsel if they substantially prevail on their \nclaim.\n  Sixth, the amendment contains certain provisions intended to deter \ncomputer crimes by juveniles. The amendment would permit federal \nprosecution, under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  5032, of juveniles as juveniles upon \ncertification by the Attorney General, after investigation, that the \noffense charged is one of the most serious felonious violations of our \nfederal computer crime laws and that there is a substantial Federal \ninterest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of Federal \njurisdiction. The computer crime offenses that would qualify for \nfederal prosecution of a juvenile offender as a juvenile are: \nviolations of 1030(a)(1) (accessing a computer and obtaining \ninformation relating to national security with reason to believe the \ninformation could be used to the injury of the United States or to the \nadvantage of a foreign nation and willfully retaining or transmitting \nthat information or attempting to do so); (a)(2)(B) (intentionally \naccessing without authorization a federal government computer and \nobtaining information); (a)(3) (intentionally accessing without \nauthorization a federal government computer and affecting the use by or \nfor the government); and (a)(5)(A)(i) (knowingly causing the \ntransmission of a program to intentionally cause damage without \nauthorization to a protected computer).\n  The amendment would also authorize a judge to exercise discretion and \nimpose as part of a sentence for a violation of the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act termination of or ineligibility for federal financial \nassistance for education at a post-secondary institution. The court is \nexpressly authorized to reinstate such eligibility upon motion of the \ndefendant.\n  Unlike the version reported by the Judiciary Committee, the amendment \ndoes not require that prior delinquency adjudications of juveniles for \nviolations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act be counted under the \ndefinition of ``conviction'' for purposes of enhanced penalties. This \nis an improvement that I urged since juvenile adjudications simply are \nnot criminal convictions. Juvenile proceedings are more informal than \nadult prosecutions and are not subject to the same due process \nprotections. Consequently, counting juvenile adjudications as a prior \nconviction for purposes of the recidivist sanctions under the amendment \nwould be unduly harsh and unfair. In any event, prior juvenile \ndelinquency adjudications are already subject to sentencing \nenhancements under certain circumstances under the Sentencing \nGuidelines. See, e.g., U.S.S.G. Sec.  411.2(d) (upward adjustments in \nsentences required for each juvenile sentence to confinement of at \nleast sixty days and for each juvenile sentence imposed within five \nyears of the defendant's commencement of instant offense).\n  Seventh, section 108 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act \namendment to H.R. 46 would authorize the interception of wire and oral \ncommunications relating to computer fraud and abuse violations by \nexpanding the enumerated list of predicate offenses that may support \nsuch authority to include felony violations of section 1030. Under \ncurrent law, federal investigators and prosecutors have the authority \nto obtain an order for interception of electronic communications, such \nas e-mail, when investigating any felony, including a felony violation \nof Section 1030. Current law, however, does not permit federal \ninvestigators and prosecutors to intercept wire or oral communications \nin investigations of such crimes.\n  Section 108 addresses this anomaly by adding felony violations of \nSection 1030 to the list of federal crimes for which federal law \nenforcement officials may seek evidence by intercepting wire or oral \ncommunications. Applications for such interception are to be governed \nby the same stringent Title III requirements that govern all such \napplications. See 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2510 et seq.\n  Some have objected to this provision, questioning the necessity of \nadding computer crimes to the list of crimes for which interception of \nwire and oral communications are authorized since this provision would, \nfor example, permit government wiretapping for some relatively minor \ncomputer felonies. I disagree. We have come to rely on computers for \neverything from banking and stock-trading to travel reservations to our \nmost intimate personal conversations with friends and family. \nOpportunists are exploiting our reliance on computers to advance \nfraudulent schemes or just for the sport of disruption. We have seen \nthe global havoc that is threatened by a lone hacker transmitting a \nsingle virus. Giving law enforcement a full complement of tools \nto fight computer crime serves to protect the security, confidentiality \nand privacy of our computer communications and stored electronic \ninformation. That there are some computer felonies that are less \nserious than other computer felonies that might not be as worthy of a \nwiretap is true of all felonies. The stringent procedural requirements \nfor wiretaps and the investment in time and resources necessary to \nexecute a wiretap within the bounds of the law provide incentive for \nlaw enforcement to make prudent use of this important investigative \ntool in computer fraud and abuse cases.\n\n  Developments in technology have placed wire, oral and electronic \ncommunications on more equal footing in terms of frequency of use, \nexpectation of privacy, and exploitation for criminal purposes. The law \nshould recognize that more equal footing, particularly for electronic \nmessages, and accord the same privacy safeguards to electronic \ncommunications as apply to both oral and wire communications. In fact, \nthe Administration has proposed such changes in the legislation \ntransmitted to the Congress in July, 2000 called the ``Enhancement of \nPrivacy and Public Safety in Cyberspace Act.'' For example, the \nAdministration's proposal would apply existing prerequisites for court-\nauthorized wire communications, such as high-level official approval \nand investigation of an enumerated predicate offense (rather than any \nfelony), to most electronic communications, such as e-mails and fax \ntransmissions. Unfortunately, as I have noted, we have been unable to \nreach a consensus on privacy legislation in general or on this more \nspecific instance where additional legislative attention is needed. \nThese are matters that should be addressed.\n  Eighth, the amendment changes a current directive to the Sentencing \nCommission enacted as section 805 of the Antiterrorism and Effective \nDeath Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132, that imposed a 6-month \nmandatory minimum sentence for any conviction of the sections \n1030(a)(4) or (a)(5) of title 18, United States code. The \nAdministration has noted that ``[i]n some instances, prosecutors have \nexercised their discretion and elected not to charge some defendants \nwhose actions otherwise would qualify them for prosecution under the \nstatute, knowing that the result would be mandatory imprisonment.'' \nClearly, mandatory imprisonment is not always the most appropriate \nremedy for a federal criminal violation, and the ironic result of this \n``get tough'' proposal has been to discourage prosecutions that might \notherwise have gone forward. The amendment eliminates that mandatory \nminimum term of incarceration for misdemeanor and less serious felony \ncomputer crimes.\n  Ninth, section 110 of the amendment directs the Sentencing Commission \nto review and, where appropriate, adjust sentencing guidelines for \ncomputer crimes to address a variety of factors, including to ensure \nthat the guidelines provide sufficiently stringent penalties to deter \nand punish persons who intentionally use encryption in connection with \nthe commission or concealment of criminal acts.\n  The Sentencing Guidelines already provide for enhanced penalties when \npersons obstruct or impede the administration of justice, see U.S.S.G. \nSec. 3C1.1, or engage in more than minimal planning, see U.S.S.G. \nSec. 2B1.1(b)(4)(A). As the use of encryption technology becomes more \nwidespread, additional guidance from the Sentencing Commission would be \nhelpful to determine the circumstances when such encryption use would \nwarrant a guideline adjustment. For example, if a defendant employs an \nencryption product that\n\n[[Page S10918]]\n\nworks automatically and transparently with a telecommunications service \nor software product, an enhancement for use of encryption may be not be \nappropriate, while the deliberate use of encryption as part of a \nsophisticated and intricate scheme to conceal criminal activity and \nmake the offense, or its extent, difficult to detect, may warrant a \nguideline enhancement either under existing guidelines or a new \nguideline.\n  Tenth, section 105 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act \namendment to H.R. 46 would eliminate certain statutory restrictions on \nthe authority of the United States Secret Service (``Secret Service''). \nUnder current law, the Secret Service is authorized to investigate \noffenses under six designated subsections of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030, \nsubject to agreement between the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nAttorney General: subsections (a)(2)(A) (illegally accessing a computer \nand obtaining financial information); (a)(2)(B) (illegally accessing a \ncomputer and obtaining information from a department or agency of the \nUnited States); (a)(3) (illegally accessing a non-public computer of a \ndepartment or agency of the United States either exclusively used by \nthe United States or used by the United States and the conduct affects \nthat use by or for the United States); (a)(4) (accessing a protected \ncomputer with intent to defraud and thereby furthering the fraud and \nobtaining a thing of value, unless the object of the fraud and the \nthing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value \nof such use is not more than $5,000 in a one-year period); (a)(5) \n(knowingly causing the transmission of a program, information, code or \ncommand and thereby intentionally and without authorization causing \ndamage to a protected computer; and illegally accessing a protected \ncomputer and causing damage recklessly or otherwise); and (a)(6) \n(trafficking in a password with intent to defraud).\n  The Secret Service is not authorized to investigate offenses under \nsubsection (a)(1) (accessing a computer and obtaining information \nrelating to national security with reason to believe the information \ncould be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of \na foreign nation and willfully retaining or transmitting that \ninformation or attempting to do so); (a)(2)(C) (illegally accessing a \nprotected computer and obtaining information where the conduct involves \nan interstate or foreign communication); and (a)(7) (transmitting a \nthreat to damage a protected computer with intent to extort).\n  Section 105 of the Internet Security Act removes these limitations on \nthe authority of the Secret Service and authorizes the Secret Service \nto investigate any offense under Section 1030 subject to agreement \nbetween the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General. Section \n105 also makes a stylistic change, describing the inter-agency \nagreement as ``between'' the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney \nGeneral rather than one ``which shall be entered into by'' them.\n  Prior to 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the \nSecret Service was authorized to investigate all violations of Section \n1030. According to the 1996 Committee Reports of the 104th Congress, \n2nd Session, the 1996 amendments attempted to concentrate the Secret \nService' s jurisdiction on certain subsections considered to be within \nthe Secret Service's traditional jurisdiction and not grant authority \nin matters with a national security nexus. According to the \nAdministration, which first proposed the elimination of these statutory \nrestrictions in connection with transmittal of its comprehensive crime \nbill, the ``21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act,'' \nhowever, these specific enumerations of investigative authority ``have \nthe potential to complicate investigations and impede interagency \ncooperation.'' (See Section-by-section Analysis, SEC. 3082, for ``21st \nCentury Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act'').\n\n  The current restrictions, for example, risk hindering the Secret \nService from investigating ``hacking'' into White House computers or \ninvestigating threats against the President that may be delivered by \nsuch a ``hacker,'' and fulfilling its mission to protect financial \ninstitutions and the nation's financial infrastructure. The provision \nthus modifies existing law to restore the Secret Service's authority to \ninvestigate violations of Section 1030, leaving it to the Departments \nof Treasury and Justice to determine between them how to allocate \nworkload and particular cases.\n  Eleventh, section 107 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security \nAct amendment would provide an additional defense to civil actions \nrelating to preserving records in response to government requests. \nCurrent law authorizes civil actions and criminal liability for \nunauthorized interference with or disclosures of electronically stored \nwire or electronic communications under certain circumstances. 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. Sec.  2701, et seq. A provision of that statutory scheme \nmakes clear that it is a complete defense to civil and criminal \nliability if the person or entity interfering with or attempting to \ndisclose a communication does so in good faith reliance on a court \nwarrant or order, grand jury subpoena, legislative or statutory \nauthorization. 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2707(e)(1).\n  Current law, however, does not address one scenario under which a \nperson or entity might also have a complete defense. A provision of the \nsame statutory scheme currently requires providers of wire or \nelectronic communication services and remote computing services, upon \nrequest of a governmental entity, to take all necessary steps to \npreserve records and other evidence in its possession for a renewal \nperiod of 90 days pending the issuance of a court order or other \nprocess requiring disclosure of the records or other evidence. 18 \nU.S.C. Sec.  2703(f). Section 2707(e)(1), which describes the \ncircumstances under which a person or entity would have a complete \ndefense to civil or criminal liability, fails to identify good faith \nreliance on a governmental request pursuant to Section 2703(f) as \nanother basis for a complete defense. Section 107 modifies current law \nby addressing this omission and expressly providing that a person or \nentity who acts in good faith reliance on a governmental request \npursuant to Section 2703(f) also has a complete defense to civil and \ncriminal liability.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes construction and operation of a National \nCyber Crime Technical Support Center and 10 regional computer forensic \nlabs that will provide education, training, and forensic examination \ncapabilities for State and local law enforcement officials charged with \ninvestigating computer crimes. The section authorizes a total of $100 \nmillion for FY 2001, of which $20 million shall be available solely for \nthe 10 regional labs and would complement the state computer crime \ngrant bill, S. 1314, with which this bill is offered.\n  I am pleased to see the ``Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act'' pass as \nan amendment to this legislation. I was an original cosponsor of this \nbill, S. 3164, which Senator Bayh introduced on October 5, 2000, with \nSenators Grams and Cleland. I have been concerned for some time that \neven as the general crime rate has been declining steadily over the \npast eight years, the rate of crime against the elderly has remained \nunchanged. That is why I introduced the Seniors Safety Act, S. 751, \nwith Senators Daschle, Kennedy, and Torricelli over a year ago.\n  The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act includes one of the titles from \nthe Seniors Safety Act. This title does two things. First, it instructs \nthe Attorney General to conduct a study relating to crimes against \nseniors, so that we can develop a coherent strategy to prevent and \nproperly punish such crimes. Second, it mandates the inclusion of \nseniors in the National Crime Victimization Study. Both of these are \nimportant steps, and they should be made law.\n  The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act also includes important \nproposals for addressing the problem of crimes against the elderly, \nespecially fraud crimes. In addition to the provisions described above, \nthis bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make \ngrants to establish local programs to prevent fraud against seniors and \neducate them about the risk of fraud, as well as to provide information \nabout telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud to seniors, both directly and \nthrough State Attorneys General. These are two common-sense provisions \nthat will help seniors protect themselves against crime.\n\n[[Page S10919]]\n\n  I hope that we can also take the time to consider the rest of the \nSeniors Safety Act, and enact even more comprehensive protections for \nour seniors. The Seniors Safety Act offers a comprehensive approach \nthat would increase law enforcement's ability to battle telemarketing, \npension, and health care fraud, as well as to police nursing homes with \na record of mistreating their residents. The Justice Department has \nsaid that the Seniors Safety Act would ``be of assistance in a number \nof ways.'' I have urged the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nto hold hearings on the Seniors Safety Act as long ago as October 1999, \nand again this past February, but my requests have not been granted. \nNow, as the session is coming to a close, we are out of time for \nhearings on this important and comprehensive proposal and significant \nparts of the Seniors Safety Act remain pending in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee as part of the unfinished business of this Congress.\n  Let me briefly summarize the parts of the Seniors Safety Act that the \nmajority in the Congress declined to consider. First, the Seniors \nSafety Act provides additional protections to nursing home residents. \nNursing homes provide an important service for our seniors--indeed, \nmore than 40 percent of Americans turning 65 this year will need \nnursing home care at some point in their lives. Many nursing homes do a \nwonderful job with a very difficult task--this legislation simply looks \nto protect seniors and their families by isolating the bad providers in \noperation. It does this by giving federal law enforcement the authority \nto investigate and prosecute operators of those nursing homes that \nengage in a pattern of health and safety violations. This authority is \nall the more important given the study prepared by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services and reported this summer in the New York \nTimes showing that 54 percent of American nursing homes fail to meet \nthe Department's ``proposed minimum standard'' for patient care. The \nstudy also showed that 92 percent of nursing homes have less staff than \nnecessary to provide optimal care.\n\n  Second, the Seniors Safety Act helps protect seniors from \ntelemarketing fraud, which costs billions of dollars every year. This \nlegislation would give the Attorney General the authority to block or \nterminate telephone service where that service is being used to defraud \nseniors. If someone takes your money at gunpoint, the law says we can \ntake away their gun. If someone uses their phone to take away your \nmoney, the law should allow us to protect other victims by taking their \nphone away. In addition, this proposal would establish a Better \nBusiness Bureau-style clearinghouse that would keep track of complaints \nmade about telemarketing companies. With a simple phone call, seniors \ncould find out whether the company trying to sell to them over the \nphone or over the Internet has been the subject of complaints or been \nconvicted of fraud. Senator Bayh has recently introduced another bill, \nS. 3025, the Combating Fraud Against Seniors Act, which includes the \npart of the Seniors Safety Act that establishes the clearinghouse for \ntelemarketing fraud information.\n  Third, the Seniors Safety Act punishes pension fraud. Seniors who \nhave worked hard for years should not have to worry that their hard-\nearned retirement savings will not be there when they need them. The \nbill would create new criminal and civil penalties for those who \ndefraud pension plans, and increase the penalties for bribery and graft \nin connection with employee benefit plans.\n  Finally, the Seniors Safety Act strengthens law enforcement's ability \nto fight health care fraud. A recent study by the National Institute \nfor Justice reports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately \ntarget vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's \npatients, who are less willing or able to complain or alert law \nenforcement.'' This legislation gives law enforcement the additional \ninvestigatory tools it needs to uncover, investigate, and prosecute \nhealth care offenses in both criminal and civil proceedings. It also \nprotects whistle-blowers who alert law enforcement officers to examples \nof health care fraud.\n  I commend Senators Bayh, Grams and Cleland for working to take steps \nto improve the safety and security of America's seniors. We are doing \nthe right thing today in passing this bipartisan legislation and \nbeginning the fight to lower the crime rate against seniors. I also \nurge my colleagues to consider and pass the Seniors Safety Act. Taken \ntogether, these two bills would provide a comprehensive approach toward \ngiving law enforcement and older Americans the tools they need to \nprevent crime.\n  On March 27, 2000, the Senate passed H.R. 1658, the Civil Asset \nForfeiture Reform Act of 2000. This was an important step forward and I \nwant to thank Mr. Hyde, Mr. Conyers and Senators Sessions, Biden, \nSchumer and all others who worked with us in good faith to enact these \nlong overdue reforms. At the same time, there was some unfinished \nbusiness in connection with this legislation that a Hatch-Leahy \namendment to H.R. 46 completes.\n  The bill that the Senate passed by unanimous consent on March 27th \nwas supposed to be a substitute amendment to H.R. 1658. I had been led \nto believe that the substitute was word-for-word that which I had \npainstakingly worked out over the preceding weeks for approval by the \nSenate Committee on the Judiciary the previous Thursday, March 23, \n2000. Imagine my surprise to see reprinted in the Record the next day a \nsubstitute amendment at variance with the version to which I had agreed \nto and at variance with the language that had been circulated to and \napproved by the Committee.\n  Specifically, the agreed upon version of the bill would amend section \n983(a)(2)(C) of title 18, United States Code, to describe what a \nclaimant in a civil asset forfeiture case must state to assert a claim. \nThe amendment to which I agreed and which the Judiciary Committee \n``ordered reported'' requires that a ``claim shall--(i) identify the \nspecific property being claimed; (ii) state the claimant's interest in \nsuch property; and (iii) be made under oath, subject to penalty of \nperjury.''\n  By contrast, the version of the amendment submitted to the Senate for \npassage contained the following additional clause in subparagraph (ii): \n``state the claimant's interest in such property (and provide customary \ndocumentary evidence of such interest if available) and state that the \nclaim is not frivolous''. I did not approve the language inserted in \nthe version considered by the Senate and this language was not approved \nby the Judiciary Committee.\n  This inserted language is superfluous, at best, since the claim must \nalready be made under oath and penalty of perjury. At worst, this \ninserted language is an invitation for mischief in an area where the \nrecord has already amply demonstrated overreaching by law enforcement \nagencies. For example, if a claimant provides only partial paperwork \nsupporting a claim to property seized by the government, would the \nclaim be subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim? If a \nclaimant certifies that the claim is not frivolous, as required by the \ninserted language, and a court ultimately determines otherwise, would \nthe claimant be put at risk of a perjury prosecution? Even the threat \nof such risks puts additional burdens on claimants and may dissuade \nclaimants from filing claims.\n  For these reasons, I had objected to insertion of this language and \napproved a substitute amendment that did not contain this problematic \ninsert. Moreover, the version of that substitute amendment ``ordered \nreported'' by the Judiciary Committee and in the Committee's official \nfiles simply does not contain that problematic insert.\n  We rely every day on each other and on the professionalism of our \nstaffs. Having raised my concern about the change as soon as it was \ndiscovered, I am pleased that Chairman Hatch has worked with me to pass \na correction to the law that strikes the language that was added \nwithout agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10919-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10919-S10920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HERITAGE HARBOR MUSEUM NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY\n\n  Mr. L.

Mr. President, today I rise to thank the chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury and General \nGovernment, Senator Campbell, for including funds for the National \nHistorical Publications and Records Commission to provide a grant to \nthe Heritage Harbor Museum in Providence for the development of the \nmuseum's Native American Story exhibit.\n\n[[Page S10920]]\n\n  The funds will be used by the Museum and the local Native American \ncommunity to research and catalog the history of the area's Native \nAmericans in a cross-cultural context. As the chairman knows, Heritage \nHarbor revolves around the telling of our nation's history in an \nintegrated environment. The museum will not focus on one ethnic or \nreligious group but strive to present the independent and coexisting \nhistories of many of our nation's peoples.\n  The task ahead for Heritage Harbor is a complex one, and I appreciate \nthe committee underscoring the federal interest in the project by \nproviding these funds. In order for the Native American perspective to \nbe presented effectively, the museum will not only research records, \ndata and artifacts, but it will also catalog the research and present \nit in formal exhibit fashion.\n  Is it the understanding of the Chairman that these funds are intended \nto be used for research and cataloging as well as exhibit presentation?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Again, I thank the Senator for his interest in this \nproject, and I look forward to inviting you to Rhode Island to see the \nresults of the museum's effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10920-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10920-S10921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF S. 1854\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Thursday, the Senate passed the Hatch-\nLeahy-DeWine-Kohl substitute amendment to S. 1854, the ``Hart-Scott-\nRodino Antitrust Improvements Act,'' that will make significant \nimprovements to this important antitrust law. Section 7 of the Clayton \nAct, as amended by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976 (HSR), requires \ncompanies that plan to merge to notify the Justice Department's \nAntitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission of their intention \nand submit certain information. HSR pre-merger notifications provide \nadvance notice of potentially anti-competitive transactions and allow \nthe antitrust agencies to block mergers before they are consummated, \nwhich is easier than undoing them after-the-fact.\n  Since passage of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, this law has worked well \nto help the American economy flourish, despite larger and more complex \nmergers and consolidations within and among different industries. The \nHatch-Leahy-DeWine-Kohl substitute amendment to S. 1854, the ``Hart-\nScott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act,'' will update this law \nand make it work even better.\n  Specifically, the substitute would raise the minimum threshold for \nthe ``size of the transaction'' required to provide HSR notifications \nfrom $15,000,000 to $50,000,000. Thus, no pre-merger filing will be \nrequired if the transaction is valued at less than $50,000,000. A pre-\nmerger filing would always be required if the size of the transaction \nis valued at more than $200,000,000. With regard to transactions valued \nat between $50,000,000 and $200,000,000, the amendment would require \npre-merger filing if the total assets or net annual sales of one party \nare over $100,000,000 annually while the other party's total assets or \nnet annual sales are over $10,000,000 annually. The thresholds may be \nadjusted by the FTC every three years to reflect the percentage change \nin the gross national product for that period. These threshold changes \nare supported by the antitrust agencies.\n  The remaining part of the substitute directs the Federal Trade \nCommission and the DOJ's Antitrust Division to implement regulations to \nimprove the manner in which these agencies obtain information as part \nof the review of a proposed merger. The antitrust agencies do not \nobject to these parts of the substitute amendment.\n  As explained in more detail below, this substitute addresses the most \nsignificant flaws in the original bill.\n  To appreciate the issues addressed in the bill, the pre-merger review \nprocedures currently in effect must be understood. Upon receipt of the \nmerger notification, the agency takes a ``quick look'' and determines \nwhether to open a Preliminary Investigation, PI. A PI may take from a \nfew weeks to several months to determine whether to close the PI or \nproceed with a Second Request or Civil Investigative Demand, CID, for \nadditional information. Second Requests were issued in only 2.5 percent \nof reported transactions in 1999.\n  Under statutory time limits, the Second Request must be made within \n30 days from the initial filing. In addition, only a single Second \nRequest is allowed so it must be complete. This Second Request extends \nthe waiting period before the merger may be completed for up to 20 days \nfrom the time that all responsive documents are submitted to the \nagency. Second requests for voluminous documents, combined with the \nrequirement that ``all responsive documents'' have been supplied by the \ncompanies to the agency, can cause substantial delays in the waiting \nperiod and the time when a merger may be completed.\n  To address business concerns over broad second requests and the delay \nsuch requests may cause, the original bill substantially limited the \nscope of agencies' second requests and authorized judicial review of \nboth the scope of and compliance with these critical requests, as \ndetailed below.\n  First, the original bill would have limited the scope of second \nrequests to information or documents ``not unreasonably cumulative or \nduplicative'' and that ``do not impose a burden or expense that \nsubstantially outweighs the likely benefit of the information to the \nagency.'' The antitrust agencies raised significant, valid questions \nabout whether these limitations were workable. In particular, at the \ntime a second request is issued, an agency generally cannot evaluate \nthe cost/benefit tradeoff because it does not know the costs of \nproduction, and has only limited knowledge about the potential benefits \nof the information for the investigation (in part because the \nanticompetitive issues are often still indefinite). The documents \nthemselves provide this information.\n  The bill would also have required the antitrust agency to provide, \nwith each second request, a specific summary of the competitive \nconcerns presented by the proposed acquisition and the relation between \nsuch concerns and the second request specifications. The antitrust \nagencies questioned this requirement because anticompetitive concerns \nare still often general and evolving at the time a second request is \nissued. Consequently, a specific summary may not be possible at that \ntime and would likely be incomplete since additional competitive \nconcerns may be discovered during the investigation. Furthermore, \naccording to the agencies, this requirement was unnecessary since they \nordinarily provide a general explanation of their concerns and provide \nmore specific information as it develops, in face-to-face conferences \nbetween parties (or their counsel) and investigating staff.\n  Second, the original bill would have limited the agencies' ability to \nclaim that the production of documents in response to a second request \nis deficient only if the deficiency ``materially impairs the ability of \nthe agency to conduct a preliminary antitrust review.'' This proposed \nstandard for claiming deficiency (that is, for requiring further \ndocument production) is higher than the ordinary standard for discovery \nand would limit the agency's ability to investigate, especially given \nHSR's stringent time frames and the fact that the second request is the \nsingle opportunity to seek information in a premerger review. This \ncould have seriously harmed the agency's posture in court, as courts \noften examine the entire substance of the agency's case even in a \npreliminary injunction action.\n\n  Finally, the original bill would have authorized a merging company to \nseek review by a magistrate judge of both the scope of the second \nrequest and any claim of deficient production. The magistrate was \nrequired to apply the scope and deficiency standards described above, \nwhich impose more limits on antitrust agencies than general civil \ndiscovery rules. Moreover, magistrates were unlikely to be familiar \nwith the types of information that form the basis for the complex \nantitrust analysis required in predicting likely future competitive \neffects of a proposed transaction--a shortcoming with possible adverse \nconsequences for antitrust agencies seeking relevant information for an \ninvestigation since\n\n[[Page S10921]]\n\nthis experience is particularly important in light of HSR's special \ntime constraints and the agencies' single opportunity to seek documents \nprior to the merger.\n  The substitute amendment eliminates these three problematic \nprocedural limitations on the second request investigation process \ncontained in the original bill. Instead, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Kohl \nsubstitute amendment directs the agencies to reform the merger review \nprocess to eliminate unnecessary delay, costly duplication and undue \ndelay. In addition, the agencies are directed to designate senior \nofficials within the agencies to review the second requests to \ndetermine whether the requests are burdensome or duplicative and \nwhether the request has been substantially complied with by the merging \ncompanies.\n  These changes are consistent with reforms that the FTC and Antitrust \nDivision already have underway. Indeed, the FTC on April 5, 2000, and \nthe Antitrust Division the next day, announced their adoption of new \nprocedures and other initiatives to improve the premerger ``second \nrequest'' investigation process to make the process more efficient for \nboth businesses and the agencies. I commend both agencies for their \nefforts in this regard and look forward to working with them to ensure \nthat implementation of their regulations proceeds smoothly.\n  The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Kohl substitute amendment also imposes a \nreporting requirement on the FTC to provide the Congress with \ninformation on the number of HSR notices filed and on the reviews \nconducted by the antitrust agencies.\n  The antitrust agencies did not support the fee structure in the \nCommittee reported bill since, in their view, the level of fees \nauthorized in the substitute amendment would not provide them with the \nability to collect sufficient fees to meet their budget request for FY \n2001. Although these agencies are funded by direct appropriations and \nnot by their fees, the reality is that the appropriations to these \nagencies usually corresponds to the level of the fees collected. \nNevertheless, the Committee reported bill authorized the collection of \nsufficient fees to be revenue neutral and at a level that would enable \nthe agencies, according to the CBO, to collect fees at a level \namounting to an increase of ten percent over the agencies' last year's \nbudget.\n  The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Kohl substitute amendment eliminates reference \nto the revised fee structure. I intend to work with my colleagues and \nthe antitrust agencies, as I have in the past, to ensure that they \nreceive all the funding necessary to support their mission and carry \nout their important work through the appropriations process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10921-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE SAVAGE RAPIDS DAM ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be the original cosponsor \nof the Savage Rapids Dam Act of 2000, introduced by my friend and \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith.\n  This legislation is another good example of the Oregon way: bringing \ntogether varied interests to get win-win results for all stakeholders. \nBorn out of controversy concerning the detrimental effects of the \nSavage Rapids Dam on fish passage and survival, this legislation is now \nsupported by the Grants Pass Irrigation District, Waterwatch, Oregon's \nGovernor Kitzhaber, Trout Unlimited, and various Oregon river guide and \nsport fishing concerns.\n  The winners under this legislation are Oregon's environmental and \nagricultural interests. The legislation begins the important process of \nrestoring salmon habitat on the Rogue River, while retaining access to \nnecessary irrigation water from the Rogue River for the Grants Pass \nIrrigation District. The legislation authorizes the acquisition by the \nSecretary of Interior of the Savage Rapids Dam for the purpose of \nremoving the Dam to promote the recovery of coastal salmon. But prior \nto that acquisition, the legislation directs the Secretary of Interior, \nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation, to design and install modern \nelectric irrigation pumps for the Grants Pass Irrigation District so \nthey may continue to access Rogue River water for crop irrigation, as \nthey have done since 1921.\n  This legislation is good for irrigators: by maintaining water \naccessibility, it will help sustain local agricultural businesses. It \nis good for fish because it takes important steps toward habitat \nrestoration by authorizing Dam removal as well as the monitoring, \nmitigation, and restoration activities necessary to restore the fish \npopulation in on the Rogue River.\n  I look forward to continuing to improve the legislation with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the stakeholders at home. As I work over \nthe recess and on into the next Congress on this issue, I know, \neventually, we will have another win for the Oregon way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10921-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10921-S10923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RESOLUTION FOR SUBPOENA TO SECRETARY RICHARDSON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during the last presidential debate, \nGovernor Bush told the American people, as he has frequently during the \ncampaign, that if he and Republicans are in control, there will be a \nmore even-handed, cordial and respectful atmosphere in Washington and \nless partisan politics. I know that Governor Bush has tried to cast \nhimself as a Washington outsider, so maybe he has not been paying \nattention to how the Republican majority here in Washington has been \ndoing things these past few years. A resolution on the agenda for the \nfinal two meetings of the Judiciary Committee in this Congress might \nhelp bring Governor Bush up to speed.\n  That resolution proposed by the Republican leadership of the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts \nsought to authorize issuance of a subpoena compelling Department of \nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson to testify before the Subcommittee \nabout the investigation and prosecution of Wen Ho Lee and provide \nthirteen different categories of documents. Under the proposed \nresolution, if by November 8, 2000, Secretary Richardson did not agree \nto testify and provide the demanded documents, the subpoena would be \nauthorized. This resolution was ultimately not brought to a vote due to \nthe lack of the requisite quorum, sparing the Judiciary Committee from \nmaking an unnecessary and embarrassing demand for which the only \nenforcement mechanism is a contempt trial in the Senate.\n  It might appear from the targets of this subpoena resolution, namely, \nSecretary Richardson and the Department of Energy, that the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts are charged with oversight of the Department of Energy (DOE). In \nfact, the Republicans have proposed this resolution as part of the \nSubcommittee's oversight of the Justice Department. While the \nDepartment of Energy may have information helpful to an understanding \nof the Justice Department's handling of the Lee case, the manner in \nwhich the Republican majority has chosen to proceed both with regard to \nSecretary Richardson and other matters before the Subcommittee have \nbeen marked by an unprecedented political intervention in pending \ncriminal matters and second-guessing of the handling of certain cases \nby federal agencies.\n  For example, the majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee has \nbroken from tradition and called line assistants to testify before the \nSubcommittee, questioned federal judges about pending cases over which \nthey are presiding, attempted to exact assurances that particular cases \nwill be handled particular ways, and made public internal and \nconfidential recommendations by senior prosecutors to the Attorney \nGeneral on how to proceed in ongoing investigations. The Subcommittee's \nearlier intervention in the Waco matter prompted a rebuke from Special \nCounsel Jack Danforth, who wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee \ntwice in September, 1999, requesting that the Committee ``conduct its \ninquiries in a way that does not undermine the work of the Special \nCounsel.'' I should note that the Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts persisted in seeking documents from the \nDepartment of Justice on the Waco matter, and that 250 boxes of Waco \ndocuments produced by the Department of Justice sit largely unopened in \nJudiciary Committee offices.\n\n[[Page S10922]]\n\n  Let me help bring Governor Bush up to speed with the most recent \nexample of how the majority is conducting itself. Sponsors of this \nsubpoena resolution made it sound as if a subpoena were necessary \nbecause Secretary Richardson had been dodging a discussion of the Lee \ncase since March 2000. Indeed, a sponsor of the subpoena resolution \nstated at a Judiciary Committee meeting on October 5, 2000, that \n``[t]he efforts to secure Secretary Richardson's attendance go back to \nMarch of this year when we requested his appearance and he declined, \nwith comments about his unavailability on a specific date.''\n  Yet, as some Republicans have even acknowledged, from December 1999 \nuntil just six weeks ago when Dr. Lee pled guilty, the Committee was \nhonoring FBI Director Freeh's urgent request that the Committee suspend \nreview of Dr. Lee's case during the pendency of the criminal \nprosecution so as not to compromise the case.\n  When former Senator Danforth testified to Congress about his \nindependent investigation of the tragic raid on the Branch Davidian \ncompound in Waco, Texas, he commented that, ``We have totally overblown \nour willingness to just trash people.'' Senator Danforth said about \nthose who make reckless claims of government misconduct and who \ngrandstand on matters of public importance: ``The wrong information was \npresented to the American people and it caused a real shaking of \nconfidence of people in their government . . . When people make dark \ncharges--I mean really, really serious charges--the people who make the \ncharges should bear some kind of burden of proof before we all buy into \nthem.'' His words have not been sufficiently heeded by the majority in \nthis Congress, as this unwarranted and scurrilous subpoena resolution \ndirected at Secretary Richardson makes clear.\n  Governor Bush may also not be aware of the following: Despite \nDirector Freeh's request that the Congress suspend the Lee hearings \nduring pendency of the case, and the Judiciary Committee's honoring of \nthat request, an interim report on the Lee matter was issued by a \nRepublican Member in March 2000. He did so over the written objections \nof a Member of his own party, who expressed concern about the haste of \nissuing the report despite an incomplete investigation and the lack of \na consensus in the Judiciary Committee about key matters.\n  The Committee's suspension of its inquiry into this matter was lifted \nonly six weeks ago, September 13, 2000, when Dr. Lee pled guilty and \nwas sentenced. The March 2000 hearing to which Secretary Richardson was \ninvited, but for which he had a conflict, was not about the facts of \nDr. Lee's case, but legislation on which the Judiciary Committee was \nthen working.\n  It might help Governor Bush size up the source of partisan bickering \nin Washington if he were aware of how the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwas rushing to issue a subpoena to a cabinet secretary, even though \nMembers of his own party acknowledge that the complete story of the Lee \nmatter will not and cannot come out for some time. I concur with \nSenator Grassley's comments on October 3, 2000, at a hearing conducted \nby the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts on the \nLee matter: ``For now, Dr. Lee's side of the story is on hold. That is \nbecause his attorneys have asked that his side be told only after he is \ndebriefed by the government. We also asked to interview Judge Parker \nabout his views of the case but Judge Parker declined our invitations, \nso the public is not going to get the full picture, which may not come \ninto view for some time yet.''\n\n  Nonetheless, for Secretary Richardson, a high-ranking member of this \nAdministration, the Judiciary Committee was asked to authorize a \nsubpoena and get him before Congress immediately in an apparent effort \nto make it seem as though he is dodging congressional oversight, even \nthough by Senator Grassley's candid admission that Congress will not \nhave the full picture of Dr. Lee's case ``for some time.''\n  In fact, the investigation of Dr. Lee remains open with intense \ndebriefings ongoing. The agencies involved are rightfully sensitive \nthat the debriefings of Dr. Lee are not complete and concerned that \npublic discussion of the case not jeopardize the debriefings or future \nsteps in the case.\n  Republicans have not shown similar interest in oversight of other \nopen criminal matters about which the American people might truly want \nall the facts immediately and certainly before Election Day. For \nexample, no effort by the majority has been made to get to the bottom \nof ``Debategate,'' the mailing of Bush debate preparation materials to \nthe Gore campaign. That incident might be a third-rate mail fraud, but \nit might also be serious campaign misconduct of the type we saw during \nthe Watergate scandal. Some have speculated that it was a dirty trick \nby the Bush campaign to set up the Vice President. I have heard nothing \nfrom the Republicans about the matter. I have heard no outrage that \nGovernor Bush and his campaign aides are not being put under oath or \ndragged before grand juries to get to the bottom of the scandal. In \ncontrast to the majority's preference to investigate rather than \nlegislate, their silence on the Debategate case is deafening. On that \ninvestigation, the Republicans are happy to allow the ongoing criminal \ninvestigation to take its course. But not here, where the important \ndebriefings of Dr. Lee are sensitive and ongoing.\n  The fact is that in the six short weeks since Dr. Lee pled guilty, \nthe Department of Energy has been extremely cooperative, just as the \nDepartment of Energy was cooperative with other committees' previous \nreviews of the Lee matter.\n  At the first hearing on the matter after Dr. Lee pled guilty, the \nJudiciary Committee's joint hearing with the Senate Committee on \nIntelligence on September 26th, Deputy Secretary T.J. Glauthier of the \nDepartment of Energy appeared to testify in place of Secretary \nRichardson because the Secretary was testifying before another \ncommittee. Secretary Richardson agreed to testify at that afternoon's \nclosed session when he would be available, but no such afternoon \nsession was conducted. At the second hearing on September 27th, DOE \nSecurity Chief Edward Curran appeared to testify.\n  At the third hearing on October 3rd, DOE computer specialist Ronald \nWilkins appeared to testify. In addition, the Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts heard from Los Alamos officials \nDr. Stephen Younger and former officials Robert Vrooman and Notra \nTrulock. In sum, Department of Energy has provided witnesses before a \ntotal of 11 House and Senate committees and has provided testimony 37 \ntimes in hearings and briefings on the Lee case and related espionage \nand security matters in the past two years.\n  Moreover, the thirteen categories of documents called for in the \nsubpoena resolution-- to the extent not already produced--were \nrequested only a few days before the subpoena was sought. A chronology \nof the relevant events shows that the Department of Energy has made and \nis making every effort to produce documents.\n  On November 17, 1999, the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee \napproved a resolution to issue subpoenas to five cabinet secretaries, \nincluding Secretary Richardson, containing a general request for all \ndocuments related to Wen Ho Lee and three other matters. Because the \nJudiciary Committee a few short weeks later, in December 1999 honored \nDirector Freeh's request that the Committee suspend inquiry of the Lee \nmatter, no subpoena was ever issued and forwarded, and it is unclear \nwhether that document request was ever communicated to the Department \nof Energy.\n  On September 13, 2000, Dr. Lee pled guilty and was sentenced.\n  On September 28, 2000, Senator Specter wrote to DOE requesting that \nfive pages of a DOE Inspector General report be declassified, but \nmaking no other request for documents. My understanding is that the \nrequest was honored.\n  On September 29, 2000, Senator Specter wrote a letter directly to \nSecretary Richardson enclosing follow-up written questions to DOE's \nSecurity Chief Edward Curran, who testified before the subcommittee on \nSeptember 27th. Neither the letter to Secretary Richardson nor the \nquestions to Mr. Curran contained any request for documents.\n  On October 3, 2000, Senator Specter wrote to both Secretary \nRichardson and the Attorney General requesting\n\n[[Page S10923]]\n\ndocuments relating to Dr. Lee's claim of racial profiling that the \nprosecution would have been required to submit to Judge Parker for in \ncamera review had Dr. Lee not pled guilty. DOE has produced materials \nin response to that request.\n  On October 5, 2000, Secretary Richardson met with Senator Specter and \ndiscussed the case. My understanding is that Senator Specter's staff \nthereafter orally requested five documents or files from DOE Chief \nLarry Sanchez.\n  On October 12, 2000, Senator Specter asked the Judiciary Committee to \napprove a resolution authorizing a subpoena for Secretary Richardson's \ntestimony. That resolution contained no request for documents.\n\n  Finally, on the evening of October 16, 2000, Senator Specter wrote a \nletter to Secretary Richardson listing the thirteen categories of \ndocuments sought by the subpoena resolution.\n  Despite that record of the DOE's good faith, on October 19, 2000, \nless than two weeks since Senator Specter's office made an oral request \nof Mr. Sanchez for five documents or files and just three days since \nSenator Specter submitted his list of thirteen categories of documents, \nthe Republicans sought a resolution seeking issuance of a subpoena. The \nDepartment of Energy has made three deliveries of materials over the \npast two weeks, and I have no doubt that the Department of Energy will \ncontinue to comply with these document requests and act in good faith. \nMoreover, I understand that Secretary Richardson has met recently with \nSenator Specter and with Chairman Hatch to discuss the facts of the \ncase. Far from dodging congressional oversight, the Secretary has made \nhimself available for such meetings in the midst of recent crises over \nthe price of oil.\n  The sponsors of the subpoena resolution advanced three reasons to \njustify its issuance. They claimed that the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts needs to hear immediately from \nSecretary Richardson so that he may (1) respond to allegations that the \nDepartment of Energy was to blame for the delay between April 1999, \nwhen Dr. Lee's residence was searched and evidence of his downloading \nwas seized, and December 1999, when he was indicted; (2) explain why \nhis signature was purportedly on the order to put Dr. Lee in leg irons; \nand (3) respond to allegations made by DOE's former intelligence chief \nNotra Trulock at an earlier Congressional hearing that he had been told \nby New York Times reporter James Risen that Secretary Richardson had \nleaked Dr. Lee's name. Based on the record, as I understand it, these \nthree claims are unsupportable. First, between April and December 1999, \nnumerous agencies participated in sorting out a hugely complex case, \nanalyzing a million computer files, interviewing a thousand people, and \nassessing the sensitive question of how to prosecute Dr. Lee in a \npublic courtroom without publicly disclosing the nuclear secrets that \nhe downloaded.\n  As to the second claim, Secretary Richardson wrote to the Attorney \nGeneral certifying, as required by a federal regulation, that national \nsecurity would be threatened if Dr. Lee communicated classified \ninformation to a confederate, and requesting that she direct prison \nauthorities to implement whatever measures might be appropriate to \nprevent such communication while Dr. Lee was in custody. Secretary \nRichardson did not order leg irons. To the contrary, Secretary \nRichardson noted his understanding that ``the conditions of [Dr. Lee's] \nconfinement are in no respect more restrictive than those of others in \nthe segregation unit of the detention facility,'' and he emphasized his \nconcern that Dr. Lee's civil rights be scrupulously honored.\n  As to the third claim, my understanding is that, immediately after \nthe hearing at which Mr. Trulock testified, Mr. Risen walked up to Mr. \nTrulock and said that he had never told Mr. Trulock any such thing \nabout Secretary Richardson. In addition, Secretary Richardson has \nalready categorically denied the allegation.\n  These reasons are hardly a basis for taking the extraordinary step of \nauthorizing the issuance of a subpoena for a member of the President's \ncabinet.\n  At the Judiciary Committee's meeting on October 19, 2000, it was \nsuggested that Chairman Hatch might have the authority to issue a \nsubpoena for Secretary Richardson pursuant to a resolution which the \nRepublicans on the Committee approved in November 1999. The Democrats \nopposed that resolution in part because a subpoena might interfere with \nthe ongoing investigation of Dr. Lee. Over the Democrats' objection, \nthat partisan resolution was rushed through the Judiciary Committee by \nthe majority precipitously and was never executed. Indeed, just a few \nweeks later, Director Freeh made his urgent request that the Committee \nsuspend its inquiry into the Lee matter during the pendency of the \ncriminal case.\n  As it related to the Department of Energy, the partisan resolution \nauthorized issuance of a subpoena to Secretary Richardson for \ndocuments, not his personal appearance. As for the documents, the \nresolution authorized issuance of a subpoena for all documents related \nto DOE's investigation of Dr. Lee and identified just two particular \ndocuments that were sought. That resolution did not identify the \nthirteen categories of documents for which authorization was sought in \nthe last meetings of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Since the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts began its oversight of the Justice Department, no fewer than \nnine subpoenas have been authorized for cabinet secretaries, not \nincluding a subpoena for Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in \nconnection with Elian Gonzalez which was authorized and later \nrescinded.\n  If the American people want to test the credibility of Governor \nBush's claim about the kinder and gentler America that he claims only a \nRepublican-led government can bring to our nation, they should examine \nthe record of the oversight efforts by Republican-led Judiciary \nCommittee and its Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10923-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10923-S10924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n CELEBRATING THE PUBLICATION OF EARLY ART AND ARTISTS IN WEST VIRGINIA\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to address a \nsubject very close to my heart. Not long after my wife, Sharon, and I \nsettled in West Virginia, my father presented me with a wonderful \npainting of the Kanawha River by Frederic Edwin Church, one of \nAmerica's greatest nineteenth-century landscape painters. Thoroughly \ndelighted with the painting, I became curious to know more about West \nVirginia's art history. What I discovered was a rich and varied \ntradition of artists, musicians and authors. Indeed, we in West \nVirginia have much to be proud of in the fields of fine art, music and \nliterature, as well as theater, dance and architecture.\n  However, there has persisted a distinct lack of documentation of West \nVirginia's artistic tradition. That is, until now, with the publication \nof the groundbreaking book, Early Art and Artists in West Virginia. \nCompiled and narrated by Dr. John A. Cuthbert, in cooperation with West \nVirginia University Press, this book is the first of its kind. This \nwonderful compendium finally establishes a foundation upon which we can \nbegin to explore the history of art in West Virginia, and examine the \nimportant contributions the state has made to the world of fine art.\n  Dr. Cuthbert offers us a richly illustrated explanation of the \ndevelopment of portrait and landscape painting, as well as lesser \ngenres in the state. He has also compiled a directory of nearly one \nthousand artists who are a part of this special history, providing both \nteachers and scholars with an invaluable tool for further study. From \nthe many visiting and native artists who worked in the panhandles in \nthe early nineteenth century, to the members of the Hudson River School \nwho delighted in the state's virgin forests several decades later, all \nare present in this remarkable volume.\n  The lovely portrait of Sophie B. Colston that graces the book's cover \nis but a sample of the caliber of their work. Set in a landscape that \nevery West Virginian will recognize, this\n\n[[Page S10924]]\n\nmasterpiece by Berkeley County's William Robinson Leigh suggests the \nunderlying message of this book--that sophistication and elegance have \nlong been a part of the state's celebrated mountain folk culture.\n  Since receiving Church's study of the Kanawha River from my father, I \nhave continued to be intrigued by the fine art inspired by and produced \nin my adopted state. Few American communities the size of Charleston \nand Wheeling can boast symphony orchestras as accomplished as those \nfound in these cities. Rebecca Harding Davis, Melville Davisson Post, \nPearl S. Buck, Davis Grubb and Jayne Anne Phillips are but a few of the \nWest Virginians who have contributed to the great canon of American \nliterature. This uplifting part of our heritage deserves to be much \nbetter known. Early Art and Artists in West Virginia is a remarkable \ncontribution toward this end. Thank you, John Cuthbert and West \nVirginia University Press, for this wonderful and important \nbook.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10924-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIREMENT OF DR. JAMES HENDRICKS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. \nJames Hendricks, who is retiring this year from a career in education \nwhich spanned 43 years, and included 33 years of dedicated service to \nNorthern Michigan University in Marquette, Michigan. For the past 22 \nyears, Dr. Hendricks has served as Director of the School of Education \nthere, and in this capacity he has illustrated to fellow professors and \nstudents alike that, while there is no single formula for successful \neducation, there is a single foundation--caring deeply for each and \nevery student in the classroom.\n  Dr. Hendricks grew up on a farm in rural Indiana. As a child, his \ninterests were extremely atypical. He loved the opera and classical \nmusic, and often chose to read a book during recess while his \nclassmates played games. His experiences at school were to help him \nlater in life, as he gained a sensitivity towards children with \ndifferent interests, and developed educational strategies with the goal \nof ``just and inclusive classrooms.''\n  Dr. Hendricks graduated from the University of Indiana, where he \nstudied English, Philosophy, History and Spanish, in 1957. Following \nhis graduation, he turned down a job at his local bank to teach \nelementary school in Southport, Indiana. He immediately knew that he \nhad made the right decision, and it did not take long for him to fall \nin love with teaching. His goal during those years was to help ``all \nchildren find a happiness in being in that classroom.''\n  Recognizing a need to further his own education, Dr. Hendricks \nreturned to the University of Indiana after three years of teaching in \nSouthport. In 1962, he received his Master's Degree in History and \nEducation. He then spent three years in Bloomington as both a graduate \nassistant and research fellow before coming to Marquette to serve as an \nAssistant Professor at Northern Michigan from 1965-67.\n  In 1968, he returned to the University of Indiana, and received his \nDoctoral Degree in History and the Philosophy of Education. Following \nthis, he accepted a position as Assistant Professor in the Department \nof Education at Portland State University, and during his time there \nhelped the university set up its educational doctoral program. In 1969, \nDr. Hendricks returned to Marquette and the faculty of Northern \nMichigan University.\n  During Dr. Hendricks' tenure at Northern Michigan, the Education \nDepartment has been rejuvenated. Admission standards for students have \nbeen elevated and the curriculum has been deepened. From the time that \nthey decide they want to be teachers, students are required to gain \nhands-on experience in classrooms throughout Marquette County, where \nthey learn from proven teachers, as well as from students. In addition, \nveteran elementary and secondary school teachers have joined the \nUniversity's faculty in an effort to assist student teachers. All of \nthis equates to students graduating the Education Department who are \nexperienced and knowledgeable enough to immediately handle the pressure \nand responsibility of having their own classroom.\n  Dr. Hendricks' good works within the community were surpassed only by \nthose of his wife, Sandra. Mrs. Hendricks greatly impacted the City of \nMarquette with her volunteerism, while at the same time remaining a \ndevoted mother to the couple's three children. Before her death in \n1998, she spent time baking brownies for cancer patients at Beacon \nHouse in Marquette, and then brightening their days by hand delivering \nthe goods and staying to chat with the patients. She loved Christmas \nand each year sponsored the Alternative Gifts Fair, which benefitted \nThird World artists. The event still takes place each December at St. \nPaul's Episcopal Church.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Dr. Hendricks on an extraordinary career in \neducation. The key to his success has been nothing more than a strong \ndesire to see his Department and his students succeed to the utmost of \ntheir potential. Because of this desire, the Northern Michigan \nUniversity Education Department not only has a profound impact on the \nquality of education offered to students in the Upper Peninsula, but \nthroughout the entire State of Michigan. On behalf of the United States \nSenate, I thank Dr. James Hendricks for the many beneficial things he \naccomplished during his career, and wish him the best of luck in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10924-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL HISTORY DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding \nhistory education program in Vermont and throughout the United States. \nNational History Day is a year-long nonprofit program through which \nstudents in grades 6-12 research and create historical projects related \nto a broad theme, culminating in an annual contest. This year's \nNational History Day theme, Frontiers in History: People, Places, \nIdeas, encompasses endless possibilities for exploration. Each year \nmore than 500,000 students participate in this nationwide event that \nencourages students to delve into various facets of world, national, \nregional, or local history and to produce original research projects.\n  By encouraging young Vermonters to take advantage of the wealth of \nprimary historical resources available to them, students are able to \ngain a richer understanding of historical issues, ideas, people and \nevents. Students in this program learn how to analyze a variety of \nprimary sources such as photographs, letters, posters, maps, artifacts, \nsound recordings and motion pictures. This significant academic \nexercise encourages intellectual growth while helping students to \ndevelop critical thinking and problem solving skills that will help \nthem manage and use information.\n  In June I had the pleasure of meeting with the 25 winners of this \nyear's Vermont History Day contest here in Washington as they \nparticipated in the national contest held at the University of \nMaryland. These impressive students represent the great benefit of \nfostering and encouraging academic curiosity in our youth. Every \nstudent in Vermont should have the opportunity to participate in this \nenriching experience. I commend the coordinator of our state program, \nthe Vermont Historical Society, for its commitment to expanding History \nDay in Vermont. The National History Day program is a truly great asset \nto Vermont educators and students in their quest for educational \nexcellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10924-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10924-S10925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 501.

A bill to promote the development of affordable, quality \nrental housing in rural areas for low-income households; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  THE RURAL RENTAL HOUSING ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \npromote the development of affordable, quality rental housing for low-\nincome households in rural areas. I am pleased, along with Senator \nJeffords and Senator Leahy, to introduce the ``Rural Rental Housing Act \nof 2000.''\n  There is a pressing and worsening need for quality rental housing for \nrural families and senior citizens. As a group, residents of rural \ncommunities are the worst housed of all our citizens. Rural areas \ncontain approximately 20 percent of the nation's population as compared \nto suburbs with 50 percent. Yet, twice as many rural American families \nlive in bad housing than in the suburbs. An estimated 2,600,000 rural \nhouseholds live in substandard housing with severe structural damage or \nwithout indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity.\n  Substandard housing is a particularly grave problem in the rural \nareas of my home state of North Carolina. Ten percent or more of the \npopulation in five of North Carolina's rural counties live in \nsubstandard housing. Rural housing units, in fact, comprise 60 percent \nof all substandard units in the state.\n  Even as millions of rural Americans live in wretched rental housing, \nmillions more are paying an extraordinarily high price for their \nhousing. One out of every three renters in rural America pays more than \n30 percent of his or her income for housing; 20 percent of rural \nrenters pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing.\n  Most distressing is when people living in housing that does not have \nheat or indoor plumbing pay an extraordinary amount of their income in \nrent. Over 90 percent of people living in housing in the worst \nconditions pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing costs.\n  Unfortunately, our rural communities are not in a position to address \nthese problems alone. They are disproportionately poor and have fewer \nresources to bring to bear on the issue. Poverty is a crushing, \npersistent problem in rural America. One-third of the non-metropolitan \ncounties in North Carolina have 20 percent or more of their population \nliving below the poverty line. In contrast, not a single metropolitan \ncounty in North Carolina has 20 percent or more of its population \nliving below the poverty line. Not surprisingly, the economies of rural \nareas are generally less diverse, limiting jobs and economic \nopportunity. Rural areas have limited access to many forces driving the \neconomy, such as technology, lending, and investment, because they are \nremote and have low population density. Banks and other investors, \nlooking for larger projects with lower risk, seek metropolitan areas \nfor loans and investment. Credit in rural areas is often more expensive \nand available at less favorable terms than in metropolitan areas.\n  Given the magnitude of this problem, it is startling to find that the \nfederal government is turning its back on the situation. In the face of \nthis challenge, the federal government's investment in rural rental \nhousing is at its lowest\n\n[[Page S10927]]\n\nlevel in more than 25 years. Federal spending for rural rental housing \nhas been cut by 73 percent since 1994. Rural rental housing unit \nproduction financed by the federal government has been reduced by 88 \npercent since 1990. Moreover, poor rural renters do not fair as well as \npoor urban renters in accessing existing programs. Only 17 percent of \nvery low-income rural renters receive housing subsidies, compared with \n28 percent of urban poor. Rural counties fared worse with Federal \nHousing Authority assistance on a per capita basis, as well, getting \nonly $25 per capita versus $264 in metro areas. Our veterans in rural \nareas are no better off: Veterans Affairs housing dollars are spent \ndisproportionately in metropolitan areas.\n  To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, I believe that the \nfederal government must come up with new solutions. We cannot simply \nthrow money at the problem and expect the situation to improve. \nInstead, we must work in partnership with State and local governments, \nprivate financial institutions, private philanthropic institutions, and \nthe private and nonprofit sectors to make headway. We must leverage our \nresources wisely to increase the supply and quality of rural rental \nhousing for low-income households and the elderly.\n  Senator Jeffords, Senator Leahy, and I are proposing a new solution. \nToday, we introduce the Rural Rental Housing Act of 2000 to create a \nflexible source of financing to allow project sponsors to build, \nacquire or rehabilitate rental housing based on local needs. We demand \nthat the federal dollars to be stretched by requiring State matching \nfunds and by requiring the sponsor to find additional sources of \nfunding for the project. We are pleased that over 70 housing groups \nfrom 26 states have already indicated their support for this \nlegislation.\n  Let me briefly describe what the measure would do. We propose a $250 \nmillion fund to be administered by the United States Department of \nAgriculture (USDA). The funds will be allotted to states based on their \nshares of rural substandard units and of the rural population living in \npoverty. We will leverage federal funding by requiring states or other \nnon-profit intermediaries to provide a dollar-for-dollar match of \nproject funds. The funds will be used for the acquisition, \nrehabilitation, and construction of low-income rural rental housing.\n  The USDA will make rental housing available for low-income \npopulations in rural communities. The population served must earn less \nthan 80 percent area median income. Housing must be in rural areas with \npopulations not exceeding 25,000, outside of urbanized areas. Priority \nfor assistance will be given to very low income households, those \nearning less than 50 percent of area median income, and in very low-\nincome communities or in communities with a severe lack of affordable \nhousing. To ensure that housing continues to serve low-income \npopulations, the legislation specifies that housing financed under the \nlegislation must have a low-income use restriction of not less than 30 \nyears.\n  The Act promotes public-private partnerships to foster flexible, \nlocal solutions. The USDA will make assistance available to public \nbodies, Native American tribes, for-profit corporations, and private \nnonprofit corporations with a record of accomplishment in housing or \ncommunity development. Again, it stretches federal assistance by \nlimiting most projects from financing more than 50 percent of a project \ncost with this funding. The assistance may be made available in the \nform of capital grants, direct, subsidized loans, guarantees, and other \nforms of financing for rental housing and related facilities.\n  Finally, the Act will be administered at the state level by \norganizations familiar with the unique needs of each state rather than \ncreating a new federal bureaucracy. The USDA will be encouraged to \nidentify intermediary organizations based in the state to administer \nthe funding provided that it complies with the provisions of the Act. \nThese intermediary organizations can be states or state agencies, \nprivate nonprofit community development corporations, nonprofit housing \ncorporations, community development loan funds, or community \ndevelopment credit unions.\n  This Act is not meant to replace, but to supplement the Section 515 \nRural Rental Housing program, which has been the primary source of \nfederal funding for affordable rental housing in rural America from its \ninception in 1963. Section 515, which is administered by the USDA's \nRural Housing Service, makes direct loans to non-profit and for-profit \ndevelopers to build rural rental housing for very low income tenants. \nOur support for 515 has decreased in recent years--there has been a 73 \npercent reduction since 1994--which has had two effects. It is \npractically impossible to build new rental housing, and our ability to \npreserve and maintain the current stock of Section 515 units is \nhobbled. Fully three-quarters of the Section 515 portfolio is more than \n20 years old. Currently $60 million of the $115 million appropriation \nin fiscal year 2000 is used to preserve existing stock.\n  The time has come for us to take a new look at a critical problem \nfacing rural America. How can we best work to promote the development \nof quality rental housing for low-income people in rural America? My \ncolleagues and I believe that to answer this question, we must comply \nwith certain basic principles. We do not want to create yet another \nprogram with a large federal bureaucracy. We want a program that is \nflexible, that fosters public-private partnerships, that leverages \nfederal funding, and that is locally controlled. We believe that the \nRural Rental Housing Act of 2000 satisfies these principles and will \nhelp move us in the direction of ensuring that everyone in America, \nincluding those in rural areas, have access to affordable, quality \nhousing options.\n  Mr. President, I request that the text of the legislation be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Rental Housing Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a pressing and increasing need for rental \n     housing for rural families and senior citizens:\n       (A) Two-thirds of extremely low-income and very low-income \n     rural households do not have access to affordable rental \n     housing units.\n       (B) More than 900,000 rural rental households (10.4 \n     percent) live in either severely or moderately inadequate \n     housing.\n       (C) Substandard housing is a problem for 547,000 rural \n     renters, and approximately 165,000 rural rental units are \n     overcrowded.\n       (2) Many rural United States households live with serious \n     housing problems, including a lack of basic water and \n     wastewater services, structural insufficiencies, and \n     overcrowding:\n       (A) 28 percent, or 10,400,000, rural households in the \n     United States live with some kind of serious housing problem.\n       (B) Approximately 1,000,000 rural renters have multiple \n     housing problems.\n       (C) An estimated 2,600,000 rural households live in \n     substandard housing with severe structural damage or without \n     indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity.\n       (3) One-third of all renters in rural America are paying \n     more than 30 percent of their income for housing:\n       (A) 20 percent of rural renters pay more than 50 percent of \n     their income for housing.\n       (B) 92 percent of all rural renters with significant \n     housing problems pay more than 50 percent of their income for \n     housing costs, and 60 percent paying more than 70 percent of \n     their income for housing.\n       (4) Rural economies are often less diverse, and therefore, \n     jobs and economic opportunity are limited:\n       (A) Factors existing in rural environments, such as \n     remoteness and low population density, lead to limited access \n     to many forces driving the economy, such as technology, \n     lending, and investment.\n       (B) Local expertise is often limited in rural areas where \n     the economies are focused on farming and/or natural resource-\n     based industries.\n       (5) Rural areas have less access to credit than \n     metropolitan areas:\n       (A) Banks and other investors, looking for larger projects \n     with lower risk, seek metropolitan areas for loans and \n     investment.\n       (B) Often, credit that is available is insufficient, \n     leading to the need for interim or bridge financing.\n       (C) Credit in rural areas is often more expensive and \n     available at less favorable terms than in metropolitan areas.\n       (6) The Federal Government investment in rural rental \n     housing has dropped during the last 10 years, as--\n       (A) Federal spending for rural rental housing has been cut \n     by 73 percent since 1994; and\n\n[[Page S10928]]\n\n       (B) Rural rental housing unit production financed by the \n     Federal Government has been reduced by 88 percent since 1990.\n       (7) To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, the \n     Federal Government must work in partnership with State and \n     local governments, private financial institutions, private \n     philanthropic institutions, and the private sector, including \n     nonprofit organizations.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $250,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2001 through 2005.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nRural Rental Housing Act of 2000. This bill takes a much needed step \ntoward reestablishing the federal government's commitment to quality \naffordable housing in rural areas and I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis legislation.\n  The need for a new federal matching grant program to encourage the \nproduction, rehabilitation and acquisition of rural rental housing has \nnever been more evident than it is today. Families across the country \nin small towns, where property is often high and resources scarce, are \nfinding themselves with fewer and fewer options for a safe and \naffordable place to live. In my home state of Vermont, like many other \nstates across the country, we are in the middle of an affordable \nhousing crisis. Housing costs are soaring and rental vacancy rates are \nalarmingly low. For those fortunate enough to find an apartment it is \nincreasingly difficult to afford the rent that the market demands. \nRecent studies suggest that while the need for rental units continues \nto grow in Vermont, estimated production levels are drastically \ninadequate to meet demand.\n  Despite this trend, the federal government has consistently scaled \nback their commitment to production and rehabilitation of rental \nhousing. Rural rental production has dropped nearly 88% since 1990, and \nthe funding for subsidized housing has fallen by 73% since 1994. This \ndecline has made it difficult to produce new housing and maintain the \ncurrent obligations and existing stock. In Vermont roughly 4,091 rental \nunits were produced with federal assistance between 1976 and 1985, but \nduring the next ten years this number fell to under two thousand--\nnearly half of what was produced the decade before, despite the rising \nneed.\n  Nationally it is estimated that 2.6 million households live in \nsubstandard housing with severe structural damage or without indoor \nplumbing, heat, or electricity. Unfortunately, rural areas often have \nless appeal for investment from financial institutions and are often \nisolated from social services that are more accessible in urban areas \nto help address these problems.\n  The Rural Rental Housing Act will provide $250 million dollars for a \nmatching federal grant program to be administered by the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture to address this situation. These funds will \ncomplement existing programs run by the Rural Housing Service at USDA \nand will be used in a variety of ways to increase the supply, the \naffordability, and the quality of housing for the most needy residents, \nthe lowest income families and the elderly. Most importantly the \nprogram is designed to be administered at the state and local level and \nto encourage public-private partnerships to best address the unique \nneeds of each state.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and am \ncommitted to work with Senator Edwards to reintroduce this bill in the \n107th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. KERREY:\n  S. 3229. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for the cost of certain equipment\n\n[[Page S10929]]\n\nused to convert public television broadcasting from analog to digital \ntransmission; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n to establish a tax credit for public television digital transmission \n                              conversions\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we often use the tax code as a tool to \nreward certain taxpayer behaviors. Today, I am pleased to introduce a \nbill that would reward the behavior of individuals or groups who step \nforward to help finance the digital transmission conversions of the 348 \npublic television stations across the United States.\n  Mr. President, public television is an extremely important public \ngood, which brings creative, non-commercial TV programming of the \nhighest quality to citizens in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. \nVirgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa. Public television is available \nto 99 percent of American homes--and serves nearly 100 million people \neach week.\n  Throughout the U.S., 171 noncommercial, educational licensees operate \n348 PBS member stations. Of the 171 licensees, 87 (51%) are community \norganizations, 55 (32%) are colleges or universities, 21 (12%) are \nstate authorities and 8 (5%) are local educational or municipal \nauthorities.\n  As my colleagues may remember, regulations promulgated by the FCC, \npursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, require all public \ntelevision stations to convert their analog transmission equipment and \nsystems to digital transmission by May 1, 2003. This is a very \nexpensive--though important--Federal government mandate. The mandate is \nparticularly burdensome for public television stations because, as non-\nprofit entities, they rely primarily on the charitable donations of \ntheir viewers for financial sustenance.\n  In some states, all of the public television transmission equipment \nis operated and managed by an umbrella organization. In Nebraska, for \nexample, Nebraska Educational Telecommunications (NET) operates nine \ntransmitters and seventeen translators across the state. The cost of \nsimultaneously replacing all of this equipment in a large, but sparsely \npopulated, state is particularly burdensome.\n  I have been working with public broadcasters in the State of Nebraska \nto reduce the financial burden imposed by this government mandate. The \nlegislation I am introducing today is the product of our discussions.\n  This legislation will provide a tax credit to individuals or groups \nthat provide funding for the purchase or construction of qualified \nconversion equipment for a qualified public TV digital conversion \nproject. Qualified conversion equipment would include: transmission \ntowers, transmission equipment, production equipment (including \ncameras, recorders, software and editing systems), retransmission \nequipment, and transformers. The proposed tax credit is equal to the \nfull cost of the conversion equipment, but the taxpayer will be limited \nto \\1/6\\th of the credit each year over a six-year period. The \nindividuals or groups who fund these conversions would not be able to \ncharge rents for use of the equipment or claim depreciation for the \nequipment--the tax credit would be the sole benefit.\n  I am confident that citizens and groups across the United States \nwould take advantage of this tax credit for the benefit of their local \npublic television stations. While time is running out for action on \nthis legislation during the 106th Congress, I am hopeful that the 107th \nCongress will work together with the next Administration to alleviate \nthe financial burden on public television stations through the \nenactment of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 3231. A bill to provide for adjustments to the Central Arizona \nProject in Arizona, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 ARIZONA WATER SETTLEMENTS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain and myself I am \nintroducing legislation today that would codify the largest water \nclaims settlement in the history of Arizona. The affected parties have \nbeen negotiating for several years, and they are getting very close to \nfinalizing these settlement agreements. They still have much work to \ndo; but I am confident that a comprehensive settlement of these issues \nwill be achieved. Therefore, we are introducing this bill today so that \nall interested Arizonans and others can have time to analyze the \nproposed language and make suggestions for changes that will enable us \nto submit a consensus bill early in the next session of Congress.\n  There are a few major issues that have not been resolved. To the \nextent that the parties are close to agreement on certain issues, we \nhave included language in the bill that attempts to capture the essence \nof where the negotiations stand at the moment. For example, although \ndifferences remain, the parties are relatively close to agreement on \nthe process to be followed in negotiating intergovernmental agreements. \nThe legislation will have to be changed, therefore, before it is \nreintroduced in the next Congress, to precisely reflect the agreement \nreached between the parties. In addition, the timing of the waivers to \nbe issued by the Gila River Indian Community is tied to, among other \nthings, a transfer of a minimum amount of federal funds from the Lower \nColorado River Basin Development Fund into the Gila River Indian \nCommunity Settlement Development Trust Fund. The relevant parties \nrecognize that the settlement agreement needs more definition of uses \nof the funds and the precise timing of the transfers, and that the \nultimate legislative language will reflect that consensus.\n  There are other issues that have not been resolved. For example, \nSection 213 of the bill has been left open for the resolution of the \n``Upper Gila Valley'' (including the City of Safford) issues. Those \nnegotiations are continuing, but have not progressed enough to produce \nlanguage that can be included in this version of the bill. In addition, \nTitle IV of the bill has been left open for a possible settlement of \nthe claims of the San Carlos Apache Tribe. We will work with the \nparties over the next few months to ensure that, prior to its \nreintroduction next year, the bill is modified to reflect the ultimate \nresolution of these issues. Of course, if those parties choose to \nlitigate their differences, rather than settle them by negotiation, we \nwill not include titles for them in the final bill.\n  Mr. President, I am submitting for the Record a statement supporting \nthis legislation signed by all eight members of the Arizona \nCongressional delegation. I am also submitting a letter of support from \nArizona Governor Jane Dee Hull. I ask unanimous consent that these \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of the Arizona Congressional Delegation Regarding the Arizona \n            Water Settlements Act of 2000, October 24, 2000\n\n       We are pleased to announce that legislation was introduced \n     today to resolve issues relating to the repayment obligations \n     of the State of Arizona for construction of the Central \n     Arizona Project (CAP), allocation of remaining CAP water \n     (including the use of nearly 200,000 acre-feet of water to \n     satisfy the water rights claims of the Gila River Indian \n     Community, the Tohono O'odham Nation, and other Arizona \n     Indian tribes), and other issues, including final settlement \n     of all claims to waters of the Gila River and its \n     tributaries.\n       Legislation is needed to codify several aspects of the \n     settlement of these various water related issues. Although \n     not all water users have reached agreement on all issues, \n     negotiations are continuing at a rapid pace. We, therefore, \n     expect that all of the remaining differences will be resolved \n     and settlement agreements will be signed by the parties in \n     the next two months. When final agreements are signed, we \n     intend to introduce the final version of legislation to \n     effectuate those settlements. In the meantime, we have \n     introduced this first version of legislation to demonstrate \n     our commitment to the settlement process, and to allow all \n     interested parties the time to suggest changes to precisely \n     reflect the terms of the settlement.\n       One of the purposes of this legislation is to implement the \n     settlement (in lieu of adjudication) of all of the water \n     rights claims to the Gila River and its tributaries. Once \n     this legislation is enacted, and the presiding judge approves \n     the settlement, water litigation over rights to the waters of \n     the Gila River, which has been ongoing since 1978, will be \n     terminated. Resolution of this case, and of other issues \n     addressed in the settlement agreements, will help to ensure \n     that there is a more stable and certain water supply for the \n     various water users. This is a significant benefit to the \n     citizens of Arizona, the tribes, and the United States.\n\n[[Page S10930]]\n\n       The legislation will also resolve several issues. For \n     example, it will effectuate a settlement of litigation \n     between the state and federal government over the state's \n     repayment obligation for construction of the Central Arizona \n     Project. It also amends the Colorado River Basin Project Act \n     of 1968 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to expend \n     funds from the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund to \n     construct irrigation distribution systems to deliver CAP \n     water to the Gila River Indian Community and other CAP water \n     users.\n       In addition, this legislation authorizes the reallocation \n     of 65,647 acre-feet of CAP water for use by Arizona \n     communities, and the reallocation of nearly 200,000 acre-feet \n     for the settlement of Indian water claims.\n       We compliment the parties for their hard work and their \n     commitment to resolving these difficult and sometimes \n     contentious issues. We hope and expect that all parties will \n     continue to negotiate in good faith to resolve the remaining \n     issues.\n       Since the parties have not yet completed their \n     negotiations, this bill is, of necessity, also a work in \n     progress. We point out that some of the provisions in the \n     bill may have to be modified (e.g. Section 207 has not been \n     totally agreed to by all interested parties), and other \n     provisions will have to be added (e.g. resolution of \n     conflicts involving water users in the Upper Gila Valley, the \n     City of Safford, and the San Carlos Apache Tribe).\n       We note that, while Interior staff have been active in the \n     ongoing negotiations and have served on the committees \n     drafting the bill, the Department of the Interior has not had \n     an opportunity to vet some sections of this draft prior to \n     its introduction. One reason for introducing this bill now \n     rather than waiting until the final settlement agreement has \n     been completed, is to enable Secretary Babbitt to analyze and \n     comment upon the draft legislation before he leaves office in \n     January. Secretary Babbitt has been a major participant in \n     the negotiations over the last two years; and his input into \n     the final legislation will be very important to the \n     successful conclusion of the process.\n       In summary, our intention is to initiate public discussion \n     of the issues and elicit constructive comments on this bill. \n     Our plan is to reintroduce a modified form of this bill early \n     in the 107th Congress. We expect that the necessary \n     settlement agreements will be complete and signed prior to \n     reintroduction. In relation to the Gila River Indian \n     Community Settlement, we expect that all of the participants \n     named in the attached list will support the settlement \n     agreement, and the implementing legislation. Section 213 has \n     been left open for additional parties to the agreement.\n       We hope that agreement can be reached to settle the claims \n     of the San Carlos Apache Tribe. Title IV has been left open \n     for this purpose. However, if the San Carlos Tribe cannot \n     reach agreement with the other parties, including the United \n     States, it is our intention to proceed without Title IV. A \n     separate San Carlos settlement will have to be pursued at a \n     later date.\n       We pledge our continuing effort to work with the parties to \n     successfully conclude these historic settlements.\n         John McCain, U.S. Senator; Bob Stump, Member of Congress, \n           Jon Kyl, U.S. Senator; Jim Kolbe, Member of Congress; \n           Ed Pastor, Member of Congress; Matt Salmon, Member of \n           Congress; J.D.

Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: I commend you for the introduction of the \n     draft legislation the Arizona Water Settlements Act of 2000. \n     This bill will maintain the momentum toward the completion of \n     negotiations on difficult water issues concerning the Central \n     Arizona Project, the Gila River Indian Community, the Tohono \n     O'odham Nation, and the San Carlos Apache Tribe.\n       The Central Arizona Project is the lifeblood of Arizona. \n     Confirming the repayment settlement between the United States \n     and the Central Arizona Water Conservation District will \n     benefit all of Arizona's taxpayers. Confirming the agreement \n     between the Secretary of the Interior and the Arizona \n     Department of Water Resources on the allocation of CAP water \n     will provide for Arizona's future.\n       It is my understanding that when this legislation is \n     reintroduced in the next congressional session, the parties \n     will approve the Gila River Indian Community settlement \n     agreement. The Governor of the State of Arizona has \n     traditionally been a signatory to Indian water rights \n     settlements and I expect to be a signatory to the Gila \n     settlement. However, I want to emphasize that I will only \n     support a complete settlement of the Gila River Indian \n     Community claims. For example, the economic well being of the \n     upper Gila River Valley communities and agricultural \n     interests is of great interest to the State of Arizona. I \n     understand that much work remains to revolve these upper \n     valley issues and I urge all the participants to reach an \n     agreement as part of the overall settlement.\n       Again, I commend your efforts to move the process along, \n     and I look forward to our continued work together on Arizona \n     water resource issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jane Dee Hull,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nKyl, as a co-sponsor to this important legislation, the Arizona Water \nSettlements Act of 2000, to ratify a negotiated settlement for Central \nArizona Project water allocations to municipalities, agricultural \ndistricts and Indian tribes in the state of Arizona. This settlement \nreflects extensive negotiations by state, federal, and tribal parties.\n  Let me begin by commending the extraordinary commitment and diligence \nby all parties involved in these negotiations to reach this pivotal \nstage in the settlement process, which as I understand is near \nconclusion. I also praise my colleague, Senator Jon Kyl, and the \nInterior Secretary, Bruce Babbitt, for their front-line leadership in \nfacilitating the settlement process. From my previous role in \nlegislating past agreements, I recognize how challenging these \nnegotiations can be, and I appreciate their personal commitment to this \nsettlement process.\n  This legislation is vitally important to Arizona's future because it \nwill finally bring certainty and stability to Arizona's water supply by \ncompleting the final adjudication of the Gila River. Repayment \nobligations of the state of Arizona for construction of the Central \nArizona Project (CAP) will be addressed as part of this bill. Pending \nwater rights claims to the Gila River and its tributaries by various \nIndian tribes and non-Indian users will be permanently settled and \nallocated.\n  I join Senator Kyl, and the rest of the Arizona delegation, in \nsponsoring companion bills today to express our strong support for \ncontinuation and conclusion of this settlement process. While much of \nthe negotiations have successfully resulted in consensus language among \nthe various parties, it is important to emphasize that this bill does \nnot reflect the final settlement agreement. All parties recognize that \nthe provisions of this bill are likely to change as the negotiations \ncontinue and additional parties settle remaining claims. We fully \nexpect that settlement negotiations will continue with a final \nagreement ratified in the 107th congressional session.\n  Mr. President, my sponsorship of this bill indicates my strong \nsupport for the settlement process and I expect that further \nnegotiations will be carried out in good-faith among all parties. \nHowever, I want to be clear that my support today is not a full \nendorsement of all the provisions in this preliminary bill.\n  This is a particularly important point as several provisions in this \nbill are not typical of language included in past Indian water \nsettlement agreements ratified by the Congress. These noted provisions \nare intended to prescribe future off-reservation Indian trust land \nacquisitions for the Gila River Indian Community, one of the primary \nIndian parties to the settlement. Inclusion of these provisions is\n\n[[Page S10931]]\n\nintended to address water management concerns of the state in the event \nthat the tribe removes lands from either public or private use to be \nadded into federal Indian trust land status.\n  Mr. President, Indian trust land acquisitions are the subject of much \ndebate nationwide. In fact, the Department of Interior has proposed \nmodifications to its existing regulations to address many of the same \nconcerns raised by the state parties regarding potential impacts to \nresource management, loss of tax revenues, or other impacts to \nneighboring communities. These regulations have not been finalized to \ndate.\n  Despite my support for the overall settlement, I believe it unwise to \ninclude ad hoc language that applies restrictions to only one \nparticular tribe when overall changes to the underlying federal law \ngoverning Indian trust land acquisitions have not been settled. Such \nmodifications to federal Indian trust land policies should also be \nguided by the review and advice of the congressional committees of \njurisdiction.

Res. 36\n\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, as co-pilot and navigator with Floyd \n     Bennett and under the sponsorship of Joseph Wanamaker, flew \n     the Ford trimotor monoplane ``Josephine Ford'' on a flying \n     tour to more than 50 American cities in 1926, thereby \n     promoting commercial aviation as a safe, reliable, and \n     practical means of transport;\n       Whereas in 1927 Bernt Balchen, piloting the first flight to \n     carry United States mail over the Atlantic Ocean, flew the \n     aircraft ``America'' to France under weather conditions so \n     adverse that he was forced to set the aircraft down in the \n     surf off Normandy at night, a maneuver that he executed so \n     skillfully that he saved all on board the aircraft;\n       Whereas on November 29, 1929, Bernt Balchen, while \n     participating in the first expedition of Admiral Richard \n     Evelyn Byrd to Antarctica, became the first pilot to fly a \n     plane over the South Pole;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen was indispensable to the success of \n     various American expeditions in Antarctica under the \n     leadership of Admiral Byrd and Lincoln Ellsworth;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, under secret conditions and in \n     record time, was responsible for building in Greenland in the \n     autumn of 1941 the air base Sondre Stromfjord, then known as \n     ``Bluie West Eight'', that was used for ferrying warplanes to \n     Europe;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, as commander of ``Bluie West Eight'' \n     between September 1941 and November 1943, provided his \n     personnel with training in cold weather survival skills and \n     rescue techniques which enabled them to carry out many \n     spectacular rescues of downed airmen on the Greenland icecap;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, on May 7, 1943, successfully led a \n     bombing raid that destroyed the sole German post in \n     Greenland, a weather station and antiaircraft battery on the \n     east coast of Greenland, thereby hindering the ability of the \n     German armed forces to predict weather patterns in the North \n     Atlantic and Europe;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, between March

nationalities and \n     transported strategic freight and numerous important \n     diplomats and Armed Forces officers;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, between July and October 1944, \n     commanded a clandestine air transport operation that \n     transported 64 tons of operational supplies from Scotland to \n     occupied Norway in defiance of severe enemy opposition;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, between November 1944 and April \n     1945, commanded a clandestine air transport operation that, \n     again in defiance of severe enemy opposition, transported \n     from England to Sweden 200 tons of arctic equipment and \n     operational supplies that were used to make clandestine \n     overland transport from Sweden to Norway possible;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, during

intelligence of inestimable value to \n     the Allied Expeditionary Force;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, as one of the founders of the \n     Scandinavian Airlines System, pioneered commercial airline \n     flight over the North Pole, which increased business \n     development in Alaska and shortened the flying time necessary \n     for international flights between the United States and \n     points in Europe and Asia;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, from November 1948 to January 1951, \n     commanded the 10th Rescue Squadron of the United States Air \n     Force, which was headquartered in Alaska but ranged across \n     the entire northern tier of North America rescuing downed \n     airmen, and led the squadron in the development of the \n     techniques that are now universally used in cold weather \n     search and rescue operations;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen was the individual primarily \n     responsible for the pioneering and development of the \n     strategic air base at Thule, Greenland, which was built \n     secretly in 1951 under severe weather conditions and which, \n     by extending the range of the Strategic Air Command, \n     increased the capabilities that made the Strategic Air \n     Command a significant deterrent to Soviet aggression during \n     the Cold War;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, as Assistant for Arctic Activities \n     in the Directorate of Operations of the United States Air \n     Force, rendered expert advice on the development of concepts, \n     procedures, and programs pertaining to the Arctic that have \n     been consistently utilized by other agencies in planning \n     Arctic projects and operations of national and international \n     interest;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen served brilliantly as an officer in \n     the United States Air Force and contributed immeasurably to \n     the mission of the Air Force and the security of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the International Aviation Snow Symposium, of which \n     Bernt Balchen was a founder and honorary chairman, \n     established in 1976 the Balchen Award that is presented \n     annually to recognize excellence in the performance of \n     airport snow and ice removal, is sought avidly by the \n     managers of airports of all categories in the United States \n     and Canada, and has successfully encouraged progressive \n     improvement in cold weather airport safety and air travel;\n       Whereas the United States Government has awarded Bernt \n     Balchen the Byrd Antarctic Expedition Congressional Medal, \n     the Distinguished Service Medal, the Distinguished Flying \n     Cross, the Legion of Merit, the Soldier's Medal, and the Air \n     Medal, and other governments and societies have awarded Bernt \n     Balchen various other medals and awards in recognition of his \n     patriotism and remarkable achievement in aviation;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen, a native of Norway who became a \n     citizen of the United States on November 5, 1931, before a \n     Federal judge in Hackensack, New Jersey, and entered the \n     military service of the United States in the United States \n     Army Air Corps on September 5, 1941, at all times furthered \n     the cordial relationship between the United States of America \n     and the Kingdom of Norway, one of America's most-cherished \n     allies;\n       Whereas Bernt Balchen was buried with full military honors \n     at Arlington National Cemetery on October 23, 1973; and\n       Whereas October 23, 1999, is the 100th anniversary of the \n     birth of Bernt Balchen and is being observed as such in many \n     commemorative events taking place in the United States and \n     Norway: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the late \n     Bernt Balchen is hereby recognized for his extraordinary \n

Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate passed my \nresolution to urge the creation of a postage stamp honoring Korczak \nZiolkowski, the visionary sculptor who began work on the Crazy Horse \nMemorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota over 52 years ago. I would \nlike to take a moment to describe the man and the dream that led him to \ncarve a mountain.\n  Korczak Ziolkowski was born on September 6, 1908 in Boston, \nMassachusetts. Orphaned at age one, he grew up in a series of foster \nhomes and often was mistreated. Korczak later would say that his \ncollective experiences during this difficult part of his life prepared \nhim for sculpting the Crazy Horse memorial and enabled him to prevail \nover the decades of financial hardship he encountered trying to create \nan Indian memorial in the Black Hills.\n  Before coming west, Korczak was a noted studio sculptor and member of \nthe National Sculpture Society. Although he never took a lesson in art \nor sculpture, his marble portrait of Polish composer and political \nleader Ignace Jan Paderewski won first prize by unanimous vote at the \n1939 New York World's Fair. This award drew the attention of Lakota \nSioux Chief Henry Standing Bear, who invited Korczak to carve a \nmemorial to the Sioux warrior Crazy Horse in the sacred Black Hills. In \nhis invitation letter, Chief Standing Bear wrote: ``My fellow chiefs \nand I would like the white man to know the red man has great heroes, \ntoo.''\n  In 1939, Korczak also traveled to South Dakota to assist Gutzon \nBorglum, the famed sculptor of Mount Rushmore. Korczak finally met \nChief Standing Bear in 1941 and he learned more about Crazy Horse. He \nthen returned to his sculpting career in New\n\n[[Page S10941]]\n\nEngland, but he never stopped studying the life of Crazy Horse and the \nNative American tribes of North America. However, a sense of duty to \nhis country delayed his return to South Dakota. At age 34, he \nvolunteered for service in World War II, landed on Omaha Beach and \nlater was wounded. After the war, Korczak turned down a government \ncommission to create war memorials in Europe to accept Chief Standing \nBear's invitation. He returned to South Dakota in 1947 and dedicated \nthe rest of his life to sculpting the Crazy Horse Memorial.\n  Korczak's first year in the Black Hills was spent pioneering, \nbuilding a log cabin, and constructing a massive wooden staircase to \nthe top of the mountain he would carve. Then, on June 3, 1948, the \nCrazy Horse Memorial was dedicated. From its inception, Korczak said \nthat the memorial would be a nonprofit educational and cultural project \nfor all Native Americans. The memorial would be financed solely by the \ninterested public, not from government funds. In fact, Korczak twice \nturned down $10 million in federal funds because he believed the \ngovernment would never complete the memorial as he envisioned it--a \nsprawling campus including the Indian Museum of North America and the \nUniversity and Medical Training Center for the North American Indian \nwith the massive mountain carving at its center. Carved in three \ndimensions, the memorial is 563 high and 641 feet long, and upon \ncompletion will be the largest sculpture in the world.\n  In 1950, Korczak married Ruth Ross, a volunteer at the memorial, and \nhad 10 children, one of whom he delivered himself. Korczak soon \nrealized that finishing the memorial would exceed one man's lifetime, \nso he and Ruth prepared detailed plans for the memorial's completion. \nSince Korczak's death on October 20, 1982, Ruth has carried out his \nvision. Under her leadership, the memorial continues to grow. In 1998, \n50 years after the first blast on the mountain, the completed face of \nCrazy Horse was dedicated, and more recently, a state of the art \nvisitors center was opened to educate visitors about the memorial. \nRuth's next task is to complete work on the head of the Sioux leader's \nhorse, which is a staggering 20 stories tall. Completing the memorial \nmay take decades, even generations, to complete, but I am certain that \nunder the leadership of the Ziolkowski family and the Crazy Horse \nMemorial Foundation it will be completed.\n  Korczak Ziolkowski was a humble man. From his first days on the \nmemorial to his death, he never took salary. He always believed that, \nfirst and foremost, the Crazy Horse Memorial was for the Native \nAmericans. I would like to close with a quote Korczak was fond of: \n``When the legends die, the dreams end; when the dreams end, there is \nno more greatness.'' Korczak's legend did not die with him. His and \nChief Henry Standing Bear's dream continues to inspire greatness today. \nNow, eighteen years after his death, it is my hope we can share his \ndream with all Americans by issuing a postage stamp in his honor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous \nconsent that the resolution, as amended, and the preamble, as amended, \nbe agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 371\n\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was born in Boston, \n     Massachusetts on September 6, 1908, the 31st anniversary of \n     the death of Lakota Sioux warrior Crazy Horse;\n       Whereas, although never trained in art or sculpture, \n     Korczak Ziolkowski began a successful studio career in New \n     England as a commissioned sculptor at age 24;\n       Whereas Korzcak Ziolowski's marble sculpture of composer \n     and Polish leader Ignace Jan Paderewski won first prize at \n     the 1939 New York World's Fair and prompted Lakota Indian \n     Chiefs to invite Ziolkowski to carve a memorial for Native \n     Americans;\n       Whereas later that year, Korzcak Ziolkowski assisted Gutzon \n     Borglum in carving Mount Rushmore;\n       Whereas while in South Dakota, Korczak Ziolkowski met with \n     Chief Henry Standing Bear who taught Korczak more about the \n     life of the brave warrior Crazy Horse;\n       Whereas at the age of 34, Korczak Ziolkowski temporarily \n     put his sculptures aside when he volunteered for service in \n     World War II, later landing on Omaha Beach;\n       Whereas after the war, Korczak Ziolkowski turned down other \n     sculpting opportunities in order to accept the invitation of \n     Chief Henry Standing Bear and dedicate the rest of his life \n     to carving the Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of \n     South Dakota;\n       Whereas on June 3, 1948, when work was begun on the Crazy \n     Horse Memorial, Korczak Ziolkowski vowed that the memorial \n     would be a nonprofit educational and cultural project, \n     financed solely through private, nongovernmental sources, for \n     the Native Americans of North America;\n       Whereas the Crazy Horse Memorial is a mountain carving-in-\n     progress, and once completed it will be the tallest sculpture \n     in the world;\n       Whereas since his death on October 20, 1982, Korczak's wife \n     Ruth and the Ziolkowski family have continued to work on the \n     Memorial and to expand upon the dream of Korczak Ziolkowski; \n     and\n       Whereas on June 3, 1998, the Memorial entered its second \n     half century of progress and heralded a new era of work on \n     the mountain with the completion and dedication of the face \n     of Crazy Horse: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate recognizes--\n       (A) the admirable efforts of the late Korczak Ziolkowski in \n     designing and creating the Crazy Horse Memorial;\n       (B) that the Crazy Horse Memorial represents all North \n     American Indian tribes, and the noble goal of reconciliation \n     between peoples; and\n       (C) that the creation of the Crazy Horse Memorial, from its \n     inception, has been accomplished through private donations \n     and without any Federal funding; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the Citizens' Stamp \n     Advisory Committee should recommend to the Postmaster General \n     that a commemorative postage stamp be issued in honor of \n     sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski for his upcoming 100th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10941-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10941-S10942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PROTECTING SENIORS FROM FRAUD ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Seniors From \n     Fraud Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Older Americans are among the most rapidly growing \n     segments of our society.\n       (2) Our Nation's elderly are too frequently the victims of \n     violent crime, property crime, and consumer and telemarketing \n     fraud.\n       (3) The elderly are often targeted and retargeted in a \n     range of fraudulent schemes.\n       (4) The TRIAD program, originally sponsored by the National \n     Sheriffs' Association, International Association of Chiefs of \n     Police, and the American Association of Retired Persons \n     unites sheriffs, police chiefs, senior volunteers, elder care \n     providers, families, and seniors to reduce the criminal \n     victimization of the elderly.\n       (5) Congress should continue to support TRIAD and similar \n     community partnerships that improve the safety and quality of \n     life for millions of senior citizens.\n       (6) There are few other community-based efforts that forge \n     partnerships to coordinate criminal justice and social \n     service resources to improve the safety and security of the \n     elderly.\n       (7) According to the National Consumers League, \n     telemarketing fraud costs consumers nearly $40,000,000,000 \n     each year.\n       (8) Senior citizens are often the target of telemarketing \n     fraud.\n       (9) Fraudulent telemarketers compile the names of consumers \n     who are potentially vulnerable to telemarketing fraud into \n     the so-called ``mooch lists''.\n       (10) It is estimated that 56 percent of the names on such \n     ``mooch lists'' are individuals age 50 or older.\n\n[[Page S10942]]\n\n       (11) The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal \n     Trade Commission have provided resources to assist private-\n     sector organizations to operate outreach programs to warn \n     senior citizens whose names appear on confiscated ``mooch \n     lists''.\n       (12) The Administration on Aging was formed, in part, to \n     provide senior citizens with the resources, information, and \n     assistance their special circumstances require.\n       (13) The Administration on Aging has a system in place to \n     inform senior citizens of the dangers of telemarketing fraud.\n       (14) Senior citizens need to be warned of the dangers of \n     telemarketing fraud before they become victims of such fraud.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENIOR FRAUD PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Attorney General $1,000,000 for \n     each of the fiscal years 2001 through 2005 for programs for \n     the National Association of TRIAD.\n       (b) Comptroller General.--The Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     effectiveness of the TRIAD program 180 days prior to the \n     expiration of the authorization under this Act, including an \n     analysis of TRIAD programs and activities; identification of \n     impediments to the establishment of TRIADS across the Nation; \n     and recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the TRIAD \n     program.\n\n     SEC. 4. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services for Aging, shall provide to the Attorney \n     General of each State and publicly disseminate in each State, \n     including dissemination to area agencies on aging, \n     information designed to educate senior citizens and raise \n     awareness about the dangers of fraud, including telemarketing \n     and sweepstakes fraud.\n       (b) Information.--In carrying out subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall--\n       (1) inform senior citizens of the prevalence of \n     telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud targeted against them;\n       (2) inform senior citizens how telemarketing and \n     sweepstakes fraud work;\n       (3) inform senior citizens how to identify telemarketing \n     and sweepstakes fraud;\n       (4) inform senior citizens how to protect themselves \n     against telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud, including an \n     explanation of the dangers of providing bank account, credit \n     card, or other financial or personal information over the \n     telephone to unsolicited callers;\n       (5) inform senior citizens how to report suspected attempts \n     at or acts of fraud;\n       (6) inform senior citizens of their consumer protection \n     rights under Federal law; and\n       (7) provide such other information as the Secretary \n     considers necessary to protect senior citizens against \n     fraudulent telemarketing and sweepstakes promotions.\n       (c) Means of Dissemination.--The Secretary shall determine \n     the means to disseminate information under this section. In \n     making such determination, the Secretary shall consider--\n       (1) public service announcements;\n       (2) a printed manual or pamphlet;\n       (3) an Internet website;\n       (4) direct mailings; and\n       (5) telephone outreach to individuals whose names appear on \n     so-called ``mooch lists'' confiscated from fraudulent \n     marketers.\n       (d) Priority.--In disseminating information under this \n     section, the Secretary shall give priority to areas with high \n     incidents of fraud against senior citizens.\n\n     SEC. 5. STUDY OF CRIMES AGAINST SENIORS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall conduct a study \n     relating to crimes against seniors, in order to assist in \n     developing new strategies to prevent and otherwise reduce the \n     incidence of those crimes.\n       (b) Issues Addressed.--The study conducted under this \n     section shall include an analysis of--\n       (1) the nature and type of crimes perpetrated against \n     seniors, with special focus on--\n       (A) the most common types of crimes that affect seniors;\n       (B) the nature and extent of telemarketing, sweepstakes, \n     and repair fraud against seniors; and\n       (C) the nature and extent of financial and material fraud \n     targeted at seniors;\n       (2) the risk factors associated with seniors who have been \n     victimized;\n       (3) the manner in which the Federal and State criminal \n     justice systems respond to crimes against seniors;\n       (4) the feasibility of States establishing and maintaining \n     a centralized computer database on the incidence of crimes \n     against seniors that will promote the uniform identification \n     and reporting of such crimes;\n       (5) the effectiveness of damage awards in court actions and \n     other means by which seniors receive reimbursement and other \n     damages after fraud has been established; and\n       (6) other effective ways to prevent or reduce the \n     occurrence of crimes against seniors.\n\n     SEC. 6. INCLUSION OF SENIORS IN NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION \n                   SURVEY.\n\n       Beginning not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, as part of each National Crime \n     Victimization Survey, the Attorney General shall include \n     statistics relating to--\n       (1) crimes targeting or disproportionately affecting \n     seniors;\n       (2) crime risk factors for seniors, including the times and \n     locations at which crimes victimizing seniors are most likely \n     to occur; and\n       (3) specific characteristics of the victims of crimes who \n     are seniors, including age, gender, race or ethnicity, and \n     socioeconomic status.\n\n     SEC. 7. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OUTREACH.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that State and local \n     governments should fully incorporate fraud avoidance \n     information and programs into programs that provide \n     assistance to the aging.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/24/senate-section/article/S10942-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10942-S10943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADOPTION OF RETIRED MILITARY DOGS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate now proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3230, \nintroduced earlier today by Senators Lugar and Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3230) to reauthorize the authority for the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to pay costs associated with removal \n     of commodities that pose a health or safety risk and to make \n     adjustments to certain child nutrition programs.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                    grain standards reauthorization\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Grain Standards Act contains the Small Watershed \nRehabilitation Amendments of 2000, legislation that enables the Natural \nResources Conservation Service (NRCS) to provide cost-share money for \nlocal sponsors to rehabilitate dams that were built with funding from \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture. Before approving a project, NRCS \nwill examine all options, including correcting damage or deterioration \nof the structure, upgrading the structural measure to meet changed land \nuse conditions or safety needs within the watershed, and \ndecommissioning the structure. Let me ask you, Mr. Chairman, is it your \nunderstanding that even though NRCS must fully evaluate every \nreasonable option, if a local sponsor does not wish to choose \ndecommissioning the local sponsor can reject that option if NRCS \npresents it?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. As with any of options for rehabilitation, the local \nsponsor can reject NRCS' offer to provide cost-share for a particular \nproject. also, NRCS is never required to fund a project that it \nbelieves is not justified.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I recognize that this Act is silent on the \nrequirements of a formal cost-benefit analysis. I would like to ask \nyou, Mr. Chairman, if it is your understanding that each project should \nbe completed using the most-effective option possible that also has the \nfewest environmental costs, including the options of voluntary buy-outs \nof at-risk structures, wetland restoration, dam decommissioning, and \ndam removal?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. Although the bill is silent on cost-benefit analysis, \nit is expected that NRCS will follow its normal procedures including \nfollowing the ``Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines \nfor Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies.'' As part \nof being fiscally and environmentally responsible, NRCS should look for \nthe most cost-effective solution with the best feasible environmental \nresults. Further, NRCS should not fund a project if the local sponsor \ninsists on a form of rehabilitation that does not meet these standards.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under this Act, the Secretary will establish a system of \napproving rehabilitation requests. As part of this process, Mr. \nChairman, is it correct that NRCS should give equal priority to local \nsponsors projects regardless of the form of rehabilitation requested?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. The system NRCS establishes for approving a \nrehabilitation project should not rank projects based on the local \nsponsor's choice of rehabilitation, as defined in the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senate has passed a substantially similar version of \nthe Act. When the bill was reported by the Senate Agriculture Committee \nour report embodied the Committee's understanding of how the provisions \nof the bill should be carried out. Mr. Chairman, does that report still \nembody our understanding of the interpretation of the Small Watershed \nRehabilitation Amendments of 2000?\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. Our report language should be used as legislative \nhistory of interpreting and applying this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements related to \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3230) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3230\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
