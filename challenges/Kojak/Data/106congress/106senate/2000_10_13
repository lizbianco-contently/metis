We remember the words of John Paul Jones, the \nfather of the Navy, ``Sir, I have not yet begun to fight.'' He defied \ndefeat and surrender on that day in 1779 and gave the Navy not only a \nmotto for heroism but an example of courage that has remained strong \nduring war as well as in peacetime service to our Nation.\n  Yet, Lord, our celebration of this birthday of the Navy is mingled \nwith grief for the sailors of the U.S.S Cole who were killed, injured, \nor are missing as a result of an explosion in the destroyer as it was \npulling into Aden, Yemen. Dear Father, be with the sailors' families \nand friends at this time of loss.\n  Lord, our minds drift back to the gallantry of the Navy in American \nhistory. May the men and women of the Navy know of the profound \ngratitude and esteem this Senate has for them.\n  And Lord, we could not celebrate the Navy's birthday without a \nspecial expression of thanks to You for our own friend and doctor, \nAdmiral John Eisold, the physician for the Members and officers of the \nCongress. Bless him and all of the Navy personnel on this special day. \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10517-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Ted Stevens, a Senator from the State of Alaska, led \nthe Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4461, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill, H.R. \n     4461, making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, the Food and Drug Administration, and related \n     agency programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2001, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed that \n     the House recede from its disagreement of the Senate \n     amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, signed by a \n     majority of the conferees on the part of the House.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the Record of Friday, October 6, \n2000.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my prepared \nremarks describing the provisions of this conference report be printed \nat this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to announce to the \nSenate that we successfully completed action in our conference \ncommittee and brought back to the Senate a bill that has already been \napproved by the other body by a substantial vote of support, and \nindications are that the President is prepared to sign this conference \nreport.\n  I am pleased to make that announcement because during the development \nof this legislation and the markup sessions that we held here in the \nSenate, and discussions of the bill on the floor of the Senate, there \nwere some very contentious and controversial issues that were debated \nand considered. We didn't achieve all of the successes that Senators \nwanted to achieve, as is usually the case in the situation where you \nare negotiating compromise with the other body and dealing with views \nand opinions reflected in the policies of the administration. But, \ntaken together, given the expressions of support and interest in the \nSenate for the provisions that are in the bill, I am confident that \nmost Senators will be very pleased with this result.\n  This is a good bill. It deserves the support of the Senate.\n  It provides a restrained approach to funding the activities of the \nAgencies and Departments of Government that are funded in this bill.\n  The total dollar amount for new budget authority, for example, is \nless than the fiscal year 2000 enacted level. It is less than the level \nrequested by the President. It is less than the House-passed bill \nlevel, and it is less than the Senate-passed bill level.\n  The fact is, every effort was made during consideration of this bill \nto be restrained and responsible in the allocation of funds that are \navailable to this subcommittee under the budget resolution.\n  The conference agreement provides total new budget authority of $74.5 \nbillion for programs and activities of the United States Department of \nAgriculture (except for the Forest Service which is funded by the \nInterior Appropriations bill), the Food and Drug Administration, and \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This is approximately $1.1 \nbillion less than the fiscal year 2000 enacted level and $2.3 billion \nless than the level requested by the President. It is $651 million less \nthan the House-passed bill level, and $859 million less than the \nSenate-passed bill level.\n  This conference report also includes an additional $3.6 billion in \nemergency appropriations to compensate agricultural producers for \nlosses suffered due to drought, fires, and other natural disasters; to \nmeet conservation needs; and to provide relief to rural communities.\n  Including Congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-\nyear spending actions, this conference agreement provides total non-\nemergency discretionary spending for fiscal year 2001 of just over $15 \nbillion in budget authority and outlays.\n  I am pleased to report that this conference report provides funding \nat the President's request level, an increase of nearly $58 million \nfrom the fiscal year 2000 level, for activities and programs in this \nbill which are part of the Administration's ``Food Safety Initiative.''\n  The conference report provides adequate funding in our view for the \nFood Safety and Inspection Service, which has the responsibility of \nconducting inspections and monitoring the safety of our Nation's food \nsupply to ensure that the food that is consumed by Americans and \nproduced and processed here is fit for human consumption, and free from \ncontamination.\n  This is a big challenge. It is a big worry all over the country \nbecause there have been instances where there have been problems in \nthis area. We think this conference report responds to those concerns \nand that will have a very positive influence in helping to solve \nproblems in this area of food safety.\n  Let me also point out the emphasis in this conference report on \nagricultural research and education programs. We have to maintain a \nhigh level of technological sophistication in order to continue to \nproduce an adequate amount of food and fiber for our country at \nreasonable prices, and to do so in a way that permits a level of profit \nfor those engaged in farming operations to stay in business. It is very \ndifficult in many areas of the country now for farmers and ranchers to \nmake ends meet. They are confronted with a wide range of difficulties.\n  We have to invest in research to try to find new ways of improving \nyields for the crops that are produced in our country, and to do so in \na way that is not threatening to the environment or to the citizens of \nour country. We have a heightened awareness of problems that can occur \nin this area.\n  There is almost a near hysteria in Europe over this issue. We are \nconfronting difficulties in trade because we are having problems \ngetting licenses for commodities and foods that are produced in the \nUnited States because they have genetically modified organisms--GMOs--\nwhich is a big issue in the U.K. particularly. The tabloids have been \nfanning the flames of the hysteria that has taken hold there. The \nEuropean Union has been very hesitant and difficult to deal with in \napproving licenses from exporters who would like to sell what they are \nproducing in the European market. In my view, many of these practices \nare unfair and not based on sound science.\n  But we need to have a regiment of research and development that is \nbeyond question in terms of its impact on human health and our \nenvironment. That is why it is as important this year, more important \nthan ever before, to have a robust research and education program that \nis supported by the Department of Agriculture. In colleges and \nuniversities and in Agricultural Research Service laboratories all \naround the country, there are funds that will be made available to help \nachieve the goals in this area.\n  This conference agreement provides increased appropriations for \nagriculture research and education programs. Total appropriations of \nnearly $2 billion are provided for the Agriculture Research Service and \nthe Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, $126 \nmillion more than the fiscal year 2000 level and $62 million more than \nthe Senate-passed bill level. In addition, as requested by the \nPresident and provided in the Senate bill, $120 million in fiscal year \n2000 funding will be available in fiscal year 2001 to fund the \nInitiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems.\n  Approximately $34 billion, close to 46 percent of the total new \nbudget authority provided by this conference report, is for domestic \nfood programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These \ninclude food stamps; commodity assistance; the Special Supplemental \nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the school \nlunch and breakfast programs; and the school breakfast pilot program, \nwhich is funded at $6 million. Included in this amount is the Senate-\n\n[[Page S10519]]\n\npassed bill level of $4.052 billion for the WIC program, including $20 \nmillion for the WIC farmers' market nutrition program.\n  The WIC program is a very important nutrition program and health \nprogram for women, infants, and children. Everybody is aware of the \nimportance of school lunch and breakfast programs to help equip our \nchildren with the nutrition they need as they are at school so they can \nlearn and do a good job at school.\n  We also have a Food Stamp Program that is funded in this bill. In my \nview, these are funded at adequate levels to meet the demands and needs \nwe have in our country. We have been very fortunate in this time of \neconomic expansion and growth for jobs to be created so those who want \nto work can find work. We have people coming into the country now under \nspecial visa requirements because we have an inadequate labor supply, \nor at least an inadequately trained supply of labor to do many of the \njobs that have to be done in this country. Many entry level positions \nare now being filled by those who are newly coming into the country, \nmany just for the purpose of working on farms because people who live \nhere and who have been here for a while either don't want to do the \nwork or for some reason are unavailable to those who need help on their \nfarms.\n\n  This is a challenge. The point I am making in connection with the \nfood and nutrition programs is we have been able to reduce the costs of \nsome of these programs, particularly the Food Stamp Program, because of \nthe expansion in the economy and the availability of jobs. We need to \nmake sure through our budget policies that we continue to have an \nenvironment economically for job growth and expansion.\n  For farm assistance programs, the conference report provides $1.3 \nbillion in appropriations. Included in this amount is the full increase \nof $89 million above the fiscal year 2000 level requested by the \nAdministration for Farm Service Agency salaries and expenses, as well \nas appropriations which, together with available carryover balances, \nwill fund the fiscal year 2001 farm operating and farm ownership loan \nlevels included in the President's budget request.\n  Appropriations for conservation programs administered by the Natural \nResources Conservation Service total $873 million, $69 million more \nthan the fiscal year 2000 level, and approximately $6 million more than \nthe level recommended by the Senate.\n  Conservation programs, in my view, are some of the less well \nadvertised programs of the Department of Agriculture. We have increased \nthe amount of acreage available for the Wetlands Reserve Program by \n100,000 acres.\n  We have also worked hard on these programs to ensure they help \nimprove wildlife habitat on farms and on the lands that are owned by \nAmerican citizens. We have incentive programs, not just mandatory \nprograms, but programs that encourage the management of land so that \nconservation is enhanced, and the protection of soil and water \nresources is enhanced by the way landowners use and care for their \nlands.\n  We found that to be a very popular way of helping to encourage and \nobtain the best possible land management practices, rather than having \na Federal Government come in with threats and other sanctions that can \nbe imposed on landowners. It is better to do it in a way that is \neducational and nonthreatening and based on incentives rather than \nsanctions, fines, and penalties from the Federal Government.\n  We also see in this bill something that is important to every rural \ncommunity: development programs, housing programs, water and sewer \nsystem programs. They are all important in rural America. Many of these \ncommunities have some of the lowest income families in America and \ntherefore they don't have the economic base to pay the costs that would \nbe required for utilities and other lifestyle enhancements that are \navailable in the larger towns or the cities of our country. These \nprograms are very important in States, such as mine and others, which \nhave to depend upon Federal assistance to make sure they have safe \ndrinking water, they have sewer systems, they have electric lights, \nthey have telephone service access. These programs are funded in this \nbill this year.\n  For rural economic and community development programs, the conference \nreport provides appropriations of $2.5 billion to support a total loan \nlevel of $8.8 billion. Included in this amount is $763 million for the \nRural Community Advancement Program, $680 million for the rental \nassistance program, and a total rural housing loan program level of \n$5.1 billion.\n\n  A total of $1.1 billion is provided for foreign assistance and \nrelated programs of the Department of Agriculture, including $115 \nmillion in new budget authority for the Foreign Agricultural Service \nand total appropriations of $973 million for the P.L. 480 Food for \nPeace Program, $31 million above the fiscal year 2000 level, and the \nsame as the President's request and Senate bill levels.\n  Total new budget authority for the Food and Drug Administration is \n$1.1 billion, $74 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level and $24 \nmillion more than the Senate-passed bill level. The conference report \nalso makes available an additional $149 million in Prescription Drug \nUser Fee Act collections. The increase in new budget authority, \ntogether with the redirection of base funds, provides FDA with an \nadditional $130 million from the fiscal year 2000 level for funding \nrequirements identified in the President's fiscal year 2001 budget \nrequest. These include the full increases requested in the budget of \n$30 million for food safety, $20 million for construction of the Los \nAngeles laboratory, and $22.9 million for premarket review. Also \nincluded is a portion of the increased funding requested for FDA to \nenforce Internet drug sales, enhance inspections, improve existing \nadverse events reporting systems, and continue counter-bioterrorism \nactivities.\n  In addition, the conference report appropriates, contingent on a \nbudget request, the $23 million FDA has identified it needs for fiscal \nyear 2001 to carry out the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000. \nThe FDA said it needed this amount for this next fiscal year to carry \nout the provisions of this conference report that provides these new \nresponsibilities, to guarantee safety and efficacy of drugs in this new \nera, so that is included in this report.\n  For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $68 million is \nprovided; and a limitation of $35.8 million is established on \nadministrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration.\n  As my colleagues recall, as passed by the Senate, this bill included \nnot only the regular fiscal year 2001 appropriations bill, but a \n``Division B'' providing supplemental appropriations, rescissions, and \nother emergency provisions relating not only to programs and activities \nunder this Subcommittee's jurisdiction but to various other Departments \nand agencies of government. Provisions outside this Subcommittee's \njurisdiction have been deleted by the conference committee and will be \naddressed, as appropriate, on other bills.\n  Funding for emergency assistance for farmers and landowners who have \nbeen affected by drought, fires, and other natural disasters that have \noccurred this year is now included as Title VIII of this conference \nreport. The total assistance package has been scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office at $3.6 billion.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to use such sums as \nnecessary of the Commodity Credit Corporation to compensate farmers for \ncrop and quality losses at the same rates as have been used in previous \nyears. However, unlike years past, there is no limit on the amount of \nfunds available for this assistance, thus eliminating proration of \nproducers' payments and hopefully expediting payments.\n  Other assistance provided by the bill includes $490 million for the \nlivestock assistance program, $473 million for dairy producers, and \n$328 million for producers of certain specialty crops.\n  The agreement provides needed conservation funding by making $35 \nmillion in technical assistance available for the Conservation Reserve \nProgram and the Wetlands Reserve Program, and providing an additional \n$110 million for the Emergency Watershed Program of the Natural \nResources Conservation Service.\n  Senators worked very hard in the conference on this issue, and other\n\n[[Page S10520]]\n\nissues as well. We have expanded the opportunities to sell what we \nproduce in the international marketplace in this conference report as a \nresult of changes in sanctions policy. There have been many initiatives \nintroduced on this subject. I know the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, \nhas a wide, sweeping, and very thoughtful approach to this sanctions \nissue reflected in a bill he has introduced. I hope we can pass \nlegislation in this area that sets new policies and establishes a new \nway of going about deciding when and where to impose sanctions that tie \nthe hands of our exporters and have an adverse impact on our ability to \nsell what we produce on the international marketplace.\n\n  I am not saying sanctions are bad. We have to use them in certain \ncases. They have proven to be very effective in certain cases. \nNormally, this is when we have the cooperation of other countries. But \nwhen we just unilaterally impose sanctions, in many cases that ends up \nbeing more hurtful and harmful to our farmers and ranchers and \nbusinesses than to anybody else. We have to be careful how we approach \nthis whole issue.\n  I think the conference committee exercised good judgment and an \nawareness of concerns throughout our country on this issue when it made \nthe changes that are reflected here. I am hopeful with the emergency \nassistance provisions that are in the bill, the other programs that \nhave been funded, the Senate will be able to enthusiastically support \nand approve the work that this conference committee has done.\n  This conference report carries a number of other legislative \nprovisions adopted by the conference committee, including the Continued \nDumping and Sudsidy Offset Act; the Conservation of Farmable Wetland \nAct; and the Hass Avocado Promotion, Research, and Information Act.\n  Mr. President, we are already well beyond the October 1 start of the \nnew fiscal year. This conference agreement is the product of two \nlengthy sessions of the conference committee. The conference report was \nfiled last Friday night, October 6, and was adopted by the House of \nRepresentatives on October 11 by a vote of 340 to 75. Senate passage of \nthis conference report today is the final step necessary to send this \nfiscal year 2001 appropriations bill to the President for signature \ninto law.\n  Senator Kohl is the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee. It has been \na pleasure to work with him throughout the hearing phase of the \ndevelopment of our factual basis for writing this bill. In all the \ndiscussions we have had in working on challenges before the \nsubcommittee, I could not have asked for more cooperation or careful \nand thoughtful assistance than Senator Kohl provided to me and to the \ncommittee as a whole.\n  The full committee, of course, had a role to play in this, all \nmembers of our subcommittee and full committee, too. I want to express \nmy appreciation to all of them. It was a pleasure working in conference \nwith Chairman Joe Skeen, from New Mexico, who is serving in his last \nyear as chairman of the subcommittee. This is his sixth year in that \ncapacity. The House has term limits on subcommittee chairmen. It \neffectively prohibits his service beyond this year as chairman of the \nsubcommittee. But he has really been a hard-working leader in the House \non the development of this legislation and this appropriations bill. We \nwill miss working with him as chairman. We hope to be able to continue \nworking with him closely in the years ahead, though, as a fellow member \nof the Appropriations Committee in the House.\n  Marcy Kaptur, from Ohio, is the distinguished ranking Democrat on the \nHouse committee. It is always a pleasure working with her. She was very \nhelpful in the development of this bill during our consideration of it \nin conference with the House.\n  I know none of this excellent work product would have been possible \nwithout the outstanding assistance and hard work that has been turned \nin by our able staff members: Rebecca Davies, who is the chief clerk on \nthis committee, Hunt Shipman, Martha Scott Poindexter, Les Spivey, and \nwith the wise counsel and influence of my chief of staff, Mark Keenum, \nand with others who participated in the development of this bill. I say \nthank you. It would not have been possible without their help. This is \nan outstanding work product. We appreciate your excellent effort. I do \nnot want to leave out Galen Fountain either. He is the chief clerk on \nthe Democratic side of our subcommittee. He has been a very helpful \nperson to work with, and we appreciate very much his outstanding \nassistance, too.\n\n  I know of no Senators who have asked to be recognized at this point, \nbut I repeat what the majority leader provided by way of information to \nthe Senate in the opening announcements this morning. We have time \nreserved today, we have time reserved on Tuesday, and a short period of \ntime on Wednesday for discussion of this bill, and then a vote will \noccur at 11:30 on Wednesday morning. I hope Senators will take \nadvantage of these opportunities if they have questions or if they have \nstatements they want to make in connection with the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi for his leadership in producing \na very sound Agriculture Appropriations bill. I have served with the \nSenator from Mississippi on that subcommittee for almost 20 years now \nand have participated in the conference just concluded which has \nproduced this bill. I can personally attest to the professionalism, \ncourtesy, and, perhaps most of all, the patience displayed by the \nSenator from Mississippi in presiding over those proceedings.\n  The public has little opportunity to know what goes on in the \nlegislative process generally, but they do hear about the introduction \nof bills and they do see, on C-SPAN and otherwise, the committee \nmeetings and the questioning of witnesses, and to some extent they see \non C-SPAN II, to the extent anybody watches, what happens on the Senate \nfloor. But the conferences are largely unseen by the public. That is \ncrunch time, when the work is concluded. Everything else which is done \nis really of much less significance than the conferences, where the \nfinal touches are put on legislation which constitutes the laws of the \ncountry.\n  There are very long sessions. A week ago last night was illustrative \nof the point. The speeches tend to go very long. The presiding chairman \nhas to have great patience, to have the proper balance between allowing \nevery member to speak and getting the work completed. That conference \nhad some very difficult issues, issues which related to relieving \nsanctions on Cuba, to allow more importations of food, and it went into \nan issue which is highly sensitive, where there really ought to be an \nevaluation as to our relations with Cuba. We did take a step in the \nright direction on releasing the sanctions as to food--really, largely \nas an economic matter for America's farmers.\n  In the foreign operations bill there is a provision, which this \nSenator introduced, to try to get more cooperation on drug \ninterdiction, which the Cuban Government is willing to do. Then we had \nimportant provisions on reimportation of drugs, on which the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, who is now presiding, \nwas the leader.\n  It has come to pass that the appropriations bills, now, are the \nprincipal legislative vehicles, so to speak, for getting substantive \nlegislation because it is only the appropriations bills, ultimately, \nwhich pass. So much of that is done in conference as opposed to \namendments on the floor, which is the prescribed way.\n  The senior Senator from Mississippi presided at that conference, and \nwe produced a very important bill. As I have heard him report on it \ntoday, I am struck by its promise and its importance for the American \npeople under his leadership.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10521]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I first express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for his generous \ncomments about my efforts in behalf of this legislation as chairman of \nthe subcommittee. He also put in a lot of time and effort during the \nconference with the House and also during the development of this \nlegislation in our subcommittee. He has been an outstanding member of \nthe Appropriations Committee and, of course, chairs the Labor-HHS \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate and does an \nexcellent job in that capacity. I thank him for his very generous \nstatements.\n  I also commend, as he did, the Senator from Vermont, who is chairing \nthe Senate this morning, for his leadership on the drug importation \nissue. I don't think this would have been included in this \nlegislation--I know it would not--were it not for the leadership of \nSenator Jeffords. It was this amendment that was included in the bill \nwhen the bill was on the floor of the Senate.\n  As the occupant of the chair remembers, we had a very heated debate. \nIt was contentious. It was a matter of a lot of controversy surrounding \nit. I offered an amendment to the Jeffords amendment, which was adopted \nas it turned out, helping protect the safety and efficacy of drugs that \nwould be imported under the provision of the Jeffords amendment. Then \nin conference with the House, everybody got involved, not just the \nconferees but the leadership of the House and the leadership of the \nSenate. Everybody, it seemed, had an opinion or a viewpoint on how that \nlanguage should be changed or modified or improved.\n  As it turned out, the end result is something in which the Senator \nfrom Vermont can take a great deal of pride. His influence will always \nbe remembered on this issue. I thank him for his courtesies during the \nhandling of the issue and his good advice and counsel all along the \nway.\n  Mr. President, the crop disaster provisions in this bill take a \nsomewhat different approach to compensating producers who may have \nsuffered significant quality losses during 2000 caused by bad weather, \ninsects, or other natural occurrences. The bill authorizes the \nSecretary of Agriculture to compensate producers for quantity, quality, \nand severe economic losses. Loss thresholds for quantity and quality \nlosses are separated in this bill, whereas they have been combined in \nprevious disaster bills. Different crops have different values \nassociated with declines in quality. The report language accompanying \nthe conference report takes care to discuss special rules that should \nbe considered for cotton, for example.\n  The conferees were concerned that this new calculation might have \nsome unintended consequences and provided the Secretary of Agriculture \nwith additional flexibility in devising an appropriate loss \ncompensation program. Because there are crops, like cotton, that rarely \nhave quality losses that are not accompanied by quantity losses, this \nbifurcated approach could have unintended detrimental consequences. The \nSecretary could use his authority to compensate for severe economic \nlosses and calculate losses for cotton and other similar commodities in \nthe manner done in 1999, when quality and quantity losses were combined \nto determine whether a producer had met the loss thresholds.\n  The Secretary could also use the authority provided him to provide \nassistance for severe economic losses to provide appropriate \ncompensation to producers that incur the necessary expense to bring \ntheir 2000 crop all the way to harvest.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Montana is on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, when we finally vote on the Agriculture \nappropriations conference report, I intend to vote for it essentially \nbecause the bill provides so much that helps so many people, many of \nwhom are in dire straits. I am referring specifically to a lot of the \npeople living and working in farm communities in my State of Montana \nand throughout the Nation.\n  I am especially pleased the bill provides $3.6 billion for weather-\nrelated disasters. The droughts and fires in my State, as well as other \nparts of the Nation, have been quite severe and, in many areas, \ndevastating. This bill will help our citizens get through the most \ndifficult times. I commend the Senator from Mississippi and others who \nhave worked to help pass this bill.\n  I want to mention a couple of points of this bill which I think are \nerroneous. I object strenuously to the provisions in the bill with \nrespect to restrictions on food and medicine sales to Cuba and \nrestrictions on the right of American citizens to travel to Cuba.\n  Last July, I flew to Havana, along with my colleagues, Senator \nRoberts and Senator Akaka. It was a brief trip, but I returned from \nHavana more convinced than ever that it was time to end our outdated \ncold war policy toward Cuba. For example, I believe we should have \nnormal trade relations with Cuba. We do not. The President just a day \nago signed permanent normal trade relations with China, a Communist \ncountry which certainly presents more of a national security threat to \nthe United States than Cuba, but yet we do not have normal trade \nrelations with Cuba. It makes no sense.\n  As a consequence, we Americans, the Congress, and the Federal \nGovernment, prevent our farmers and ranchers from exporting their \nproducts to Cuba. But our Japanese, European, and Canadian competitors \nhave no constraints. They fill the gap. The result, obviously, is it \nhelps those countries, it helps the Cubans, but it hurts Americans. \nAlso, our policy has no impact on those Cuban policies that we would \nlike to see changed--none whatsoever.\n  Most Members in the Senate and House have also recognized the \nabsurdity of this policy. Earlier this year, the Senate and the House \nagreed to end the ban on food and medicine sales to Cuba. We had \noverwhelming majorities in the Senate and the House. Those votes \nexpressed the will of the Congress. The votes clearly reflected the \nwill of the American people.\n  Yet the Republican conferees simply overturned those House and Senate \nvotes. The Republican conferees thwarted the will of the American \npeople. The result is that there will be restrictions on the sale of \nfood and medicine to Cuba. These restrictions guarantee that there will \nbe few such sales, and those few that do occur will be done only by \nmajor companies, shutting out the small farmer. That is not the way law \nis supposed to be made in a democracy.\n  To rub salt in the wounds, the Republican conferees agreed to codify \nin law the current administrative restrictions on travel to Cuba. That \naction removed the flexibility of this President and future Presidents \nto liberalize or not to liberalize, depending upon what seems to make \nthe most sense. The result is a further infringement on the right of \nAmericans to travel freely. It also diminishes the right of \nCuban Americans to visit family members in Cuba.\n\n  An overwhelming majority of the Congress recognizes we must end the \nanachronistic cold war policy toward Cuba. That policy harms the \naverage Cuban. Clearly, it harms the average American. The current \npolicy against Castro is a foil. It helps prop him up. Were we to lift \nthe bans that would take away that foil, it would make it more \ndifficult for him to stay in power. It is amazing how foolhardy our \npolicy is. It is also a policy that hurts the American public. It is a \ngreat danger.\n  Once the resistance of the Castro regime begins--think of that for a \nminute. We have to think very carefully about how to help manage the \ntransition that occurs in Cuba from the current-Castro regime to the \npost-Castro regime. Of course, the Cubans must make that decision. The \nnature of that transition has a very direct bearing upon this country. \nWe have to be very careful.\n  Clearly, if we were to open up now, we could help influence a \ntransition that is more in America's national interest. Current policy \nalso clearly abridges the freedoms of Americans to travel. If we had to \nvote separately on these Cuban provisions, I would work hard to defeat \nthem, but the other provisions in the bill are so overwhelming \nimportant for the health and prosperity of Americans that I will vote \nin favor of the Agriculture appropriations bill. But I repeat, the Cuba \nprovisions are a serious step backward.\n\n[[Page S10522]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are now considering the Agriculture \nappropriations conference report. It is critically important to a \nnumber of our States. It certainly is critically important to mine.\n  We are faced with one of the toughest downturns in the agricultural \nmarkets in the history of our country. We currently have the lowest \nreal prices for farm commodities in 50 years, and we are in a very \nserious situation as a result. Literally, thousands of farm families \nwill be forced off the land if there is not an adequate Federal \nresponse to this crisis.\n  A number of years ago we passed a new farm bill. That farm bill is \nnot working. I think the proof is abundantly clear. The fact is, we \nhave had to write disaster bills every year for the last 3 years to try \nto deal with this collapse in farm prices.\n  The situation now is even more grave as we have dealt not only with \ncollapsed prices but also with what I call the triple whammy of bad \nprices, bad policy, and bad weather.\n  In my State, as in many others, farmers have not only had to cope \nwith very low prices but, in addition to that, weather conditions that \nhave dramatically reduced the value of the crop even from these very \nlow prices.\n  I just had a farmer stop me when I was home and tell me he was \noffered 75 cents a bushel for his grain--75 cents a bushel.\n  A lot of people wonder, what is a bushel? We talk about these things \nin farm terms. I think many people in the country have no idea what a \nbushel represents. A bushel is almost 60 pounds. Can you imagine \ngetting 75 cents for that product? That is ruinous. That is \nconfiscatory. And it will drive thousands of farm families into \nbankruptcy if there is not a response.\n  Thankfully, each of the last 3 years, there has been a Federal \nresponse. Three years ago, I am proud to say, the first amendment was \nmine, offered with Senator Dorgan, to begin to respond to this crisis \nof collapsed prices. That developed into a $6 billion assistance \npackage.\n\n  Last year, we had another package. Senator Grassley of Iowa and I \noffered the only bipartisan package of assistance, and it formed the \nbasis for what was agreed to, an $8.7 billion package. This year, for \nthe third year in a row, we have already passed, and the President has \nsigned into law, a package of $7.2 billion of assistance, again to \noffset these collapsed prices. But since that package was passed and \nsigned into law, we also have these weather disasters across the \ncountry. In my State, overly wet conditions have led to an outbreak of \na disease called scab that has dramatically lowered the value of the \ncrop. In other parts of the country, there has been devastating \ndrought, a situation where farmers have not received any rain \nthroughout the growing season. As a result, they have almost total \nlosses.\n  In this bill we will vote on next week, there is an additional $3.5 \nbillion of assistance, including provisions to address the quality loss \naffecting my State's farmers; $500 million to address the quality loss \ncircumstance in which farmers go to the elevator and in some cases the \npeople at the elevator say, we won't buy your grain at any price \nbecause it is so loaded with this fungus called scab. That is the \nnature of the crisis.\n  It is so important that next week we pass that bill. It is so \nimportant that this aid start to flow. It is so important that we say \nto farm families across America, we are not going to let you fail \nbecause of a failed farm policy written in Washington. We are not going \nto let you face a circumstance just because our major competitors, the \nEuropeans, are outspending us 10 to 1 in their support for their \nproducers, that we let our people fall by the wayside. We are not going \nto say to our producers, just because the Europeans account for 84 \npercent of all the world's agriculture export subsidy--we only account \nfor 1.4 percent--just because they are outgunning us 60 to 1 on that \nmeasure of support, we are not going to let you go under because of a \nfailed policy out of Washington.\n  These are critical times. Our major competitors, the Europeans, have \ndone everything they can to support their producers. I am not being \ncritical. I admire them. They have stood up for their people. They \nunderstand that if you just abandon them to this world market, where we \nsee catastrophic prices, what that will mean is an exodus from the \nrural parts of Europe, just as we are seeing that kind of circumstance \nin America. We are seeing thousands of farm families leave the land \nbecause the economics just don't work.\n  We obviously need this rescue package. We need this assistance. More \nthan that, we need a new farm policy, one for the longer term, one that \nrecognizes what is happening in world agriculture, one that understands \nthe Europeans are supporting their producers at a rate of $300 an acre \non average while we support our producers at a rate of $30 an acre on \naverage. It is no wonder that Europe is moving up in world market share \nand we are moving down because our friends in Europe are doing it the \nold-fashioned way--they are going out and buying markets that have \ntraditionally been ours. They have a strategy; they have a plan. Their \nplan is to dominate world agricultural trade. They are putting the \nmoney up to do it.\n  The harsh reality is that USDA now tells us for the first time in as \nlong as anyone can remember, Europe is poised to surpass us in world \nmarket share. Let me repeat that: This year USDA tells us for the first \ntime in memory Europe is poised to pass us in world market share for \nagricultural products. That ought to be a warning to all of us of what \nis happening. It is happening because the Europeans have spent tens of \nbillions of dollars a year, nearly $50 billion a year, supporting their \nproducers, paying for export subsidies so they can buy markets that \nhave traditionally been ours. Shame on us if we allow them to take us \nout of world markets that have been ours for decades. That would be a \nserious mistake.\n\n  When I ask the Europeans, how is it you are able to convince your \npeople to step up and support your producers in the way that you do, \nthey say, it is very simple: we have been hungry twice in Europe. We \nnever intend to be hungry again. We are not going to rely on outside \nfood sources to feed our people. We just are not going to do it.\n  I hope next year we will begin the debate on a new farm policy, and \nwe will recognize that unilateral disarmament does not work. It doesn't \nwork in military affairs; it doesn't work in an agricultural trade \nconfrontation. It hasn't worked with this new Federal farm policy. It \nhas been a disaster. I don't know of any better proof for that than the \nsimple fact we have had to write disaster bills the last 3 years to try \nto cope with the wreckage that is represented by this Federal farm \npolicy: the lowest prices in 50 years; thousands of farmers being \npushed off the land; an agricultural economy that is in deep trouble.\n  I hope next week, when we take a vote on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, there will be strong bipartisan support for that \npackage, and then when we convene next year we will begin the debate on \na new Federal farm policy, one that recognizes that our major \ncompetitors are on the move. They are on the march. They have a \nstrategy. They have a plan. They have an intention to dominate world \nagricultural trade, and we have an obligation to fight back, to give \nour producers, our farmers a fair fighting chance.\n  So far we have said to our farmers, you go out there and compete \nagainst the French farmer or the German farmer. And while you are at \nit, you take on the French Government and the German Government, too. \nThat is not a fair fight. Our producers can compete against any \nproducers anywhere in the world, but only if they have a level playing \nfield, only if it is a fair fight. They can't win if the deck is \nstacked against them. That is precisely what is happening now. The deck \nis stacked against our producers in a way that is devastating.\n  It reminds me of the cold war, where we built up to build down. I \nbelieve we have to follow that same principle in\n\n[[Page S10523]]\n\nthis trade confrontation with Europe. We have to add resources to force \nthem to the table to negotiate to level the playing field so our \nproducers are not at this extraordinary disadvantage where Europe \nspends $300 an acre on average to support their producers while we \nspend $30, where the Europeans account for 84 percent of all the \nworld's agricultural export subsidy while we account for only 1.4 \npercent, outgunned 60 to 1. It is pretty hard to win a fight when you \nare outgunned 60 to 1 or 10 to 1. It makes it virtually impossible for \nour very efficient producers, very hard-working people, to have any \nkind of a chance.\n  These are the harsh realities of what is occurring in world \nagriculture. I hope next week, when that bill comes before the Chamber, \nwe will stand up and vote aye. I hope when we start next year the \ndebate and discussion about a new farm bill, we will recognize the \nharsh realities of what is happening in these world agricultural \nmarkets.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my \ncolleagues to support the Agriculture appropriations conference report \nthat will be considered by this body in the next few days. I think it \nis a good bill with a number of desperately needed aid provisions for \nour Nation's farmers. The provisions included in the bill for \nprescriptions are also desirable.\n  First, though, I want to talk a little about my own family history \nand why I am so proud and honored to be the author of the legislation \nwith respect to prescription drugs and pharmacies. My family, on the \nJeffords side, came to Vermont back in 1794. At least, that is the \nfirst time they bought a piece of land. They settled in the northern \npart of Vermont up on the Canadian border. Gradually, they moved down \nto a community a little further south, about 20, 30 miles from the \nCanadian border. The family ran a drugstore in Enosberg Falls called \nJeffords Drug Store for over a hundred years.\n  I remember the summers so vividly. We always spent 2 weeks in \nEnosberg Falls, spent a week on the family farm, and then spent a week \ndown in town with Roger Pratt and Cora Pratt, my uncle and aunt who ran \nthe drugstore. I remember some wonderful times there. I could go up to \nthe soda fountain, without having to do anything, and I could get a \nsoda. Sometimes, I would be given the job of trying to swat the flies \nand keep the flies away. That was before we had insecticides. I know \nsometimes I would probably get a little annoying when I was 8 or 9 \nyears old while swatting them too close to the patrons sitting at the \nlittle tables where they got sodas. Later, I had the great thrill of \nbeing able to stand behind the pharmacy's soda fountain and make \nsundaes and all sorts of things. It was a wonderful experience.\n  But what I learned more than anything else was the importance of a \npharmacy to a small town. In those days, it was probably as much of the \nhealth care plan as you could get, along with the local doctor. The \npharmacy was your health care, unless you got really sick and you would \ngo to the hospital. But more people came in to get advice from the \npharmacist as to what they should take for this or for that. Things \nwent along very fine for many years.\n  As time went on, my uncle died. My aunt, who was not a pharmacist, \nwas working the drugstore and she had to hire a pharmacist to do that \nwork. Unfortunately, she died. When she died, the question was, Who is \ngoing to get the drugstore and the property? I took the position that I \nwould be willing to sell it to the pharmacist. I got it appraised, and \na price was set. He said, ``I'm sorry, but I'm going to go down the \nstreet and open a pharmacy and I will run you out of business.'' I \nsaid, ``Okay, go right ahead''--because I am a stubborn Vermonter--``I \nwill run you out of business.'' So I had to go around the State and \nfind a pharmacist. So we kept the competition going.\n  I finally sold the drugstore for twice what he wanted to pay, and I \nlearned important things such as if you want a generic aspirin, you can \nlook right next to the Bayer aspirin, and you will find an aspirin that \nis identical but in a different bottle, and it is cheaper. I have used \nthat knowledge all through the years to save a buck on aspirin and \nother things. Many useful lessons have come from that experience.\n  What I also understood by being near the Canadian border was what it \nmeant to that pharmacist in recent years. The drugs his pharmacy \npurchased cost twice as much as the pharmacist paid across the border \nin Canada.\n  It is more than just a casual knowledge that led me to become deeply \ninvolved in the bill which we now have as part of the appropriations \nbill.\n  I thank Senator Specter and Chairman Cochran for their very kind \nwords about me and my work in this area. I deeply appreciate that.\n  Mr. Jeffords. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my \ncolleagues to support the Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report \nthat will be considered by this body within the next few days. I think \nit is a good bill, with a number of desperately needed aid provisions \nfor our nation's farmers. But today I would like to address the \nPrescription Drug Importation provision included in the bill.\n  We are all familiar with the problem. The cost of drugs, as a \npercentage of our health care dollar, is skyrocketing to the point of \nunaffordability for average Americans. During a time when we are \nexperiencing unprecedented economic growth, it is not uncommon to hear \nof patients who cut pills in half, or skip dosages in order to make \nprescriptions last longer, because they can't afford the refill. \nPrescription medicines have revolutionized the treatment of certain \ndiseases, but they are only effective if patients have access to the \nmedicines that their doctors prescribe. The fact is, failure to take \ncertain medicine can be just as deadly as taking the wrong pill.\n  Today we are confounded by the question: Why do drugs cost so much \nmore in the U.S. than in Canada or abroad? It's a good question--one \nfor which the drug companies don't have any good answers.\n  It's true that these companies are making some miraculous \nbreakthroughs. But why must Americans have to shoulder seemingly the \nentire burden of paying for research, development and a healthy return \nto shareholders?\n  I believe it is time we put an end to this unfair burden. I don't \nthink it is fair to expect Americans, especially your senior citizens \nliving on fixed incomes, to pay the highest costs in the world for \nprescription medicines, many of which are manufactured within our \nborders.\n  That's why more than a year ago I started working with the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA), the agency responsible for overseeing the \nsafety of the drug supply in this country, to see if there were a way \nwe could safely reimport prescription medicines into our country.\n  In July, on an overwhelming vote of 74-21, the United States Senate \nagreed to an amendment I offered, based on S. 2520, cosponsored by \nSenators Wellstone, Dorgan, Snowe, Collins, and others, to do just \nthat. Importantly, for the first time, we had developed and passed a \nproposal that did not, in the eyes of FDA, present public health and \nsafety concerns. This was critical to me, because we have the gold \nstandard in the U.S. when it comes to drug safety, and I don't want to \ndo anything to undermine it.\n  Over the past few months, the drug companies have waged a furious \ncampaign against my amendment, taking out advertisements and sending \nlegions of lobbyists to Capitol Hill to argue that it would undermine \nsafety. I don't think my amendment will undermine safety, but I do \nthink it will undermine the price Americans pay for prescription drugs.\n  I was heartened by the positive movement in the Clinton \nadministration over the past few weeks, from neutrality in July to \noutright support for my amendment, provided Congress gave enough \nmoney--$23 million this year--to FDA to carry out its responsibilities. \nCongress has agreed to do so, and if my proposal works out as I hope, \nit will be a small price to pay on the\n\n[[Page S10524]]\n\npotential billions of dollars that Americans will save on prescription \ndrug costs.\n  The negotiators for the House and Senate on the agriculture \nappropriations bill have completed their work. Unfortunately, the \nprocess used in reaching this agreement was marred by partisanship. But \nthe product is as strong as the one endorsed by the Clinton \nadministration, and even stronger in some respects.\n  The proposal before Congress, while slightly different from my plan, \nis a strong and workable proposal. Critics have argued that the \nproposal has been weakened because it allows drug companies to \nfrustrate the intent through manipulations of sales contracts. The fact \nis, this bill is stronger than either the House-passed or Senate-passed \nversions because it includes a clear prohibition of such agreements--\nsomething that was missing in the House and Senate bills.\n  Critics have claimed that the latest version of the bill contains a \nloophole regarding the labeling requirements. The fact is, the bill \nrequires manufacturers to provide all necessary labeling information, \nand gives the FDA very broad power to write any other rules necessary \nto accomplish the intent of the provision. How much stronger can we get \nthan that.\n  Critics have claimed that the bill unfairly restricts the countries \nfrom which these products may come. The fact is that the bill lists 23 \ncountries to start the process, and lets the FDA expand the list at any \ntime.\n  Critics have complained that this bill will expire after about 7 \nyears.\n  The fact is that this is a vast improvement over the House-passed \nversion which would have expired after only one year. As we all know, \nmajor legislation is frequently required to be reauthorized on 5 year \ncycles in order to force Congress to make improvements, and popular \nlaws always survive this process.\n  This bill, like any other, is not perfect. But critics are wrong to \nsuggest that it is weaker than the original Jeffords amendment. I ought \nto know. And so should John Rector, senior vice president for the \nNational Community Pharmacists Association who has been a leader in the \neffort to reimport lower cost drugs and whose members would be \nresponsible for making this proposal work.\n  Mr. Rector recently took the position that the bill, ``will result in \nthe importation of far less expensive drugs.''\n  Might the drug companies try to evade the spirit of this legislation? \nsome probably will. Have we anticipated every action they might take? \nOf course not.\n  But I am confident that our proposal will work, and that the process \nhas improved it. That is why the pharmaceutical industry is fighting \nthis tooth and nail--they know it will work. They would like nothing \nmore than to see us defeat this bill. That should tell you something \nabout what they think the effect will be of this provision.\n  Mr. President, I must say--I am disappointed with how partisan this \nissue has become, and I am disappointed that the White House has moved \nthe goal posts on this issue. In fact, I'd like to quote from the \nletter that President Clinton sent to Speaker Hastert and Majority \nLeader Lott less than 3 weeks ago. In that letter, he said ``I support \nthe Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 which the Senate \npassed'' and ``I urge you to send me the Senate legislation--with full \nfunding.'' Mr. President, that is exactly what we are doing, except \nthat the bill we are sending the President is even stronger than the \noriginal language.\n  But I am glad that the President has said he will sign the bill. I \nthink this is because he knows that, at the end of the day, this \nprovision will work, despite all of the political rhetoric.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this provision and support this \nAgriculture appropriations conference report.\n  I also would like to discuss the chart that is behind me that very \nsuccinctly asks and answers questions about the differences between the \nHouse amendment, the Senate amendment, and the conference agreement.\n  I think you will find by just looking at the complete list on the \nconference agreement, the important improvements that were made as it \nwondered through the normal legislative process which we all have to \nfollow.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the White House of September 25 \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Santa Fe, September 25, 2000.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Leader:) In your letter, you \n     outlined a number of health care issues that you indicated \n     could be resolved before Congress adjourns. I want to be \n     equally clear about my priorities and hopes for progress this \n     fall. As the days dwindle in this session of Congress, I am \n     seriously concerned about the lack of movement on some of our \n     most important issues. I am, however, encouraged to learn \n     from your letter that the Republican leadership is now \n     committed to providing Americans with access to prescription \n     drugs available at lower cost from other countries.\n       As you know, our people are growing more and more concerned \n     that the pharmaceutical industry often sells the same drugs \n     for a much higher price in the United States than it does in \n     other countries, even when those drugs are manufactured here \n     at home. This forces some of our most vulnerable citizens, \n     including seniors and people with disabilities, to pay the \n     highest prices for prescription drugs in the world. This is \n     simply unacceptable.\n       That is why I support the ``Medicine Equity and Drug Safety \n     Act of 2000,'' which the Senate passed by an overwhelming \n     vote of 74 to 21. This important legislation would give \n     Americans access to quality medications at the lower prices \n     paid by citizens in other nations. The Senate bill, sponsored \n     by Senators jeffords, Wellstone, Dorgan and others, would \n     allow wholesalers and pharmacists to import FDA-approved \n     prescription drugs and would establish a new safety system \n     intended to track these imports and test them for \n     authenticity and degradation. Before this provision could \n     take effect, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would \n     be required to certify that the regulations would, first, \n     pose no risk to the public health; and, second, significantly \n     decrease prices paid by consumers. With these protections in \n     place and the $23 million necessary to implement them, this \n     legislation would meet the test that we both believe is \n     crucial--preserving the safety of America's drug supply.\n       Although your letter implies support for legislation \n     similar to the Senate-passed bill, I am concerned by its \n     statement that seniors would ``buy lower-priced drugs in \n     countries like Canada'' [emphasis added]. Of course, few \n     seniors live near the Canadian or Mexican borders and even \n     fewer can afford to cross the border in search of lower-price \n     drugs. Moreover, policies like the House's Coburn amendment \n     would strip the FDA of all of its ability to monitor safety \n     and prevent seniors from buying counterfeit drugs, putting \n     their health in danger and their finances at risk.\n       I urge you to send me the Senate legislation--with full \n     funding--to let wholesalers and pharmacists bring affordable \n     prescription drugs to the neighborhoods where our seniors \n     live. Though this initiative does not address seniors' most \n     important need--meaningful insurance to cover the costs of \n     expensive medications--it still has real potential to allow \n     consumers to access prescription drug discounts.\n       I remain concerned that with less than one week left in \n     this fiscal year, Congress has not passed eleven of thirteen \n     appropriations bills; Congress has not raised the minimum \n     wage; and Congress has not passed a strong, enforceable \n     patients' bill of rights. And, according to your letter, the \n     congressional leadership has given up on passing a \n     meaningful, affordable and optional Medicare prescription-\n     drug benefit.\n       I am extremely disappointed by your determination that it \n     is impossible to pass a voluntary Medicare prescription-drug \n     benefit this year. I simply disagree. There is indeed time to \n     act, and I urge you to use the final weeks of this Congress \n     to get this important work done. It is the only way we can \n     ensure rapid, substantial and much-needed relief from \n     prescription drug costs for all seniors and people with \n     disabilities, including low-income beneficiaries.\n       On the issue of the Medicare lock-box, I have endorsed the \n     Vice President's initiative, which has been effectively \n     embodied in Senator Conrad's amendment that passed on the \n     Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill. I am \n     therefore encouraged by your commitment to passing this \n     legislation; but we must still make all efforts to ensure \n     that the Medicare payroll taxes in the lockbox are used \n     solely for Medicare.\n       Similarly, I am pleased to learn of your commitment to pass \n     a greatly-needed package of Medicare and Medicaid health care \n     provider payment and beneficiary refinements. As you know, I \n     proposed such refinements in my budget and in my June Mid-\n     Session Review. This includes payment increases for \n     hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes and other \n     providers as well as access to Medicaid for legal immigrants, \n     certain uninsured women with breast cancer, and children with \n     disabilities; extended Medicare coverage for people with \n     disabilities; an extension of the Balanced Budget Act's \n     diabetes provisions; and full funding for the Ricky Ray Trust \n     Fund.\n       Again, I am pleased to learn of your commitment to \n     providing Americans with access to high-quality, lower cost \n     prescription drugs from other nations. There is no reason\n\n[[Page S10525]]\n\n     why we cannot work together to pass and enact such \n     legislation immediately. As we do, we should not give up on \n     passing both a workable, affordable and voluntary Medicare \n     prescription-drug benefit for our nation's seniors and a \n     meaningful patients' bill of rights for all Americans. I will \n     do everything in my power to achieve that end, and I look \n     forward to meeting with you on these issues as soon as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as expected, Chairman Cochran and Senator \nKohl have once again crafted an excellent Agriculture Appropriations \nbill that benefits not only the State of Washington, but natural \nresource dependent communities and rural economies all across the \nnation.\n  For my own State of Washington, this equates to more than $5 million \nin essential research programs for wheat, apples, asparagus, animal \ndiseases, small fruits, barley and potatoes to name a few. I have long \nadvocated for increased emphasis on agriculture research, noting that \nprojects such as these advance the development of new technology, \ngenerate healthy food systems, promote environmentally sound growing \npractices, and maintain the U.S. dominance in agriculture production.\n  Also included in the legislation are the indispensable relief funds \nnecessary to ensure the longevity of the once highly profitable and \nprosperous tree fruit industry in Washington. The $138 million in \ndirect payments to apple producers will provide necessary short-term \nrelief favored by Washington's orchardists.\n  The cranberry industry, lesser known to most but still one of the \nhardest hit in the agriculture economy, will also benefit from $50 \nmillion in relief.\n  In response to the other natural disasters that have plagued our \nnation, $3.4 billion in emergency spending is included for farmers and \nrural areas that have already experienced continued low farm commodity \nprices.\n  While the core issues in the bill are of great significance, there \nare two other issues in the conference report I wish to highlight. Both \nthe sanctions relief and drug re-importation provisions deserve the \nSenate's support.\n  With respect to sanctions relief, I believe few members of Congress \nwould argue that food and medicine sanctions fail to cripple regimes or \nhandicap the ability of dictators to simply find these goods elsewhere. \nWhat sanctions on food and medicine do promote are uncompensated losses \nto America's farmers and poor health in sanctioned countries.\n  For more than a year-and-a-half, many members of this body have \nfought to right this situation and remove these onerous barriers. \nObviously our efforts to provide a comprehensive package of sanctions \nreform has been met with determined resistance.\n  With that said, however, the compromise my friend and colleague from \nWashington, Mr. Nethercutt, brokered to the best of his ability, \nwithout ever losing sight of the common goal of sanctions relief, and \nto the severe chagrin of several influential members, was agreed to by \nthe Agriculture Appropriations conference committee, of which I was a \nmember.\n  While some will argue that this compromise is not comprehensive \nenough and does not perfectly mirror the language of the original \nSenate bill, this language is unquestionably significant. What the \nlanguage does include is sanctions relief for exports to Cuba, Iran, \nSudan, North Korea, and Libya. If my colleagues believe this major \nshift in policy does not make a positive statement regarding Congress' \nintent to provide sanctions reform, I think they are sadly mistaken.\n  Perhaps even more pivotal, this language prohibits the Administration \nfrom imposing any new unilateral food or medicine sanctions without the \nconsent of Congress. What with the Administration considering wheat \nsanctions on Japan for that country's whaling practices, I hope this \nchange in policy will be supported by agriculture advocates. This is \nanother significant goal the sanctions coalition has sought to attain.\n  I choose not to argue with my colleagues over the merits of the Cuba \ntravel or financing restrictions contained in the bill, but instead \nchoose to remind my colleagues that we have accomplished something \ngreat here.\n  While this compromise does not reflect everything we intended when we \nsought to achieve our goals, it does contain the core principles \nnecessary in order to ensure unilateral sanctions reform. And I remind \nmy colleagues that it is a compromise.\n  It's not perfect. It's a starting point, a means by which we test the \nsystem. If the changes we have incorporated into this bill aren't \nworkable, then we will work to change them.\n  No one in this body believes agriculture trade will resurrect with \neach of these countries overnight. Will Iran announce a wheat tender in \nthe next few months? Few years? We cannot tell. Sanctions reform will \ntake work, and it will take time. But we must begin somewhere and we \nmust begin now rather than later.\n  I fear some of my colleagues have lost sight of the ultimate goal, \nand I hope they and the Administration would not seek to undermine the \nlanguage our agriculture community supports and desires.\n  As a representative for a Northern border state, I have been privy to \nissues surrounding drug prices. Everyday Americans pay 50 percent, 60 \npercent, 70 percent or more for prescription drugs than our neighbors \nin Canada, in Mexico and for that matter most of the rest of the world. \nWho does\n\n[[Page S10526]]\n\nthis affect most? Those who take the most prescription drugs--typically \nseniors, and those without any kind of prescription drug coverage from \ntheir insurance. But all Americans pay more whether through higher \nprices at the drugstore counter or higher insurance premiums.\n  Why does this problem exist? American pharmaceutical companies sell \nthe exact same prescription drugs overseas, drugs developed and \nmanufactured here in the U.S., for a fraction of the price they demand \nfrom American citizens. Other countries have implemented price control \npolicies that successfully tempt manufacturers to discriminate against \nAmerican consumers with higher drug prices. Our drug companies agree \nbecause the costs of manufacturing are nominal, and they can make some \nprofit overseas by simply charging Americans all of the high costs of \nresearch and development.\n  This bill takes a first step towards solving this problem. It allows \nwholesalers and pharmacists to go to Canada and other countries where \nprescription drugs are sold at deep discounts and bring the same FDA-\napproved, FDA-manufactured products back to the U.S. in order to pass \nthe discounts on to American consumers.\n  It is important to note that safety is a priority in this bill. Only \nproducts that have been determined to be safe and effective can be \nbrought into the United Sates. The importer is required to test for \nauthenticity and degradation. And importers can only bring in these \nproducts from countries that the Secretary of HHS has determined have \nan appropriate regulatory infrastructure to ensure the safety of \nprescription drugs.\n  This provision should give our American families access to lower cost \nprescription drugs that are safe and effective.\n  Is it perfect? Probably not. But, I hope it will work and I hope it \nresults in lower prices for consumers in the U.S. and eventually puts \npressure on drug companies to end price discrimination in the U.S. \nCritics say the bill has loopholes and drug companies will find a way \naround it. Let me be clear--if they do I will be back to make sure this \nprovision is even stronger. I hope that is not necessary, that drug \ncompanies will simply end the current discrimination against Americans \nby charging fair prices here in the United States.\n  This is not my favorite idea for dealing with price discrimination. \nIt is a much more complicated solution than I would prefer.\n  My idea is straightforward and based on a law that has applied to \nevery product sale in the U.S. since 1935--the Robinson-Patman Act. \nThis law simply says that manufacturers can't use price to discriminate \namong buyers. If that principle is applied to prescription drug sales \noverseas--drug companies would no longer be allowed to discriminate \nagainst their best customers--American families.\n  But this bill is something that can be done this year to lower prices \nfor American consumers. I believe it represents a genuine step forward \nto lower prescription drug costs for all Americans.\n  With all that said, the bill before the Senate not only represents a \nresponse to the core needs of agriculture, but signifies a profound \nshift in sanctions reform, and puts the drug companies on notice. While \nI have indicated that neither proposal represents perfection, what each \ndoes signify is the goal of Congress to address issues vital to those \nwe represent. I sincerely hope my colleagues will work to pass this \nbill without hesitation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we do have a number of items that have been \ncleared for consideration, including in this package a series of energy \nbills that Senator Daschle and I talked about yesterday on the floor. \nThere are a number of Senators who have been involved in this effort. I \nthank them all. This is important legislation.\n  We do have a number of other unanimous consent requests we will need \nto go through. It will take a few minutes. There are a lot of very \nimportant issues here. Most of them have been cleared on both sides. \nThere may be a couple here that there will be objections to, but there \nis a necessity to make that request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10526-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 4292\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has \npassed S. 623, the Dakota Water Resources Act. My colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Kent Conrad, and I have worked on this legislation for \nquite some time. We have worked closely with others who have an \ninterest in this bill and passage of S. 623 today is a result of \ntireless negotiation between our delegation and the downstream states, \nespecially Missouri and Minnesota. The compromise that the Senate \nadopted today strikes an important balance between meeting the water \nneeds of North Dakota and protecting the needs of other states.\n  This bill is essential to meeting the water needs of North Dakota. \nThe bill, as amended, will provide authorization for the development of \nmunicipal, rural, and industrial water projects across the State of \nNorth Dakota. The bill would also help to meet the water needs of the \nfour Indian Reservations in the state.\n  The Dakota Water Resources Act authorizes $631.5 million. This \nincludes a $200 million authorization for municipal, rural and \nindustrial water development and another $200 million authorization to \nmeet the critical water needs of the four Indian reservations in the \nstate. The Red River Valley water supply needs will also receive a $200 \nmillions authorization. The bill includes $25 million for a natural \nresources trust and $6.5 million for recreation projects in North \nDakota. Mr. President, the Dakota Water Resources Act represents a \nresponsible way for the federal government to fulfill their role in the \nstate. It also represents a serious compromise on the part of North \nDakota, while still meeting our highest priority water supply needs.\n  The bill clearly lays out the process for meeting the water needs for \nthe Red River Valley in eastern North Dakota. First, the Secretary of \nthe Interior will identify these water needs and evaluate options for \nmeeting them. The Department must submit a report on the needs and \nsuggest possible solutions to the Congress. The Secretary is also \nrequired to complete an environmental impact statement, EIS, on the Red \nRiver Valley project and select the best option.\n  In the event that the Secretary of the Interior determines that the \nbest option includes a transfer of Missouri River water to meet the Red \nRiver Valley needs, then a further act of Congress authorizing that \noption must occur before construction of that feature or features could \nbegin. This is a key provision that will allow all of our colleagues \ndownstream to have input on such a proposal. However, if an in-basin \nsource of water is chosen, then no further action is needed from \nCongress.\n  This is a good bill that reflects hard work and compromise of many \nstakeholders all along the Missouri River. I am pleased that we were \nable to develop a win-win solution, that allows us to move forward in \nmeeting the needs of North Dakotans while protecting the interests of \nthose who are\n\n[[Page S10535]]\n\ndownstream. I am confident that this bill can be signed into law this \nyear, and look forward to working with our friends in the other body to \npass this bill and send it to the President for his signature.\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about S. 623, \nthe Dakota Water Resources Act of 2000, as amended by this critical \namendment currently pending before the Senate.\n  Over the last two years, I have worked to preserve and protect \nMinnesota's precious water rights and resources, in consultation with a \nnumber of my Republican and Democratic colleagues, and to ensure that \nthe concerns expressed about the original bill by those in my state \nwere taken into account as this legislation was developed. While it \ndoes not resolve the roughest underlying issues--indeed it does not \neven attempt to resolve them--I believe this amendment takes into \naccount those concerns, and I appreciate the willingness of my \ndistinguished colleagues from North Dakota to accommodate their \nneighbors to the east.\n  It is clear this legislation, as amended by Senators Bond, Conrad, \nand Dorgan, is a very different bill than the one which was originally \nintroduced. While I, along with the State of Minnesota, had serious \nreservations about the original version, in the past year my office has \nconducted extensive consultations and discussions with Minnesota \nDepartment of Natural Resources water officials, who have indicated \nthat the amended version of this legislation--at least the sections \nwhich apply to Minnesota interests--is a reasonable measure which meets \ntheir concerns. I agree that the key elements of this legislation, in \nwhich I have been most interested, will now simply provide for a \ncomprehensive and unbiased review of the water quality and quantity \nneeds of the Red River Valley, and of the environmental implications of \nany proposed water transfers--either within the basin or on an inter-\nbasin basis--and thus I have not objected, as I did to earlier \nrequests, to bringing it to the Senate floor for consideration. There \nare other parts of the bill, as amended, which primarily affect \nexisting or planned facilities in North Dakota, which have not raised \nconcerns in my state.\n  The amended bill does not pose the same concerns about biota \ntransfer, inter-basin transfer, and water quality that I, and the State \nof Minnesota, had raised in forceful objection to the original \nlegislation. In fact, it explicitly requires prior Congressional action \nand approval before any inter-basin transfer can be made. Under the \nbill, only after careful, reasoned study by the Secretary of the \nInterior--including extensive consultation with all of the interested \nstakeholders on the water quality and quantity needs of the Red River \nValley, the various portions for meeting those needs, and the \nenvironmental implications of any further steps to address them--would \nCongress even consider an inter-basin transfer of water, which I and \nothers would continue to oppose. Let me restate that, because it's \nimportant: this legislation would preclude any transfer of water from \nthe Missouri River or its tributaries to the Red River Valley, unless \nspecifically authorized by a future Act of Congress, thus allowing \nconcerns of biota transfer, inter-basin transfers and water quality to \nbe discussed and fairly resolved by all the parties involved \nbeforehand.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have long opposed the original \nversion of this legislation. I would continue to oppose any attempts to \ntransfer water into the basin without adequate safeguards--if such \nsafeguards can be devised, which is not at all clear. Many of my \noriginal concerns, and those of the state of Minnesota, including \nespecially the Department of Natural Resources, remain about the \ndetrimental environmental effects and potential adverse precedents of \nan inter-basin transfer. Even so, I recognize the real needs of our \nneighbors in North Dakota to resolve their continuing water problems, \nand I believe that the study provided for in this bill may help to \nfurther that effort. I believe this legislation represents a reasonable \neffort to move the process forward, while protecting the rights and \nresources of those in my state and elsewhere in the Upper Midwest. I \ncommend my colleagues for their hard work and determination over these \nmany years.\n  The bill (S. 623), as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I further ask \nconsent the Senate proceed en bloc to their consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bills by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2984) to direct the Secretary of the Interior, \n     through the Bureau of Reclamation, to convey to the Loup \n     Basin Reclamation District, the Sargent River Irrigation \n     District, and the Farwell Irrigation District, Nebraska, \n     property comprising the assets of the Middle Loup Division of \n     the Missouri River Basin Project, Nebraska;\n       A bill (H.R. 3986) to provide for a study of the \n     engineering feasibility of a water exchange in lieu of \n     electrification of the Chandler Pumping Plant at Prosser \n     Diversion Dam, Washington.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, the Senate will pass H.R. 3986, a \nbill introduced by Representative Doc Hastings, R-Washington, that will \nauthorize the Bureau of Reclamation to study the feasibility of moving \nthe intake system for the Kennewick Irrigation District from the Yakima \nRiver to the Columbia River. I introduced a similar bill earlier this \nyear, S. 2163, which was passed by the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee earlier this month. The Senate's action today sends \nthis bill, critical to Central Washington's efforts to recover \nthreatened and endangered salmon, to the President's desk--an \nachievement long sought by the Yakama Indian Nation and the irrigators \nof the Yakima River Basin.\n  Disputes over how to allocate and use water have always been \ncontentious in the Pacific Northwest, and the disputes have only become \nmore difficult as the region has been forced to deal with the recovery \nof threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead species. Over the \npast year, however, I have been pleased to support a new era of \ncooperation among tribes and various irrigation districts in Eastern \nWashington. An area of consensus has developed around the concept of \n``pump exchanges,'' which move the intake systems of irrigation \ndistricts from over appropriated streams and rivers to rivers \ndownstream with more water. In July, I introduced legislation that \nauthorizes the study of a pump exchange for the Okanogan Irrigation \nDistrict and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. I \nhope this legislation will receive quick approval during the 107th \nCongress.\n  H.R. 3986 will amend the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement \nProgram, YRBWEP, first approved by Congress in 1994 (P.L. 103-434). \nThat legislation established a comprehensive framework for increasing \ncritical flows in the Yakima River in order to reverse a longstanding \ntrend of declining salmon and steelhead runs. One portion of that \nlegislation, Section 1208, authorized a specific project to electrify \nhydraulic turbines at the Chandler Pumping Plant near Prosser, \nWashington. By converting these pumps from hydraulic to electrical \npower, an additional 400 second feet of water would be added to a 12-\nmile stretch of the Yakima River below Prosser Dam called Chandler \nReach. This project would increase survival rates and provide important \nnew habitat for both the anadramous and resident fisheries in this \ncritical section of the Yakima River. This electrification project is \nstill a good approach to augmenting Yakima River flows, but early in \nits implementation an even better idea was developed that can nearly \ndouble the benefits projected from electrification.\n  The pump exchange approach proposed in H.R. 3986 could result in \ncompletely eliminating the need to divert water at Prosser Dam and \nWanawish Dam for use by the Kennewick Irrigation District, K.I.D., and \nthe Columbia River Irrigation District, C.I.D. This plan will require \nbuilding a new pumping plant on the Columbia River and a pipeline to \nconnect this new facility to K.I.D. This approach could add back to the \nYakima River during critical flow periods the entire 749 second feet of \nwater now diverted at Prosser Dam. This project might well be the key \nto the success of the rest of the YRBWEP program. For the extensive \nefforts being made farther upstream to be entirely successful, the \nlower sections of the Yakima River must provide the conditions \nnecessary for salmon and steelhead to survive their journey to and from \nthe upper river and its tributaries. The Chandler Reach and the lower \nYakima must have sufficient water at the right time for anadromous fish \nto be able to transit this area. Without it, the programs upstream will \nbe less effective.\n  The legislation passed today authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to \nspend some of the funds previously authorized for the electrification \nproject to develop this new approach. There are several studies and \nundertakings necessary to determine with certainty the efficacy and \ncost of this pump exchange project. These include carrying out a \nfeasibility study, including an estimate of project benefits, an \nenvironmental impact analysis, and preparing a feasibility level design \nand cost estimates as well as securing critical right-of-way areas.\n  This change in approach to enhancing flows in the lower Yakima is \nenthusiastically supported by the resource agencies of the State of \nWashington, including the Washington State Department of Ecology, as \nwell as by the Northwest Power Planning Council, the Bonneville Power \nAdministration, National Marine Fisheries Service, and the United \nStates Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  It is important to note that a change in the diversion for K.I.D. \nfrom the Yakima River to the Columbia River will completely change the \ncurrent operational philosophy of the district. It will evolve from a \nrelatively simple system relying on gravity to supply its customers to \none of significant additional complexity involving a major pump station \nand pressure pipeline to the main feeder canals. This remodeling of \nK.I.D. will have significant impact on the existing system and its \nusers during construction, startup, and transition. That is why it is \nessential for K.I.D. to be in a position to develop these facilities in \na way that best fits their current and future operational goals and \ncauses the least impact to the district water users. This legislation \nrequires the Bureau of Reclamation to give K.I.D. substantial control \nover the planning and design work in this study with the Bureau, of \ncourse, having final approval. It is an approach that will continue \nlocal improvement and support, which is vital to the success of this \nproject and other projects.\n  I thank Representative Doc Hastings for his leadership on this bill \nin the House of Representatives and appreciate the support of my \ncolleagues in passing this bill that will provide a crucial component \nto the salmon recovery efforts in the Yakima Basin.\n  Mr. LOTT.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rails to Resources Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) rail transportation is an essential component of the \n     North American intermodal transportation system;\n       (2) the development of economically strong and socially \n     stable communities in the western United States and Canada \n     was encouraged significantly by government policies promoting \n     the development of integrated transcontinental, interstate \n     and interprovincial rail systems in the states, territories \n     and provinces of the two countries;\n       (3) United States and Canadian federal support for the \n     completion of new elements of the transcontinental, \n     interstate and interprovincial rail systems was halted before \n     rail connections were established to the state of Alaska and \n     the Yukon Territory;\n       (4) both public and private lands in Alaska, the Yukon \n     Territory and northern British Columbia, including lands held \n     by aboriginal peoples, contain extensive deposits of oil, \n     gas, coal and other minerals as well as valuable forest \n     products which presently are inaccessible, but which could \n     provide significant economic benefit to local communities and \n     to both nations if an economically efficient transportation \n     system was available;\n       (5) rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas \n     facilitates controlled access and reduced overall impact to \n     environmentally sensitive areas;\n       (6) the extension of the continental rail system through \n     northern British Columbia and the Yukon Territory to the \n     current terminus of the Alaska Railroad would significantly \n     benefit the U.S. and Canadian visitor industries by \n     facilitating the comfortable movement of passengers over long \n     distances while minimizing effects on the surrounding areas; \n     and\n       (7) ongoing research and development efforts in the rail \n     industry continue to increase the efficiency of rail \n     transportation, ensure safety, and decrease the impact of \n     rail service on the environment.\n\n     SEC. 3. AGREEMENT FOR A UNITED STATES-CANADA BILATERAL \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       The President is authorized and urged to enter into an \n     agreement with the Government of Canada to establish a joint \n     commission to study the feasibility and advisability of \n     linking the rail system in Alaska to the nearest appropriate \n     point on the North American continental rail system.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 4681.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4681) to provide for the adjustment of status \n     of certain Syrian nationals.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the passage of a \nbill that will grant permanent residency status to a small group of \nSyrian Jews who fled the brutal dictatorship of Hafez Assad almost a \ndecade ago.\n  In 1992, through negotiations between our State Department and the \nSyrian regime, President Assad allowed the last remnants of Syria's \nJewish community to leave Syria. For years, this community faced \nreligious persecution, restrictions on the right to travel and \nemigrate, and other forms of harassment. When Assad finally agreed to \nlet them go, he insisted that they come to this country as tourists, \nrather than as refugees fleeing religious tyranny, in order to avoid \nthe appearance that his repression had driven out a considerable number \nof his own citizens. We permitted this fiction in order to rescue \npeople desperate for freedom, but obviously, the 2000 Syrian Jews who \ncame here in 1992 were never tourists--they were seeking a permanent \nhome and a life free of religious and political oppression.\n  Once safely in the United States, the Syrian Jews had no choice but \nto request asylum, and asylum was granted. But because of the long \ndelays that asylees face in obtaining permanent resident status, the \nSyrian Jews still have not become permanent residents and gotten green \ncards. If they had come to the United States as the refugees they truly \nwere, instead of as tourists, they would have become permanent \nresidents years ago because there is no annual cap on the number of \nrefugees permitted to move to permanent residency.\n  The Syrian Jews have suffered for years because of this situation, \nimposed on them by the terms of the secret 1992 deal with Assad. \nWithout green cards, those among them who are doctors and dentists, as \nmany are, are unable to practice their professions under the New York \nState licensing system. As asylees, the Syrian Jews face restrictions \non their right to travel abroad. Finally and most important, the Syrian \nJews have been stalled for years in the efforts to become full citizens \nof our country, something all of them ardently want.\n  This legislation corrects this anomaly and directs the Attorney \nGeneral to grant permanent resident status to the Syrian Jews who came \nhere in 1992. This will give this small group of people the immigration \nstatus they should have had years ago, but for the fiction that they \nwere coming to the United States as tourists. It will permit them to \nbegin practicing their chosen professions and moving toward full \ncitizenship. It will finally effectuate the agreement by which they \nemigrated from Syria in the first place. Most of all, it will guarantee \nthe full blessings of liberty to people who want nothing more than to \nlive in peace in a land where the government doesn't mistreat you \nsimply because of your religion.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10545]]\n\n  The bill (H.R. 4681) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10545-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              STEWART B. McKINNEY HOMELESS ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 5417, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5417) to rename the Stewart B. McKinney \n     Homeless Assistance Act as the ``McKinney-Vento Homeless \n     Assistance Act.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to pass \nlegislation that has been sent to us by the House of Representatives \nthat would change the name of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless \nAssistance Act to the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. This is \none, small step we can take to honor a colleague who devoted his life \nto public service, particularly service on behalf of the most \ndisadvantaged Americans.\n  Bruce F. Vento has been one of the most effective advocates on behalf \nof homeless people throughout his career. Mr. Vento was one of the \nfirst Members of Congress to bring the plight of the nation's homeless \nto the public's attention. In 1982, Bruce introduced legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives to create the Emergency Shelter Grant Program. \nHe attached an amendment to a housing bill to provide matching grants \nto repair vacant buildings to be used as temporary shelters. This \nbecame the first national legislation to provide federal assistance for \nemergency homeless shelters.\n  Throughout the 1980s, Mr. Vento worked repeatedly, with his \ncolleagues on the House Banking Committee, to raise the profile of this \nissue and to build the coalitions necessary to enact comprehensive \nlegislation to help the homeless across this nation. In early 1987, \nRepresentative Vento worked to pass an aid package that included $100 \nmillion for a program of emergency shelter grants to help charitable \norganizations and state and local governments renovate buildings for \nthe homeless and succeeded in enacting the legislation into law.\n  In that same year, Congressman Vento was an original author of a \nlarger, more comprehensive measure that became known as the Stewart B. \nMcKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the first and only coordinated \nfederal initiative directed toward the problem of homelessness and the \nonly social program that was passed during the Reagan era. The McKinney \nAct seeks to meet some of the immediate needs of the homeless: shelter, \nfood, health care, education, job training services, and transitional \nhousing through programs at HUD, FEMA, HHS, and the Education and Labor \nDepartments. This legislation continues to be at the heart of the \nfederal government's response to the ongoing problem of homelessness in \nAmerica.\n  It is indeed fitting to honor Bruce Vento by joining his name with \nthat of his friend and colleague, Stewart B. McKinney, on this \nlegislation. In 1987, after Representative McKinney's passing, Bruce \ntook a leading role in seeking to name the programs that would serve \npersons who are homeless as the McKinney Act because of Stewart \nMcKinney's ``close association and concern and compassion that he \nespoused and reflected throughout his service'' in Congress. We all \nrecognize how well these very same words, which Mr. Vento used to \ndescribe Stewart McKinney, embody the work and career of Bruce F. Vento \nhimself.\n\n  Shortly after taking office, President Clinton asked then-speaker of \nthe House Tom Foley to organize a Task Force to look into the problem \nof homelessness. In February of that year, Mr. Vento was appointed as \nthe Chairman of that Task Force, which issued a comprehensive, \nnationally recognized report to the Speaker one year later.\n  During the past few years, Mr. Vento continued to work hard on the \nMcKinney Act. He added language that improved prevention planning and \nactivities so that people do not become homeless due to lack of \nforesight or planning. The Vento prevention language added discharge \nplanning requirements for persons who are discharged from publicly \nfunded institutions, that is, mental health facilities, youth \nfacilities and correctional facilities, so that people are not merely \ndischarged to the streets.\n  Mr. Vento also introduced the ``Stand Down Authorization Act.'' \nCreated by several Vietnam veterans, Stand Downs are designed to give \nhomeless veterans a brief respite from life on the streets. The Stand \nDown bill would, in conjunction with the grassroots community, expand \nthe VA's role in providing outreach assistance to homeless veterans. In \nthis Congress, H.R. 566 gained the strong support of over 100 \nbipartisan cosponsors, the VA, the American Legion, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars (VFW) and the Disabled American Vets (DAV).\n  Bruce Vento worked throughout his entire career to improve and save \nthe lives of homeless men, women and children around this nation. In \nthe tradition of Minnesota's great leader, Hubert H. Humphrey, Bruce \nhas always believed that we are elected to formulate and enact policies \nwhich improve the quality of life of our citizens. I have had the \npleasure of working with him these many years to do just that. That is \nwhy I urge you to join me in enacting into law this legislation to \nrename our nation's fundamental homeless statute the McKinney-Vento \nAct. This act will duly honor a colleague who has worked long and hard \nfor the most vulnerable Americans, people who are without a home to \ncall their own.\n  Mr. President, while this legislation deals with homelessness, I want \nto make it clear that Mr. Vento's interests and accomplishments go far \nbeyond this important area. He was one of the strongest proponents of \nFHA in the Congress. He understood how FHA has been a crucial tool in \nhelping millions of families attain the dream of homeownership in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. Vento played an active role in helping craft the bipartisan \npublic housing reform legislation that passed in 1998. He was a leader \nin the effort to preserve affordable housing that has been threatened \nby expiring use restrictions or rental assistance contracts. Important \nprogress as made on this front last year. He was a strong supporter of \nthe effort to increase and strengthen community-based non-profits in \ntheir efforts to develop affordable housing and revitalize our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Vento has been a longstanding supporter of the Community \nReinvestment Act, CRA, because he understood how access to capital for \nhomeownership and small businesses is the key to ensuring equal \nopportunity for all Americans, regardless of the neighborhoods they \nlive in or their economic status. I was privileged to work closely with \nhim to preserve CRA during the debate on financial services \nmodernization legislation.\n  Finally, Mr. Vento was a strong supporter of consumer protection \nlaws, from the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act, to the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act.\n  Renaming the McKinney Act is one small way that all of us can honor \nMr. Vento's memory. Mr. President, Bruce Vento will be sorely missed in \nthe Congress of the United States. I want to join President Clinton, my \ncolleagues, and many others in expressing my deepest sympathies to Mr. \nVento's family and friends.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3235, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3235) to improve academic and social outcomes \n     for youth and reduce both\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\n     juvenile crime and the risk that youth will become victims of \n     crime by providing productive activities conducted by law \n     enforcement personnel during non-school hours.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate \ntoday, by unanimous consent, passed H.R. 3235, the National Police \nAthletic League Youth Enrichment Act of 2000, a bill that will \nauthorize the Department of Justice to provide grant money to police \nafter-school programs to reduce crime and drug use. This bill is \ncompanion legislation to S. 1874, a bill introduced by Senator Graham, \nSenator Bingaman, and myself. The Senate bill has a total of 22 \ncosponsors.\n  I want to thank my colleagues in this body, particularly my friend \nSenator Hatch, for their support of this legislation. I also want to \nthank Representative Tom Barrett for his work on the bill, and \nRepresentatives Canady and Scott for helping shepherd the legislation \nthrough the House.\n  I also want to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the Police \nAthletic League in spreading the word about the bill. In particular, \nRon Exley of the California Police Activities League labored tirelessly \nto build support for the legislation.\n  H.R. 3235 would create a program directing the Department of \nJustice's Office of Justice Programs to award grants to the Police \nAthletic League, PAL, to establish new PAL chapters to serve public \nhousing projects and other distressed areas and to expand existing \nchapters to assist additional youth.\n  To do this, the bill would authorize $16 million a year for 5 years \nbeginning with fiscal year 2001. The money would be used to enhance the \nservices provided by the existing 320 established PAL chapters and \nprovide seed money for the establishment of an additional 250 chapters \nover 5 years.\n  The Police Athletic League was founded by police officers in New York \nCity in 1914. Its mission is to offer an alternative to crime, drugs, \nand violence for our nation's most at-risk youth. In the last 75 years, \nPAL has become one of the largest youth-crime prevention programs in \nthe nation, with a network of 1700 facilities serving more than 3000 \ncommunities and 1.5 million young people. Over one-third of existing \nPALs are in California, and these chapters serve more than 300,000 at-\nrisk youth. Off-duty police officers staff local chapters, and PALs \nreceive most of their funding from private sources.\n  PALs currently provide kids with after-school recreational, \neducational, mentoring, and crime prevention programs. By keeping kids \nbusy and out of trouble, PALs have significantly reduced juvenile crime \nand victimization in hundreds of communities across the country. One \nstudy found, for example, that PALs have cut crime in Baltimore by 30 \npercent and decreased juvenile victimization there by 40 percent. \nAnother study concluded that PAL reduced crime and gang activity in a \nHUD housing development in El Centro, California by 64 percent.\n  PAL programs involve close, positive interaction between kids and \ncops, encouraging youngsters to view the police in a favorable light \nand obey the law. The programs are generally held after school, during \nthe prime hours that some youth turn to crime and other anti-social \nactivities.\n  PAL programs more than pay for themselves, saving taxpayers millions \nof dollars in crime, drug, and dropout costs. The Department of Justice \nhas found, for example, that each youngster who drops out of high \nschool and turns to crime and drugs costs taxpayers a staggering $2-3 \nmillion. Even so, the legislation requires any new chapter seeking a \ngrant to explain the manner in which it will operate without additional \ndirect federal assistance when the act is discontinued.\n  In short, this valuable legislation will help fight crime and benefit \nkids in California and across the country. It will now go to President \nClinton's desk for signature.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Presidential Threat Protection Act, \nH.R. 3048, is a high priority for the Secret Service and the Service's \nrespected Director, Brian Stafford, and I am pleased that this \nlegislation is passing the Senate today, along with legislation that \nSenators Thurmond, Hatch and I have crafted to assist the U.S. Marshals \nService in apprehending fugitives.\n  The Presidential Threat Protection Act, H.R. 3048, would expand or \nclarify the Secret Service's authority in four ways. First, the bill \nwould amend current law to make clear it is a federal crime, which the \nSecret Service is authorized to investigate, to threaten any current or \nformer President or their immediate family, even if the person is not \ncurrently receiving Secret Service protection and including those \npeople who have declined continued protection, such as former \nPresidents, or have not yet received protection, such as major \nPresidential and Vice-Presidential candidates and their families.\n  Second, the bill would incorporate in statute certain authority, \nwhich is currently embodied in a classified Executive Order, PDD 62, \nclarifying that the Secret Service is authorized to coordinate, design, \nand implement security operations for events deemed of national \nimportance by the President ``or the President's designee.''\n  Third, the bill would establish a ``National Threat Assessment \nCenter' within the Secret Service to provide training to State, local \nand other Federal law enforcement agencies on threat assessments and \npublic safety responsibilities.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue \nadministrative subpoenas for investigations of ``imminent'' threats \nmade against an individual whom the service is authorized to protect. \nThe Secret Service has requested that the Congress grant this \nadministrative subpoena authority to expedite investigation procedures \nparticularly in situations where an individual has made threats against \nthe President and is en route to exercise those threats.\n  ``Administrative subpoena'' is the term generally used to refer to a \ndemand for documents or testimony by an investigative entity or \nregulatory agency that is empowered to issue the subpoena independently \nand without the approval of any grand jury, court or other judicial \nentity. I am generally skeptical of administrative subpoena power. \nAdministrative subpoenas avoid the strict grant jury secrecy rules and \nthe documents provided in response to such subpoenas are, therefore, \nsubject to broader dissemination. Moreover, since investigative agents \nissue such subpoenas directly, without review by a judicial officer or \neven a prosecutor, fewer ``checks'' are in place to ensure the subpoena \nis issued with good cause and not merely as a fishing expedition.\n  H.R. 3048 addresses these general concerns with the following \nprocedural safeguards, some of which would apply not only to the new \nadministrative subpoena authority of the Secret Service but also to \ncurrent administrative subpoena authority granted to the FBI to issue \nadministrative subpoenas in cases involving child abuse, child sexual \nexploitation, and Federal health care offenses.\n  The new administrative subpoena authority in threat cases may only be \nexercised by the Secretary of the Treasury upon determination of the \nDirector of the Secret Service that the threat is imminent, and the \nSecret Service must notify the Attorney General of the issuance of each \nsubpoena. I should note that this requirement will help ensure that \nadministrative subpoenas will be used in only the most significant \ninvestigations since obtaining the authorization for such a subpoena \nfrom senior Treasury and Secret Service personnel may take longer than \nsimply going to the local U.S. Attorney's office to get a grand jury \nsubpoena.\n  The bill would limit the scope of both current and new administrative \nsubpoena authority of the FBI for obtaining records in child sex abuse \nand exploitation cases from Internet Service Providers to the name, \naddress, local and long distance telephone billing records, telephone \nnumber or services used by a subscriber.\n  The bill would also expressly allow a person whose records are \ndemanded pursuant to an administrative subpoena to contest the \nadministrative subpoena by petitioning a federal judge to modify or set \naside the subpoena.\n  The bill would authorize a court to order non-disclosure of the \nadministrative subpoena for up to 90 days (and up to a 90 day \nextension) upon a showing that disclosure would adversely affect the \ninvestigation in an enumerated way.\n  Upon written demand, the agency must return the subpoenaed records or \nthings if no case or proceedings arise from the production of records \n``within a reasonable time.''\n  The administrative subpoena may not require production in less than \n24 hours after service so agencies may have to wait for at least a day \nbefore demanding production.\n  The Senate amendment to H.R. 3048 would modify the House-passed \nversion, which provides that violation of the administrative subpoena \nis punishable by fine or up to five years' imprisonment. This penalty \nprovision in the House version of the bill is both unnecessary and \nexcessive since current law already provides that failure to comply \nwith the subpoena may be punished as a contempt of court--which is\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\neither civil or criminal. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3486(c). Under current \nlaw, the general term of imprisonment for some forms of criminal \ncontempt is up to six months. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 402. The Senate \namendment would strike that provision in the House bill.\n  Secret Service protective function Privilege. While passage of this \nlegislation will assist the Secret Service in fulfilling its critical \nmission, this Congress is unfortunately coming to a close without \naddressing another significant challenge to the Secret Service's \nability to fulfill its vital mission of protecting the life and safety \nof the President and other important persons. I refer to the misguided \nand unfortunately successful litigation of Special Counsel Kenneth \nStarr to compel Secret Service agents to answer questions about what \nthey may have observed or overheard while protecting the life of the \nPresident.\n  As a result of Mr. Starr's zealous efforts, the courts refused to \nrecognize a protective function privilege and required that at least \nseven Secret Service officers appear before a federal grand jury to \nrespond to questions regarding President Clinton, and others. In re \nGrand Jury Proceedings, 1998 W.L. 272884 (May 22, 1998 D.C.), affirmed \n1998 WL 370584 (July 7, 1998 D.C. Cir) (per curiam). These recent court \ndecisions, which refused to recognize a protective function privilege, \ncould have a devastating impact upon the Secret Service's ability to \nprovide effective protection. The Special Counsel and the courts \nignored the voices of experience--former Presidents, Secret Service \nDirectors, and others--who warned of the potentially deadly \nconsequences. The courts disregarded the lessons of history. We cannot \nafford to be so cavalier; the stakes are just too high.\n  In order to address this problem, I introduced the Secret Service \nProtective Privilege Act, S. 1360, on July 13, 1999, to establish a \nSecret Service protective function privilege so Secret Service agents \nwill not be put in the position of revealing private information about \nprotected officials as Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr compelled the \nSecret Service to do with respect to President Clinton. Unfortunately, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee took no action on this legislation in \nthis Congress.\n  Few national interests are more compelling than protecting the life \nof the President of the United States. The Supreme Court has said that \nthe nation has ``an overwhelming interest in protecting the safety of \nits Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties without \ninterference from threats of physical violence.'' Watts v. United \nStates, 394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969). What is at stake is not merely the \nsafety of one person: it is the ability of the Executive Branch to \nfunction in an effective and orderly fashion, and the capacity of the \nUnited States to respond to threats and crises. Think of the shock \nwaves that rocked the world in November 1963 when President Kennedy was \nassassinated. The assassination of a President has international \nrepercussions and threatens the security and future of the entire \nnation.\n  The threat to our national security and to our democracy extends \nbeyond the life of the President to those in direct line of the Office \nof the President--the Vice President, the President-elect, and the Vice \nPresident elect. By Act of Congress, these officials are required to \naccept the protection of the Secret Service--they may not turn it down. \nThis statutory mandate reflects the critical importance that Congress \nhas attached to the physical safety of these officials.\n  Congress has also charged the Secret Service with responsibility for \nprotecting visiting heads of foreign states and foreign governments. \nThe assassination of a foreign head of state on American soil could be \ncatastrophic from a foreign relations standpoint and could seriously \nthreaten national security.\n\n  The bill I introduced, S. 1360, would enhance the Secret Service's \nability to protect these officials, and the nation, from the risk of \nassassination. It would do this by facilitating the relationship of \ntrust between these officials and their Secret Service protectors that \nis essential to the Secret Service's protective strategy. Agents and \nofficers surround the protectee with an all-encompassing zone of \nprotection on a 24-hour-a-day basis. In the face of danger, they will \nshield the protectee's body with their own bodies and move him to a \nsecure location.\n  That is how the Secret Service averted a national tragedy on March \n30, 1981, when John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan. \nWithin seconds of the first shot being fired, Secret Service personnel \nhad shielded the President's body and maneuvered him into the waiting \nlimousine. One agent in particular, Agent Tim McCarthy, positioned his \nbody to intercept a bullet intended for the President. If Agent \nMcCarthy had been even a few feet farther from the President, history \nmight have gone very differently.\n  For the Secret Service to maintain this sort of close, unremitting \nproximity to the President and other protectees, it must have their \ncomplete, unhesitating trust and confidence. Secret Service personnel \nmust be able to remain at the President's side even during confidential \nand sensitive conversations, when they may overhear military secrets, \ndiplomatic exchanges, and family and private matters. If our Presidents \ndo not have complete trust in the Secret Service personnel who protect \nthem, they could try to push away the Secret Service's ``protective \nenvelope'' or undermine it to the point where it could no longer be \nfully effective.\n  This is more than a theoretical possibility. Consider what former \nPresident Bush wrote in April, 1998, after hearing of the independent \ncounsel's efforts to compel Secret Service testimony:\n\n       The bottom line is I hope that [Secret Service] agents will \n     be exempted from testifying before the Grand Jury. What's at \n     stake here is the protection of the life of the President and \n     his family and the confidence and trust that a President must \n     have in the [Secret Service]. If a President feels that \n     Secret Service agents can be called to testify about what \n     they might have seen or heard then it is likely that the \n     President will be uncomfortable having the agents nearby. I \n     allowed the agents to have proximity first because they had \n     my full confidence and secondly because I knew them to be \n     totally discreet and honorable. . . . I can assure you that \n     had I felt they would be compelled to testify as to what they \n     had seen or heard, no matter what the subject, I would not \n     have felt comfortable having them close in. . . . I feel very \n     strongly that the [Secret Service] agents should not be made \n     to appear in court to discuss that which they might or might \n     not have seen or heard. What's at stake here is the \n     confidence of the President in the discretion of the [Secret \n     Service]. If that confidence evaporates the agents, denied \n     proximity, cannot properly protect the President.\n\n  As President Bush's letter makes plain, requiring Secret Service \nagents to betray the confidence of the people whose lives they protect \ncould seriously jeopardize the ability of the Service to perform its \ncrucial national security function.\n  The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be compelled to \ntestify about their protectees could have a particularly devastating \naffect on the Service's ability to protect foreign dignitaries. The \nmere fact that this issue has surfaced is likely to make foreign \ngovernments less willing to accommodate Secret Service both with \nrespect to the protection of the President and Vice President on \nforeign trips, and the protection of foreign heads of state traveling \nin the United States.\n  The security of our chief executive officers and visiting foreign \nheads of state should be a matter that transcends all partisan politics \nand I regret that this legislation does not do more to help the Secret \nService by providing a protective function privilege.\n  The Fugitive Apprehension Act. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3048 \nincorporates into the bill the substance of the Thurmond-Biden-Leahy \nsubstitute amendment to S. 2516, the Fugitive Apprehension Act, which \npassed the Senate unanimously on July 26, 2000. That substitute \namendment reconciled the significant differences between S. 2516, as \nintroduced, and S. 2761, ``The Capturing Criminals Act,'' which I \nintroduced with Senator Kohl on June 21, 2000. The Senate amendment to \nH.R. 3048 makes certain changes to S. 2516 to ensure that the authority \ngranted is consistent with privacy and other appropriate safeguards.\n  As a former prosecutor, I am well aware that fugitives from justice \nare an important problem and that their capture is an essential \nfunction of law enforcement. According to the FBI, nearly 550,000 \npeople are currently fugitives from justice on federal, state, and \nlocal felony charges combined. This means that there are almost as many\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\nfugitive felons as there are citizens residing in my home state of \nVermont.\n  The fact that we have more than one half million fugitives from \njustice, a significant portion of whom are convicted felons in \nviolation of probation or parole, who have been able to flaunt court \norder and avoid arrest, breeds disrespect for our laws and poses \nundeniable risks to the safety of our citizens.\n  Our Federal law enforcement agencies should be commended for the job \nthey have been doing to date on capturing federal fugitives and helping \nthe states and local communities bring their fugitives to justice. The \nU.S. Marshals Service, our oldest law enforcement agency, has arrested \nover 120,000 federal, state and local fugitives in the past four years, \nincluding more federal fugitives than all the other federal agencies \ncombined. In prior years, the Marshals Service spearheaded special \nfugitive apprehension task forces, called FIST Operations, that \ntargeted fugitives in particular areas and was singularly successful in \narresting over 34,000 fugitive felons.\n  Similarly, the FBI has established twenty-four Safe Streets Task \nForces exclusively focused on apprehending fugitives in cities around \nthe country. Over the period of 1995 to 1999, the FBI's efforts have \nresulted in the arrest of a total of 65,359 state fugitives.\n  Nevertheless, the number of outstanding fugitives is too large. The \nSenate amendment to H.R. 3028 will help make a difference by providing \nnew but limited administrative subpoena authority to the Department of \nJustice to obtain documentary evidence helpful in tracking down \nfugitives and by authorizing the Attorney General to establish fugitive \ntask forces.\n  Unlike initial criminal inquiries, fugitive investigations present \nunique difficulties. Law enforcement may not use grand jury subpoenas \nsince, by the time a person is a fugitive, the grand jury phase of an \ninvestigation is usually over. Use of grand jury subpoenas to obtain \nphone or bank records to track down a fugitive would be an abuse of the \ngrand jury. Trial subpoenas may also not be used, either because the \nfugitive is already convicted or no trial may take place without the \nfugitive.\n  This inability to use trial and grand jury subpoenas for fugitive \ninvestigations creates a gap in law enforcement procedures. Law \nenforcement partially fills this gap by using the All Writs Act, 28 \nU.S.C. Sec. 1651(a), which authorizes federal courts to ``issue all \nwrits necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions \nand agreeable to the usages and principles of law.'' The procedures, \nhowever, for obtaining orders under the Act, and the scope and non-\ndisclosure terms of such orders, vary between jurisdictions. \nAuthorizing administrative subpoena power will help bridge the gap in \nfugitive investigations by providing a uniform mechanism for federal \nlaw enforcement agencies to obtain records useful for tracking a \nfugitive's whereabouts.\n  The Thurmond-Biden-Leahy substitute amendment, which previously \npassed the Senate, incorporated a number of provisions from the Leahy-\nKohl ``Capturing Criminals Act'' and made significant and positive \nmodifications to the original version of S. 2516. These improvements \nare largely incorporated into the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond \namendments to H.R. 3048, which the Senate considers today. First, as \nintroduced, S. 2516 would have limited use of an administrative \nsubpoena to those fugitives who have been ``indicted,'' and failed to \naddress the fact that fugitives flee after arrest on the basis of a \n``complaint'' and may flee after the prosecutor has filed an \n``information'' in lieu of an amendment. The prior substitute amendment \nand the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048, by \ncontrast, would allow use of such subpoenas to track fugitives who have \nbeen accused in a ``complaint, information or indictment.''\n  Second, S. 2516, as introduced, would have required the U.S. Marshals \nService to report quarterly to the Attorney General (who must transmit \nthe report to Congress) on use of the administrative subpoenas. While a \nreporting requirement is useful, the requirement as described in the \noriginal S. 2516 was overly burdensome and insufficiently specific. The \nprior substitute amendment and the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond \namendment to H.R. 3048 would require, as set forth in the Capturing \nCriminals Act, that the Attorney General report for the next three \nyears to the Judiciary Committees of both the House and Senate on the \nfollowing information about the use of administrative subpoenas in \nfugitive investigations: the number issued, by which agency, \nidentification of the charges on which the fugitive was wanted and \nwhether the fugitive was wanted on federal or state charges.\n\n  Third, although the original S. 2516 outlined the procedures for \nenforcement of an administrative subpoena, it was silent on the \nmechanisms for contesting the subpoena by the recipient. The procedures \noutlined in H.R. 3048 address this issue in a manner fully consistent \nwith those I originally outlined in the Capturing Criminals Act by \nallowing a person, who is served with an administrative subpoena, to \npetition a court to modify or set aside the subpoena.\n  Fourth, the original S. 2516 set forth no procedure for the \ngovernment to command a custodian of records to avoid disclosure or \ndelay notice to a customer about the existence of the subpoena. This is \nparticularly critical in fugitive investigations when law enforcement \ndoes not want to alert a fugitive that the police are on the person's \ntrail. Both the prior substitute amendment to S. 2516, which passed the \nSenate last July, and H.R. 3048, which the Senate considers today, \nprovide express authority for law enforcement to apply for a court \norder directing the custodian of records to delay notice to subscribers \nof the existence of the subpoena on the same terms applicable in \ncurrent law to other subpoenas issued, for example, to telephone \ncompanies and financial institutions. This procedure is consistent with \nprovisions I originally proposed in the Capturing Criminals Act.\n  Fifth, S. 2516, as introduced, would have authorized use of an \nadministrative subpoena in fugitive investigations upon a finding by \nthe Attorney General that the documents are ``relevant and material,'' \nwhich is further defined to mean that ``there are articulable facts \nthat show the fugitive's whereabouts may be discerned from the records \nsought.'' In my view, changing the standard for issuance of a subpoena \nfrom ``relevancy'' to a hybrid of ``relevant and material'' would set a \nconfusing precedent. Accordingly, the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond \namendment to H.R. 3048 amendment would authorize issuance of an \nadministrative subpoena in fugitive investigations based on the same \nstandard as for other administrative subpoenas, i.e., that the \ndocuments may be relevant to an authorized law enforcement inquiry.\n  Sixth, the original S. 2516 authorized the Attorney General to issue \nguidelines delegating authority for issuance of administrative \nsubpoenas in fugitive investigations only to the Director of the U.S. \nMarshals Service, despite the fact that the FBI, and the Drug \nEnforcement Administration also want this authority to find fugitives \non charges over which they have investigative authority. The substitute \namendment to S. 2516, which previously passed the Senate, and the \ncurrent Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048, which we consider \ntoday, would authorize the Attorney General to issue guidelines \ndelegating authority for issuance of administrative subpoenas to \nsupervisory personnel within components of the Department. In addition, \nthe current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 would require \nthat the Attorney General's guidelines require that administrative \nsubpoenas in fugitive investigations be issued only upon the review and \napproval of senior supervisory personnel within the respective \ninvestigating agency and of the U.S. Attorney in the judicial district \nin which the subpoena would be served.\n\n  Seventh, the original S. 2516 did not address the issue that a \nvariety of administrative subpoena authorities exist in multiple forms \nin every agency. The substitute amendment to S. 2516, which previously \npassed the Senate, and the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048, \nwhich we consider today, incorporates from the Capturing Criminals Act \na requirement that the Attorney General provide a report on this issue.\n\n[[Page S10550]]\n\n  Eighth, the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 would \nlimit the use of administrative subpoenas in fugitive investigations to \nthose fugitives who have been accused or convicted of serious violent \nfelony or serious drug offenses.\n  Finally, as introduced, S. 2516 authorized the U.S. Marshal Service \nto establish permanent Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces. By contrast, \nthe substitute amendment to S. 2516, which previously passed the \nSenate, and the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048, which we \nconsider today, would authorize $40,000,000 over three years for the \nAttorney General to establish multi-agency task forces (which will be \ncoordinated by the Director of the Marshals Service) in consultation \nwith the Secretary of the Treasury and the States, so that the Secret \nService, BATF, the FBI and the States are able to participate in the \nTask Forces to find their fugitives.\n  The Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 will help law \nenforcement--with increased resources for regional fugitive \napprehension task forces and administrative subpoena authority--to \nbring to justice both federal and state fugitives who, by their \nconduct, have demonstrated a lack of respect for our nation's criminal \njustice system.\n  I urge that the Senate pass H.R. 3048 with the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond \namendment without delay.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4319) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 3048), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10550-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10550-S10551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF \n                        2000--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. 1654, which is the \nNASA authorization conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1654) to authorize appropriations for the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal years 2000, \n     2001, and 2002, and for other purposes, having met, after \n     full and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by \n     all of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.)\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 12, 2000.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1654 which \nauthorizes appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration for fiscal years 2000 to 2002.\n  We have taken a long road to reach this point. I particularly want to \nthank my fellow conferees, Senators McCain, Frist, Stevens, and Breaux. \nYou and your staffs have worked in a professional, bipartisan manner to \nget this bill done. Congratulations.\n  In the past year alone, we have heard of great successes at NASA--\nlaunch of the first element of the International Space Station, \ndiscoveries about the nature of our universe by our new Chandra X-Ray \nObservatory, the discovery of evidence to show liquid water on Mars. \nHowever, NASA has also seen some chinks in its armor with the failure \nof the Mars Climate Orbiter and the Mars Polar Lander and subsequent \nquestions about the ``faster, better, cheaper'' mission concept. I note \nthat Section 301 of the bill requires an independent cost analysis of \nmissions that are projected to cost more than $150 million so that we \ndo not operate under unrealistic budget constraints that have been \nblamed, in part, for these losses.\n  It seems that NASA is at a bit of a crossroads both in trying to \noperate more efficiently without losing its effectiveness and in \nlooking forward to the day when the International Space Station will be \ncomplete. So you see, this is the perfect time for an authorization \nbill like this one to help lay down a road map for the agency.\n  Specifically, H.R. 1654 authorizes $13.6 billion for NASA in FY 2000, \n$14.2 billion in FY 2001, and $14.6 billion in FY 2002. These are at or \nabove the requested level. The conference report highlights some \npriorities within NASA's accounts. I want to make it very clear for the \nrecord, though--this is an authorization bill. None of this money in \nany of these accounts can be spent until appropriated. The VA-HUD \nappropriations law will have the final say on spending, and that is as \nit should be.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Breaux, I am sure, will summarize the \nmajor provisions of this legislation. I would like to discuss, briefly, \nwhy the conferees did what we did in a few places.\n  The bill imposes a cap on the total development cost of the \nInternational Space Station and related Space Shuttle launch costs. \nWhile I am no supporter of the International Space Station, I support \nthe cap as a way of imposing a program that until recently was bleeding \nmore and more red ink every day.\n  Nonetheless, I am concerned about the safety of the Shuttle, the \nStation, and our astronauts. As soon as NASA expressed concerns about \nsafety, we immediately listened to their concerns and accommodated them \nwithout putting a hole in the cap that you could fly the Shuttle \nthrough.\n  Section 324 of the bill alters the provisions of the Space Act \nrelating to insurance, indemnification, and cross waivers for \nexperimental launch vehicles. Current law provides broad authority for \nthe Administrator of NASA to indemnify the developers of experimental \nlaunch vehicles. As you may know, the parallel authority under FAA's \nlicensing authority for operational vehicles sunsets periodically. H.R. \n1654 places a sunset on the authority for experimental vehicles to \nallow us to review its use. The bill also does not allow reciprocal \nwaivers of liability in a case where a loss results from the willful \nmisconduct of a party to such waiver.\n  I am pleased we could include section 322 which would prohibit the \nlicensing of the U.S. launch of a payload containing advertising which \nwould be visible to the naked eye from space. It also encourages the \nPresident to seek agreements with other nations to do the same. I, for \none, do not believe that advertisements should compete for space in the \nsky with constellations, meteor showers, and planets.\n  The conferees have authorized $25 million in FY 2001 and 2002 for the \nCommercial Remote Sensing Program's data purchases. I hope that such \nfunding would be used to assist local and state government users \nacquire and use remote sensing data in their operations.\n  The conferees have worked with the Administration to resolve several \ncomplicated policy issues. We did not come to the exact place the \nAdministration wanted us to be. Nonetheless, I think we have come to \nprovisions which satisfy the Administration's bottom line. Does the \nAdministration love the bill? Of course not--what agency likes \noversight, likes an authorization bill, especially if that agency has \nbeen operating in the absence of authorization since FY 1993. \nNonetheless, I think we have done a good job. This is a bill the \nPresident can and should sign.\n  We resolve the Administration's concerns regarding onerous provisions \nrelating to Russian involvement in the Space Station program by making \nthem country-neutral and forward-looking. The bill keeps the Space \nStation Commercial Demonstration Program in law, albeit for a shorter \nauthorization period. H.R. 1654 will allow NASA to lease an inflatable \nhabitation module or ``Trans-HAB.'' The bill does not terminate the \nTriana satellite program. And, as I mentioned before, the bill accounts \nfor safety-related concerns about the cap provision.\n  Unfortunately, we could not include some meritorious provisions which \nwere transmitted to the Hill with NASA's FY 2001 budget submission. I \nwould be happy to work in the next Congress with NASA on a policy bill \nwhich meets these needs.\n\n[[Page S10551]]\n\n  Finally, I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee once again. \nWhen our negotiations with the House threatened to dissolve, he stood \nfirm on the need for a bipartisan NASA bill this year. I speak for all \nof the conferees when I congratulate him for putting together this \nbill. While it is not perfect, I support H.R. 1654 and hope that the \nSenate will adopt the conference report.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \non H.R. 1654, the NASA Authorization bill. First, I thank Chairman \nMcCain and the other Senate conferees. We have come to a bi-partisan \nagreement after many months of conference and now we have the \nopportunity to pass a NASA Authorization bill for the first time since \nfiscal year 1993.\n  As you know, NASA is one of the agencies of government that captures \nthe spirit of the American people. Who can fail to be awed by the \nliftoff of a Space Shuttle, a walk in space, or the discovery of water \non Mars? Because NASA is such a treasure, it is important that we in \nCongress exercise our duty to oversee and authorize its programs.\n  And that is just what this conference report does. H.R. 1654 would \nauthorize funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \nat the appropriated level of $13.6 billion in FY 2000. It provides \n$14.2 billion in FY 2001 and $14.6 billion in FY 2002, slightly more \nthan the President's requested level.\n  The bill fully funds the Space Shuttle program, the International \nSpace Station, and the Space Launch Initiative. It provides \nauthorizations above the requested levels for the Space Grant College \nprogram, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, \nEPSCoR, and NASA's research into aircraft noise reduction and cleaner, \nmore energy-efficient aircraft engine technology--research that can \nimprove the quality of life of Americans who live near airports.\n  When we were nearing the finish line with this bill, the \nAdministration contacted us about several key concerns they had with \nthe bill. We have resolved their concerns, and now I would like to run \nthrough these issues: our interaction with International Space Station \npartners, commercialization of the Space Station, Trans-Hab, Shuttle \nSafety, and Triana.\n  International partners and the space station: We successfully altered \nHouse-proposed lauguage which was overly punitive. The provision \ncontained in H.R. 1654 encourages NASA to provide for equitable use of \nthe Space Station by seeking reduction in utilization rights (like crew \nallocation) for International Partners that willfully violate any of \ntheir commitments to the program.\n  Space station commercialization: The conferees agreed to leave in \nplace the Space Station Commercial Development program and did not \nagree to the House's proposal to eliminate the program. We did, \nhowever, shorten the period of time for which the program is authorized \nfrom 2004 to 2002. The program will be up for reauthorization at the \nsame time that NASA itself is due for reauthorization.\n  Trans-hab: NASA has considered replacing the ``hard'' habitation \nmodule for the Space Station with an inflatable ``Trans-Hab.'' The \nHouse had sought to prohibit NASA from using its funds to develop an \ninflatable habitation module. The conference agreement clarifies that \nNASA is permitted to lease or use a commercially-developed Trans-Hab. \nIt is my understanding that NASA is currently evaluating a very serious \ncommercial proposal for an inflatable space structure capable of \naccommodating humans in space, and this language should allow them to \nparticipate in such an agreement.\n  Shuttle safety: The Administration was concerned that the Senate-\npassed cost cap on the International Space Station and Shuttle flights \nto assemble the Station might send the wrong message about Shuttle and \nStation crew safety. That concern sent up a red flag to the conferees--\nno cost limitation proposed in this legislation should make NASA \nhesitate for one moment in launching the Shuttle if a life was at \nstake. No one wants to jeopardize the life and safety of the crew of \nthe Space Station. We inserted language to ensure that the cap would \nnot apply to costs incurred to ensure or enhance the safety or \nreliability of the Space Shuttle and another provision to allow the \nAdministrator to use monies provided beyond the cap to improve safety \nor to launch a shuttle to protect the Station and its crew.\n  Triana: Finally, the House agreed to take out its provision to \nterminate the Triana program. Triana will be the world's first Earth-\nobserving mission to L1, the gravitational mid-point between the sun \nand the Earth. From this vantage point, the satellite has a continuous \nview of the Sun-lit portion of the Earth. Over 90 percent of the \ninstrument development has already taken place, and we've already spent \nabout $40 million.\n  NASA highlighted several legislative provisions which they feel would \nbe beneficial, yet are not included in the bill. While I would not \nsupport all of those provisions, I am disappointed we could not include \nsome of the provisions that represent their greatest needs in this \nConference Report.\n  I would also like to highlight a few of H.R. 1654's other major \nprovisions. The Conference Report imposes a $25.0 billion cost cap for \nInternational Space Station development and a $17.7 billion cost cap \nfor Space Shuttle launch costs in connection with Station assembly. The \ncap would not apply to operations, research, or crew return activities \nafter the Station is complete. An additional contingency fund of $5 \nbillion for Station development and $3.5 billion for Space Shuttle is \nauthorized to provide flexibility in case of an emergency or other \nunusual circumstance.\n  As you know, I am a strong supporter of the International Space \nStation Program. The Space Shuttle Discovery is currently on the 100th \nSpace Shuttle mission, putting cargo and other items in place so that \nthe Station is ready to be occupied by its permanent crew next month.\n  The cap on Station development in the bill does not seek to alter or \nimpede that program in any way. It merely seeks to limit the \ndevelopment costs so we stick to the plan and put a fully-operational \nSpace Station on orbit in a timely manner.\n  The bill also directs NASA, after Congressional review of their plan, \nto establish a non-governmental organization (NGO) to manage Space \nStation research and commercial activities upon completion of the \nStation. I understand that some members are concerned about this \nprovision. I will simply note: (1) NASA is already in the process of \nevaluating and establishing an NGO to manage station research; and (2) \nour bill allows Congress nearly 4 months to react to NASA's proposal \nbefore it can be implemented. If we don't like what they come back \nwith, we can tell them not to do it.\n  H.R. 1654 represents the culmination of several years of hard work, \nand it is a good piece of legislation. I don't like every provision in \nthe bill, but it represents a fine compromise--and one it looked like \nwe might never reach. Again, I would like to thank Chairman McCain and \nSenator Frist for their hard work and to thank our staffs, in \nparticular Floyd DesChamps, Elizabeth Prostic, and Jean Toal Eisen.\n  I urge the swift adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, Senators Snowe and Kerry have an amendment \nat the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] for Ms. Snowe, for \n     herself and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 4320.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4320) was agreed to.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to support H.R. 3417, the Pribilof \nIslands Transition Act with the amendment I have offered. This bill, as \namended, contains a number of ocean, coastal, and fisheries related \ntitles that will result in major conservation gains for our nation's \nmarine resources at a time when we are placing enormous demands on \nthem. The bill not only attempts to provide additional environmental \nprotections through a number of state and local programs, but also \ntools for better management.\n  Title I of this bill is the Pribilof Islands Transition Act. The \nAlaskan Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea were a former reserve for \nharvesting fur seals. The Commerce Department, acting through the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has been \ninvolved in municipal and social services on the islands since 1910. In \n1983, NOAA tried to remove themselves from administering these \nprograms. However, despite the $20 million in funds the Pribilof \nIslands received to replace future annual Federal appropriations, the \nPribilof Islanders claim that the terms of the transition process were \nnot met and the withdrawal failed.\n  This title authorizes $28 million over five years to again attempt to \nachieve the orderly withdrawal of NOAA from the civil administration of \nthe Pribilof Islands. Additionally, it authorizes $10 million a year \nfor five years for NOAA to complete its environmental cleanup and \nlandfill closure obligations prior to the final transfer of federal \nproperty to the six local entities. The Pribilof Islands have \nhistorically been a very expensive program to the American taxpayers. \nCongress expects that this title will provide a final termination of \nNOAA's municipal and social service responsibilities on the islands and \na distinct end to federal taxpayer funding of those services.\n  Title II of this bill is the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000, \nwhich refines and reauthorizes funding for the nation's coastal zone \nmanagement program. This is the same language that was passed by \nunanimous consent in the Senate on September 28, 2000. Not only is this \nfederal-state partnership important to my home state of Maine, but it \nis also a significant management tool for coastal states throughout the \ncountry. Despite the fact that the coastal zone only comprises 10 \npercent of the contiguous U.S. land area, it is home to more than 53 \npercent of the U.S. population, and more than 3,600 people relocate \nthere annually. Not only is it an important economic region, but the \ncoastal zone is also critical ecologically.\n  We are currently facing a very serious problem in the coastal zone in \nthe form of non-point source pollution. This type of runoff pollution \nis degrading the condition of our coastal rivers, wetlands, and marine \nenvironments. Compromising the environmental integrity of the coastal \nzone can in turn have a large impact on the regions' economic viability \nin a number of sectors, including tourism and fishing. The Coastal Zone \nManagement Act of 2000 addresses this issue by encouraging and funding \nstates to implement local solutions to their non-point source pollution \nproblems. We have not created any new mandates or programs addressing \nnon-point source pollution. Rather, the Coastal Community program can \nbe used at the states' discretion if they want to create and \nimplement local community-based solutions to problems, which would \ninclude non-point source pollution control strategies and measures.\n\n  This title greatly increases authorization levels for the coastal \nzone management program, allowing states to better address their \ncoastal management plan goals. While we have achieved many successes \nthrough the CZMA, the states have made it clear that they can do more \nand that they can raise additional funds to match the increased federal \nfunding. Therefore, we have authorized a total of $136.5 million for \nfiscal year 2001 and increased authorization levels by $5.5 million a \nyear through fiscal year 2004. This total authorization includes an \nincrease for the National Estuarine Research and Reserve System (NERRS) \nto $12 million in fiscal year 2001, with an additional $1 million \nincrease each year through fiscal year 2004.\n  Mr. President, Title III of the bill deals with the management of \nseveral Atlantic coast fisheries. Subtitle A reauthorizes the Atlantic \nStriped Bass Conservation Act (ASBCA). The ASBCA was originally passed \nto help coordinate and improve interstate management of Atlantic \nstriped bass, an important commercial and recreational fish. Because \nstriped bass migrate along the eastern seaboard, it is imperative that \nmanagement measures be coordinated among the various states. The \nrebuilding of striped bass populations is considered one of our \nfisheries management success stories and it is critical that we \ncontinue these efforts. This subtitle authorizes $1.25 million a year \nfor fiscal years 2001 through 2003 to carry out the provisions of the \nact and another $250,000 to conduct a population study on the Atlantic \nstriped bass.\n  Subtitle B, the Atlantic Costal Fisheries Act of 2000, will \nreauthorize the highly successful interstate program that manages \ncoastal fisheries that cross jurisdictional boundaries along the east \ncoast. The states have proven that joint management of these resources \nis far more effective than a piecemeal approach by individual states. \nIn an effort to further increase the effectiveness of interstate \nmanagement, the states have initiated the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative \nStatistics Program. This joint data collection and analysis program is \nintended to meet the need for improved fishery statistics for \nmanagement purposes. It is a comprehensive effort to address all\n\n[[Page S10553]]\n\nareas and fisheries and could serve as a model for a national \ncooperative statistics program. This subtitle authorizes $10 million in \nfiscal year 2001, increasing the authorization by $2 million a year \nuntil fiscal year 2005.\n  Subtitle C of this title deals with a significant problem facing the \nAtlantic bluefin tuna, ABT, fishery. In 1998, the Highly Migratory \nSpecies Advisory Panel unanimously requested and advised the Secretary \nof Commerce to ban the use of spotter aircraft in the General and \nHarpoon categories of the ABT fishery. Spotter aircraft tend to \naccelerate the catch of the ABT, and thus can create significant \nimpacts on both the communities that depend on the fishery and the \nconservation intentions of the ABT management plans. Because NMFS has \nbeen unable to successfully implement a rule to ban the use of spotter \naircraft in the ABT fishery over the past two years, it has become \nnecessary for Congress to take legislative action. Subtitle C prohibits \nthe unfair use of spotter aircraft to locate or assist in fishing for \nABT in the General and Harpoon categories of the ABT fishery. This \naction follows numerous public hearings held by NMFS and the discussion \nof this issue at several Senate hearings. This provision passed by \nunanimous consent in the Senate as part of an amendment to H.R. 1651, \nthe Fishermen's Protective Act, on June 26, 2000.\n\n  Mr. President, to many Americans, as well as myself, the practice of \nshark finning is both wasteful and disturbing. Shark finning is a \nmethod by which the dorsal fin and tail of a shark are cut off and \nretained, while the rest of the shark carcass is discarded as waste. \nMuch of the fin product is then exported for sale to Asian countries. \nTitle IV, the Shark Conservation Act, attempts to address this problem \nby prohibiting the domestic landing and at-sea transhipment of shark \nfins. It also directs the Administration to begin international \nnegotiations to reduce foreign shark finning.\n  Title V of the bill is the Fishermen's Protective Act Amendments of \n2000. It amends the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 to lengthen the \nperiod during which reimbursement can be provided to owners of U.S. \nfishing vessels for costs incurred when a vessel is illegally seized, \ndetained, or charged certain fees by a foreign country. Under the \ntitle, the reimbursement period is extended until fiscal year 2003. \nThis provision passed by unanimous consent in the Senate on June 26, \n2000.\n  Mr. President, title VI of the bill is the Yukon River Salmon Act of \n2000. It creates a Yukon River Salmon Panel to advise both the \nSecretary of State regarding negotiation of any international \nagreements with Canada relating to management of Yukon River salmon \nstocks and Secretary of the Interior regarding management of those \nstocks. An Advisory Committee is created to make advisory \nrecommendations to a number of entities, including the Panel. A total \nof four million dollars a year for fiscal years 2000 through 2003 is \nauthorized. Of these funds, up to $3 million a year can be used for a \nYukon River salmon survey, restoration, enhancement activities; \n$600,000 of the total is to be available for cooperative Yukon River \nsalmon research and management projects. This provision passed by \nunanimous consent in the Senate on June 26, 2000.\n  This bill also address the very serious problem of an aging fishery \nresearch vessel, FRV, fleet. Because these vessels are used to conduct \nthe majority of fishery stock assessments, they are a critical tool for \nimproving management and regulation of our commercial fish species. \nOver the past year, I have conducted a series of six hearings across \nthe country on fisheries management. At every hearing, the need for \nmore and better data was raised repeatedly by the witnesses. The \nseventh title of the bill directs the Secretary of Commerce to acquire \nvessels, authorizing $60 million a year for fiscal years 2002 through \n2004. They will be outfitted with the latest technology and enable \ninnovative research. New England is in particular need of a replacement \nFRV, since the current NOAA vessel, the Albatross IV, is 38 years old \nand at the end of its useful life. Without a new vessel, the ability \nfor NOAA to collect long term fisheries, oceanographic, and biological \ndata in New England will be seriously compromised. I had offered this \nprovision as an amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act which \npassed by unanimous consent in the Senate on June 26, 2000.\n\n  Mr. President, the bill also makes significant conservation and \nmanagement improvements for our nation's coral reefs. Title VIII, the \nCoral Reef Conservation Act of 2000, requires the creation of a \nnational coral reef action strategy. Of particular note is the use of \nmarine protected areas to serve as replenishment zones. The U.S. Coral \nReef Task Force has called for setting aside 20 percent of coral reefs \nin each region of the United States that contains reefs as no-take \nareas. However, many of the U.S. islands that have coral reefs have \nsignificant cultural ties to these reefs. It is imperative that any new \nmarine protected areas are developed in close cooperation with the \npeople of these islands and account for traditional and cultural uses \nof these resources. Without such cooperation, there will not be public \nsupport. The national strategy will address how such traditional uses \nwill be incorporated into these replenishment zones.\n  The national program will also incorporate such important topics as \nmapping; research, monitoring, and assessment; international and \nregional management; outreach and education; and restoration. According \nto NOAA, the majority of our nation's coral reefs are within federal \nwaters, therefore it is expected that NOAA will continue to work \ncooperatively with the states, territories, and commonwealths in the \ndevelopment and implementation of coral reef management plans and shift \nthe burden of responsibility onto these states, territories, and \ncommonwealths.\n  The title also creates a new coral reef conservation program, which \nwill provide grants to states, governmental authorities, educational \ninstitutions, and non-governmental organizations. This is intended to \nfoster locally based coral reef conservation and management. Creation \nof a coral reef conservation fund is also authorized. This fund would \nallow the Administration to enter into agreements with nonprofit \norganizations to support partnerships between the public and private \nsectors to further the conservation of coral reefs and help raise the \nmatching funds required as part of the new grants program.\n  The title authorizes a total of $16 million a year for fiscal years \n2001 through 2004 to be spilt equally between the local coral reef \nconservation program and national coral reef activities.\n  Title IX of the bill amends the American Fisheries Act to allow for \nthe participation of two additional catcher vessels in the Alaskan \npollock fishery. These vessels were able to demonstrate that they \nshould have been included in the Act when it passed in 1998. This title \nalso makes a number of minor technical changes to other fisheries laws.\n  Title X creates a new marine mammal rescue assistance grant program. \nThis new program will assist eligible marine mammal stranding network \nparticipants by providing funding for recovery and treatment of marine \nmammals. Grants can also be used for data collection and the continued \noperation of these stranding centers. Efforts of these centers are \ncritical for the continued conservation and management of marine \nmammals in our nation's waters. This program is authorized at $5 \nmillion for each of fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kerry, the ranking member of the Oceans \nand Fisheries Subcommittee for his hard work and support of this bill. \nI would also like to thank Senator Inouye for his support, particularly \nfor his contributions to the coral reef conservation section of the \nbill. In addition, I would like to thank Senator McCain, the chairman \nof the Commerce Committee, and Senator Hollings, the ranking member of \nthe Committee, for their bipartisan support of this measure. We have \nbefore us an opportunity to significantly improve our Nation's ability \nto conserve and manage our marine resources and I urge the Senate to \npass H.R. 3417, as amended.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on H.R. 3417 \nand amendments to it that will pass the Senate today. It is a package \nof several bills all designed to benefit our coastal\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\nand marine environment. It is my hope, Mr. President, that the House of \nRepresentatives will consider and pass the bill immediately. They are \nsound proposals with broad support.\n  Since the day I first arrived in the Senate more than 15 years ago, I \nhave worked hard to address the many challenges confronting our common \nocean and coastal resources. After all, few states draw as much of \ntheir national and regional identity from their coasts as does \nMassachusetts. And I have been fortunate that the Commerce Committee \nincludes members of both parties who are ready and willing to work \ntogether, to find compromise and pass sound legislation. In that \nregard, I want to thank Senators Snowe, McCain and Hollings for their \nwork on this bill.\n  The major provisions of H.R. 3417, as amended, are the Pribilof \nIslands Transition Act, the Shark Finning Prohibition Act, the Atlantic \nStriped Bass Conservation Act, the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries \nCooperative Management Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the \nFishermen's Protective Act Amendments, the Coral Reef Conservation Act \nand the Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Act. Each of these major \nproposals in the bill, except the corals bill, has already passed the \nHouse, the Senate or both. The bill also includes a ban on the use of \nspotter aircraft in certain bluefin tuna fishery categories. This \nproposal has passed the Senate.\n  I would like to make a few short comments on the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act. To begin, I want to thank Senator Snowe, our chairman \non the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee, for \nputting this legislation on the Committee agenda this Congress and \nworking for its enactment.\n  Mr. President, when Congress enacted the Coastal Zone Management Act \nin 1972, it made the critical finding that, ``Important ecological, \ncultural, historic, and esthetic values in the coastal zone are being \nirretrievably damaged or lost.'' As we deliberated CZMA's \nreauthorization this session, I measured our progress against that \nalmost 30-year-old congressional finding. And, I concluded that while \nwe have made tremendous gains in coastal environmental protection, the \nincreasing challenges have made this congressional finding is as true \ntoday as it was then.\n  It is clear from the evidence presented to the Committee in our \noversight process and from other input that I have received, that a \ngreat need exists for the federal government to increase its support \nfor states and local communities that are working to protect and \npreserve our coastal zone. To accomplish that goal, the Committee has \nreported a bill that substantially increases annual authorizations for \nthe CZMA program and targets funding at controlling coastal polluted \nrunoff, one the more difficult challenges we face in the coastal \nenvironment.\n  This reauthorization tackles the problem of polluted coastal runoff. \nThis is one of the great environmental and economic challenges we face \nin the coastal zone. At the same time that pollution from industrial, \ncommercial and residential sources has increased in the coastal zone, \nthe destruction of wetlands, marshes, mangroves and other natural \nsystems has reduced the capacity of these systems to filter pollution. \nTogether, these two trends have resulted in environmental and economic \ndamage to our coastal areas. These effects include beach closures \naround the nation, the discovery of a recurring ``Dead Zone'' covering \nmore than 6,000 square miles in the Gulf of Mexico, the outbreak of \nPfiesteria on the Mid-Atlantic, the clogging of shipping channels in \nthe Great Lakes, and harm to the Florida Bay and Keys ecosystems. In \nMassachusetts, we've faced a dramatic rise in shell fish beds closures, \nwhich have put many of our fishermen out of work.\n  To tackle this problem, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000 \ntargets up $10 million annually to, ``assist coastal communities to \ncoordinate and implement approved coastal nonpoint pollution control \nstrategies and measures that reduce the causes and impacts of polluted \nrunoff on coastal waters and habitats.'' This is an important \namendment. For the first time, we have elevated the local management of \nrunoff as national priority within the context of the CZMA program. \nRunoff is not a state-by-state problem; the marine environment is far \ntoo dynamic. States share the same coastlines and border large bodies \nof waters, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay or the Long \nIsland Sound, so that pollutants from one state can detrimentally \naffect the quality of the marine environment in other states. We are \nseeing the effects of polluted runoff both in our coastal communities \nand on our nation's living marine resources and habitats. Mr. \nPresident, I'm pleased that we've included the runoff provision in the \nbill. It's an important step forward and I believe we will see the \nbenefits in our coastal environment and economy.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000, Mr. President, has been \nendorsed by the 35 coastal states and territories through the Coastal \nStates Organization. It also has the endorsement of the Great Lakes \nCommission, American Oceans Campaign, Coast Alliance, Center for Marine \nConservation, Sierra Club, Environmental Defense, California \nCoastKeeper and many other groups. It's a long list that makes clear \nthat this is a consensus proposal. We heard from all sides and did our \nbest to fine compromise, and I believe that we succeeded.\n  I also want to make a short statement on shark finning. H.R. 3417 \nwould prohibit the practice of shark finning. Sharks are among the most \nbiologically vulnerable species in the ocean. Their slow growth, late \nmaturity and small number of offspring leave them exceptionally \nvulnerable to overfishing and slow to recover from depletion. At the \nsame time, sharks, as top predators, are essential to maintaining the \nbalance of life in the sea. While many of our other highly migratory \nspecies such as tunas and swordfish are subject to rigorous management \nregimes, sharks have largely been overlooked until recently.\n  The bill bans the wasteful practice of removing a shark's fins and \nreturning the remainder of the shark to sea. National Marine Fisheries \nService regulations in the Atlantic Ocean prohibit the practice of \nshark finning, but a nationwide prohibition does not currently exist. \nShark fins comprise only a small percentage of the weight of the shark, \nand yet this is often the only portion of the shark retained. The \nMagnuson-Stevens Act and international commitments discourage \nunnecessary waste of fish, and thus I believe this bill ensures our \ndomestic regulations are consistent on this point. Another goal of the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act--the minimization of bycatch and bycatch \nmortality--is an issue that I have been particularly committed to over \nthe years. Because most of the sharks caught and finned are \nincidentally captured in fisheries targeting other species, I believe \nestablishing a domestic ban will help us further reduce this type of \nshark mortality.\n\n  The next step in this process is to act internationally. At present, \nforeign fleets transship or land approximately 180 metric tons of shark \nfins annually through ports in the Pacific alone. The global shark fin \ntrade involves at least 125 countries, and the demand for shark fins \nand other shark products has driven dramatic increases in shark fishing \nand shark mortality around the world. International measures are an \nabsolutely critical component of achieving effective shark \nconservation.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes a Western Pacific longline fisheries \ncooperative research program to provide information for shark stock \nassessments, identify fishing gear and practices that prevent or \nminimize incidental catch of sharks and ensure maximum survivorship of \nreleased sharks, and provide data on the international shark fin trade.\n  The United States is a global leader in fisheries conservation and \nmanagement. I believe this legislation provides us the opportunity to \nfurther this role, and take the first step in addressing an \ninternational fisheries management issue. In addition, I believe the \nU.S. should continue to lead efforts at the United Nations and \ninternational conventions to achieve coordinated international \nmanagement of sharks, including an international ban on shark-finning.\n  Mr. President, this package also includes a provision to ban the use \nof spotter aircraft in both the harpoon and general categories of the \nAtlantic bluefin tuna fishery. This has been an\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\nongoing issue in New England since 1996. Several of my Senate \ncolleagues, including Senators Snowe, Kennedy, Gregg, and Collins, have \nasked the agency to ban aircraft in the past. Unfortunately Mr. \nPresident, because aircraft do not catch fish, our legal system has \ndetermined that the agency cannot regulate these aircraft. Let me point \nout that the fisheries service has gone through two rounds of public \nrulemaking on this issue and in both instances an overwhelming number \nof public comments were in support of this ban. The Atlantic bluefin \ntuna fishery is one of the last open fisheries in New England, and \nspotter aircraft provide an unfair competitive advantage to those \nfishermen who use them. Banning spotter aircraft will level the playing \nfield and provide the opportunity for thousands of New Englanders to \nexperience the thrill of landing a 400 pound bluefin tuna that, \ndepending on the quality of the fish, can easily be worth $10,000.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 3417 also includes an authorization for the \nSecretary of Commerce to acquire fishery research vessels in 2002, \n2003, and 2004 at a cost of $60 million. These state-of-the-art fishery \nresearch vessels will replace a fleet of vessels that are becoming \ntechnologically obsolete and reaching the end of their useful lives. In \nNew England, the primary vessel used for our stock assessments is the \n38-year old Albatross IV. Over the years NOAA has assumed increased \nresponsibilities for managing our marine resources under the Magnuson-\nStevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act, the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act, and the Endangered Species Act. It is absolutely \nimperative that we give NOAA scientists the tools necessary to carry \nout the mandates Congress has given them.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely hope that the House will move to pass this \nlegislation. This is a very reasonable proposal. Indeed, it includes \nseveral proposals the House has initiated and passed. We have made \nevery effort to act on their priorities and we ask that they do the \nsame with our priorities.\n\n\n                 atlantic striped bass conservation act\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, on his efforts to reauthorize \nthe Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act in a package of oceans and \nfisheries legislation. I would also like to reaffirm the continued \ninterest of the Committee on Environment and Public Works in this \nimportant legislation, over which our two committees have traditionally \nshared jurisdiction. As my colleague knows, this legislation is \ncritically important to the northeast.\n  The populations of striped bass, which can be found all along the \neast coast, began to decline dramatically during the 1970s. In 1979, \nCongress responded by authorizing the Emergency Striped Bass Study as \npart of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act. And in 1984, Congress \nenacted the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. This Act promotes a \ncoordinated Federal-State partnership for striped bass management. The \nNational Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService have been jointly responsible for working with State agencies \nto recover the fishery. Their efforts have been very successful. The \ncommercial catch of striped bass peaked in 1998 at 19 million pounds, \nwhich is a dramatic increase from 1983 when the catch was 2.9 million \npounds.\n  Historically, both the Environment and Public Works Committee, which \nI chair, and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which \nis chaired by Senator McCain, have shared jurisdiction over the \nconservation of striped bass. Because both the Department of Commerce \nand the Department of the Interior are involved in the conservation of \nthe fishery, legislation to reauthorize the 1984 Atlantic Striped Bass \nConservation Act has always been of interest to both the Commerce \nCommittee and the Environment and Public Works Committee. The most \nrecent reauthorizing legislation, the Atlantic Striped Bass \nConservation Act Amendments of 1997, was sequentially referred, by \nunanimous consent, to the Environment and Public Works Committee after \nthe Commerce Committee ordered the bill to be reported. The Environment \nCommittee then amended and reported the bill. It was signed into law on \nDecember 16, 1997.\n  In order to facilitate passage of reauthorizing legislation this \nyear, I have agreed to the language being offered by Senator McCain in \nH.R. 3417, as amended, the Pribilof Islands Transition Act, and will \nnot request sequential referral. However, I want to reaffirm, with the \nagreement of my colleague, that this in no way affects the future \njurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee over the \nAtlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As the Senator from New Hampshire stated, the Commerce \nCommittee and the Environment and Public Works Committee have \nhistorically shared jurisdiction over the Atlantic Striped Bass \nConservation Act. Our two committees have in the past always worked \ntogether to reauthorize and amend the Atlantic Striped Bass \nConservation Act. I expect that relationship to continue.\n  In order to facilitate the passage of this year's Atlantic Striped \nBass reauthorization, Subtitle A of Title III of H.R. 3417, as amended, \nreauthorizes the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. Although the \nPribilof Islands Transition Act and the other provisions in this \nlegislation are under the sole jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, \nI understand that my colleague from New Hampshire has reviewed and \napproved the language contained in Title III; therefore, the shared \njurisdiction of the Commerce Committee and the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee over the conservation of Atlantic Striped bass should \nnot be altered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3417), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10555-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10555-S10556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION \n                                INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \ntroubling developments in the Middle East. Given what has happened in \nthe past several days, it is increasingly apparent that we are at a \ndangerous juncture in a critically important region of the world. The \nUnited States can and must stay engaged in the Middle East.\n  First and foremost, Mr. President, my heart goes out to the families \nof the seventeen sailors reported killed and the 36 injured in the \nexplosion yesterday on the U.S.S. Cole off the coast of Yemen. These \nbrave individuals lost their lives or suffered injury in defense of our \ncountry, our values, and our future. This explosion underscores the \ndanger that the men and women of our Armed Forces face every day, and \nour debt of gratitude for the duty they undertake.\n  All evidence strongly suggests that yesterday's explosion was a \nterrorist attack. Such an attack is senseless and cowardly, and those \nresponsible will be found and brought to justice. The world should know \nthat the President and the Congress stand united on this score.\n  We will not grant the perpetrators an ounce of satisfaction that they \nhave succeeded in altering the way the United States conducts business. \nWe will remain a force for stability. We will continue to press for a \nnegotiated peace in the Middle East. We will stand against insecurity \nand senseless violence in the Middle East and throughout the world. We \nowe that much to the brave sailors who were killed yesterday.\n  Recent days have also confronted us with a stream of horribly violent \nincidents in Israel and the territories. Unfortunately, efforts to end \nunrest have yet to succeed. Yesterday two Israeli soldiers were killed \nin a distressing scene of mob violence as protests gave way to deadly \nconfrontation. I deplore that violence, Mr. President, and I call on \nChairman Arafat to raise his voice in favor of peace.\n  I have followed with grave concern the violence that has gripped \nIsrael and the territories for more than two weeks. After years of \ninstability and violence, this region of the world--so riven with \nreligious and strategic interests--was experiencing relative calm. This \nstate of affairs was born out of an emerging consensus among all \nparties in the region that the future peace and security of Israel and \nthe territories could be decided only through negotiation. The outlines \nof and expectations for a lasting peace were beginning to take shape. A \nsuccessful conclusion to these negotiations seemed tantalizingly close \njust two short months ago when Israel made unprecedented compromises in \nthe name of peace.\n  In addition to the human toll exacted by the recent string of violent \nincidents, there has been another equally tragic casualty--at least in \nthe short term. The events of the past week or so have apparently \npunctured the hope for a quick peace settlement, putting at risk the \ngreat progress that had been made toward settling long-standing \nIsraeli-Palestinian differences. Moreover, the latest crisis in Israel \nand the territories also threatens wider regional conflict, as \nevidenced by the abduction of three Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah \nguerrillas operating out of Lebanon as well as Iraqi troop movements. \nThe stakes, Mr. President, are high and the time is short.\n\n[[Page S10584]]\n\n  If we are to return to the path of a peaceful settlement after the \nevents of the last two weeks, we must first end the violence. A \ncessation of hostilities can only be accomplished if all sides \ndemonstrate leadership by condemning the violence. I am sorely \ndisappointed in Arafat and the Palestinian Authority and in the fact \nthat they have allowed violence to be carried out without restraint or \ncomment.\n  Preferring instead to blame the violence on what he terms Israeli \nprovocations, Arafat has refused to publicly and unequivocally call for \nan end to violent protests and confrontations. Palestinian police have \nfailed to control mob violence. And efforts at re-establishing \nnegotiations have been rebuffed. The result is despicable violence that \nhas cost far too many innocent lives.\n  Rather than being unable to control the violence--as Chairman Arafat \nclaims--his silence leaves the impression that he condones it. The on-\nagain off-again cooperation with Israeli security forces suggests that \nArafat prefers using violence and the threat of wider war as a \nnegotiating tool. Such tactics are cynical, dangerous and stand in \nstark contrast to the Oslo process that brought the region to brink of \na comprehensive peace just two short months ago.\n  Meanwhile Prime Minister Barak has remained committed to negotiations \nand the Oslo Process. He took great risks at Camp David in July. He \noffered remarkable concessions on issues that go to the very core of \nhis country's history and identity--compromises that no one had \nconsidered possible before President Clinton convened the Camp David \ntalks.\n  Despite subsequent violence provocations, Barak has repeated his \ninterest in restoring calm, ending the violence and returning to the \nnegotiating table. When he was approached by President Clinton to join \nan emergency summit, he readily stated his interest and willingness in \nparticipating.\n  And unlike Arafat, Barak has clearly denounced violence. He implored \nIsraelis not to participate in the violence when he said, ``I urge our \nJewish citizens to refrain from attacking Arabs and their property \nunder any circumstances.''\n  Time is short in the Middle East, Mr. President. The risk of a wider \nregional conflict is very real. The first step toward assuring that the \nsituation improves is a strong public statement from Chairman Arafat \ncalling for an end to the violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10584-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR CONNIE MACK\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend and \nan outstanding public servant who is retiring from the United States \nSenate this year after 18 years in public service, Senator Connie Mack \nof Florida.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with Senator Mack in both houses \nof Congress. And I know him as a man deeply committed to the finest \nideals of public service, as well as the beliefs he so passionately \nholds.\n  Perhaps no one believes more fervently in the inherent potential of \neach and every individual than Senator Mack. For him, it is not \ngovernment that creates wealth or success or personal fulfillment. It \nis the American people. To give people opportunity--to give them the \nskills they need to compete and reach their greatest potential--is for \nSenator Mack perhaps the greatest end that government can serve.\n  I have also known Senator Mack as a staunch proponent of fiscal \nresponsibility, back to the days when it often seemed that talk of \nbalanced budgets was only slightly more fashionable than actually \nbalancing the budget. I have to believe he must share my sense of \nwonder as to how far we've come, and it is thanks in no small part to \nthe efforts of Senator Mack and those like him who have fought for \nyears to make the current surpluses a reality.\n  Senator Mack has been a strong voice for the Sunshine State in the \nUnited States Senate. Most recently, his tireless efforts in helping to \nshepherd through the Senate the historic Everglades restoration plan, \nthe Restoring the Everglades, an American Legacy Act, leaves a positive \nand lasting mark on Florida and one of our nation's true natural \ntreasures that will be appreciated for generations to come.\n  One could argue, however, that Senator Mack has pursued no other goal \nwith a higher degree of dogged determination than increasing our \nfederal investment in medical research. He rightly sees this issue as a \nmatter of national importance, knowing no political, social, financial, \nor racial boundaries.\n  He recognizes that disease touches every American family. Certainly, \nit has had a profound impact on his own family, including his wife, \ndaughter, brother, and both parents--as well as affecting his own life.\n  Characteristically, Senator Mack and his wife, Priscilla, who is a \ncourageous breast cancer survivor, met these challenges first with \ncourage and dignity, and then with an unyielding determination to do \nsomething about them.\n  Both have been extremely active in spreading the word on the \nimportance of early detection. As co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate \nCancer Coalition, Senator Mack has provided outstanding leadership on \nmatters relating to our fight against cancer, and in particular I have \nbeen honored to work with Senator Mack on providing greater funding for \nbreast cancer research.\n  The depth of Senator Mack's concern when it comes to this dread \ndisease cannot truly be measured. Certainly, having worked on this \nissue throughout my tenure in Congress, I was honored and thankful for \nSenator Mack's participation in a breast cancer hearing, or ``breast \ncancer summit'', we convened in 1996, but I was not surprised that he \nwould be there to contribute his wisdom and his support.\n  From that summit came legislation to establish a national data bank \nof information on clinical trials involving experimental treatments for \nserious or life-threatening diseases. It also mandated that a toll-free \nnumber be instituted for patients, doctors and others to access this \ninformation.\n  Senator Mack has literally been instrumental in securing increased \nfunding for medical research in general, and indeed for the fiscal year \n2000 fought for the inclusion of a $2.3 billion increase for the \nNational Institutes of Health. And he has rightfully called for funding \nto NIH to be doubled from $12.75 billion to over $25 billion over the \nnext five years.\n  Finally, Mr. President, to quote a piece from the St. Petersburg \nTimes from last year, ``the Senate will lose one of its nicest \nmembers.'' And that is absolutely true. Senator Mack has strongly held \nbeliefs on the issues, let there be no doubt.\n  But he has always understood the fine but certain distinction between \ndisagreeing and being disagreeable. He has been a credit to the Senate, \nto Florida, to the nation, and to his family. I wish him well as he \nreturns to his beloved state and embarks on a new chapter in his life--\none that I hope will be filled with happiness and good health for him \nand his wife, Priscilla. He will be missed by all those fortunate \nenough to have worked with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10584-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10584-S10585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONSIDERATION OF IMMIGRATION MATTERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would like to commend Senator Reed for allowing us to \nproceed on several important immigration matters even though the \nRepublican majority has refused to act on his compelling legislation to \ndo justice for Liberians. Senator Reed has been a persistent advocate \nfor the Liberian nationals who have fled the strife in their nation for \nthe United States. He has recognized that the U.S. has a special \nrelationship with Liberia's citizens and has sought to respect and \nenhance that relationship. But his efforts have been resisted by the \nmajority, which has consistently denied his requests to take up his \nbipartisan bill, which would allow Liberians who fled here and meet \ncertain criteria to become legal permanent residents of the United \nStates. I hope that we will change course and address this issue before \nwe adjourn. I commend the Administration for its commitment to insist \non action.\n  Meanwhile, I am pleased that we were able to pass H.R. 2883, a bill \nthat will confer automatic citizenship upon foreign-born children who \nare adopted by the American parents. Given the severe curtailment of \nnoncitizens' rights under the immigration laws we passed in 1996, it is \nall the more important to\n\n[[Page S10585]]\n\nextend this right to American parents and their adopted children. \nEveryone in the Senate supports adoption, and we should make sure the \nlaw expresses that support.\n  Many Senators on both sides of the aisle worked hard to see this bill \nbecome law, and I would like in particular to commend Senator Landrieu \nfor her efforts. She and her staff were dedicated to this bill and were \ninstrumental in its passage.\n  I hope that we are able today to move forward on a number of pieces \nof legislation. First, I hope we can pass the bill that extends the \nprogram under which religious workers can obtain visas to enter the \nU.S. Senator Kennedy has championed this legislation, it has \nsignificant bipartisan support, and there is no reason not to act \nquickly to pass it. We should also pass the bill benefiting Syrian Jews \nthat Senator Schumer has advocated, as well as legislation benefiting \nthe Hmong people, which the late Congressman Bruce Vento did so much to \npromote. Although many of the larger immigration issues that should \nhave been addressed in this Congress--from reforming expedited removal \nto restoring due process rights for legal permanent residents--may \nregrettably remain unresolved, we can at least take these more limited \nsteps and demonstrate some commitment to immigrants and a sound \nimmigration policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10585-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my vote against \nthe Boxer amendment No. 4308 to the FY01 VA/HUD Appropriations bill.\n  This amendment addressed two issues which are very important to \nMichiganians: clean air and clean water. Unfortunately, whatever the \nintentions of the author, the amendment would have done more harm than \ngood. I particular, I was troubled by the attempt to strike language \nwhich will prevent the EPA from designating Michigan counties as being \nin nonattainment, or not meeting clear air requirements.\n  On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit, in American Trucking Association v USEPA, ruled \nthat the 8-hour ozone standard as proposed by EPA be remanded to EPA \nfor further consideration. The 8-hour standard was therefore suspended. \nThe court specifically noted that USEPA retains the power to designate \nareas as nonattainment under a revised national Ambient Air Quality \nStandard (NAAQS), however, there must be a legal standard in place \nbefore USEPA makes such designations. Since the 8-hour standard was \nremanded, it is not legal NAAQS.\n  In response, EPA announced its intention to reinstate applicability \nof the one-hour ozone standard. However, in determining which \ncommunities were in nonattainment under the one-hour standard, EPA \nintended to make air quality designations based on the designations of \nthese areas at the time the 1-hour standard was originally revoked, \nrather than rely on the most recent air quality data.\n  Under this proposed action, six Michigan counties would have been in \nnonattainment even though all six have monitoring data measuring \nattainment--Midland, Bay, Saginaw, Genesee, Muskegon, and Allegan. \nThese are counties that were previously designated as nonattainment of \nthe 1-hour standard. Although they were previously designated as \nnonattainment, only Muskegon was ``classified'' under the \nclassification scheme of the Clean Air Act. Thus, only Muskegon County \nwas subject to the major ozone control programs, but all nonattainment \ncounties are subject to tougher permit and offset requirements.\n  Even though these counties are now in attainment, tougher permit \nstandards would have been required for new major stationary sources \njust because these counties were previously designated as nonattainment \nfor the 1-hour standard. Additionally, offset requirements for major \nstationary sources would have applied. In addition, these six counties \nwould have had to resume doing transportation and general conformity \nfor projects receiving federal funds. Under the revocation, conformity \nwas not a requirement. Conformity was a continuing requirement for \nredesignated areas.\n  Shortly after the announcement, I made clear to USEPA that in my \nopinion there was no rational basis for intentionally jeopardizing \neconomic development and the construction of much-needed road projects \nin areas that are meeting attainment levels for the 1-hour ozone \nstandard. Further, I noted that EPA should not disregard air quality \nimprovements made in several areas of the state and should base any \nnon-attainment designations under this rulemaking on the most current \nair quality monitoring data available.\n  To date, I have not been satisfied with the response from USEPA and \nfor that reason, I supported the language included in the FY01 VA/HUD \nAppropriations bill. This language will prevent EPA from designating \nany Michigan county as nonattainment for the next 12 months or until \nthe courts have settled the pending matter, whichever happens first. In \nfact, I understand that EPA actually agreed to this language in a \ncompromise with the house.\n  It was unfortunate that the Boxer amendment also sought to permit EPA \nto move forward on a new arsenic standard. This is an issue which I \nbelieve merits independent consideration. I understand the arsenic \nstandard has not been updated in almost 60 years. However, I am \nconcerned that the push to lower the standard to 5ppb from the current \n50ppb may be too extreme. While large water systems may be able to \ncomply with such a strict requirement, I am not at all certain that \nsmaller systems which serve a great percentage of the Michigan \npopulation would be able to comply with that standard. They would \ntherefore be subject to penalties for their inability to comply with \nyet another unfunded mandate. In any event, I look forward to the \nopportunity to consider this issue on its own merit, and urge the EPA \nto base whatever standard it eventually proposes on sound science and \neven then only after extensive peer review.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10585-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10585-S10586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL HISPANIC MONTH\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join many \nof my colleagues in commemorating National Hispanic Heritage Month. The \nnationwide celebration of Hispanic heritage was initiated by the 90th \nCongress in 1968, which designated National Hispanic Heritage Week. \nTwenty years later, the 100th Congress transformed this week into a \nmonth, designating the period of September 15 to October 15 as a time \nto recognize the Hispanic influence in and contributions to our culture \nand society.\n  For over 400 years, Hispanic Americans have played a fundamental role \nin the history of the United States. The first European expedition in \nrecorded history to land in what is today the continental United States \nwas led by the former Spanish Governor of the Island of Puerto Rico, \nJuan Ponce de Leon.\n  America's diverse and vibrant Hispanic population has made an \nenormous contributions to the building and strengthening of our nation, \nits culture, and its economic prowess. As we cross the threshold of a \nnew century, we look to the outstanding contributions of Hispanic \nAmericans for inspiration and leadership. My hometown, Detroit, was \nmade great in the twentieth century in part by immigrants who went \nthere to find work and provide for their families. This great dream \nlives on today as thousands of immigrants come to Detroit every year \nfrom countries like Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Cuba. In fact, \nSouthwest Detroit, known as Mexicantown by its residents, is the \nfastest growing part of Detroit. Hispanics who have come to Detroit \nhave opened businesses, bought homes and turned a once neglected urban \nneighborhood into a thriving community that has become one of the \ncenters of the city.\n  One woman, Maria Elena Rodriguez, has had a lot to do with this \nturnaround. Her hard work as president of the Mexicantown Community \nDevelopment Corporation has helped to provide the spark needed to \nreinvigorate a community. Ms. Rodriguez is currently in the process of \nhelping to build a welcome center for people coming into Detroit across \nthe Ambassador Bridge, an effort she hopes will fulfil her mission to \nbring more business and visitors to her neighborhood.\n\n[[Page S10586]]\n\n  Hispanic contributions to Michigan businesses abound. The Kellogg \nCompany, founded and headquartered in Battle Creek, Michigan, has \nmillions of customers in over 160 countries, and is the world's leading \nproducer of cereal. Its CEO is Carlos Gutierrez, who started with \nKellogg's as a sales representative in Mexico City, and after 25 years \nwith the company is now in charge of this global giant.\n  Education has long played a prominent role in Hispanic culture. The \nfirst free integrated public school was established in St. Augustine, \nFlorida in September of 1787. On March 31, 2000 Rebecca Arenas was \nawarded the ``Caesar Chavez Civil Rights Achievement Award'' for her \nwork to better the lives of Hispanics in general, and migrant workers \nin particular. Rebecca's parents brought her to Michigan at the age of \n5 from Crystal City, Texas. Her parents were migrant workers who chose \nto stay in Michigan because they believed it would allow Rebecca to \nhave a better education. Because of the actions of her parents, Rebecca \ndeveloped a commitment to education that would last a lifetime. Rebecca \npassed this commitment to education onto her children, all seven of \nwhom have received a post-secondary education. In addition to the \n``Caesar Chavez'' award, Rebecca has received recognition on numerous \nother occasions because of her work in education, health care, and \nvoter registration.\n  For these and countless others reasons, it is a pleasure for me to \nstand today with my Senate colleagues in commemorating National \nHispanic Heritage Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10586-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, over the last few years, high profile \nschool shootings across this country have left teachers, parents, and \nstudents scared and confused. In response, the FBI has conducted an \nexhaustive study on school shootings in an effort to assess, intervene \nand prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future. The report, \nentitled, ``School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective,'' \nrecommends specific steps for school officials to take to prevent youth \nviolence. The report notes that in the vast majority of cases, kids do \nnot turn violent overnight. Instead, those who become violent tend to \nexhibit increasingly disturbing patterns of behavior as their \nfascination with violence builds. By learning to recognize these \nbehavioral signs, teachers and students can be prepared to investigate \nand intervene before potentially violent situations get out of control.\n  The FBI report goes on to suggest specific measures schools can take \nto head off potential shootings. The report recommends that students \nand faculty should be trained to recognize certain warning signs that \nstudents may be considering committing violent acts; groups of faculty \nand students should be established to encourage students not to keep \nsilent when they recognize potential threats; programs should be \ndeveloped to teach parents to recognize behavior that may indicate that \ntheir children are prone to acts of violence. In addition to these \npreventive measures, the FBI recommends that schools establish \nspecially trained Threat Assessment Teams to handle evaluating and \nresponding to threats if and when they arise.\n  The FBI warns teachers, parents, and students that they should not \nignore any threat of violence. We in Congress should follow the same \nadvice. Yet, while parents and school officials are pursuing more \nvigorous responses to potential violence, we in Congress seem to be \nless responsive to such danger. Over the last few years, many of us in \nCongress have continually tried to close the loopholes in our laws that \npermit school children to gain access to firearms. Unfortunately, our \nefforts have been stymied by the leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives. In a few weeks, this session of Congress will come to \nan end. Before we adjourn, let's do our part and reduce the threat of \ngun violence in our schools and communities.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10586-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10586-S10587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE COUNTERTEROURISM ACT OF 2000\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my good \nfriend Senator Jon Kyl in sponsoring S. 3205, the Counterterrorism Act \nof 2000. This bill, introduced last night, seeks to improve our ability \nto prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.\n  In light of the events yesterday in the Middle East, there can be no \ndoubt of the need for this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to act \nquickly to pass this important bill.\n  All the evidence now indicates that the cowardly and reprehensible \nattack on the U.S. Navy destroyer U.S.S. Cole yesterday in Aden was a \nterrorist suicide attack. It appears that the bombers had infiltrated \nthe port's harbor operations and carefully planned the operation. It is \nfortunate that the explosion did not set off Tomahawk cruise missiles \nor other ordnance on board, causing even more devastation.\n  If found to be a terrorist incident, the attack on the U.S.S. Cole \nwould be the worst against the U.S. military since the bombing of an \nAir Force barracks in Saudi Arabia killed 19 airmen in 1996. It would \nalso be the worst attack on a Navy ship since an Iraqi missile struck \nan American guided-missile frigate in 1987, killing 37 sailors.\n  My heart goes out to the families of the American sailors who were \nkilled or injured or who are still missing. Their tragedy underlines \nthe constant danger faced by our armed forces around the world and the \nneed for this country to remain vigilant in protecting them from \nterrorist and other attacks.\n  The attack on the U.S.S. Cole was no isolated incident. In fact, just \ntoday, a bomb was hurled at the British embassy in Yemen, causing a \nmassive explosion.\n  I believe that we need to take strong action to combat terrorism. \nThere is no question that terrorist attacks will continue and that they \nwill become more deadly. Terrorists today often act out of a visceral \nhatred of the U.S. or the West and seek to wreak maximum destruction \nand kill as many people as possible.\n  At the same time, I believe that our counterterrorism policy must be \nconducted in a way that remains consistent with our democratic values \nand our commitment to an open, free society.\n  To help avert attacks such as those on the U.S.S. Cole, Senator Kyl \nand I have introduced S. 3205. This legislation implements major \nrecommendations from a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission on terrorism.\n\n[[Page S10587]]\n\n  Specifically, the bill aims to review legal authority for responding \nto catastrophic terrorist attacks and increase long-term research and \ndevelopment to counter such attacks, improve controls on biological \npathogens and equipment that could be used in a terrorist assault, \ndiscourage terrorist fundraising, improve the sharing of information \nabout terrorists, keep Syria and Iran on the list of countries that \nsponsor terrorism, and fully reimburse counterintelligence personnel \nfor insurance they purchase to protect themselves from professional \nliability.\n  In many ways, the Kyl-Feinstein Counterterrorism Act of 2000 is a \ncounterpart bill to the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act that just \npassed the Senate 95 to 0. That legislation, of which I was a chief \ncosponsor, will make it easier for American victims of terrorism abroad \nto collect court-awarded compensation and to ensure that the \nresponsible state sponsors of terrorism pay a price for their crimes. \nThe act also contained an amendment I authored with Senator Patrick \nLeahy that will provide faster and better assistance to victims of \nterrorism abroad. This legislation, which has passed the House as well, \nwill now go the desk of President Clinton, who will sign it.\n  While I strongly support assisting terrorist victims, I also believe \nthat we need to do more to prevent Americans from becoming victims of \nterrorism in the first place. And I believe that we should act now--\nbefore terrorists strike again, killing and injuring more Americans and \nleaving more families grieving. I urge Congress to act pass S. 3205 \nbefore we adjourn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10587-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRESS MUST ADDRESS INEQUITIES SUFFERED BY FEDERAL RETIREES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Congress and \nthe President on the recent enactment of S. 2420, the bill to provide \nlong-term healthcare insurance for federal employees. As the nation's \nlargest employer, we have set an example for the private sector in \nestablishing a long-term care insurance program for federal workers and \nretirees. At least thirteen million people are expected to benefit from \nthis far-sighted effort, but there is more work to be done on those \nissues affecting current and former Federal employees. Today, I wish to \nhighlight three proposals on which I have received much correspondence \nfrom my constituents: repeal of the Government Pension Offset, GPO, \nelimination of the Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision, WEP; \nand, health insurance premium conversion availability.\n  I am a cosponsor of S. 717, Senator Mikulski's proposal to reform the \nGPO. Additionally, I am a supporter of initiatives in the House of \nRepresentatives to eliminate the WEP. Both pieces of legislation \nalleviate current laws that block Federal annuitants and their spouses \nfrom collecting full Social Security benefits. Because of the current \nbudget rules requiring the offsetting of spending cuts or tax \nincreases, passage of these reforms have been complicated.\n  We should not penalize people who have worked hard and contributed to \nthe country simply because they worked for the Federal government and \nreceive a Federal pension. This Senate must consider these bills a \npriority, and seriously review the offsets necessary to achieve these \nessential and fair changes. I believe that we need to enforce a budget \ndiscipline which will balance the budget without borrowing payroll tax \ndollars from the Social Security trust fund and any other federal trust \nfunds. However, now that the budget is balanced, we should first \nrestore the change that helped bring us toward fiscal soundness.\n  Finally, I wish to address the availability of health insurance \npremium conversion arrangements. As my colleagues may be aware, no \nSenate legislation has been introduced, but H.R. 4277 has been \nintroduced in the House. Under the provisions of this bill, the Office \nof Personnel Management, OPM, would be directed to take necessary \nmeasures to ensure that enrollees have the option to paying charges out \nof pre-tax earnings. This would ensure equal premium tax treatment for \nfederal workers and retirees. I urge my House and Senate colleagues to \nprovide full consideration to this legislation, and bring Federal \nemployees and retirees pay and benefit equity and fairness.\n  Mr. President, these are just three issues of concern to me and my \nconstituents. While enactment of the long-term care bill was a great \nstep forward, I must reiterate my call for more work to be done. I am \nhopeful that we may make a serious effort on this legislation on the \nfew remaining days of the 106th Congress. These concerns will not go \naway, and I know we will surely be hearing about the GPO, WEP, and \npremium conversion in the next Congress is we do not take action this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10587-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10587-S10588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                225TH BIRTHDAY OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncommemorating the 225th birthday to the United States Navy, by passing \nSenate Resolution 373. Several of the Senate's other veterans of naval \nservice have joined me in sponsoring this resolution and I thank \nSenator McCain, Senator Moynihan, Senator Warner, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Robb, Senator Bob Smith, Senator Miller, Senator Bob Kerrey and \nSenator John Kerry.\n  While we like to celebrate on a birthday, we must pause in solemn \nreflection, for yesterday, the Navy family suffered a tragic loss. I \nsend my heartfelt condolences to the U.S.S. Cole and her extended \nfamily. Like thousands of Sailors before them, these brave men and \nwomen have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country. The \nloss is felt by the entire nation, and the entire nation grieves with \nyou and expresses gratitude for your sacrifice.\n  October 13, 1775, was the day that the Continental Congress \nestablished a ``Naval Committee'' to acquire and fit out vessels for \nsea and draw up regulations. By the following month the committee \nprocured two ships, two brigs and later two sloops and two schooners. \nFrom these modest beginnings, the greatest Navy in the world has grown. \nDown through the years, the Navy has been central to the history of \nthis nation, and ever-integral to her longevity and prosperity.\n  Mr. President, I had the honor of serving in the Navy. Perhaps my \ngreatest honor during my service as a young naval intelligence officer \nwas working for Admiral Arleigh ``31-Knot'' Burke, when he was Chief of \nNaval Operations. A heroic WWII destroyer squadron commander, Admiral \nBurke was truly a man of vision. Under his tutelage I learned valuable \nlessons about the Navy's place in our history, but also about the key \nrole it plays today in economics, science, politics, and international \nrelations. Then as now, the world was an uncertain place, and the Navy \nplayed a vital role in calming the waters.\n  Admiral Burke is the namesake for the class of destroyers to which \nthe U.S.S. Cole belongs. The Cole tragedy brings the spotlight on the \nNavy and the day-in, day-out honor, courage and commitment of her \nsailors. At the commissioning of the lead ship in the class, Admiral \nBurke stated fittingly ``This ship is built to fight, you had better \nknow how.'' A quote reminiscent of Captain John Paul Jones legendary \ndeclaration: ``I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not \nsail fast, for I intend to go in harm's way.'' These are the best ships \nin the world, manned by the world's best Sailors, but they are not \nimpregnable fortresses, they do sail in harm's way.\n  Many have expressed incredulity at the attack on the warship Cole. \nBut, she was in a vulnerable situation--coming pierside to replenish \nfuel in a presumed-benign environment. The task that was to occupy Cole \nand her crew over the next several months--maritime interdiction duty \nin the Persian Gulf--was more precarious. Ships refuel in foreign ports \ndaily as they have for many years. But this tragedy is a reminder that \nthe peace and prosperity we enjoy is not without cost, nor are the \ncommitments we make to our allies.\n  The U.S.S. Cole is one of the Navy's finest warships--one of 318 \noperational ships. 4108 Navy aircraft are also operational today. 42 \npercent of those ships are away from homeport and 32 percent, like the \nCole and the U.S.S. George Washington Battlegroup, of which she was a \nmember, are deployed. These numbers provide a snapshot of\n\n[[Page S10588]]\n\nthe Navy's diligence around the globe. Their involvement in contingency \noperations over the last 10 years is also very telling. From 1946 to \n1989 (44 years) the U.S. Navy responded to 195 crises, while from 1990 \nto 1999 (10 years) the Navy responded to 122 crises. Such optempos \ndemand much of the men and women in uniform, and their loved ones back \nhome. It also places tremendous stress on our ships and aircraft. While \ndeployed battlegroups have maintained their readiness, they often do so \nat the expense of non-deployed units. In my view, we must maintain our \ncommitment to support the fleet and ensure they continue to be the best \nequipped in the world. We have a distinct responsibility to our Navy, \nnot to blindly increase ship production in response to rampant \ndeployment rates, but to ensure we are ready to face clearly defined \nmissions and threats.\n  Today, as in the future, America relies on its Navy. For 225 years, \nthe Navy has responded to each new demand and comes through in the \nclutch. Ever-present, around the globe, minutes away from crises as \nthey occur, today's Navy is deterring would-be aggressors; and \nproviding fledgling democracies with visible reassurance of U.S. \nsupport. Daily, Navy men and women are our ambassadors in ports of call \nand as participants in multi-national operations and exercises. As one \nof the eleven members of this Senate to have worn the Navy uniform, I \nam pleased to share my pride in our sea service with all who have worn \nNavy blue down through the years. I also send greetings to the 373,910 \nmen and women on active duty today, the 182,970 ready reservists, and \nthe extended Navy family of civilian personnel, families and loved \nones.\n  As we celebrate this 225th birthday, I close solemnly, and offer the \nfirst verse of the Navy Hymn in memory of those who have most recently \nperished in service to their Navy and their country:\n\n     Eternal Father, Strong to save,\n     Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,\n     Who bid'st the mighty Ocean deep\n     Its own appointed limits keep;\n     O hear us when we cry to thee,\n     for those in peril on the sea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10588-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MONSIGNOR BOLDUC\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Reverend Monsignor Norman P. Bolduc, 48, Chancellor of the \nDiocese of Manchester, as New Hampshire mourns his tragic loss.\n  Monsignor Bolduc was ordained a priest in April 1979 after entering \nhis religious training at Saint Thomas Seminary in Connecticut at the \ntender age of 13. As a Lieutenant Colonel, Monsignor Bolduc served as a \nChaplain of the United States Air Force Reserves. He earned a master's \nin philosophy at the Catholic University of America in Washington, \nD.C., where he also earned his licentiate in Canon law.\n  Upon the recommendation of Bishop Odore Gendron, the seventh Bishop \nof Manchester, Pope John Paul II appointed Reverend Norman Bolduc as a \nChaplain to His Holiness with the title of Monsignor in 1991. As \nChancellor, Monsignor Bolduc was the third-ranking official in the \ndiocese. He served as the bishop's Secretary for Pastoral Services and \nrepresented the bishop in Concord, New Hampshire, speaking on \nlegislative matters. Reverend Edward Arsenault, Secretary for \nAdministration of the diocese, noted Monsignor Bolduc's keen intellect \nand his ``great ability to explain and teach the church's teaching. He \nwas a noted and gifted homilist.''\n  Monsignor Bolduc was a talented baseball player, an avid golfer and \nhad a passion for travel, often traveling to foreign lands. Many New \nHampshire residents were fortunate to share his love of travel and \naccompanied him on pilgrimages to the Holy Land. Monsignor Bolduc was \nthe eldest of seven children. He was the loving son of Norman Sr. and \nCecile Bolduc of Laconia, New Hampshire. Monsignor Bolduc was a caring \nbrother and devoted uncle to his eleven nieces and nephews. He enjoyed \nhis family life and cherished the time he spent with all of them.\n  As Bishop John B. McCormack remembered his faithful and devoted \ncolleague during the Funeral Mass celebrated at Saint Joseph's \nCathedral he reminded us all that, ``It is clear that God does give, \nbut God also takes away. It is clear whether we live or die, we are all \nthe Lord's.'' Monsignor Bolduc honorably served our nation and the \nRoman Catholic Church and will be greatly missed by all those who were \nblessed by his presence and ministry. As Holy Scripture says in Psalm \n116, ``Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of the faithful \nones.'' May God bless Norman Sr., Cecile and Monsignor Boduc's \nsiblings, nieces and nephews as they mourn the loss of their loved one.\n  I am honored to have served the Reverend Monsignor Norman Bolduc in \nthe United States Senate. May God bless him and grant him eternal \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10588-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10588-S10589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DONALD L. BEMIS JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL NAMED BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL FOR 1999-\n                                  2000\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States \nDepartment of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In \neach year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the \ncountry which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and \nteacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon \nSchools are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation \nhas to offer. They are the schools that set the standard for which \nothers strive. I am very proud to report that nine of the 198 Blue \nRibbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are \nlocated in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Donald \nL. Bemis Junior High School in Sterling Heights, Michigan, one of these \nnine schools.\n  The mission of Donald L. Bemis Junior High is to educate its students \nin the development of knowledge, problem solving, and acceptance of \nothers. Curriculum places primary emphasis on basic skills to promote \nessential knowledge and challenge students to achieve at the highest \nlevels they are capable of attaining. Students are taught tolerance as \nconflict resolution strategies have been integrated into this \ncurriculum. In addition, character building is taught and modeled \nwithin the school climate. The whole of this curriculum is designed to \nprovide students with the building blocks they need to construct \npositive ideals which they can carry with them for the rest of their \nlives.\n  Technology has recently begun to play a large role in the program as \nwell. Each classroom at Bemis is equipped with a television and VCR, \nallowing students to be a part of a worldwide telecommunications system \nand providing teachers with audio-visual communication throughout the \nentire school. There are at least two computers in each classroom, \nwhich are hooked up to two building servers as well as the Internet. \nBemis also has three computer laboratories, from which teachers and \nstudents can easily access personal files which have been set up for \nthem. There is no doubt that technology is revolutionizing the way that \nstudents are taught throughout our Nation. There is also no doubt that \nBemis Junior High has been on the forefront of employing it for \npositive purposes.\n  Perhaps the greatest key to the success of Bemis Junior High though \nhas been the collaborative decision making process which has been \ndeveloped by parents, teachers and students. This process involved an \noverall dedication to the Bemis Junior High community, and relies upon \nkeeping lines of communication open through parental contacts, open \nhouses, parent-teacher conferences, the Parent Sounding Board, and the \nStudent Council. Also present and a part of this process is the School \nImprovement Team, made up of staff and students focusing upon issues to \nenhance student achievement. All of these efforts lead to a well \ninformed school community, which has been the most important aspect in \nthe development of Bemis Junior High.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the students, parents, faculty and \nadministration of Bemis Junior High, for I believe this is an award \nwhich speaks more to the effort of a united community than it does to \nthe work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like \nto recognize Mrs. Joyce A. Spade, Principal of Bemis Junior High, whose \ndedication to making her school one of\n\n[[Page S10589]]\n\nthe finest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this \ncommunity. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate \nDonald L. Bemis Junior High School on being named a Blue Ribbon School \nfor 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10589-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ADLAI E. STEVENSON HIGH SCHOOL NAMED 1999-2000 BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States \nDepartment of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In \neach year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the \ncountry which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and \nteacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon \nSchools are recognized because they are the finest public and private \nsecondary schools our Nation has to offer. They are the schools that \nset the standard for which others strive. I am very proud to report \nthat nine of the 198 blue Ribbon Schools names by Secretary Richard W. \nRiley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise \ntoday to recognize Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Sterling Heights, \nMichigan, one of these nine schools.\n  The mission of Stevenson High School is to provide every student with \na positive learning environment, which will allow them to feel a part \nof a school community while at the same time achieving their greatest \npotential as responsible and contributing members of society. This \nmission is reflected in Stevenson's motto, ``School of Champions,'' \nsymbolizing the importance that the faculty and administration place on \ndeveloping champions in all aspects of life. Students are treated with \ndignity and with respect, as faculty view this as the most effective \nmethod to help them achieve excellence in school and in life of which \nthey are capable.\n  Indeed, the commitment of the faculty and administration towards \nmaking their school achieve to the highest level has been the most \nimportant key in it actually achieving at this level. 85 percent of the \n94 professional staff members hold masters, specialist or doctorate \ndegrees. All staff serve on one of four target-goal committees, which \nis only one example among many of how the faculty and administration \nwork cooperatively to facilitate both teaching and learning. They also \ntake an active role in curriculum development, from researching new \ntextbooks and other classroom materials to serving on curriculum \ncommittees at the district level. The faculty and administration \nrecently witnessed the success of their efforts, as Stevenson High \nSchool recently completed its five-year journey to achieve North \nCentral Outcome-Based Accreditation.\n  The administration at Stevenson High School has also made a concerted \neffort to ensure that their school is as safe as possible. There is \nzero tolerance regarding weapons, violence, threats of violence and the \nuse of alcohol or other drugs. A building security plan is in place and \npracticed on a regular basis, and an evacuation plan is in place to \nsafeguard students and staff in an emergency or crisis. In addition, a \nsupport network has been established at Stevenson High School so \neffective that students trust the administration and faculty enough to \nforewarn them of potential problems. This is due to the success of \nstudent organizations such as the Students Offering Services Club, the \nRenaissance Club, the Cultural Diversity Council and the Peer Mediation \nProgram. Because of these support groups, students feel connected to \nthe school and to each other, and know that they are valued as \nindividuals.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the students, parents, faculty and \nadministration of Stevenson High School, for I believe this is an award \nwhich speaks more to the effort of a united community that it does to \nthe work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like \nto recognize Mr. Donald R. Nawrocki, the Principal of Stevenson High \nSchool, whose dedication to making his school one of the finest in our \nNation has been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of \nthe entire United States Senate, I congratulate Adlai E. Stevenson High \nSchool on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the \nschool continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10589-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10589-S10590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:00 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 4392) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2001 for \nintelligence and intelligence-related activities of the United States \nGovernment, the Community Management Account, and the Central \nIntelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System, and for other \npurposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the \namendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3292) to provide for the \nestablishment of the Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge in West \nFeliciana Parish, Louisiana.\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  The message further announced that the Speaker has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to provide additional protections to victims of rape; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               the victims of rape health protection act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Victims of \nRape Health Protection Act. This legislation would facilitate health \ntreatment of rape victims by empowering victims with the ability to \ndetermine at an early date whether or not their attacker carried the \nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS.\n  Mr. President, in addition to a rape survivor being forced to live \nwith the horrific elements commonly associated with the act of rape, \nrape victims simultaneously are threatened by yet another cruel \naggressor, the HIV disease. Current medical technology is limited in \nits ability to detect HIV in the body during the initial stages of \ninfection; as such, if the victim must rely on self-testing alone, the \npresence of HIV may not be evident for months.\n  Reports from both the American Medical Association and a study \npublished in the April, 1997, New England Journal of Medicine outline \nthe merits of early action in the fight against HIV. As immediate and \nintensive administration anti-HIV drugs has been shown to greatly \nreduce the risk of HIV infection, early knowledge of whether or not a \nvictim has been exposed to the virus is imperative to embarking on \ncritical, potentially life-saving courses of medication.\n  Mr. President, ten years ago Congress passed a law that allowed rape \nvictims to compel testing of their attacker upon conviction. Over the \nyears medical science has made important advancements in the fight \nagainst AIDS, and it is time for the law to follow suit. Today, I wish \nto challenge the current inadequate policies which exist in some \nstates, and allow victims of rape early access to their assailants' HIV \nscreen results.\n  Where there is any risk of transmission of the virus, this \nlegislation would require states to actively screen rape defendants for \nHIV and disclose the results to the victim within forty-eight hours of \nan indictment or information. Beyond notification of the victim, test \nresult confidentiality would be determined by the individual states as \nthey see necessary to protect the privacy of their citizens. Federal \nByrne Grant funding would be made available to the states in order to \nhelp pay for the testing; states which refuse to operate in compliance \nwith these testing requirements would be subject to a ten-percent \nreduction of their Byrne Grant funds.\n  Mr. President, I have read far too many stomach-churning accounts of \nboth female and male rape victims, at every age, where early knowledge \nof a sex offender's HIV status--positive or negative--may have spared \nthe victim unnecessary mental anguish, or possibly, may have spared the \nvictim's life. At this time, I would like to share a few of these sad \nstories with my colleagues.\n  In the summer of 1996, a seven year old girl was brutally raped by a \n57 year old man. The little girl and her five year old brother had been \nlured to a secluded, abandoned building in the East New York section of \nBrooklyn. The man raped and sodomized the girl. Her brother, meanwhile, \nwas beaten, tied up and forced to witness his sister's rape. After the \nman's arrest, the defendant refused to be tested for HIV. His refusal \nwas permitted by the state's laws. The man latter told the police he \nwas infected with HIV.\n  In New Jersey, three boys gang-raped a 10 year-old mentally-retarded \ngirl. The girl's family demanded that the boys be tested for HIV; these \nrequests were denied. Three years after the girl was raped and the boys \nwere convicted, the family was still fighting to learn the HIV status \nof the rapists.\n  A Maryland man with HIV sexually assaulted an 11 year-old boy for \nover a year. It was not until the man's trial that it was learned he \nwas infected.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe I need to elaborate further on this \nsubject. I believe we have a unique opportunity to help ease the stress \nand suffering of women and children mercilessly raped and wounded by \nsexual predators, and in the process, we will change a system which \ncurrently favors the so-called privacy of sex offenders over the health \nof their victims. I implore my colleagues to support the Victims of \nRape Health Protection Act. May we finally deliver a higher degree of \nsecurity and safety to rape victims, regardless of age or gender. Mr. \nPresident, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation and a letter from Ms. Deidre Raver, a rape survivor who has \nchampioned this cause for years, be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3206\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Victims of Rape Health \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. BYRNE GRANT REDUCTION FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) Grant Reduction for Noncompliance.--Section 506 of \n     title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of \n     1968 (42 U.S.C. 3756) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(g) Sex Offender HIV Testing.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The funds available under this subpart \n     for a State shall be reduced by 10 percent and redistributed \n     under paragraph (2) unless the State demonstrates\n\n[[Page S10591]]\n\n     to the satisfaction of the Director that the laws or \n     regulations of the State with respect to a defendant against \n     whom an information or indictment is presented for a crime in \n     which by force or threat of force the perpetrator compels the \n     victim to engage in a sexual act (as defined in subsection \n     (f)(3)(B)), the State requires as follows:\n       ``(A) That the defendant be tested for HIV disease if--\n       ``(i) the nature of the alleged crime is such that the \n     sexual act would have placed the victim at risk of becoming \n     infected with HIV; and\n       ``(ii) the victim requests the test.\n       ``(B) That if the conditions specified in subparagraph (A) \n     are met--\n       ``(i) the defendant undergo the test not later than--\n\n       ``(I) 48 hours after the date on which the information or \n     indictment is presented; or\n       ``(II) 48 hours after the request of the victim if that \n     request is made after the date on which the information or \n     indictment is presented;\n\n       ``(ii) the results of the test shall be confidential except \n     as provided in clause (iii) and except as otherwise provided \n     under State law; and\n       ``(iii) that as soon as is practicable the results of the \n     test be made available to--\n\n       ``(I) the victim; and\n       ``(II) the defendant (or if the defendant is a minor, to \n     the legal guardian of the defendant).\n\n     Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to bar a \n     State from restricting the victim's disclosure of the \n     defendant's test results to third parties as a condition of \n     making such results available to the victim.\n       ``(C) That if the defendant has been tested pursuant to \n     subparagraph (B), the defendant, upon request of the victim, \n     undergo such follow-up tests for HIV as may be medically \n     appropriate, and that as soon as is practicable after each \n     such test the results of the test be made available in \n     accordance with subparagraph (B) (except that this \n     subparagraph applies only to the extent that the individual \n     involved continues to be a defendant in the judicial \n     proceedings involved, or is convicted in the proceedings).\n       ``(2) Redistribution.--Any funds available for \n     redistribution shall be redistributed to participating States \n     that comply with the requirements of paragraph (1).\n       ``(3) Compliance.--The Attorney General shall issue \n     regulations to ensure compliance with the requirements of \n     paragraph (1).''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 506(a) of title I of the \n     Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended \n     by striking ``subsection (f),'' and inserting ``subsections \n     (f) and (g),''.\n       (c) Funding.--Section 501(b) of title I of the Omnibus \n     Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (25), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (2) in paragraph (26), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (3) by inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(27) programs to test defendants for HIV disease in \n     accordance with the terms of subsection (g).''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--\n       (1) Program.--The amendments made by subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall take effect on the first day of the fiscal year \n     succeeding the first fiscal year beginning 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Funding.--The amendment made by subsection (c) shall \n     take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Abraham: I understand that you are interested \n     in sponsoring legislation that would provide rape victims the \n     opportunity to quickly learn if they have been exposed to the \n     HIV virus. I have been associated with this compelling issue \n     for many years as an advocate for crime victims and thank you \n     for considering the health issues that a rape victim is \n     forced to deal with following a horrific experience. As a \n     survivor of rape myself. I personally know how traumatic it \n     is to wait for medical information regarding exposure to the \n     many frightening venereal diseases that exist, not to mention \n     the possibility of pregnancy occurring.\n       A rape victims needs to learn the HIV status of their \n     assailants when making decisions with her doctor about taking \n     risky drug medications. The only way for a victim to know if \n     she has been exposed to the HIV virus is to test the \n     assailant because of the 16-week infection time window \n     period. It is inhumane and cruel to deny rape victims the \n     right to learn of their assailants' H.I.V. status early \n     enough to eradicate the virus, if exposed.\n       Currently, in states like mine, a person accused of rape \n     cannot be involuntarily tested for the AIDS virus until he is \n     convicted of the crime, which can be years later. The H.I.V. \n     test becomes a plea bargaining tool for defense attorneys to \n     use, reducing the sentencing of violent sex offenders to non-\n     felony convictions. Our current laws force prosecuting \n     attorneys to choose between prosecuting violent criminals or \n     protecting the health of the victims.\n       New York has had its share of horrific cases where an \n     arrested rapist will have boasted to the victim of a positive \n     H.I.V. status and then refuse to take the test on the advice \n     of a defense attorney. I was personally outraged by a case in \n     Brooklyn where a fifty-seven-year old man raped a little girl \n     next to her five-year-old brother and then declared to police \n     that he had AIDS upon arrest. The Brooklyn District \n     Attorney's Office could not force the arrested man to take an \n     HIV test.\n       In order for states to qualify for AIDS funding, they \n     should have legal provisions in place to allow rape victims \n     to test arrested assailants for HIV, no exceptions. Our laws \n     should not aggravate the terror that rape victims face when \n     coping with their fear of the attacker and the numerous \n     frightening health risks.\n       I thank you for considering the rights of rape victims \n     before the privacy concerns of rape assailants, as rape \n     victims deserve compassionate help that includes determining \n     whether or not exposure to HIV has occurred.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deidre Raver.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 3207. A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants to \nnonprofit organizations to finance the construction, refurbishing, and \nservicing of individually-owned household water well systems in rural \nareas for individuals with low or moderate incomes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 affordable drinking water act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Affordable Drinking Water Act of 2000.'' This bill sets out an \ninnovative approach to meet the safe drinking water needs of rural \nAmericans nationwide.\n  The Affordable Drinking Water Act of 2000 provides a targeted \nalternative to water delivery in rural areas. Through a partnership \nestablished between the federal government and non-profit entities, low \nto moderate income households who would prefer to have their own well \nor are experiencing drinking water problems could secure financing to \ninstall or refurbish an individually owned household well. In my home \nstate of Pennsylvania, 2.5 million citizens currently choose to have \ntheir drinking water supplied by privately-owned individual water \nwells.\n  The government assistance envisioned under this bill would also allow \nhomeowners of modest means in Pennsylvania, and the rest of the \ncountry, to bring old household water wells up to current standards; \nreplace systems that have met their expected life; or provide \nhomeowners without a drinking water source with a new individual \nhousehold water well system.\n  Another important component of this legislation will afford rural \nconsumers with individually owned water wells the same payment \nflexibility as other utility customers. Centralized water systems \ncurrently are eligible to receive federal grants and loans with \nrepayment spread out over 40 years. The Affordable Drinking Water Act \nof 2000 would provide loans to low to moderate income homeowners to \nupgrade or install a household drinking water well now, and then repay \nthe cost through convenient monthly charges. This ability to stretch \nout payments over the life of the loan gives rural well owners an \naffordable option that they otherwise do not have.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this legislation today, and \nbelieve that it is appropriately balanced to meet the safe-drinking \nwater needs of rural households.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10591-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 3005\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the name of the Senator from \nWisconsin (Mr. Kohl) was added as a cosponsor of S. 3005, a bill to \nrequire country of origin labeling of all forms of ginseng.\n\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate will not be in session on Monday. On Tuesday, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report on this Agriculture \nappropriations bill--very important legislation. The debate will be \nlimited to Tuesday's session and approximately 2 hours on Wednesday \nmorning, with the vote scheduled to occur at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday on \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  For the remainder of the week, the Senate is expected to complete all \naction necessary for sine die adjournment. I pause for applause. That \nis certainly what we should do. It is possible we can do it. We were \nable to get a good deal accomplished this week. It took a lot of work \non both sides of the aisle. We were able to get a package of five bills \ndone, which included, of course, the sex trafficking issue as well as \nAimee's law and the Violence Against Women Act. We were able to pass \nfour appropriations bills and complete action on the Defense \nauthorization bill and begin debate on the Agriculture appropriations \nbill.\n  Next week we will have to deal with the foreign operations conference \nreport final passage in some form; the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill; the Labor-HHS and Education appropriations \nconference report, and there are several tax provisions that need to be \nconsidered, including the FSC issue that we have been trying to get \ncleared, a bill that came out of the Finance Committee to make sure the \nUnited States complies with WTO requirements. We need to get that \ncompleted as well as several other items that have broad support in the \nHouse and in the Senate and the administration.\n  So there are four categories that we will need to act on next week. I \nhave been having conversations and meetings this morning with Members \nof both sides of the aisle and with the administration to try to help \nfacilitate that.\n  I notice Senator Conrad reacted positively to ``both sides of the \naisle.''\n  I think it is clearly possible to complete our work by next Friday. I \nhad hoped we could do it by Saturday, the 14th, but the unfortunate \ndeath of our friend and colleague, Congressman Vento from Minnesota, \noccurred and, therefore, Members are in Minnesota this morning for the \nfuneral service. Clearly, we can get our work done next week, and we \ncertainly will try to. Senators should expect votes throughout the day \nWednesday and Thursday and into Friday, if it is necessary.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a question or comment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10603-5", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10603-S10604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KEVIN SHAWN RUX\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have just learned very tragic news that \na young man from my home State of North Dakota is among those now \nlisted as missing and presumed dead on board the U.S.S. Cole.\n  He is Petty Officer 2nd Class Kevin Shawn Rux. I want to express my \ndeepest sympathies to the family. Our Nation honors this young man for \nhis service and sacrifice. Our prayers are with his family in their \ngrief today, and with all the fathers, mothers, spouses, sons, and \ndaughters of those who lost their loved ones in this terrible attack.\n  I want to reassure the family this Nation will not rest until we find \nthe criminals responsible for the death of Kevin Shawn Rux and his \nshipmates. This country will hold them accountable for these murders. \nAgain, we share the grief of the family of this young\n\n[[Page S10604]]\n\nman. He was doing his duty. He was serving his country. We admire very \nmuch his service, and we deeply respect his sacrifice.\n  My colleague from North Dakota would also like to comment. We would \nappreciate that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me just say, Mr. President, I appreciate \nthe fact that the Senator has raised this issue. It is appropriate that \nwe acknowledge the service of our military men and women who are \nserving all over the world, more often than we realize, in very \ndangerous situations, and that we recognize those who lost their \nlives--in this instance, sailors on the U.S.S. Cole.\n  I, too, have a personal feeling about this. I would like to make some \ncomments on it myself. Before I do that, I yield to Senator Dorgan from \nNorth Dakota for his remarks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. This was \nobviously a senseless act of terrorism. Acts of terrorism are, in most \ncases, perpetrated by cowards who want to inflict terrible mayhem on \nespecially those from our country, but others around the world as well. \nYesterday, when we learned the news that the U.S.S. Cole had been \nattacked, all of us were deeply saddened. Our thoughts and prayers go \nout to all of the families of those who are now known dead and those \nwho are presumed dead or missing.\n  As Senator Conrad indicated, we have just learned from the U.S. Navy \nthis morning that a young man named Kevin Rux from Portland, ND, is \namong those missing and presumed dead, according to the U.S. Navy. I \nwant to add my voice to my colleagues' comments that my thoughts and \nprayers go out to his family. We are thinking of them and praying for \nthem today. We feel the same about all of those who have been the \nvictims of this attack. It tells us, once again, that this is a \ndifficult and in some cases troubled world, and those who wear the \nuniform of this country in all parts of this globe, who stand for \npeace, do so at some risk to themselves and on behalf of a grateful \nNation.\n  Again, I want to simply say we are thinking of the Rux family and all \nof the other families whose loved ones have become victims of this \ncowardly terrorist attack. I say, as well, that this country has said \nto its President and Members of Congress that those responsible for \nthis attack must be found and brought to justice for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10604-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDER FOR RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the U.S.S. Cole was built in my hometown of \nPascagoula, MS. I have been on it. I have visited with the sailors, the \ncrew, and officers on many of these ships --destroyers, cruisers, and \nLHDs--that are built there. It is always a thrilling experience to see \nthe enthusiasm of these young men and women and the caliber of the \nyoung men and women who serve our country, and also the tremendous \nsophistication of these ships. These ships are the most sophisticated \nin the history of the world, with an incredible array of radar and \nweapons systems.\n  These ships can fire at 120 different targets simultaneously, using \nmissiles and Gatling guns. They are incredible vessels. They are \nreferred to as ``aegis class\" destroyers. They have a tremendous shield \nwhere they can track and identify targets or enemy activities. But we \nsee, once again, no matter how big, how sophisticated, or how capable \nthey are in destroying enemy ships or aircraft, they are still \nvulnerable to a suicide attack by two men on a small rubber vessel.\n  I think it is a very sobering thing that we are learning from this \nexperience. You can be in a marine barracks somewhere, in a hotel, in a \npublic building, or on a sophisticated ship, and you are still \nvulnerable to this kind of attack. This is clearly an unjustified, \nheinous, indescribable act that has taken place, and I know that our \nGovernment will act very aggressively to protect and provide aid to \nthose who are injured and work with the families who are certainly \ngoing through a period of grieving now. It will also try to identify \nexactly who did this, who gave the order, and be prepared to take swift \nand very strong action against those who did it.\n  I have no doubt that our Government will work in unity to accomplish \nthat.\n  In addition to that, I have a list before me which is not yet ready \nfor release, and I would not want to do it before it has been properly \nreleased. But there are at least 7 identified as dead now and another \n10, at least, missing potentially, and likely now 17 sailors on that \nship who lost their lives.\n  One of those was Ens. Andrew Triplett of Macon, MS. I have before me \nhis record of service, and I take note that this is a young man who was \nvery forward leaning and had advanced very quickly through the ranks to \nreach the position of ensign.\n  To his entire family, and particularly his mother, Savanna Triplett \nof Shuqualak, MS, I extend my sympathy and prayers and also the \ngrateful appreciation of our Nation.\n  I know that Americans all over the world will be touched by what we \nhave seen happen and will be thinking of the family and praying for \nthem in this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/13/senate-section/article/S10604-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
