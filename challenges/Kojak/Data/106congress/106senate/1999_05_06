Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to urge my colleagues, if they have \nany amendments for this bill, to bring those amendments to the floor.\n  We are going to try to gather up today the amendments that Members \nwant to present. We are going to evaluate them. Hopefully, we can take \nmany of those amendments without a rollcall vote. There will be some \npoint this morning at which we will attempt to try to bring this to a \nconclusion in terms of setting a blueprint for the day. It is my \nintention to press forward today as long as it takes, as hard as it is, \nto see this bill dealt with and its work completed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Texas will \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Texas, based \non the previous agreement, is to be recognized to offer two amendments. \nI heard his call for other Members to come with amendments. I have a \ncouple of amendments which I intend to offer. I would not expect the \nSenator to include those in the list of amendments he intends to \naccept, but nonetheless I also wish to make a statement about the bill \ngenerally today. I have come over several times, as the Senator knows, \nand it has not been convenient to be able to do so with respect to \nother schedules, and I understand that. But I wonder if the Senator \ncould give me some notion of when I might be able to be recognized, at \nwhich time I would make the statement I intend to make about the bill \ngenerally and then offer an amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am awaiting Senator Sarbanes, so why \ndon't I just ask, how long does the Senator need to make an opening \nstatement?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wish to speak for about 20 minutes this morning.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota might speak on the bill for 20 \nminutes, and that at the end of that time I might be recognized for the \npurpose of offering the amendment. I am willing to step aside.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas is most courteous. \nI would like about 5 minutes to gather some charts.\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Fine.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would like to proceed----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why don't we do it this way. Let me ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator be recognized to speak for 20 minutes. I will suggest \nthe absence of a quorum. He can take us out of the quorum call when he \ncomes back and speak for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are debating a piece of legislation in \nthe Senate that is called the Financial Services Modernization Act of \n1999.\n  I come today with the confession I am probably hopelessly old \nfashioned on this issue. For those who have a vision of re-landscaping \nthe financial system in this country with different parts operating \nwith each other in different ways and saying that represents \nmodernization, then I am just hopelessly old fashioned, and there is \nprobably nothing that can be said or done that will march me towards \nthe future.\n  I want to sound a warning call today about this legislation. I think \nthis legislation is just fundamentally terrible. I hear all these words \nabout the industry remaking itself--banks, security firms and insurance \ncompanies, and that we'd better catch up and put a fence around where \nthey are or at least build a pasture in the vicinity of where they are \ngrazing. What a terrible idea.\n  What is it that sparks this need to modernize our financial system? \nAnd what does modernization mean? This chart shows bank mergers in \n1998, in just 1 year, last year, the top 10 bank mergers. We have \ndiscovered all these corporations have fallen in love and decided to \nget married. Citicorp, with an insurance company--that is a big one--\n$698 billion in combined assets; NationsBank--BankAmerica, $570 \nmillion; and the list goes on. This is a massive concentration through \nmergers.\n  Is it good for the consumers? I don't think so. Better service, lower \nprices, lower fees? I don't think so. Bigger profits? You bet.\n  What about the banking industry concentration? The chart shows the \nnumber of banks with 25 percent of the domestic deposits. In 1984, 42 \nof the biggest banks had 25 percent of the biggest deposits. Now only \nsix banks have the biggest deposits. That is a massive concentration.\n  I didn't bring the chart out about profits, but it will show --this \nis an industry that says it needs to be modernized--banks have record-\nbreaking profits, security firms have very healthy profits, and most \ninsurance companies are doing just fine. Why is there a need to \nmodernize them?\n  So we must ask the question, what about the customer? What impact on \nthe economy will all of this so-called modernization have?\n  It is interesting to me that the bill brought to the floor that says, \n``Let's modernize this,'' is a piece of legislation that doesn't do \nanything about a couple of areas which I think pose very serious \nproblems. I want to mention a couple of these problems because I want \nto offer a couple of amendments on them.\n  I begin by reading an article that appeared in the Wall Street \nJournal, November 16, 1998. This is a harbinger of things to come, just \nas something I will read that happened in 1994 is a harbinger of things \nto come, especially as we move in this direction of modernization.\n\n       It was Aug. 21, a sultry Friday, and nearly half the \n     partners at Long-Term Capital Management LP [that's LTCM, a \n     company] were out of the office. Outside the fund's glass-\n     and-granite headquarters, a fountain languidly streamed over \n     a copper osprey clawing its prey.\n       Inside, the associates logged on to their computers and saw \n     something deeply disturbing: U.S. Treasurys were \n     skyrocketing, throwing their relationship to other securities \n     out of whack. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was swooning--\n     by noon, down 283 points. The European bond market was in \n     shambles. LTCM's biggest bets were blowing up, and no one \n     could do anything about it.\n\n  This was a private hedge funding.\n\n       By 11 a.m., the [hedge] fund had lost $150 million in a \n     wager on the prices of two telecommunications stocks involved \n     in a takeover. Then, a single bet tied to the U.S. bond \n     market lost $100 million [by the same company]. Another $100 \n     million evaporated in a similar trade in Britain. By day's \n     end, LTCM [this hedge fund in New York] had hemorrhaged half \n     a billion dollars. Its equity had sunk to $3.1 billion--down \n     a third for the year.\n\n  This company had made bets over $1 trillion.\n  Now, what happened? They lost their silk shirts. But of course, they \nwere saved because a Federal Reserve Board official decided we can't \nlose a hedge fund like this; it would be catastrophic to the \nmarketplace. So on Sunday night they convened a meeting with an \nofficial of the Federal Reserve Board, and a group of banks came in as \na result of that meeting and used bank funds to shore up a private \nhedge fund that was capitalized in the Caymen Islands for the purpose, \nI assume, of avoiding taxes. Bets of over $1 trillion in hedges--they \ncould have set up a casino in their lobby, in my judgment, the way they \nwere doing business. But they got bailed out.\n  This was massive exposure. The exposure on the hedge fund was such \nthat the failure of the hedge fund would have had a significant impact \non the market.\n  And so we modernize our banking system. This is unregulated. This \nisn't a bank; it is an unregulated hedge fund, except the banks have \nmassive quantities of money in the hedge fund now in order to bail it \nout.\n  What does modernization say about this? Nothing, nothing. It says \nlet's pretend this doesn't exist, this isn't a problem, let's not deal \nwith it.\n  So we will modernize our financial institutions and we will say about \nthis problem--nothing? Don't worry about it?\n  I find it fascinating that about 70 years ago in this country we had \nexamples of institutions the futures of which rested on not just safety \nand soundness of the institutions themselves but the perception of \nsafety and soundness, that is, banks. Those institutions, the future \nsuccess and stability of which is only guaranteed by the perception \nthat they are safe and sound, were allowed, 70 years ago, to combine \nwith other kinds of risk enterprises--notably securities underwriting \nand some other activities--and that was going to be all right. That was \nback in the Roaring Twenties when we had this go-go economy and the \nstock market was shooting up like a Roman candle and banks got involved \nin securities and all of a sudden everybody was doing well and \neverybody was making massive amounts of money and the country was \ndelirious about it.\n  Then the house of cards started to fall. As investigations began and \nbank failures occurred and bank holidays were declared, from that \nrubble came a description of a future that would separate banking \ninstitutions from inherently risky enterprises. A piece of legislation \ncalled the Glass-Steagall Act was written, saying maybe we should learn \nfrom this, that we should not fuse inherently risky enterprises with \ninstitutions whose perception of safety and soundness is the only thing \nthat can guarantee their future success. So we created circumstances \nthat prevented certain institutions like banks from being involved in \nother activities such as securities underwriting.\n  Over the years that has all changed. Banks have said, because \neverybody else has decided they want to intrude into our business--and \nthat is right, a whole lot of folks now set themselves up in a lobby \nsomeplace and say we are appearing to be like a bank or want to behave \nlike a bank--the banks say if that is the case, we want to get into \ntheir business. So now we have the kind of initiative here in the \nCongress that says: Let's forget the lessons of the past; let's believe \nthe 1920s did not happen; let's not worry about Glass-Steagall. In \nfact, let's repeal Glass-Steagall; let's decide we can merge once again \nor fuse together banking enterprises and more risky enterprises, and we \ncan go down the road just as happy as clams and everything will be just \ngreat. And of course it will not.\n  I mentioned hedge funds--talk about risk. How about derivatives? \nIncidentally, those who vote for this bill will\n\n[[Page S4823]]\n\nremember this at some point in the future when we have the next \ncatastrophic event that goes with the risks in derivatives. Fortune \nmagazine wrote an article, ``The Risk That Won't Go Away; Financial \nDerivatives Are Tightening Their Grip on the World Economy and No One \nKnows How to Control Them.'' Somewhere around $70- to $80 trillion in \nderivatives.\n  I wrote an article in 1994 for the Washington Monthly magazine and \nderivatives at that point were $35 trillion. You know something, today \nin this country banks are trading derivatives on their own proprietary \naccounts. They could just as well put a roulette wheel in the lobby. \nThey could just as well call it a casino. Banks ought not be trading \nderivatives on their proprietary accounts. I have an amendment to \nprohibit that. I don't suppose it would get more than a handful of \nvotes, but I intend to offer it.\n  Is it part of financial modernization to say this sort of nonsense \nought to stop; that banks ought not be able to trade derivatives on \ntheir own proprietary accounts because that is inherently gambling? It \ndoes not fit with what we know to be the fundamental nature of banking \nand the requirement of the perception of safety and soundness of these \ninstitutions. Does anybody here think this makes any sense, that we \nhave banks involved in derivatives, trading on their own proprietary \naccounts? Does anybody think it makes any sense to have hedge funds out \nthere with trillions of dollars of derivatives, losing billions of \ndollars and then being bailed out by a Federal Reserve-led bailout \nbecause their failure would be so catastrophic to the rest of the \nmarket that we cannot allow them to fail?\n  And as banks get bigger, of course, we also have another doctrine. \nThe doctrine in banking at the Federal Reserve Board is called, ``too \nbig to fail.'' Remember that term, ``too big to fail.'' It means at a \ncertain level, banks get too big to fail. They cannot be allowed to \nfail because the consequence on the economy is catastrophic and \ntherefore these banks are too big to fail. Virtually every single \nmerger you read about in the newspapers these days means we simply have \nmore banks that are too big to fail. That is no-fault capitalism; too \nbig to fail. Does anybody care about that? Does the Fed? Apparently \nnot.\n  Of course the Fed has an inherent conflict of interest. I think, if \nthe Congress were thinking very clearly about the Federal Reserve \nBoard, they would decide immediately that the Federal Reserve Board is \nnot the locus of supervision of banks. The Federal Reserve Board is in \ncharge of monetary policy. It is fundamentally a conflict of interest \nto be listening to the Fed about what is good for banks when they are \ninvolved in running the monetary policy of this country. If the Federal \nReserve Board were, in my judgment, doing what it ought to be doing, it \nwould be leading the charge, saying we need to regulate risky hedge \nfunds because banks are involved in substantial risk on these hedge \nfunds. Apparently hedge funds have become too big to fail. Then there \nneeds to be some regulation.\n\n  The Fed, if it were thinking, would say we need to deal with \nderivatives, and that bank trading on proprietary accounts in \nderivatives is absurd and ought not happen. Some will remember in 1994 \nthe collapse in the derivative area. You might remember the stories. \n``Piper's Managers' Losses May Total $700 Million.'' ``Corporation \nAfter Corporation Had to Write Off Huge Losses Because They Were \nInvolved in the Casino Game on Derivatives.'' ``Bankers Trust Thrives \non Pitching Derivatives But Climate Is Shifting.'' ``Losses By P May \nClinch Plan to Change.''\n  The point is, we have massive amounts of risk in all of these areas. \nThe bill brought to the floor today does nothing to address these \nrisks, nothing at all, but goes ahead and creates new risks by saying \nwe will fuse and merge the opportunities for inherently risky economic \nactivity to be combined with banking which requires the perception of \nsafety and soundness.\n  We have all these folks here who know a lot more about this than I \ndo, I must admit, who say: Except we are creating firewalls. We have \nsubsidiaries, we have affiliates, we have firewalls. They have \neverything except common sense; everything, apparently, except a primer \non history. I just wish, before people would vote for this bill, they \nwould be forced to read just a bit of the financial history of this \ncountry to understand how consequential this decision is going to be.\n  I, obviously, am in a minority here. We have people who dressed in \ntheir best suits and they just think this is the greatest piece of \nlegislation that has ever been given to Congress. We have choruses of \nfolks standing outside this Chamber who spent their lifetimes working \nto get this done, to say: Would you just forget all that nonsense back \nin the 1930s about bank failures and Glass-Steagall and the requirement \nto separate risk from banking enterprises; just forget all that. Time \nhas moved on. Let's understand that. Change with the times.\n  We have folks outside who have worked on this very hard and who very \nmuch want this to happen. We have a lot of folks in here who are very \ncompliant to say: Absolutely, let me be the lead singer. And here we \nare. We have this bill, which I will bet, in 5, 10, 15 years from now, \nwe will be back thinking of this bill like we thought of the bill \npassed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in which this Congress \nunhitched the savings and loans so some sleepy little Texas institution \ncould gather brokered deposits from all around America and, like a \ngiant rocket, become a huge enterprise. And guess what. With all the \nspeculation in the S and brokered deposits and all the things that \nwent with it that this Congress allowed, what did it cost the American \ntaxpayer to bail out that bunch of failures? What did it cost? Hundreds \nof billions of dollars. I will bet one day somebody is going to look \nback at this and they are going to say: How on Earth could we have \nthought it made sense to allow the banking industry to concentrate, \nthrough merger and acquisition, to become bigger and bigger and bigger; \nfar more firms in the category of too big to fail? How did we think \nthat was going to help this country? Then to decide we shall fuse it \nwith inherently risky enterprises, how did we think that was going to \navoid the lessons of the past?\n  Then the one question that bothers me, I guess, is--I understand what \nis in this for banks. I understand what is in it for the security \nfirms. I understand what is in it for all the enterprises. What is in \nthis for the American people? What is in it for the American people? \nHigher charges, higher fees? Do you know that some banks these days are \ncharging people to see their money? We know that because we pay fees, \nobviously, to access our money at bank machines. But credit card \ncompanies, most of them through banks, are charging people who pay \ntheir bills on time because you cannot make money off somebody who \nwants to pay their bill every month.\n  If you have a credit card balance--incidentally, you need a credit \ncard these days, because it is pretty hard to do business in cash in \nsome places. You know with all the bills, everybody wants to use credit \ncards. Many businesses want you to use credit cards. So you use credit \ncards, then you pay off the entire balance at the end of every month \nbecause you don't want to pay the interest. Some companies have decided \nyou should be penalized for paying off your whole balance. Isn't that \ninteresting? You talk about turning logic on its head, suggesting we \ndon't make money on people who pay off their credit card balance every \nmonth, so let us decide that our approach to banking is to say those \nwho pay their credit card bill off every month shall be penalized.\n  Turning logic on its head? I think so. As I said when I started, I am \nlikely to be branded as hopelessly old fashioned on these issues, and I \naccept that. I suspect that some day in some way others will scratch \ntheir heads and say, ``I wish we had been a bit more old fashioned in \nthe way we assessed risk and the way we read history and the way we \nevaluated what would have made sense going forward in modernizing our \nfinancial institutions.''\n  Oh, there is a way to modernize them all right, but it is not to be a \nparrot and say because the industry has moved in this direction, we \nmust now move in this direction and catch them and circle them to say \nit is fine that you are here now. That is not the appropriate way to \naddress the fundamental challenges we have in the financial services \nindustry.\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\n  I am not anti-bank, anti-security or anti-insurance. All of them play \na constructive role and important role in this country. But this \ncountry will be better served with aggressive antitrust enforcement, \nwith, in my judgment, fewer mergers, with fewer companies moving in to \nthe ``too big to fail'' category of the Federal Reserve Board, with \nless concentration.\n  This country will be better served if we have tighter controls, not \nfirewalls that allow these companies to come together and do inherently \nrisky things adjacent to banking enterprises, but to decide the lessons \nof the 1930s are indelible transcendental lessons we ought to learn and \nought to remember.\n  Mr. President, I have more to say, but I understand my time is about \nto expire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, at some point, I will have three \namendments to offer, two of them on hedge funds and one of them on \nderivatives. I understand the Senator from Texas is in line and has the \nopportunity to offer two amendments.\n  My hope is to offer my first derivative amendment following the \nSenator from Texas. I understand the Senator from Texas indicates he \nwants to try to finish the bill this evening. I understand managing the \nbill is difficult and he wants to get through these things. I will not \nspeak at great length on my amendments.\n  I appreciate the Senator's courtesy this morning in allowing me to \nmake an opening statement. If he intends to finish the bill tonight, I \nwill be here. He said if we have amendments to bring them over. I will \nbe here. If the Senator wants my amendments, I will offer them and that \nwill give us a chance to talk about them and deal with them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is an important bill. I have had \nproblems myself with this bill in the past in other forms. I understand \nthe Senator has strong feelings. It may well be that some of his \namendments we can take. If the Senator will get them to us as quickly \nas he can, we will look at them, and if we can take them, we will. If \nwe cannot, then the only thing we can do is have them presented, have \nhim debate them, and then we will have a vote on them.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. On the point of amendments, I think it would be very \nhelpful to the managers if Members could now let us know in the next \nhour or so whether they have amendments they intend to offer and what \nthe subject matter will be. That will give us a chance to think about \nhow we might structure the day.\n  The leader's intent, as I understand it, is to try to finish this \nbill tonight. I think the chairman will probably agree with me that \nthere is the real possibility that we could do that, but in order to \naccomplish that, it would be very helpful if Members who are thinking \nof offering amendments would let us know about them so we can \nincorporate that factor into our thinking as we think about how we are \ngoing to move the bill along. I would be most appreciative if people \ncould do that.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. May I inquire, if I can ask a question of the manager, if \nwe have amendments when will they likely be considered? The Senator \nfrom Texas has now an opportunity to offer two amendments, right? Will \nthere be substantial debate on those amendments?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't think so at this point. One of the reasons we are \nletting people go is to look at them. There will be a vote on one of \nthem, sort of as a bed check to get everybody awake and ready to get \ngoing. I don't believe, or it is not my intention, that either one of \nthem will be very controversial or be long debated.\n  If the Senator can get his amendments to us and let us look at them \nso we know what he is offering, again, it might be possible we can work \nsomething out and take the amendments or some part of them. It is \nalways better not to talk if one can win without talking, but if you \ncan't win, talking is often the best thing to do. Maybe we can work it \nout. Again, we are in an accommodating mood this morning.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say the worst possible position is to not be able to \nwin and not be able to talk.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I can assure the Senator, we are not going to prevent him \nfrom talking.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will provide all three amendments to the chairman \nimmediately and will be available all morning so I will not hold up his \nbill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, while holding \nour current order exactly as it is, I yield to the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania to offer an amendment which he will debate \nand then withdraw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 307\n\n(Purpose: To require the obligations of the Financing Corporation to be \n paid from certain excess funds of the deposit insurance funds and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 307.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       (e) Use of Fund Reserves To Pay FICO Obligations.--\n       Section 7(b)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1817(b)(2)) is amended by inserting after subparagraph \n     (C) the following:\n       ``(D) Use of deposit insurance funds to pay certain \n     financing corporation obligations.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Beginning on January 1, 2000, the Board \n     of Directors shall use the funds of the Bank Insurance Fund \n     and the Savings Association Insurance Fund in excess of 1.35 \n     percent of estimated insured deposits or such level \n     established by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section \n     7(b)(2)(A)(iv)(II) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1817(b)(2)(A)(iv)(II)) to pay the bond interest \n     obligations of the Financing Corporation.\n       ``(ii) Limitation.--If the funds available under clause (i) \n     are insufficient to meet the Financing Corporation's annual \n     interest obligations, the Board of Directors shall use such \n     amounts available under clause (i) and shall impose a special \n     assessment, consistent with 12 U.S.C. 1441(f)(2) and Section \n     2703(c)(2)(A) of the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996, on \n     insured depository institutions in such amount and for such \n     period as is necessary to generate funds sufficient to permit \n     the Financing Corporation to meet all interest obligations \n     due.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise as a member of the Banking \nCommittee to, first, express my support for the bill. I think the \nchairman has done an admirable job in trying to fashion a bill that \ntakes what was a very complicated, overly complex measure last year and \nsimplified it and streamlined a lot of the organizational structures \nand dealt with things in a much more straightforward fashion. I think \nas a result, we have a much cleaner and much better, more \nunderstandable, from an administrative point of view, proposal than \nwhat we were dealing with last year. I commend the chairman for that.\n  Just like every other Member here, there are certain parts of the \nbill of which I am less supportive. In fact, some parts of the bill I \nam not supportive of at all and feel it is an obligation of mine to \ncome forward and do what I can to make some of those changes.\n  One section of the bill that I do not support is section 304. Section \n304 extends for 3 years the differential that savings institutions, \nthrifts, have to pay vis-a-vis banks on what are called FICO \nobligations or FICO bonds. That is the Financing Corporation bonds that \nwere issued to resolve the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation during \nthe savings and loan crisis a few years ago.\n  These bonds were necessary. The industry that was involved--more \nresponsible, some will argue--the thrift industry, was assessed a \nhigher assessment to pay those bonds. The banking\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\nindustry, which had less problems, was assessed a lower assessment, \nfive times lower. Without this bill, in a year's time, the amount of \nmoney, the amount of assessment would equalize. Instead of the thrifts \npaying 6 basis points and the banks paying 1.2 basis points, both the \nbanks and thrifts would pay 2.2 basis points.\n  I think that is fair. It should be equalized. Certainly the thrifts \nhave paid their fair share, and then some, with respect to resolving \nthe crisis that occurred in their industry. To continue this \ncompetitive disadvantage I think is not wise, given, in particular, the \nfact this bill has a lot in it for large banks, has a lot in it for the \nbanking industry, and a lot of my small banks and thrifts have said \nthere really is not much in it for the smaller, more community-oriented \nbanks and for thrift institutions.\n  While we are providing more opportunities for the larger banks, under \nthe chairman's bill, the committee bill, we keep this additional \ndisparity between savings institutions and banks. So I think it is a \nfair way to move forward given the state of play.\n\n  The problem is that I do not think it is fair enough. Striking that \nsection--I know there are several amendments out here to strike that \nsection and allow the equalization of the assessments to go on--I think \nis a good step but, frankly, it is not a step that goes far enough. And \nthe reason I say that needs a little explanation.\n  Right now the interest that we need, the amount of money that we have \nto pay for the FICO bonds, the Financing Corporation bonds, that runs \nabout $780 million a year. That is to pay the obligations on the FICA \nbonds. That money is paid by this assessment on thrifts and banks.\n  Thrifts and banks also historically have another assessment that paid \nmoney into a reserve account, as is prudent, so we have a reserve fund \nthat can pay on the guaranties for deposits in banks and savings \norganizations.\n  That capital fund is overcapitalized. There is more money in that \naccount than is necessary to meet the reserve requirement of 1.25 \npercent of deposits. And so as a result, the assessments on banks and \nsavings institutions have been basically eliminated with very few \nexceptions. But they continue to be assessed to pay the FICO bonds.\n  What I have found, in looking at these accounts, is that there is far \nmore money in the reserve accounts than is needed to meet the 1.25 \npercent of deposits that we need in that reserve account. In fact, that \nreserve account, that money that was paid to capitalize the reserve \naccount, is invested in Government bonds--should be invested, of \ncourse--and it is invested in Government bonds.\n  The interest on that reserve account, through the investment in \nGovernment bonds, is about $2 billion a year. That is about how much \ninterest we are bringing in and adding to the reserve account every \nyear. And it is growing, by the way. Every year it continues to grow. \nWe are adding about $2 billion a year in interest. So the reserve \naccount, which is already overcapitalized, continues to grow.\n  In fact, if you look at where this account has grown--remember, we \nare supposed to have in this reserve account 1.25 percent of deposits. \nIn 1996, it was 1.3 percent; in 1997, it was 1.36; in 1998, it was \n1.39. That is in the SAIF fund, which is the savings account fund. In \nthe BIF fund, which is the bank, it is 1.34; it is going up to 1.38 in \n1999. We are seeing a growth in both of those funds, and that is \nprojected to continue to grow.\n  You may ask the question, Why are we letting it continue to grow? \nWell, because there are no failures in banks. We are not having to \ninsure the deposits and pay the money. But it is well in excess of the \namount that we need. And it is earning $2 billion a year, thereby \ngrowing.\n  What I am saying is that we have more than we need in this account; \nit is growing at a rate of about $2 billion a year, and yet we are \nstill assessing banks and savings institutions money to pay FICO bonds. \nWhy don't we use the interest that is being spun off from the \ninvestment in the reserve account to pay the FICO bonds and that way \neliminate the assessment on banks completely, which is basically a $780 \nmillion tax, when we have a fund that is growing far in excess of what \nwe need in the reserve accounts?\n  That is what my amendment would do. It would basically say that there \nisn't any reason to continue to assess banks and savings institutions \nto use that capital to pay FICO. Let the capital stay with the banks, \nstay with the savings institutions, be used to lend, to create more \nmoney, more capital available for more credit.\n\n  It is estimated that with my amendment next year alone it would make \n$10 billion of credit available--$10 billion of new credit available if \nwe pass my amendment. That money, again, which has already been \ngenerated in excess of what we need, would be used to pay the FICO \nobligations.\n  I sort of like what is going on here with respect to the deposit \ninsurance funds, the reserve funds, what goes on in a lot of trust \nfunds in Government. We had almost the identical situation with the \nhighway trust fund, and we had the courage, through the leadership of \nChairman Shuster over in the House, to stand up and say, ``Look, we're \npaying all this money in gas taxes. It is going into the highway trust \nfund. But we are only appropriating a fraction of the money that is \nactually coming in.'' In other words, consumers--taxpayers--were paying \nmuch more money in taxes going into the trust fund than was ever going \nto be used in the trust fund.\n  What was happening to the difference? What was happening to the \ndifference was we were just building up this highway trust fund money \nthat we would never use. Why would we want to do that?\n  The same question here is, if we already have enough money to pay the \nFICO bonds with interest on the reserve accounts, why do we need to \ncontinue to assess banks? Well, there is only one reason why we \ncontinue to assess banks and savings institutions. It is because it \ncounts as money to the Federal Government and it scores for the budget.\n  Wait a minute. What does that mean? What that means is that we can \nshow a lower deficit because we have $780 million coming in. That money \nwill never be spent. It will never be spent. It will just continue, in \nsome way, to grow within the reserve account, which money will never be \nused because we have far in excess of what anyone has anticipated. By \nthe way, that number continues to grow.\n  So we have in a sense here in the banking bill the identical \nsituation as we had in the highway trust fund; which is, we are \nassessing somebody, ultimately the consumer, because they ultimately \npay these taxes or these assessments, we are assessing them $780 \nmillion a year to go into a fund that does not need the money, that is \nused purely--purely--to hide the deficit so we can spend money \nsomewhere else. So what we want to do is say, let's do here what we did \nwith the highway trust fund.\n  The reason I am withdrawing my amendment--this is a good amendment. \nIt is what we should do. This is truth in budgeting. We always talk \nabout truth in budgeting and the Social Security trust fund and the \nhighway trust fund. Here is another, in a sense, trust fund that we are \nputting money into that is never going to be used, simply to hide the \ndeficit. But if we take that money out of the revenue stream, there \nwill be some who will come down here to the floor and say, ``Aha, \nyou're going to raise the deficit and thereby take money out of Social \nSecurity or thereby not have enough money for us to do a tax cut or \nthereby not have enough money to do whatever else we want to do.''\n  The fact is, this is money that we should not be assessing because \nthere isn't the need to assess it. But it is there. It is a tax. It is \na tax going into a trust fund that does not need the money. But we are \ngoing to put it in there anyway because then we can issue bonds.\n\n  Does this sound familiar to Social Security? We do not need the money \nin Social Security. We have enough money to pay, but we continue to \ncharge people higher FICA taxes, higher Social Security taxes. We have \na surplus. And what do we do with that surplus? We buy Government \nbonds. What does that surplus do? It hides the real deficit.\n  What are we doing here with this FICO? It is interesting--FICA-FICO. \nWhat are we doing with FICO? We are\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\ncharging banks and savings institutions more money than is needed. To \ndo what? To buy Government bonds. To do what? To hide the deficit. To \ndo what? So we can spend the money somewhere else.\n  The trust fund scams that go on here in Washington, when we set up \nthese separate accounts--but we count them in the general fund. We \ncount them in the overall budget calculations and create some very \ntroubling policies.\n  It is a policy that we fixed when it came to gas taxes in the highway \ntrust fund. It is a policy we are going to try to fix when it comes to \nSocial Security. It is a policy that we should fix when it comes to \nbanks and savings institutions, although it is very difficult to come \nto the floor and say, we should reduce taxes on banks and thrifts \nbecause they are paying too much in taxes.\n  It is not a very popular tax cut, if that is the way you are going to \nlook at it. But this is not a tax cut; this is an assessment to make \nsure there is adequate money in reserves to pay the guarantee. These \nare banks putting money in there to make sure there is money available \nto pay insured deposits. That is what this is about. There is more \nmoney than we need in there right now, far in excess of the \nrequirements, and yet we continue to assess it.\n  That is wrong. That is not a tax to pay for government. That is not a \ntax to pay for something else. It is an assessment to do a specific \nthing. There is more money than we need to do that specific thing. Yet \nwe continue to assess. Why? Because it counts in the general budget, \nand we do not want to reduce the amount of money coming into the \ngeneral budget, even though that money doesn't go to the general fund; \nit goes to this trust fund. The trust fund then buys bonds and then we \nuse the money.\n  That is wrong. We should not allow that to happen. I will support the \nmotion to strike section 304 because it is all we can accomplish, but I \nwill continue to work, not just with this trust fund but with the other \ntrust funds we have here in Washington that have been integrated into \nthis budget, that hide the real cost of government. That is what we are \ndealing with here. We are hiding the real cost of government. We are \nmaking banks, savings institutions, pay money that there is no need for \nthem to pay to hide the cost of government.\n  That is wrong. That is not truthful budgeting. If we want to tax \nbanks more money, if we want to go out there and tax them, say you are \nnot paying enough in taxes, we are going to tax you $780 million a year \nso we can have more money in Washington, then let's be straightforward. \nLet's just go tax them and have a debate on that. But to continue to \nhave them pay this assessment--don't call it a tax; it is an \nassessment--when there is plenty of money in there that would alleviate \nthe need to pay that assessment is wrong.\n\n  I am very disappointed that this amendment is subject to a budget \npoint of order, which means I would have to get 60 votes to allow this \namendment to go in. Why is it subject to a budget point of order? \nBecause this assessment counts as revenue to the Government and would \nthrow the budget out of balance, if we passed my amendment.\n  Some will claim, you are going to take this money out of this, or \nthis, or whatever. The fact is, this is not a tax; it is an assessment \nfor a particular purpose, to capitalize a reserve fund to make sure \nthere is money there to pay guaranteed deposits.\n  There is more money. The reserve requirement is 1.25 percent. In the \ncurrent accounts, it is almost 1.4 percent. There is almost a billion \ndollars more in the accounts than is necessary to pay to meet the \nminimum reserve requirement, yet we continue to assess more and more \nand more.\n  Again, I can't tell you how disappointed I am that we continue this \nfraudulent budget practice. It is certainly my intent, while we will \nnot be successful today with this amendment, to fight this battle and \nother battles for truth in budgeting where fraudulent trust funds are \nused to subsidize other government spending. That is not right. It is \nnot right to this industry. It is not right to those who want available \ncredit, because we are driving credit by having these assessments. It \nis certainly not right with respect to Social Security and the other \ntrust funds that are being abused by the general government to hide \ndeficits for this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 307) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 308\n\n(Purpose: To strike a provision relating to a 3-year extension for BIF-\n member FICO assessments, to provide for financial information privacy \n    protection, and to provide for the establishment of a consumer \n           grievance process by the Federal banking agencies)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas (Mr. Gramm) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 308.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Senate Banking Committee has worked on \nthis bill for a long time. In fact, this has been a live issue in the \nCongress for over 25 years. We are making progress toward at least \nhaving the Senate act. I think no one is under any delusion about the \nfact that we have a lot of work to do. We have a conference, and we \nhave a President who ultimately is going to have a say in this through \nhis ability to veto. Obviously, at some point we are going to sit down \nwith him in the process and listen to his viewpoint and see to what \ndegree we can come together.\n  But I thought it was a good time in the process here in the Senate to \ntake some action to try to clear out some differences that exist \nbetween proposals that Senator Sarbanes made in committee and positions \nwhich were adopted by the committee itself. There are two areas in this \namendment where we adopt the position of the Sarbanes substitute which \nwas considered by the Senate yesterday. What I would like to do is to \nexplain these differences and then give Senator Sarbanes an opportunity \nto talk about it.\n  The first has to do with striking the FICO provision. It is always \ndangerous to try to do good things on an important bill. No good deed \ngoes unpunished. I had a provision in the underlying bill which was \ntrying to deal with a problem, and the problem is that we have two \nseparate insurance funds and they have had very different insurance \npremiums; but we had set out an automatic pilot process to bring those \ntwo funds to the same insurance rate, with the idea that Congress, \nwhile this was happening, was going to end up merging the two insurance \nfunds.\n  Well, as often happens, Congress ended up passing no bill related to \nmerging the two insurance funds, and on the last day of the millennium, \non December 31 of 1999, these two rates are going to be merged by law. \nAnd so I thought, well, this is a chance to have a good Government \nprovision, so we will postpone that to give the conference and the \nCongress an opportunity to do what we said we would look at doing when \nwe started merging these two rates.\n  It is clear now that there is sufficient opposition to this \nprovision, and I am not sure where the votes would be if we tried to \nleave it where it is. But it seemed to me, with all the big issues we \nhave to deal with in this bill, that it is not worth fighting this \nissue. And so the first provision of this amendment strikes the so-\ncalled FICO provision and allow current law to operate to assure that \nthe insurance premiums of the two separate insurance funds for\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\ndeposit insurance will be harmonized on the last day of this year.\n  The second provision deals with antifraud provisions and with this \nemerging issue of privacy. I want people to understand that by adopting \nthe provisions of the Sarbanes bill on privacy, I am not saying to the \nSenate, nor is Senator Sarbanes, I am sure--and he will speak for \nhimself--that this is the end of the debate. This is a very important \nissue. Privacy is a fundamental right that people have, and the \nquestion is trying to balance that right against the new technology \nwhich we all benefit from, and which we all find ourselves forced to \noperate within. It is not easy. This is a beginning.\n  What I want to say to Members of the Senate is that, as a gesture \ntoward promoting bipartisanship, I want to move to adopt these \nprovisions from the Sarbanes substitute. But I want to go further than \nthat. I want to commit that the Banking Committee will hold hearings on \nprivacy issues. I want to commit that we will hold those hearings in \nboth the subcommittee and at the full committee level; that we will \nbegin the hearings with testimony from any Member of the House or \nSenate who wishes to testify; that we will hold comprehensive hearings \nso that anybody who has a legitimate viewpoint or represents any group \nwhich has a stake in this issue would have an opportunity to testify \nand have their position heard.\n  Now, basically, in this amendment we make illegal a number \nof practices, where basically people are engaging in fraud and \ndishonest behavior. In addition, we require a GAO report on financial \nprivacy. The amendment requires that GAO, in consultation with the \nFederal Trade Commission and the Federal banking agencies, report to \nthe Congress on the efficacy and adequacy of the remedies provided to \nprevent false pretext calls to obtain financial information and \nrecommendations for any additional legislation to prevent pretext \ncalling.\n\n  We have a Federal Trade Commission report to Congress on financial \nprivacy. The amendment requires the Federal Trade Commission to submit \nan interim report to Congress on its ongoing study of consumer privacy \nissues.\n  We establish a consumer grievance process. I think one of the things \nwhich has happened to every Member of the Senate is that we now find, \nin the absence of an organized process, that people tend to call us \nwhen they have problems of this nature. What we want to do in this \namendment is require the Federal banking regulators to create a \nconsumer grievance process for receiving and expeditiously addressing \nconsumer complaints alleging a violation of regulations issued under \nthis bill. These are regulations in section 202 having to do with \nconsumer protection. Each Federal banking agency is required to (1) \nestablish a group within each regulatory agency to receive consumer \ncomplaints; (2) develop procedures for investigating such complaints, \n(3) develop procedures for informing consumers of rights they may have \nin connection with such complaints, and (4) develop procedures for \naddressing concerns raised by such complaints, as appropriate, \nincluding procedures for the recovery of losses to the extent \nappropriate.\n  This is not the end of the debate. This does not solve the privacy \nproblems in America. But I believe Senator Sarbanes is correct that \nthis is the beginning of the debate. I have just touched on a portion \nof the provisions. He is more expert than I on them. But I believe they \nrepresent an important step in beginning the debate on this issue of \nprivacy.\n  I think it is important we begin this debate on a bipartisan basis. \nTherefore, I have sent this amendment to the desk adopting the privacy \nportions of the Sarbanes substitute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first of all, I want to indicate right \nat the outset that I am supportive of this amendment which the chairman \nhas sent to the desk. I would like to address briefly the two aspects \nof it.\n  First of all, it would preserve current law that ends the FICO \nassessment differential at the end of 1999.\n  Actually, my colleague, Senator Johnson, was going to offer an \namendment later, and part of that amendment would encompass this \nprovision as well. That is an amendment that addresses the unitary \nthrift issue, which I believe is probably an amendment we will be able \nto get to fairly shortly this morning. In fact, the chairman and I are \nhopeful that when we do that, we will be able to work out a time \nagreement with those who are interested in the amendment so we could \nstructure that debate, structure the vote, and Members would know how \nwe are moving ahead.\n\n  We indicated earlier, and I want to repeat the request--I will do it \nafter we vote on this amendment--that Members who have amendments to \nlet us know. Of course, we know about the unitary thrift amendment. We \nknow about the op-sub amendment. We know that some Members are thinking \nof offering amendments. The chairman indicated earlier that, if we \ncould see them, we might be able to work out accommodations with people \noffering amendments.\n  It will be very helpful to us if Members will let us know. I think an \nopportune time will be when we have the vote on this amendment, or \nshortly thereafter we could begin to try to program and plan the day.\n  The FICO assessment differential--let me briefly describe the \nlegislative background and show why the current law should be \npreserved.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 to \nresolve the disparity.\n  Let me just say this amendment has two things: the FICO differential \nand this antifraud privacy provision in it. As the chairman has \nindicated, that is just a small step. I am going to address that \nshortly.\n  Many Members have a very keen interest in the privacy issue. The \nprivacy concerns which they have been focused on are sort of broader \nand separate and more extensive than what is in this amendment. But \nthis amendment in and of itself, I think, is desirable, although it by \nno means addresses the privacy question in any broad or full manner.\n  Coming back to the FICO assessment differential, when we passed the \nDeposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 to resolve the disparity between \nthe assessments being charged by the SAIFs and the BIFs to the thrifts \nand the banks for payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing \ncorporation, so-called FICO bonds, it paid depositors of institutions \nthat failed during the thrift crisis.\n  Actually, the differential that caused thrifts to migrate assessable \ndeposits to the BIF fund, the Bank Insurance Fund, in order to reduce \ntheir premiums, that obviously over time could have led to a \ndestabilization of the SAIF funds.\n  The legislation in 1996 required SAIF-insured institutions to pay a \none-time $4.5 billion payment to the SAIF funds, and for 3 years, until \nthe end of 1999, to pay assessments at a rate of 6.1 basis points of \ndeposits, which was five times the rate at which BIF-insured funds were \nassessed. Then, as it were, as part of the arrangement for the thrifts \nundertaking these large payments, a one-time $4.5 billion payment and \nthe five-time multiple on the assessment rate going into the SAIF \nfunds, the Congress provided that the assessments would be equalized in \nthe two funds no later than January 1, 2000, and the same rate would be \nassessed on BIF and SAIF-assessable deposits thereafter.\n  The bill before has a provision in it, which the chairman has now \nproposed to strike, but that provision, if it remained, would extend \nthe premium differential for another 3 years and, therefore, require \nSAIF-insured savings associations to pay a much higher deposit \nassessment for another 3 years, whereas the existing law would have \neliminated that differential at the end of this year. This obviously \nwould impose very significant additional and unexpected costs.\n  I think, in thinking about this, that we have to really think about \nit in terms of in the sense of what the understanding was in 1996, what \nthe expectations were, what the planning has been, and, of course, if \nwe don't allow the law to take effect as it was laid out to do in 1996 \nin the Deposit Insurance Funds Act, we markedly changed people's \nexpectations and people's planning.\n  OTS Director Seidman and FDIC Chairman Tanoue both testified before\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\nthe Senate Banking Committee opposing this section. Director Seidman \ntestified that in a sense both BIF and SAIF-insured institutions have \nexpected the FICO rate differential to end at the end of this year. \nExtending it could revive the incentive to shift deposits from the SAIF \nto the BIF.\n  Deposit shifting represents a waste of resources and could \nunnecessarily lead the SAIFs less able to diversify to risks. FDIC \nChairman Tanoue testified that faced with the possibility of a \npersistent rate differential, holders of SAIF-insured deposits may feel \nit is in their best interests to try to shift deposits to the BIF. This \nwould result in the very inefficiencies that the Funds Act was intended \nto eliminate.\n  Subsequently, FDIC Chairman Tanoue sent a letter to Chairman Gramm \nurging the elimination of section 304, and stating if the differential \nis extended ``inefficiency and waste will reemerge as institutions \nexpend time and money to avoid this unequal fee structure.''\n  Mr. President, I think obviously we need to give careful \nconsideration to these arguments advanced by the FDIC and the OCC. The \nsubstitute which Senator Daschle and we proposed at the outset of these \ndeliberations did not extend the differential. We did not have this \nprovision in there, and, therefore, we stuck with existing law which \nwould have eliminated the differential at the end of this year.\n  No compelling reason has been brought to my attention that would \nrequire us to reopen this issue and extending the differential. The \nthrifts have been performing their obligations under the Funds Act by \npaying the $4.5 billion one-time payment, plus the payment on their \ndeposits, which is five times the payment the banks are paying under \nthe BIF on their deposits.\n  I agree with the amendment in striking the provision that would have \ncarried the differential out for another 3 years contrary to the \nunderstanding and everyone's assumption on the basis of the 1996 law.\n  Now, Senator Johnson will be offering an amendment which addresses \nthe unitary thrift issue, and I think that is a very important \namendment. He had, as part of that amendment, this particular provision \nwith respect to the differential. I think it is very important as \nMembers consider the Johnson amendment to understand that what he will \nbe offering on the unitary thrift issue is in the context of this \nchange, as well, with respect to the differential.\n  Looking at the Johnson amendment on the unitary thrift, to be fair to \nSenator Johnson and what he was seeking to accomplish, one would have \nto keep in mind or take into account that part of his approach \nencompassed this FICO assessment differential which is now contained in \nthe amendment offered by the chairman.\n  Members, therefore, as they examine the Johnson amendment--and I will \nmake that point later, as well--need to appreciate his effort to try to \ncome up with what I call a balanced, well-thought-through, reasoned, \nbalanced approach in trying to deal with these issues which are in some \nways connected with one another. Senator Johnson was trying very hard \nto put together a balanced package. The adoption of this amendment \nmakes it unnecessary to be in the Johnson amendment, which ought not \nresult in perceiving that the Johnson amendment is in any way \nunbalanced. Because of its approach it essentially encompassed this \nproposal, as well.\n  Let me turn to the antifraud provision that is in this legislation. \nAt the outset, let me be very clear. The chairman referred to the \nprivacy provisions of the Sarbanes bill. There are two Sarbanes bills \non this issue. I want to be very clear about it. One was the substitute \nwhich we offered which contained within it the provisions of last \nyear's bill on the Financial Information Antifraud Act. Separately, \nthere is a bill that I have introduced along with Senator Dodd, Senator \nBryan, Senator Leahy, Senator Edwards, and Senator Hollings, and a \nnumber of other colleagues have expressed a very strong interest in \nthis legislation which is a much more comprehensive approach to the \nprivacy question.\n  That bill would give customers notice about how their financial \ninstitutions share or sell their personally identifiable sensitive \nfinancial information. We think it is an extremely important issue. Of \ncourse, the chairman has indicated that he also regards it as an \nimportant issue, and he made the commitment this morning that the \ncommittee would undertake a comprehensive hearing with respect to this \nquestion of financial privacy.\n  I support the specific provisions in this amendment. I am pleased \nthat we are considering these welcomed and much needed antifraud \nprovisions. However, I have to underscore, again, they do not begin to \naddress the larger issues of financial privacy and the need to give \ncustomers an informed voice in what is happening with their most \nconfidential financial data.\n  Some have called the amendment that is before the Senate a so-called \nprivacy amendment, but I think it is more appropriate to call it an \nantifraud measure. What people are now talking about as a privacy issue \nreally is much more encompassed by this separate bill, which I \nindicated Senators Dodd, Bryan, Leahy, Edwards, and Hollings have \njoined with me in introducing, and which many of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle have expressed an interest in. I know there are \ncolleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, as well as on this side \nof the aisle, who are very concerned about the broader privacy \nquestion.\n\n  This amendment prohibits the use of fraud to obtain sensitive \ncustomer financial data from a bank. The use of fraud, in order to get \nthis data from a bank, clearly is something we need to shut down. That \nis obviously a desirable and appropriate provision. However, this \nproposal does not require financial institutions to safeguard customer \ndata. This goes to when people use fraud to somehow get that customer \ndata out of the financial institution.\n  This amendment doesn't address the increasingly common situation \nwhere companies pay banks for sensitive information without the \nknowledge or consent of their customers. Unfortunately, few Americans \nknow that under current Federal law a bank, stockbroker, or insurance \ncompany may transfer information about a customer's transactions or \nexperience to a third party without notifying the customer that the \ninformation is being shared, or obtaining the customer's consent. Such \ninformation can include savings and checking account balances, CD \nmaturity dates, security purchases and insurance payouts. Americans are \nbecoming increasingly concerned about the issue. That is very clear.\n  Last month, the American Association of Retired Persons published a \nsurvey finding in which 78 percent of the people surveyed disagreed \nwith this statement. Here is a statement that was put to people which \n78 percent disagreed with:\n\n       Current Federal and State laws are strong enough to protect \n     your personal privacy from businesses that collect \n     information about consumers.\n\n  Mr. President, 78 percent disagreed with that statement. In other \nwords, they did not think that current Federal-State laws were strong \nenough to protect their personal privacy. Ninety-two percent of the \nrespondents in this AARP survey said they would mind if a company they \ndid business with sold information about them to another company.\n  At the start of this Congress I introduced S. 187, the Financial \nInformation Privacy Act of 1999 to which I referred, in which Senators \nDodd, Bryan, Edwards, Leahy and Hollings joined. That bill will give \ncustomers the right to be told before their banks sell or share their \naccount balances, their CD maturity dates, their credit card purchasing \nhistory and other sensitive financial information. It will give them \nthe right to object to the sharing of this information.\n  Think of the kind of information now that has no restraint upon it in \nterms of it being shared or sold. I think it is clear that most people \nhave no real understanding or appreciation that this takes place and \nwould not want it to happen.\n  S. 187 has received strong support from leading consumer and privacy \nadvocate groups. This is an issue that is high on the President's \nagenda. Just this week, the President unveiled a plan for financial \nprivacy and consumer protection in the 21st century. This plan would \nrequire institutions to inform consumers of plans to share or sell \ntheir financial information and\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\ngive the consumer the power to stop it. In his radio address, the \nPresident said he was ``working to give you the right to control all \nthe information on whom you write checks to, what you buy on your \ncredit card and how you invest. We want to prevent anyone from \nencroaching on your privacy for their profit.''\n  In conclusion on this issue, first of all, let me again indicate my \nstrong support for the provision that is before the Senate which seeks \nto stop the use of fraud to obtain a consumer's confidential financial \ninformation. That provision was in the bill we brought out last year. \nIt was in the alternative which was offered earlier. We welcome the \nchairman's willingness to place it in the bill that is before the \nSenate.\n  However, I do want to note that this very limited amendment does not \nsolve the serious problem of customers not knowing what is happening \nwith their account balances, CD maturity dates and other transaction \nand experience information, and not having a choice as to whether this \nsensitive personal financial information is circulated to other \ncompanies.\n\n  This issue has the potential of being a controversial issue. I also \nthink it has the potential on which a consensus can be worked out \nbetween protecting the consumer interest and the assertions which the \nfinancial institutions are making with respect to the burdens that \nmight be placed upon them or how it would inhibit them from conducting \nlegitimate financial activities.\n  That is something which needs to be carefully worked through, so I \nparticularly welcome the indication by the chairman that we will hold \nhearings on these very important issues and undertake to develop real \nsolutions to the growing problem of financial privacy. I think it is \nextremely important that we undertake that task. It is helpful this \nmorning to have this indication and this commitment that the committee \nwill do so.\n  Mr. President, I had indications earlier there were some Members on \nthis side who wanted to address this privacy question, and I think we \nwould give them a brief period to follow through on that indication of \ninterest. If not, I would be prepared to move to a vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have a Kosovo briefing at 11:30. To try \nto accommodate our colleagues, since they are all going to be coming \nover here anyway, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the \npending amendment No. 308 at 11:30 this morning and the time until \n11:30 be equally divided in the usual form. I further ask consent that \nno amendment be in order to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me say, if we have more Members on one \nside who want to speak than the other, I would have no concern about \nyielding more time to Senator Sarbanes' side if they have people who \nwant to come over to speak on the general issue itself.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm for providing this \ntime to me to make a statement with regard to a tax cut proposal that I \nhave.\n  Mr. President, my job as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee is \nto help Congress stay focused on the right policies to keep the U.S. \neconomy energized. What that comes down to is finding ways to make sure \nWashington does less of what today it does most--tax, spend, and \nregulate--in order to let the American people do more of what they do \nbest--which is to build, create and innovate.\n  With that in mind, I instructed the JEC staff to focus on creating a \ntax plan that would accomplish three goals: first, provide tax relief \nfor all American income taxpayers; second, promote even stronger \neconomic growth; and third, ensure continued technological leadership \nin the 21st century. The plan I would like to talk about today \naccomplishes these three goals, and does so within the parameters of \nthe on-budget surplus as estimated in this year's budget resolution. It \ndoes not use one penny from the Social Security surplus.\n  As Ronald Reagan once said, when he was defining a taxpayer--``that's \nsomeone who works for the Federal Government but doesn't have to take a \ncivil service examination.'' This comment really gets to the heart of \nhow the size and scope of the Federal Government affects the way we \nlive our lives. Americans are spending more and more time working to \ngive more and more of their hard-earned dollars in taxes every year to \nthe Federal Government.\n  According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the average dual-income \nfamily will work until May 11 this year to pay their federal state and \nlocal taxes. So, as of today, the average American family has not even \nfinished working to pay off their taxes for 1999.\n  This year, the Federal Government will collect more tax revenue as a \nshare of GDP than at any time since 1944. This is the highest level in \npeacetime history--20.7 percent of GDP consumed by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Since 1993, federal tax revenues have grown 52 percent faster than \npersonal income growth. Last year alone, federal revenues grew 80 \npercent faster than personal income.\n  We have a balanced budget in 1999 and we've got balanced budgets as \nfar as the eye can see. Soon, we'll have a federal surplus as far as \nthe eye can see.\n  Our challenge now is to deal with that surplus. And, I think it's \neasy to see what will happen to this overpayment by the American \ntaxpayer--if we leave it in Washington's hands. There will be numerous \nnew government programs and they will be paid for by the Federal \nsurplus.\n  We have to change the terms of debate--and we have to do it now \nbefore the surplus is spent. First, let's not forget that the American \neconomy does not exist to feed the Federal budget. Now that the budget \nis balanced, we have to get our priorities straight.\n  To begin with: there is no such thing as ``public money.'' Every \ndollar of the Federal surplus was paid into the U.S. Treasury by \nAmerican taxpayers. If we have a persistent surplus, we have to give \nthe money back.\n  For years, my fellow Republicans and I argued that it was wrong for \nthe Government to spend more than it took in. We were right. But now, \nit is equally wrong for the Government to take in more than it spends.\n  Yes, we should cut taxes so that people can keep more of what they \nearn. Yes, we should cut taxes because lower taxes spur economic \ngrowth. But the real rationale for lowering taxes--the reason tax cuts \nare an article of faith in the Republican Party--is that high taxes \ntrespass on our freedom--our freedom to work, our freedom to invest, \nour freedom to support our families.\n  So in my mind, it is not a matter of if we cut, but how much, and how \ncan we maximize the pro-growth impact of whatever tax cuts we decide to \nenact.\n  With these thoughts in mind, I would like to focus on what they Joint \nEconomic Committee staff has come up with as a way to give the American \nincome taxpayer meaningful tax relief, promote savings and economic \ngrowth, and ensure the United States remains a technological leader in \nthe 21st century. And, Mr. President, I would like to elaborate on how \nthis plan will accomplish each of these goals.\n  The first goal is tax cuts for all American income taxpayers.\n  Under this plan we would double the standard deduction to $14,400 for \nmarried filers and raise the standard deduction for single filers to \n$7,200. Increasing the standard deduction would provide much-needed \nrelief to all low-income taxpayers. Moreover, this provision would \nsignificantly reduce the much-discussed marriage penalty and simplify \nthe Tax Code. Nearly three-\n\n[[Page S4830]]\n\nquarters of all taxpayers use the standard deduction and would benefit \nfrom this increase.\n  In addition, our plan would repeal the 1993 Clinton tax increase on \nSocial Security benefits. In 1993, President Clinton imposed this tax \nincrease on the elderly's benefits because he said it was needed to \neliminate the budget deficit. Since there is no longer a deficit, we no \nlonger need this tax. It is time to repeal this unnecessary surcharge \non Social Security recipients.\n  The second goal is economic growth.\n  The U.S. economy is enjoying unprecedented prosperity. In fact, our \neconomy has grown for more than 16 years with only 9 months of \nrecession. That is the longest period with only 9 months of recession \nsince at least the 1850s! But while my Washington colleagues and I may \nbe able to take pride in the performance of the economy, we really \ncannot take credit. The credit for the strength of our economy belongs \nto the American people--because the strength of our economy is a \ntribute to every American who uses his or her freedom to turn work into \nreward. To every individual who turns energy into a business plan--an \nidea into a new product.\n  These are the heroes of the American economy--the entrepreneurs and \ninnovators who are creating economic growth, generating trillions in \nnew wealth and reordering the global economy. We must provide pro-\ngrowth tax cuts that will ensure the continued strength of our economy \nand allow our entrepreneurs and innovators to flourish.\n  My plan would provide pro-growth tax cuts that would spur economic \ngrowth in four ways: by cutting capital gains tax rates 25 percent to \n7.5 percent and 15 percent and indexing them for inflation; by cutting \ndividend taxes to 7.5 percent and 15 percent, making them uniform with \ncapital gains tax rates; by repealing estate and gift taxes; and by \nindexing the individual AMT exemption amount.\n  Lowering capital gains tax rates will stimulate greater investment \nand keep the economy humming. Indexing capital gains for inflation will \nend the Government's unfair practice of taxing people on phantom gains \ndue to inflation.\n  Currently, people earning dividends face among the highest tax rates \nin the Tax Code--as high as 60 percent--because they are double-taxed. \nMany investors, particularly the elderly, count on their dividends as a \nmajor source of income during their retirement years. Therefore, this \nchange would have a significant, positive impact on their standard of \nliving. Furthermore, the Tax Code would no longer encourage companies \nto hold onto locked-in earnings that investors could use more wisely. \nBy making the dividend and capital gains rate uniform, this plan \neliminates the current bias against dividend income, making investing a \nmore level playing field.\n  Another major problem with the Tax Code concerns the alternative \nminimum tax, AMT. The AMT was designed to ensure that all taxpayers \npaid their fair share of taxes, but in recent years it has become an \nadditional tax burden on middle income taxpayers for whom it was never \nintended. Since the AMT exemption amount was never indexed for \ninflation, each year more and more taxpayers are subject to it. My plan \nwould stop this AMT creep by indexing the exemption amount for \ninflation, and relieve the unintended consequences of this \ncounterproductive tax that undermines other tax relief already provided \nin the Tax Code.\n  My plan also calls for the elimination of the estate and gift tax, \nsometimes referred to as the death tax. Death and taxes may be \ninevitable, but they should never be simultaneous. Death taxes are \namong the worst provisions in the Tax Code, imposing tax rates as high \nas 55 percent. After paying taxes all your life--surely people \nshouldn't have to pay even more taxes upon their death. That is just \nnot fair, and this tax should be abolished.\n  The third goal is to maintain U.S. technological leadership in the \n21st century.\n  Last, but definitely not least, my plan recognizes the importance of \nthe technology industry to the success and continued growth of the U.S. \neconomy. We need to maintain policies that give the strongest possible \nsupport to innovation, and my plan seeks to do this in two ways: by \nmaking the research and development tax credit permanent, and by \nraising the capital expensing limit from $25,000 to $500,000, indexed \nfor inflation.\n  Studies have shown that the R tax credit creates $2 of research and \ndevelopment for every one dollar of credit. It more than pays for \nitself, and we need to quit playing games with it. Our current \npractice--extending it one year at a time, letting it expire and then \nbringing it back to life--is completely counterproductive. No company \ncan plan and invest for the long-term against a policy that changes \nevery 12 months. This inefficiency impedes innovation and will make it \nmore difficult for the United States to maintain its technological edge \nin the 21st century.\n  Especially in high technology industries, rapid innovations are \nrendering equipment obsolete within a year. We are all familiar with \nthis phenomenon regarding computers. But, the same problems arise with \nmedical, telecommunications and other high-tech equipment. Under \ncurrent law, companies are required to spread these costs over time \nperiods of five or more years. Under my plan, the capital expensing \nlimit would be raised from $25,000 to $500,000 so companies would be \nable to keep pace with ever-changing technology. This will particularly \nstimulate investment in small firms.\n  Mr. President, to sum up my tax plan, it would provide $140 billion \nin tax relief over the next 5 years and $755 billion over 10 years--\nwell within the estimated $800 billion surplus in this year's budget \nproposal.\n  I think it is important to take a minute to look at who would benefit \nfrom the majority of the cuts I discussed today. In the context of my \nplan, I think it's important to stress that over one-half of the tax \nrelief associated with the individual tax cuts would flow to households \nearning less than $75,000 a year. In addition, nearly one-third of my \ntax plan would go to people with incomes under $50,000, who currently \npay 22 percent of taxes. So, in addition to providing cuts for economic \ngrowth and ensuring the U.S. remains a technological leader, my plan \nprovides substantial relief for all American income taxpayers, and \nsimplifies our burdensome Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, we are living in a new economy. And right now, the \nworld is playing America's game. We can out-perform, out-produce, out-\ncompete, and out-create anyone in the world. We need to ensure the \nUnited States keeps its status as an economic powerhouse in the 21st \ncentury. The Federal Government's role in ensuring this happens is to \nget out of the way and give the American people freedom--the freedom to \nwork, the freedom to invest, the freedom to support our families, and \nthe freedom to continue strengthening our economy. Our plan does just \nthat--cuts taxes and gets the Government out of the way to give the \nAmerican people the freedom to pursue their own dream--not \nWashington's.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nSenate Amendment 308 to S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization \nbill. Unfortunately, I was unable to vote on this amendment because I \nwas out in Wichita with Vice President Gore and FEMA director James Lee \nWitt surveying the enormous damage that was caused by the tragic \ntornadoes that passed through Kansas on Monday. These fatal tornadoes \nthat swept through the Wichita area on Monday caused 5 Kansans to lose \ntheir lives and injured more than 70 people. More than 500 homes have \nbeen damaged or destroyed, leaving many people homeless and without \npower. In the town of Haysville, 27 businesses have been wiped out, \nvirtually eliminating the business district of this Wichita suburb. I \nam pleased that federal relief for the Wichita area is on the way and I \nwill continue to assist federal, state, and local authorities as they \nhelp the people of Wichita recover from this natural disaster.\n  I support Senate Amendment 308 and would have voted for it if I had \nbeen present. This amendment was passed in the Senate by a vote of 95-2 \nand I believe that it will strengthen an already strong financial \nmodernization bill. The Financing Corporation bonds (FICO) provision in \nthe Financial Modernization bill would require Savings Association \nInsurance Fund (SAIF) institutions, or thrifts, to pay premiums at a \nrate five times higher than that paid by banks in the Bank Insurance \nFund (BIF) for three more years before merging both funds. Under the \nFunds Act of 1996, these funds were supposed to merge on January 1, \n2000 and all FDIC institutions were to pay an equal amount. This \namendment would strike the FICO provisions in S. 900 and equalize the \ndeposit insurance premiums of bank and thrift institutions.\n  I hope we now can move forward with the passage of the Financial \nServices Modernization bill. S. 900 would permit banking, securities, \nand insurance companies to exist within a single corporate structure. \nThis could lead to greater competition and more innovative and \nconsumer-responsive services. Competition would not only benefit \nconsumers, but will help America's employers by making it easier and \ncheaper for them to raise the capital they need for growth.\n  I am especially pleased that S. 900 would modernize the Federal Home \nLoan Bank System (FHLB) by banks. Under S. 900, the FHLB System would \nbe easily accessible as an important source of liquidity for community \nlenders and would enable community banks to post different types of \ncollateral for various kinds of lending.\n  Community banks are finding it increasingly tough to meet deposit and \nwithdrawal demands as customers shift their deposits into higher-\nyielding investments like mutual funds. With less liquidity, there \nisn't as much money available for lending as the community demands. A \nreduction in community lending will hurt the economies of these small \ncommunities. This bill will facilitate more small business, \nagriculture, rural development, and low-income community development \nlending in rural communities.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, before a motion to table.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Steven \nMiteff, who has served in my office for 2 months as a participant in \nUSDA's Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program, be \nprovided floor privileges during today's consideration of S. 900.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment for \nmyself and Senators Thomas and Kerrey. I thank Senators Daschle, \nDorgan, Kohl, and Lincoln, who are also cosponsors of this amendment.\n  I believe that several of my colleagues plan to speak in behalf of \nthis important effort.\n  This amendment addresses the issue of unitary thrift charters.\n  Initially this amendment also dealt with an unnecessary owners \nprovision that needlessly penalizes thrifts by removing the FICO \ninsurance differential from the underlying bill. However, Chairman \nGramm has offered an amendment that accomplishes that portion of the \noriginal amendment. Nonetheless, the remaining unitary thrift issue \nmust be addressed, and that is what this amendment does.\n  Thrifts are different from banks. Many believe that a thrift charter \nis superior to a bank charter. It gives thrifts more flexibility. It \nalso demands certain specific things of them.\n  We recently went through an extensive debate over the merits of the \nthrift charter. I don't want to open old debates. I do seek, however, \nto close a loophole that permits the dangerous combination of banking \nand commerce. Under current law, commercial firms can own and operate \nunitary thrifts. That is the only breach of the banking and commerce \nfirewalls currently allowed under our financial services law. Of \ncourse, the Glass-Steagall repeal and other opponents of this \nlegislation open a range of financial activities to each other. But \nthis bill is carefully structured to prevent the mixing of banking and \ncommerce and closes the single loophole that remains where banking and \ncommerce can mix.\n  Let me explain what this amendment would to. There has been some \nmisperception floating around about it. But I have made the language \navailable for review now for a number of days.\n  The Johnson-Thomas-Kerrey amendment does not interfere with the \ncurrent ownership of thrifts. Any commercial firms that currently own a \nunitary thrift charter will be able to continue to own and operate \ntheir institution without restriction. Their current status would be \nundisturbed. Existing unitary thrifts would be grandfathered and can \nstill sell themselves to any of the thousands of other financial \nentities that exist in our country. There will remain a strong market \nfor the sale of unitary thrifts--no doubt about that.\n  The only limitation this amendment would impose involves the \ntransferability of the charter. The charter would not be transferable \nto another commercial entity. Any bank, insurance company, or security \nfirm that wanted to acquire a charter could do so. A new entity could \nbe created to operate that thrift.\n\n  This amendment brings the two issues that concern the thrift industry \nto a consensus compromise which addresses the issues most critical to \naverage banks and average thrifts. It restores the language agreed to \nin last year's agreement effort in H.R. 10. That agreement, which is \nembodied in this amendment, was supported by the banks and by the \nthrifts. It also received the overwhelming support of the Senate \nBanking Committee. House Banking Committee Chairman Leach also supports \nclosing this loophole.\n  Moreover, this amendment would further the goals of financial \nmodernization by leveling the playing field between banks and thrifts \nand remove the dangerous threat of further weakening the walls between \nbanking and commerce.\n  OTS Director Seidman acknowledges that requests have been made by \nthrifts to relax the current restrictions on commercial lending, and as \nwe enter a new world of one-stop-shopping financial services, pressure \nwill no doubt only increase to allow more charters to be further \nexploited.\n  This amendment has the strong support of the American Bankers \nAssociations and the Independent Community Banks of America. The \namendment is the top priority of the banking associations relative to \nthis bill, which is the most important legislation, as we all know, \nimpacting financial institutions which Congress will address this year. \nThis week, bankers from all across the country were here in Washington \nto speak with their Senators about the importance of this amendment.\n  The amendment also has the strong support of the Secretary of the \nTreasury, Robert Rubin. Secretary Rubin has long articulated the \ndangers of mixing banking and commerce and expressed concern about the \nunitary thrift loophole.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, advocates \nclosing this loophole. He testified before the Senate Banking Committee \nseveral times on this point. Let me quote Chairman Greenspan directly:\n\n       In light of the dangers of mixing banking and commerce, the \n     [Federal Reserve] Board supports elimination of the unitary \n     thrift loophole, which currently allows any type of \n     commercial firm to control a federally insured depository \n     institution. Failure to close this loophole now would allow \n     the conflicts inherent in banking and commerce combinations \n     to further develop in our economy and complicate efforts to \n     create a fair and level playing field for all financial \n     service providers.\n\n  We might keep in mind the recent experiences in Japan. Part of their \neconomic and financial crisis can be directly attributable to the \nkeiretsu system that closely binds banks and commercial firms. Although \nour current system is a long way from that level of mixing banking and \ncommerce, I concur with Secretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan in the \npotential dangers.\n  Other observers have noted the dangers posed by the unitary thrift \nloophole, including former Federal Reserve Governor Paul Volcker, who \nsaid:\n\n       Recent experience with the banking crises in countries as \n     different in their stages of development as Japan, Indonesia \n     and Russia demonstrates the folly of permitting industrial-\n     financial conglomerates to dominate financial markets and \n     potentially larger areas of the economy. But we need look no \n     further than our own savings and loan crisis in the 1980s. \n     Combinations of insured depository institutions and \n     speculative real estate developers cost American taxpayers, \n     who ultimately stood behind the thrift insurance funds, tens \n     of billions of dollars.\n\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\n\n  That is former Chairman Volcker.\n  There are other amendments pending which will purport to address \nthese issues, but we should be clear; this Johnson-Thomas-Kerrey \namendment is the only amendment that helps average banks and average \nthrifts. It improves the safety and soundness of our financial system \nby eliminating the mix of banking and commerce.\n  I urge support of this effort to join with the expression of views of \nSecretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan in what I believe is a \ncommonsense, compromise approach to this critically important issue.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr President, today's thrift industry is an important \nprovider of mortgage loans and consumer financial services.\n  The thrift industry is required to focus its resources on providing \nconsumer and community-oriented credit. For example, current law \nrequiries a unitary thrift to devote at least 65 percent of its assets \nto mortgage, consumer, and small business loans. In addition, the \ncommercial lending authority of federal thrifts is strictly limited to \n20 percent of assets of which half must be to small businesses.\n  This ``specialization'' works. The last time Money magazine published \nan article identifying ``the best bank in America'' for quality and low \ncost pricing of its services, the recognized institution was a thrift--\nUSAA Federal Savings Bank.\n  Similarly, the last time Consumer Reports surveyed ``the best deals \nin 25 cities'' for checking accounts, 77 percent of the leading \ninstitutions were thrifts. This large percentage is noteworthy becasue \nless than 18 percent of the banking institutions existing at the time \nwere thrifts. Thrifts are a minority of the competitor but offer a \nmajority of the best deals.\n  The unitary thrift structure allows the capital from commercial \ncompanies to support the community lending activities of the thrift \ncharter.\n  More than 166 applications from nonbanking firms have been filed with \nthe federal thrift regulator to charter new thrift institutions since \nJanuary 1997. These new charters, if approved, will add competition in \nthe marketplace which will benefit the consumer.\n  The OTS has testified that commercial firms contributed more than $3 \nbillion in capital to support thrift institutions in the 1980s.\n  No safety and soundness issues have been presented by the unitary \ncharter.\n  In February 1999, the FDIC testified on the subject of financial \nmodernization before the U.S. House Banking Committee. In its \ntestimony, the FDIC argued that commercial companies have been a source \nof strength rather than weakness to the thrift industry and that \nlimiting the non-financial activities of thrifts ``would place limits \non a vehicle that has enhanced financial modernization without causing \nsignificant safety-and-soundness problems.''\n  Similarly, the OTS director has testified that there is no evidence \nthat the concerns about the mixing of commercial banking and commerce \napply to thrift holding companies with commercial affiliates: \n``Congress made a deliberate distinction in the treatment of thrifts \nand their holding companies based on the fact that thrifts cannot \nengage in the traditional type of banking activity--unlimited \ncommercial lending--that raises concerns with the mixing of banking and \ncommerce.''\n  The combinations of thrift and commercial firms have compiled an \nexemplary safety and soundness record. During the height of the thrift \ncrisis, the failure rate of commercially affiliated thrifts was \napproximately half that of other thrifts. Moreover, the federal thrift \nregulator has reported that only 0.3 percent of enforcement actions \nagainst thrifts and thrift holding companies from January 1, 1993, \nthrough June 30, 1997 were against holding companies engaged in non-\nbanking activities. In short, the industry's experience with commercial \naffiliates has been the opposite of what the critics contend.\n  Concerns about commercial banking and commerce are misplaced in the \ncontext of the thrift charter.\n  Current federal law expressly prohibits a unitary thrift from \nextending credit to a commercial affiliate and prohibits a thrift from \ntying deposits and loan services to non-financial services.\n  The statutorily mandated focus of the thrift charter on providing \nmortgage, consumer, and small business credit along with these other \nlending limitations distinguishes the thrift and commercial banking \nindustries.\n  Martin Mayer, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution and foe of \nmixing banking and commerce, supports the commercial ownership of \nthrifts because of their unique lending focus on consumers and small \nbusinesses.\n  Financial modernization should be about expanding chartering options \nand choices for consumers, not contracting these options.\n  While I believe there is a very strong case for fully maintaining the \nunitary thrift charter as a viable chartering option going forward, \nthis Congress should, at a minimum, not limit the authorities of \nexisting companies in the absence of any compelling safety and \nsoundness evidence about this charter.\n  The grandfather provision in S. 900 accomplishes this minimum \ntreatment for these existing companies that are focused on delivering \nconsumer and small business credit in our communities.\n  The Senate and House Banking Committees both have adopted \nsubstantially identical unitary thrift grandfather provisions, which \nalready represents a delicate compromise taken by both committees on \nthis issue. We should not reopen this issue.\n  I urge you to oppose the Johnson amendment as a serious step \nbackwards in our efforts to modernize our nation's financial services \nlaws.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. Let \nme try to set the record straight in terms of this amendment. The \nargument on the amendment is very simple, and I think it will not take \nvery long to make the case against the amendment.\n  First of all, we hear the statement made that the unitary thrift \nprovision in current law is a loophole, that somehow commercially owned \nsavings and loans have come into existence as a result of a loophole--\nhence, as Senator Johnson says, ``the unitary thrift loophole.''\n  Let me remind my colleagues that a loophole had nothing to do with \nunitary thrifts. In 1967, the Congress passed the S Holding Company \nAct. That S Holding Company Act intentionally, after a very large \nnumber of hearings in the House and the Senate, intentionally placed \ninto law the provision that allowed commercial companies to own and \ncharter S Congress did this for a very simple reason. In fact, the \nlaw said clearly, in black and white, the purpose of allowing \ncommercial interests to own S, hence the creation of what we call a \nunitary thrift, was to encourage capital and management to come in to \nthe troubled S business.\n  So this new ``loophole'' is no afterthought. This is no mistake. This \nis no provision that was created by accident. In fact, we had an entire \nbill, the S Holding Company Act, which is the Unitary Thrift Act. \nThat was passed in 1967 after extensive hearings in both the House and \nthe Senate where strong action was taken by both parties in support of \nthis provision.\n  This is no loophole. This is no accident. This is a creation of \nCongress that came into existence through a well-reasoned, extensively \ndebated law, and the decision was made to encourage commercial \ncompanies to put real capital, real money, and good management into \nS\n  Let me outline the figures, to give Members the magnitude of the \nproblem. There are 561 thrift holding companies. What is a thrift \nholding company? A thrift holding company is a company that may be in \nmany different businesses, but it owns a thrift charter. These are 561 \nthrift holding companies that are engaged in some other business as \nwell as the thrift business. Many are in insurance, many are in \nsecurities. There are 561 of them.\n  Mr. President, 22 are now owned by nonfinancial unitary thrifts. \nTherefore, 541 of these will be legal under this bill, because it is \nlegal under this bill for an insurance company and a securities company \nto own a bank, so it will be legal to own a thrift.\n  What is the ``universe'' we are talking about here in terms of actual \ncommercial interests that own thrifts? The universe is just 22--22 \nthrift charters that are owned today by a commercial\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\ninterest other than insurance and securities that will be able to own \nbanks under this bill.\n  What is special about these 22 companies? What is special about it is \nthat most of them came into existence during the S crisis. I remember \nvividly offering an amendment to assess the thrifts $15 billion to \nbegin to close troubled thrifts, 3 years before that amendment ever \npassed. It was defeated in the Banking Committee. I remember Senator \nDodd voting with me on it; I don't remember exactly how the vote broke \ndown, but I know we lost. During that period, we were desperate to try \nto get people to put money into troubled S to try to prevent the \ntaxpayer from ending up paying billions of dollars in defaulted \ndeposits.\n  Most of these 22 thrifts were commercial companies that were enticed \nby the Office of Thrift Supervision--the Federal Home Loan Bank Board--\nto come in and buy troubled thrifts, to bring good management, and to \nbring in hard cash. And these commercial companies responded. No one \nwould dispute that the S collapse cost tens of billions of dollars \nless than it would have had these commercial companies not come in and \ninvested their hard-earned money in thrifts.\n  Let me note another thing. You get the idea from this amendment that \nthere is something wrong with unitary thrifts, that there is something \nwrong with commercial companies owning thrifts. First of all, during \nthe S crisis from 1985 to 1992, the default rate of thrifts that \nended up going into insolvency--the bankruptcy rate among thrifts that \nwere owned by commercial companies--proportionately speaking, was half \nthe rate of default on thrifts that were not owned by commercial \ncompanies. So the plain truth is, today these S that are owned by \ncommercial interests are among the most stable, most secure S in \nAmerica.\n  Let me also note that in terms of the regulatory review currently \nunderway, consistently those thrifts that are least subject to \ncomplaints about violating various provisions of Federal law--the \nthrifts that behave best in complying with the law--are consistently \nthe unitary thrifts, the thrifts that are owned by a commercial \ninterest.\n  There is no evidence, therefore, based on any safety and soundness \nconcern, that unitary thrifts are anything less than safer, sounder, \nbetter run and, as a result, more compliant with existing law than \nother thrifts. In fact, the Office of Thrift Supervision has indicated \nthat out of 1,428 enforcement actions against thrifts from January 1993 \nto June 1997, only 3 of those enforcement actions involved unitary \nthrifts. These are the best performers and they are the best in terms \nof complying with the law.\n  What is the problem here? Under the bill which is pending before the \nSenate, which passed the Senate Banking Committee, we changed the law \nso there could be no more unitary thrifts. We have a cutoff date, which \nis the date the committee markup document was released to the public. \nAs of that day, under our bill no commercial interest can get a new \nthrift charter.\n  I think it is important to note that when you look at the \napplications that are pending--and we have a lot of applications \npending for thrift ownership--most of them are by insurance companies \nand securities companies. They would rather own a bank, but until we \npass this bill--and I hope we do pass this bill--they cannot do it, so \nthey have applied to own a thrift. If we pass this bill, many of those \napplications will be withdrawn. But this amendment does not have \nanything to do with them.\n  Of the proposals for unitary thrifts--that is, commercial companies \nthat are trying to buy a thrift charter or get a thrift charter \nissued--there are only seven of them. So here is the point. This \nability of commercial companies to get a thrift charter is over 20 \nyears old. It has existed for 20 years. Any commercial company--from \nGeneral Motors to A, to Kroger's, to Bell Telephone, to whatever--\ncould apply for a thrift charter. For 20 years they have had that \nright. Mr. President, 22 have done it, 22 have gotten the charter, and \nmost of them got the charter when they were basically cajoled by the \nGovernment to do it, to bring in billions of dollars to try to help us \nsolve the S problem.\n  My trusty staff tells me it was 30 years they have had the \nopportunity--there are 22 of them--not 20 years.\n  Now, with all the talk of ``runaway unitary thrifts,'' only seven \napplications are pending. So, what does our bill do and what does the \nJohnson amendment do? Our bill says that--for the 22 commercial \ninterests, most of whom got into the S business as part of our effort \nto stop the collapse of the S industry--our bill says, after the date \nwe introduce the bill, any application coming after that date cannot be \nconsidered; that the 7 applications which are already pending can be \nconsidered; and the 22 which already exist can continue to operate.\n  To that extent, the committee bill and the Johnson amendment are \nvery, very similar. The difference is that the Johnson amendment, in \naddition, provides that if you own a unitary thrift you can't sell it \nto any other commercial interest; and if you sell a thrift holding \ncompany--which, in virtually every case, has a commercial interest--it \nhas to be broken up upon its sale, because you cannot sell it with any \ncommercial interest as part of it.\n\n  We have a simple term for this kind of action. It is in the fifth \namendment of the Constitution. It is called ``takings.'' This is a \nconstitutional issue. This is not some philosophical position of \ncompetition and free enterprise. This is not an issue directly about \nhow we can make the industry better or what might help or harm the \nconsumer. This is about private property. This is a constitutional \nissue. If we could go back and start this whole thing over again, if we \nwere starting with an absolutely clean slate, I would, in all \nprobability, oppose permitting commercial companies owning thrifts--if \nwe were starting with a fresh slate.\n  But the problem is, we are starting with 22 companies that have \nalready invested billions of dollars, most of them doing so during the \nS crisis when we begged them to do it. They have now built businesses \nand part of the value of their franchise is based on their ability to \nbe able to sell it. If it has to be broken up when it is sold, as every \nthrift holding company would have to be, under the Johnson amendment, \nif it had any commercial interest--and almost all of them do--the net \nresult is, our estimates are, that the passage of this amendment would \ndestroy between 10 and 15 percent of the value of these S charters.\n  If our colleague from South Dakota had proposed an amendment that \nwould have taken money out of the insurance fund and assessed what it \nwould cost these owners of thrift charters to limit their ability to \nsell them to other commercial interests, and to require they be broken \nup if they were sold, and we were going to compensate them from the \ninsurance fund, I might support such an amendment. But the idea that on \nan ex post facto basis we are going to come in and destroy the value of \ncharters, that we are going to lower their value estimated between 10 \nand 15 percent simply because we do not have commercial ownership of \nbanks, is simply unconstitutional.\n  What is going to happen on this? I can tell you what is going to \nhappen: We now have had a series of Supreme Court rulings related to \ntakings. The Supreme Court, thank God, has suddenly awakened to the \nprovision in the fifth amendment which is as important as any provision \nin the first amendment. In fact, John Locke would have said ``more \nimportant.'' The Founding Fathers understood its importance. And that \nprovision says:\n\n       No private property shall be taken for public purpose \n     except through compensation.\n\n  How do I know how the Court is going to rule on this? They have \nalready ruled on a similar issue. You remember something called \n``supervisory goodwill''? Here is what happened: Congress got a number \nof businesses to buy troubled thrifts--one of the things we did when we \nhad no money--so the thrift was worth a negative $500 million and they \ncame in, took it over for nothing and assumed its liabilities.\n  So, having no money to protect the depositors, we said, if you will \nprotect the depositor, we will give you $500 million of regulatory \ngoodwill and for a period of time you can hold it as capital. Do you \nknow what happened? Congress decided that was not a good idea. So we \npassed a bill, called FIRREA,\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\nthat took it back. And these thrifts went to court and argued: We made \ninvestments under a certain set of rules, Congress on an ex post facto \nbasis came back and repealed those rules.\n  They took our property. There was a taking. Congress took billions of \ndollars from us and, in fact, the Federal Claims Court on April 9 of \nthis year ruled that the Federal Government owes Glendale Federal Bank \n$990 million in damages for this taking. I remind my colleagues, there \nis a list of S which takes up half a page that has exactly the same \nclaim against the Federal Government.\n  Whether you like the idea of a commercial company owning a thrift--\nand, I remind you, they have a better record of safety and soundness, \nthey have a better record of performance, they have a better record of \ncomplying with the laws and regulations than thrifts as a whole--but \neven if you don't like it, do you think we have a right to steal their \nproperty? Even if you don't like them, do you think Congress has a \nright now to change the rules and say, ``Oh, yes, you can hold your \ncharter, but if you ever sell it, it will have to be broken up because \nit has a commercial interest as part of it''?\n  It is estimated that this amendment, the moment it becomes law, would \ndestroy 10 to 20 percent of the stock value of these companies through \na taking.\n  If we adopt the Johnson amendment, these companies are going to file \na lawsuit against the Federal Government.\n  I believe, based on the rulings that have occurred on regulatory \ngoodwill, that they are going to win these lawsuits, and then where are \nthese billions of dollars coming from? Are they going to come out of \nthe insurance fund? Are they going to come from the taxpayers? Maybe we \nshould have a second-degree amendment that says if this is a taking, we \nwill raise the insurance assessment to raise the money to pay for the \ntaking rather than having it foisted onto the Treasury. I don't know if \nour colleague from South Dakota would vote for such an amendment, but \nit seems to me a pretty reasonable amendment.\n  If we did not have unitary thrifts, I doubt we would create them. I \nam not ready yet to have commercial companies own banks. I have no \ndoubt in 20 years they will, but we are not ready yet. If we didn't \nhave unitary thrifts, we would not create them.\n  To sum up, here are the critical points: We did not create unitary \nthrifts by accident. There is no loophole. The 1967 bill was \nextensively debated; there were hearings and the bill was adopted \noverwhelmingly on a bipartisan vote to bring in new capital and new \nmanagement that was desperately needed.\n  Thirty-two years later, we are coming in and saying, ``Boy, you have \ngiven us those tens of billions of dollars and we really appreciate it, \nbut we're not going to live up to our end of the bargain.'' We are \ngoing to say, ``Yes, we took your money and it saved us tens of \nbillions of dollars of taxpayers' money, but now we don't like you \nanymore, and so if you ever sell your thrift, you are on notice right \nnow your thrift holding company will have to be broken up.''\n  Unitary thrifts might have become a big problem if we were not \nconsidering this financial modernization bill. But if we pass this \nbill, all but 22 S that are owned by commercial interests will be \nowned by insurance companies or securities firms. So this is a problem \nthat some people imagined existed before this bill, but we are talking \nonly about 22 companies and 7 pending applications.\n  I have received calls from many banks that say they want this \namendment passed. But when I explain to them that it might sound like a \ngreat idea, until you realize you are taking somebody's property and \nviolating the Constitution, I have found people understand that. The \nfact that we have lobbyists calling up telling us to do this does not \nmean we have to do it.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. I preserve my ability \nto offer a constitutional point of order if the motion to table fails. \nI reserve the right to offer a second-degree amendment which would \nrequire the insurance rates to be raised to pay for any takings, but I \nhope those will not be necessary.\n  This is not a good amendment. I know there are a lot of interests for \nit, but it is not a good amendment. I urge my colleagues to take the \nlong view on this and not vote for it so we are not back here in 2 \nyears trying to come up with billions of dollars to pay off these \nlawsuits.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey, a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas and the Senator from Maryland. There are a number of \nprovisions in this legislation for which I thank them.\n  One of the things all of us have to do when looking at this piece of \nlegislation is ask the question whether or not we are going to be able \nto maintain the safety and soundness of the banking system. It is a \npretty dramatic change allowing companies that previously had been \nprohibited in certain lines of business to engage in those lines of \nbusiness.\n  I want to make it clear, I reached the conclusion that we do have the \nregulatory capacity to maintain safety and soundness, whichever piece \nof legislation emerges here. I appreciate very much the work of the \nSenator from Texas on this, as well as the work of the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  I will point out a couple of things, as well, that I am very much \ngrateful for, and one of them has to do with modernizing the Federal \nHome Loan Bank System that allows rural banks and other banks to have \naccess to credit. I think it is a very important provision. Senator \nHagel offered it, and I commend him for his leadership on it.\n  I also want to make it clear on the CRA, at some point it is going to \nget to conference. I do support what Senator Gramm is doing to provide \nexemptions to banks under $100 million. Under urgings, I had \nconversations with my larger banks who do not find themselves with the \nkind of difficulties of being coerced into making payments, as he noted \nexists in other parts of the country. While I support under 100, I do \nnot support the other changes that are being proposed.\n  As to this amendment, the takings issue, Congress does this all the \ntime. In fact, my guess is there could be people who make a claim that \nbecause the bill itself is passing, they are going to suffer a loss of \nvalue in their business.\n  Gosh, we debate the ethanol provision and we debate tax credits for \nthe oil industry all the time. Sometimes you get it, sometimes you do \nnot get it, but you do not file a claim against the Government as a \nconsequence of that action.\n  People could file a takings action against this bill based upon what \nthe Senator from Texas just argued. The Winstar case does not open up \nthe door. Indeed, the Winstar case is being appealed itself. The \nWinstar case does not open up the door to prevent Congress from passing \nlegislation in trying to modernize our banking system.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Does the Senator not agree that the Winstar case was a \ncontract violation case as opposed to the statutory change of \nregulation being proposed here?\n  Mr. KERREY. I quite agree. Not only is it a contract case, but the \ndecision by the D.C. Court of Claims is on appeal. We do not know what \nthe outcome is going to be. It was a specific contract that was signed \nbetween the Government and these businesses. They have a legitimate \ncase that they are making that a contract was broken.\n  If the takings argument is going to provoke a fear every single time \nCongress proposes a change in the law, it is going to make it awfully \ndifficult for Congress to do the very thing that the Senator from \nTexas, the Senator from Maryland, and the Banking Committee is \nproposing to us, which is that we ought to modernize our banking \nsystem. There will be losers as a consequence.\n\n  Can you imagine coming to the floor and saying, we cannot pass fast \ntrack? There are losers when we have free trade. So if I vote for fast \ntrack, and we give the President normal trade negotiating authority, \nand somebody\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\nloses, can they file a claim as a consequence and say I have taken \ntheir property? No.\n  So I appreciate very much some of the other arguments the Senator \nfrom Texas is making, but I think the takings argument would cause this \nCongress a great deal of difficulty. In fact, we should withdraw the \nbill altogether if takings is the concern that we have, because there \nwill be losers. There will be economic losers as a consequence of this \npiece of legislation who could, if they chose to, file a takings action \nbased upon the argument that was made earlier.\n  This is a fairly simple amendment. I urge colleagues to look at it. \nThe concern that the Senator from Texas is raising may be a legitimate \nconcern. Some of the details he was talking about may need to be \nmodified. But we are saying that, ``Notwithstanding paragraph (3), no \ncompany may directly or indirectly, including through any merger, \nconsolidation, or other type of business combination, acquire control \nof a savings association after May . . . unless the company is engaged, \ndirectly or indirectly (including through a subsidiary other than a \nsavings association). . . .''\n  It is an attempt to say, yes, we needed to do what the Senator from \nTexas described earlier in order to be able to clean up the savings and \nloan problem.\n  We make no judgment here that the unitary thrifts are not safe or \nsound. We have an outstanding one in the State of Nebraska that is \ndoing a tremendous amount of business, and they are a very safe \noperation, very sound operation. We make no judgment about that at all. \nBut we are just saying the Banking Committee already has spoken on the \nissue by eliminating the commercial market basket.\n  What we are doing with this is to prevent further kinds of \ntransactions precisely because we are ending the restrictions that were \nunder Glass-Steagall for 60 years. We are eliminating those. We are \ngoing to get all kinds of new transactions going on in that environment \nanyway. We are concerned about whether or not we are going to maintain \nsafety and soundness.\n  I believe we can. I believe we can in the new regulatory environment. \nI am willing to do that. But this just adds considerable new risk to \nthe transaction, considerable new risk. I believe the Office of Thrift \nSupervision is down to about 1,200 employees. I am not sure they have \nthe capacity to regulate. It provokes a whole new concern about this \nlegislation, as to whether or not we are going to be able to maintain \nthe safety and soundness that the people of the United States of \nAmerica expect.\n  To be clear, I have not had a single citizen in Nebraska come to me \nand say, ``I need financial services modernization''--that is, \nborrowers and depositors. Indeed, I have only a few banks in Nebraska \naltogether that are interested in this. The people who are interested \nin this are people who are much larger operators. They have come to me \nand asked my support for this legislation, and I have given it to them. \nI do not believe there is any more reason for us to maintain these \nbarriers between these various industries. But we need to be very \ncareful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. KERREY. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield the Senator 30 more seconds.\n  Mr. KERREY. I believe we need to be very careful not to increase, in \nan unnecessary fashion, that risk. And this amendment will reduce that \nrisk. It will not increase takings claims against the Government. It \nwill not increase litigation as a consequence of saying that we are not \ngoing to allow continued and new unitary thrift acquisition and new \ncommercial interests to come in and purchase savings and loans.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the fine work the Senator from Texas has \ndone and the Senator from Maryland has done. I hope we can get this \nlegislation in a form that I can support, because I believe financial \nservices modernization is something that has long been needed and is \nlong overdue.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Gramm has 6 minutes 20 seconds; the \nSenator from South Dakota has 17 minutes 9 seconds.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague and cosponsor of this \namendment, Senator Thomas from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank you very much for the \nopportunity to discuss this important issue.\n  First, let me, too, say that I appreciate the work that is being done \non this whole financial modernization bill. I think it is something \nthat certainly needs to be done and that I support.\n  I also believe very strongly in what the Senator from Nebraska has \njust said with regard to takings--that the idea that we cannot change \nthe rules in the Congress without it being exposed to takings is one \nthat is very threatening. I think that is the case.\n  So I am very pleased to be a sponsor of this thrift charter amendment \nwith my colleagues, Senator Johnson and Senator Kerrey. I think the \namendment will improve the underlying legislation by stopping a mixture \nof banking and commerce through the unitary thrift charter arrangement.\n  This amendment freezes the number of commercially owned thrifts and \nbans the future number of sales of unitary thrift charters to \ncommercial entities. Commercial firms that already own thrifts would be \nable to continue the endeavor, and they are grandfathered.\n  The integration of banking and commerce raises significant questions \nabout the concentration of economic resources. I happen to be chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific Rim and have had some \nopportunities recently to be in South Korea and Japan. I have to tell \nyou that I am impressed with the problems they have had with that kind \nof integration, and I do not want us to get into that.\n  I have already mentioned that I do not believe this is a taking. I \nbelieve this is actually a change in direction, one that very much \nneeds to be made, and I think it will help us in terms of this mixing \nof banking and commerce. It is a significant cause for the Asian \neconomic crisis.\n  I believe we should learn from the lessons of the Asia financial \ncrisis and be very careful about this integration. I think this will \nhelp do that.\n  In testimony before the Banking Committee last year, Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan spoke to the risks that can arise if the \nrelationships continue between banking and commercial firms. Both he \nand Secretary Rubin have testified to the need for closing the \nloophole. This amendment secures the safety and soundness of our \nfinancial system, and I urge that it be supported.\n\n  Let me just comment on some things that very knowledgeable people \nhave said.\n  Secretary Rubin has said:\n\n       [W]e support the prohibition against forming additional \n     unitary holding companies, and [we] would further support an \n     amendment terminating the grandfather rights. . . .\n\n  Former Federal Reserve Board Governor Paul Volcker said:\n\n       Recent experience with the banking crises in countries as \n     different in their stages of development as Japan, Indonesia, \n     and Russia demonstrates the folly of permitting industrial-\n     financial conglomerates to dominate financial markets and \n     potentially larger areas of the economy.\n\n  The American Bankers Association, which has studied this very \ncarefully, said:\n\n       [C]ommercial and banking should not be allowed to mix in \n     the wholesale fashion permitted under the unitary thrift \n     concept. . . .\n\n  The Independent Bankers Association of America said:\n\n       IBAA cannot support, and will oppose, any legislation that \n     does not narrow the unitary thrift holding company loophole.\n\n  The Consumers Union said:\n\n       We oppose permitting federally-insured institutions to \n     combine with commercial interests because of the potential to \n     skew the availability of credit. . . .\n\n  I close by saying that a mixture of banking and commerce is widely \nconsidered to be a significant cause of the recent Asian economic \ncrisis. As Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified last \nyear before the Senate Banking Committee:\n\n       The Asia crisis has highlighted some of the risks that can \n     arise if relationships between banks and commercial firms are \n     too close.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope we will adopt this amendment. I think it \nstrengthens\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\nthe overall bill. I certainly intend to support the bill and intend to \nsupport this amendment. I urge support of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield 5 minutes to my ranking member of the committee, \nSenator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I commend the very able Senator from South Dakota and \nhis colleague from Wyoming for offering this amendment. I think it is a \nvery important amendment. They have made some very strong arguments for \nit.\n  Both Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin, who differ on other \naspects of this legislation that is before us, are in agreement, along \nwith Chairman Volcker and Henry Kaufman, and many others who have \nexamined this issue, that we need to address this question.\n  It is called the unitary thrift loophole, because over time the \npowers of the thrifts have been expanded. So a provision, which at an \nearly time may not have appeared to be a loophole, now becomes a \nloophole through which commercial companies can acquire thrifts and, in \neffect, eliminate the line drawn between banking and commerce.\n  The recent experience with banking crises in other countries--Japan, \nKorea, and so forth--where they had industrial financial conglomerates, \nindicates the difficulties and the dangers of allowing these \narrangements.\n  I want to address very specifically the argument of limiting the \ntransferability of a unitary thrift holding company--and this would \nlimit it only in terms of being transferred to a commercial company; it \nwould not limit it in terms of being transferred to a financial \ncompany. It would be unfair because companies bought thrifts at a time \nwhen they could sell them to any commercial company, and it is now \nbeing asserted that this would be a taking under the fifth amendment of \nthe Constitution or perhaps, alternatively, a breach of contract by the \ngovernment.\n\n  You cannot keep people from making any argument that is available to \nthem. They can sort of reach out and grab hold of any argument that \nexists and sort of bring it in and try to set it down here in the \nmiddle of the Senate and say, aha, here is this argument and you have \nto pay attention to it.\n  You need to look at the argument and what is involved.\n  Let me just for a moment analyze this argument that it is a taking. \nThe Supreme Court's rulings in the area of the fifth amendment takings \nof property have generally dealt with real property, not with business \ncharters issued by the government, such as a thrift charter. However, \neven if a thrift charter did qualify as property for taking purposes, \nprohibiting transfers of thrifts to commercial companies would not give \nrise to liability under the standards which the courts have used to \nrequire compensation.\n  It is being asserted here that this is going to be a taking; you are \ngoing to have to pay compensation. Then you have to take a look at it. \nIs this limitation that is involved in this amendment, this limited \nlimitation with respect to the transferability of this thrift, is that \ngoing to be considered a taking by the court? I submit it would not \ngive rise to liability under the standards which the courts have used \nto require compensation. Courts have held that no compensation is owed \nif there is not an invasion of the property or a total diminution of \neconomic value of the property. Closing the loophole would not involve \neither of these two things.\n  There is a considerable value in the thrift charter which would \ncontinue even if this limited amount of transferability is no longer \npermitted. In fact, these thrifts may be sold to thousands of other \nthrifts, banks, securities broker dealers, insurance companies and \nother financial companies under this legislation. Of course, this is \nthe very kind of transfer that occurs in the vast majority of thrift \ntransfers. It is to some other financial institution.\n  Of course, the legislation would permit that, and this amendment does \nnot touch that. The potential for change in the powers of a unitary \nthrift holding company is in fact inherent in having an S charter. \nThe holder of a federally granted charter cannot expect that the \ngovernment will never change the laws under which the charter operates. \nThe Constitution does not guarantee that a company allowed to engage in \nsome activity will have the right to continue to do so in perpetuity.\n  I am as sensitive as any to the takings question. It is a very \nimportant part of our Constitution. It is an important part of the \nworkings of our economic system. But we need to look at the cases in \nterms of what the court has interpreted as constitutional. We need to \nexercise some practical sense judgments. Clearly, the law has never \nbeen that a company engaged in some activities can never be limited or \nrestrained by the government and has that right to go on in perpetuity. \nIn the past, Congress has changed statutes governing savings \nassociations and has required compliance with the amended statute.\n\n  In 1987, Congress imposed a qualified thrift lender test requiring \nthrifts to hold a percentage of their total assets as qualified thrift \ninvestments. New requirement. New limitation. A unitary thrift holding \ncompany owning a thrift that failed to comply with those new \nrequirements would have been required to divest its commercial \nactivities.\n  Also in 1987, we limited the transferability of nonbank banks by \nrequiring that upon transfer the new owner bank would be required to \nregister as a bank holding company. These actions have not been found \nto be takings.\n  Let me turn to the other possible argument; that is, that there is a \nbreach of contract by the government.\n  The argument has been raised that closing the loophole may break a \nsupposed contract. The Winstar case, U.S. v. Winstar Corporation et al, \n518 U.S. 839, a 1996 case, has been used as a basis for this concern. \nHowever, closing the unitary thrift loophole involves facts that are \nmaterially different from those on which the case of U.S. v. Winstar \nCorporation was decided. In Winstar, the Supreme Court determined that \nthe United States had made specific contractual promises to acquirers \nof failed thrifts and had breached those specific contractual promises.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time does the Senator have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 17 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me 2 more minutes?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield such time as the gentleman requires.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The court found the government liable for breaching its \ncontracts by not permitting the thrifts to count goodwill and capital \ncredits toward regulatory capital requirements after the enactment of \nFIRREA. There had been a specific undertaking in the S cases that \nthose goodwill arrangements could be counted and, in fact, they \nwouldn't have taken over the failed thrifts had they not been able to \ndo so.\n  It is vastly different from the situation that we are confronting \nhere.\n  There are no specific contracts here that promise acquirers of \nthrifts that they could sell them to commercial companies or that the \nlaw governing permissible thrift affiliations would never change. \nProhibiting unitaries from affiliating with commercial companies is no \ndifferent than many prohibitions the government legislatively imposes \non industries each year with no financial liability to the government.\n  The difference with the supervisory goodwill cases couldn't be \nclearer. Those cases were based upon contract law. No contracts are \ninvolved in the unitary provisions of H.R. 10. No guarantee was made by \nanyone that these affiliations with a commercial firm could continue \nand the government is entitled, in order to achieve important public \npolicy objectives, to make reasonable changes. I submit to you that \nthis is one such reasonable change in order to ensure that the dividing \nline between banking and commerce remain firm.\n  All of the people have told us about the dangers of mixing banking \nand commerce. From the Fed, Alan Greenspan says:\n\n       Failure to close this loophole now would allow the \n     conflicts inherent in banking and commerce combinations to \n     further develop in our economy and complicate efforts to \n     create a fair and level playing field for all financial \n     service providers.\n\n  Secretary Rubin has echoed those comments, as has Paul Volcker and \nmany other distinguished commentators.\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time. How much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes 26 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 6 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Six minutes. I yield 2 minutes of it to the distinguished \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, 2 minutes is all I will need.\n  In a perfect world, I would oppose the amendment with respect to the \nunitary thrift situation, but as the Senator from Texas has made clear, \nwe do not live in a perfect theoretical world. We have existing \ninstitutions who have obligations to their shareholders and who have \npast history. However much I might like to see the past history be \ndifferent, it is as it is.\n  Under those circumstances, I think we cannot penalize people who have \ngone forward on assurances from the Federal Government and say that \nthose assurances will not now be honored just because we do not think \nthey should have been given in the first place.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I will be joining with the chairman \nof the committee and voting as he does on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as a courtesy to Senator Johnson, let me \nconclude my remarks, and then let him give the concluding remarks on \nthe amendment.\n  First of all, we have had several references to the Asian crisis. I \nwant to remind my colleagues that the Asian crisis was banking and \ngovernment, not banking and commerce.\n  The second point is that Ford Motors, for example, at the strong \nurging of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, put a billion dollars into \nNationwide in the 1980s, and that billion dollars reduced the amount \nthe taxpayer had to pay to guarantee those deposits by a billion \ndollars.\n  Here is the point. Nobody makes you go into some industry where your \ntax laws might be changed ex post facto. I am not for ex post facto \nlaws, but we have passed them from time to time. But in this case, \nthese thrifts were requested, asked, begged to make investments in the \nS industry for the benefit of the taxpayer and the insurance fund. I \njust want to read a couple of lines from some letters.\n  This is from the National Retail Federation:\n\n       Seventy-nine failing thrifts were purchased and infused \n     with $3 billion of new capital. Had these institutions \n     undergone liquidation at taxpayers' expense, the cost would \n     have been billions more. Capital from our industries looked \n     pretty good at the time. We don't see what has changed.\n\n  They put up $3 billion to go into industries that let them be in \nretailing and in the S business, and now we are going to say to them, \nif you sell your holding company, you are going to have to tear up your \nbusiness, drive down its value by 10 or 15 percent. They don't \nunderstand how we changed the rules of the game when they were asked to \nget into the business.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers wrote:\n\n       Unitary thrifts were established in 1967 to attract private \n     capital into the thrift industry during the thrift crisis. \n     The National Association of Manufacturers' members responded, \n     saving the taxpayer billions of dollars. Putative \n     grandfathering of existing unitary thrifts serves only to \n     eliminate competition and innovation.\n\n  I could read from the Home Builders, and others, but the bottom line \nis this: These companies have a case that they were urged to invest \nthis money by the Government based on a set of rules. If we now come in \nand change the value of their companies on the equity market \ninstantaneously by 10 or 20 percent, I believe there has been a taking, \nand I think most people would believe there has been a taking. As we \nall know, the Supreme Court has been increasingly willing in cases such \nas Lucas v. South Carolina and Dolan v. City to rule on takings, and to \nforce the Federal Government to pay for it.\n  So if this amendment is adopted, I believe it would probably be \nprudent to have a second-degree amendment, which I hope would be agreed \nto, which would simply say that if there are court rulings that there \nhas been a takings, we should raise the fees for the insurance fund to \npay those costs, rather than letting those costs fall on the taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I commend the chairman for his work on \nthe differential issue, which was originally a component of the \nJohnson-Thomas amendment. But we need to go further. It is an \nopportunity for this body to implement a financial services policy \nconsistent with where both the banking and consumer organizations of \nthe country want to go to implement policy that is agreed upon, in the \nagreed-upon direction that Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rubin want to go. This \nis an opportunity that we cannot allow to be missed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from South \nDakota because the amendment, as he was going to originally propose it, \nincluded this closing of the unitary thrift company loophole but \nmaintained the existing law on the differential payment by the S's \nand the banks. The chairman offered that and it was accepted earlier \nthis morning. I think the fact that it was embraced--and I think the \nadoption of that amendment should be taken in the context of this \namendment--reflects an effort to come up with a very balanced approach \non the part of the able Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator. It would seem to me at this point \nthere is no constitutional mandate that for some reason we must go down \nthe road of mixing banking and commerce, that that is some of an \nirretrievable decision that is made and we are unable now to change \nthat policy. This is an opportunity, I believe, to do what needs to be \ndone in this legislation. One, to strike the provision of the bill \nwhich would, as it stands, permit commercial firms to acquire any of \nthe 500 existing unitary thrift holding companies. And our amendment \ninserts a provision to allow existing unitary thrift holding companies \nto be transferred only to financial firms.\n  There are thousands of financial firms. The marketability of these \nunitary thrifts will remain high; there is no question about that. So I \nbelieve this is an amendment that is badly needed if this bill is going \nto ultimately be signed by the President. But it is also an amendment \nthat is necessary for us to embark on what I think is a sensible and \nprudent fiscal policy, financial policy for this country. I ask support \nfor the Johnson-Thomas amendment.\n  I yield back such time as I may have remaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \ndebate time on the pending amendment, it be temporarily set aside and \nthe vote occur on or in relation to the Johnson amendment No. 309 at \n3:45.\n  Let me also say, in fairness to Senator Johnson, why don't we have 5 \nminutes each at that point. We can probably do it a little faster. \nWould 3 minutes work for the Senator?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Two or 3 minutes would be fine.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask that we have 3 minutes each prior to the vote to \ngive each side an opportunity to restate the issue at that point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I could put a question to the chairman. There would \nbe no intervening business between now and the vote on or in relation \nto the Johnson amendment, other than the debate time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That's correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No intervening business with respect to this amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Right. We are going to do a lot of other business, though.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we have come to the point where we \nare ready to begin debate on the question of whether or not banks \nshould be able to provide broad financial services within the bank \nitself, or whether it should do so outside the bank. So let me request \nthat Senator Shelby and\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\nall those who wish to debate this issue come over. I am going to \nsuggest the absence of a quorum for 15 minutes or so to give everybody \nan opportunity to come over.\n  I am hopeful that with a good outcome on this coming vote, we will be \nwell on our way to passing this bill. I urge, again, anyone who has an \namendment, Senator Sarbanes and I are willing to look at them to see if \nwe can take them, so please let us see that amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this week I addressed the Economic \nClub of Detroit, one of the most influential groups of community \nleaders in my State. I expressed the depth of my continuing concern \nabout the level of violence in our society, particularly youth \nviolence. I committed myself to continue to speak out against the easy \naccess to guns, especially by young people. I intend to comment on this \nsubject every week in the Senate, when the Senate is in session, to \nhighlight the need of our Nation to face this critical issue, to \ndiscuss the growing crisis fueled by weapons among our young people, \nand to urge action to meet our responsibility in the Senate to work \ntowards solutions.\n  There is no one cause of youth violence. The causes are many. But \namong them there is one that cannot be ignored or denied, the easy \naccess to deadly weapons for our young people. If we are honest with \nourselves, we will admit it is too easy for children to get their hands \non guns because we made it too easy to get guns, period; too easy to \nget guns that have nothing to do with the needs of hunters and \nsportsmen, guns that are too often used to kill people.\n  Yes, we have all heard the glib rhetoric of the NRA, that ``guns \ndon't kill people, people kill people.'' This bumper-sticker logic \nobscures the real truth. People with guns kill people, and they do it \nsome 35,000 times a year in this country. That is more deaths than we \nsuffered in the 3-year-long Korean war. The number of times that \nhandguns were used to commit murder is itself staggering, some 9,300 \ntimes in the United States in 1996. In that same year in Japan, a \nnation almost half our size, there were 15 murders with handguns--just \n15 handgun murders for a country with half our population. There were \n9,300 murders here in the United States.\n  We have every right as parents and as consumers to expect some \nresponsibility from the entertainment industry. But I am told Japanese \npopular culture is even more violent than our own.\n  However severe this plague of gun violence is for society as a whole, \nfor the young it is far worse. For young males, the firearm death rate \nis nearly twice that of all other diseases combined. A National Centers \nfor Disease Control study found 2 of every 25 high school students \nreported having carried a gun in the previous 30 days. If those numbers \nwere evenly distributed among communities and schools, that would mean \nthat in the average classroom, two students have carried guns at some \ntime in the previous month.\n  These figures are shocking, but they are hardly secret. We have grown \nso accustomed to the carnage that guns cause in America that only the \nmost horrific acts of violence are capable of shaking us from our \nslumber. As I told the Economic Club of Detroit, the question we have \nto ask ourselves in the wake of the Columbine High School tragedy is: \nAre we willing to say that enough is enough? And will we say it not \njust today but next week and next month and next year?\n  The NRA is betting we will not. They believe their brand of single-\nminded, single-issue politics can once again paralyze us from acting, \nonce these images of death and pain in Colorado fade from view. They \nare going to go on telling their members that even the most measured \ngun control proposal is a thinly veiled attempt to take away their \nlegitimate hunting weapons. It will not stop there. They will use that \nmembership as a potent political tool to intimidate candidates for \noffice. It is a sad fact that, thus far, too many Americans and too \nmany American children and their parents live in fear of gun violence \nbecause too many of us in Washington live in fear of the political \npower of the lobbyists of the NRA.\n\n  I believe there is also a power when people unite to demand action--\nbusinesspeople, labor union people, parents, teachers, police officers, \nyoung people, the clergy. When I look at the kind of coalition that \ncould be represented by groups like that, I see a potential power that \ncould dwarf any narrow special interest. The question is not whether we \nare in the majority. The polls show that a large majority of Americans \nwill support strong action to reduce access of minors to guns. The \nquestion is not whether we have the power. We do. The question is \nwhether we are willing to act to make America a safer country. For \nstarters, we must ban the possession and sale of handguns, \nsemiautomatic weapons, by and to minors.\n  We paused in this Chamber to observe a moment of silence in honor of \nthe victims of gun violence in Colorado. We observe these moments of \nsilence to pay tribute to those who have died and to express our \nsympathy for their loved ones. But now, with this latest tribute behind \nus, we need to be anything but silent. Those of us who want to act to \nreduce the gun violence need to be louder and clearer and stronger and, \nyes, more persistent than the NRA.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have sought recognition, because I \nintend to offer a couple of amendments to the pending legislation. I \nwould like to discuss the underlying bill just a bit more, and then \nalso offer the amendments and discuss the amendments.\n  I spoke earlier today about this legislation, which is called the \nFinancial\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\nServices Modernization Act of 1999, and said then that I am probably \npart of a very small minority in this Chamber, but I feel very strongly \nthat this is exactly the wrong bill at exactly the wrong time. It \nmisses all the lessons of the past and, in my judgment, it creates \ndefinitions and moves in directions that will be counterproductive to \nour financial future.\n  What does this bill do? It would permit common ownership of banks, \ninsurance, and securities companies, and to a significant degree \ncommercial firms as well. It will permit bank holding companies, \naffiliates, and bank subsidiaries to engage in a smorgasbord of \nexpanded financial activities, including insurance and securities \nunderwriting, and merchant banking all under the same roof.\n  This bill will also, in my judgment, raise the likelihood of future \nmassive taxpayer bailouts. It will fuel the consolidation and mergers \nin the banking and financial services industry at the expense of \ncustomers, farm businesses, family farmers, and others, and in some \ninstances I think it inappropriately limits the ability of the banking \nand thrift institution regulators from monitoring activities between \nsuch institutions and their insurance or securities affiliates and \nsubsidiaries raising significant safety and soundness consumer \nprotection concerns.\n  This morning I described what is happening in the financial services \nsector by showing a chart of big bank mergers just in the last year. \nYou couldn't help but to have picked up a daily paper at some point \nlast year and read a headline about another bank deciding to combine or \nmerge with another large bank.\n  April 6, Citicorp decided it was going to grab up Travelers Group and \nhave a $698 billion combined asset corporation--not exactly a mom and \npop, but two big very successful companies decide they want to get \nhitched.\n  NationsBank apparently fell in love with BankAmerica. Bank One \ndecided it wanted to be related to First Chicago, and Wells Fargo likes \nNorWest. So we have merger after merger, buyout after buyout, and the \nbig banks get bigger.\n  We already have a circumstance in this free market economy of ours in \nwhich you ought to have easy entry and easy exit into the marketplace \nand the right to make money and to lose money. We already have a \ncircumstance in banking called ``too big to fail.'' If you are big \nenough, the ordinary market rules don't apply to you. You have the old \nFederal Reserve Board out there. And the Fed says we have a list of \nbanks that are ``too big to fail,'' meaning they have become so big \nthat if they were to fail and made some pretty dumb decisions, lose a \nlot of money, that their failure would be so catastrophic and such a \nshock to the economic system in this country that we couldn't possibly \nlet that happen. So we have a list of banks at the Federal Reserve \nBoard. That list says these banks are ``too big to fail''--no-fault \ncapitalism. But the list is growing. That list of ``too big to fail'' \nbanks in America is growing because the big banks are getting bigger, \nand this record-breaking orgy of mergers in our country moves now at an \naccelerated rate unabated.\n  In the context of all of this--it is not just with banks but all \nfinancial services companies--at a time when banks, investment banks, \nunderwriters of securities, insurance, and others are showing very \nhandsome profits in our country, we are told, ``You know, what is \nreally wrong here with America is we need to modernize this system. The \nlack of modernization is hurting us. In fact, some U.S. banks are able \nto do things overseas they can't do here. What a shame. It is awful to \nhold them back,'' we are told. ``So let us modernize.''\n\n  In ranching parlance, this would be like if the horse gets out of the \nbarn, you decide, ``Let's find out where the horse is and build a new \nbarn around the horse.'' That is what this is all about. Where I grew \nup we raised horses. When a horse got out of the barn, you know what we \ndid. We went and chased the horse, caught the horse, and brought the \nhorse back to the barn. That is not rocket science. I didn't have to \ntake a lot of school courses to teach me that. You go bring the horse \nback.\n  But now, what they have decided is no. We will just decide, all \nright, the horses are out of the barn, and in the way things are \nsupposed to work, in a manner that preserves safety and soundness of \nour banks, in a manner that preserves separation of certain kinds of \nactivities--some that are inherently risky as opposed to those that \nrequire safety and soundness--things have happened. We are persuaded to \nget rid of all of the old rules, and we will rewrite them in a way that \ncircumstances and activities have been happening in our country. We'll \nsay those who have done it, OK, that is where you are, a new day, we \nwill call it modernization. We will just say it is just fine. Well, it \nis not fine with me.\n  It is interesting that we live in 1999, now in the month of May, \nhaving experienced this remarkable economy. I am one who, with all of \nmy colleagues, would say what a remarkable opportunity, to live in an \neconomy that has virtually no inflation, has virtually full employment, \nseems to have economic growth that continues unabated, and whose stock \nmarket continues to set new records--23 days, another 1,000 points. You \nget the feeling, gee, the stock market is like one of those slot \nmachines that pays off every time you pull the handle. Every time you \nput a quarter in you get a return back beyond what you put in.\n  There are people who have begun to invest in this economy of ours \nthrough mutual funds, and in the markets and so on who apparently \nbelieve there is only one direction for our economy and only one \ndirection for our markets, and that is up, and single digit returns are \nnot sufficient. Returns are now expected of 15, 20, 25, 30 percent a \nyear. Of course, that will not continue.\n  We want a country with the twin economic goals of stable prices, full \nemployment, and economic opportunity and growth. But we have been \nthrough periods in this country where when you sit down and add things \nup somehow the answer doesn't seem correct. This isn't all going to \ncontinue. One day in one way there will be adjustments. Companies \nselling 300 and 400 times earnings, we think that is going to continue? \nI don't think so.\n  What has happened in recent years in this country, despite all of the \ngood news, is a series of economic activities by firms that 20 and 40 \nyears ago would never have thought of engaging in those activities, and \nthose activities which really represent kind of a new form of gambling \nby firms that should not be involved in gambling represents now an \nacceptable kind of behavior.\n  Let me give you some examples of some of it. I started this morning. \nBut I am going to read a bit more, because I think it is important for \neverybody to understand and hear this.\n  I mentioned ``too big to fail''--big banks that have become so big \nthat our Government says they can't be allowed to fail. Of course, we \ncontinue then every day to see more mergers to allow more banks to join \nthat ``too big to fail'' list.\n  It is not just the banks. I want to read the story again of Long Term \nCapital Management in an article from the Wall Street Journal last \nfall, because I think it is illustrative of not just what is happening \nat this moment in this chapter of our history but also what happened in \n1994 with the massive losses across our country in derivatives \ndescribed in this Fortune article, ``The Risk That Won't Go Away,'' \n``Financial derivatives tightening their grip on the world economy, and \nno one knows how to control them.''\n  Derivatives, unregulated hedge funds, banks, holding companies that \nnow fuse and merge, banks underwriting securities, insurance--is all of \nthat a cause for concern?\n  Let me read a couple of things and see whether perhaps this can be \ninterpreted in a manner differently than those who have drafted the \ncurrent legislation.\n  It is not a secret that I have said I think this current bill, the \nunderlying bill, financial modernization for 1999, is a terrible bill. \nI don't mean disrespect to either the chairman of the committee or the \nranking member of the committee. I don't mean any disrespect to them.\n  This is moving this country in the wrong direction. This is terrible \nlegislation to be considering at this point.\n  Long Term Capital Management is a private company; big investors, all \nrich. You have to be rich to invest in\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\nLong Term Capital Management. You have to be smart. A smart operator \nwith lots of money formed a private company called Long Term Capital \nManagement and began betting. I will describe the bets in a moment.\n\n       It was Aug. 21, [last year] a sultry Friday, and nearly \n     half the partners at Long-Term Capital Management LP were out \n     of the office.\n\n  Inside, the associates that day logged on to their computer and they \nsaw something that began to strike some fear in their hearts:\n\n       U.S. Treasuries were skyrocketing, throwing their \n     relationship to other securities out of whack. The Dow Jones \n     Industrial Average was swooning--by noon, down 283 points. \n     The European bond market was in shambles. LTCM's [Long-Term \n     Capital Management, this hedge firm, their] bets were blowing \n     up, and no one could do anything about it.\n       By 11 a.m. [in the morning] the fund had lost $150 million \n     in a wager [they made] on the prices of two telecommunication \n     stocks engaged in a takeover. Then, a single bet tied to the \n     U.S. bond market lost $100 million. Another $100 million \n     evaporated [the next hour] in a similar trade in Britain. By \n     day's end [this private hedge company] LTCM had hemorrhaged \n     half a billion dollars. Its equity had sunk to $3.1 billion--\n     down a third for the year.\n\n  This is the Wall Street Journal's recount of the story:\n\n       Partners scrambled out of their offices and onto the \n     trading floor as associates stared at their screens in \n     disbelief. Making frantic phone calls around the globe, they \n     reached John Meriwether, the fund's founder, at a dinner in \n     Beijing. He boarded the next plane to the U.S. Eric \n     Rosenfeld, a top lieutenant, called in from Sun Valley, \n     Idaho, where he was settling in for a vacation. He left his \n     wife and children behind and made an all-night trip back to \n     Greenwich.\n\n  Then the brass assembled the next morning. It is 7 o'clock now, 7 \na.m. on Sunday.\n\n       One after another, LTCM's partners, calling in from Tokyo \n     and London, reported that their market had dried up. There \n     were no buyers, no sellers. It was all but impossible to \n     maneuver out of large trading bets [that they had.] They had \n     seen nothing like it.\n       The carnage that weekend set off events unprecedented in \n     the world of high finance, culminating with a $3.625 billion \n     bailout funded by a consortium of 14 Wall Street banks and \n     engineered by the Federal Reserve [Board.] LTCM lost more \n     than 90 percent of its assets by the time it was bailed out, \n     and the markets were roiled for weeks. Longer term, it forced \n     many of the world's most sophisticated institutional \n     investors to redefine the ways they manage risk and triggered \n     calls for tougher regulation of hedge funds, those \n     freewheeling investment pools that cater to the wealthy.\n\n  Here is a company that lost $3.6 billion. What happened? It gets \nbailed out in a consortium of banks investing at the behest of the \nFederal Reserve Board at meetings arranged by the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n  We will hear a bit more about this case because it relates to an \namendment I will be offering.\n\n       In an industry populated by sharp money managers, LTCM had \n     the most renowned of all--including Nobel Prize winners \n     Robert Merton and Myron Scholes. But in the end, it wasn't \n     all rocket science. It was about smart marketing-appealing to \n     a wealthy clientele who wanted to be able to say their money \n     was being managed by a passel of Ph.D.s. And it was about \n     massive borrowing, up to $50 for every dollar invested. Long-\n     Term Capital Management was, ultimately, like a supermarket--\n     a high-volume, low-margin business, trying to eke out \n     small profits from thousands of individual transactions.\n       ``Myron once told me they are sucking up nickels from all \n     over the world,'' says Merton Miller, a University of Chicago \n     business professor and himself a Nobel Prize winner in \n     economics.\n\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       ``But because they are so leveraged, that amounts to a lot \n     of money.''\n       All of which helps to explain how so many geniuses, \n     sometimes overcoming divisions within their ranks, got it so \n     wrong. And all the while, vanity, greed and a cult of \n     personality blinded some of the world's most reputable \n     financial institutions, from Wall Street stalwarts to Swiss \n     banks, to the pitfalls inherent in such a strategy.\n\n  The reason I offer this is to say we are now talking today on the \nfloor of the Senate about a strategy that says we want to ignore the \nlessons of history. We want to ignore the fact that in the go-go 1920s, \neverybody was making money at about everything, and banks decided to \nfuse their activities and be involved not just in banking, but also in \nunderwriting securities and a range of other very risky enterprises. We \nare going to ignore those lessons we learned during that period.\n  When studies were done to determine what happened in the 1920s, one \nof the things they discovered was what you expect. If you have \nsomething called banks whose perception of safety and soundness is at \nthe root of their stability and viability, when banks are fusing their \nactivities with inherently risky activities--underwriting securities, \nfor example--ultimately those kinds of risks, those bets that exist, \novercome the perception and the reality of safety and soundness, and \npeople begin getting worried and nervous and pulling their money out of \nbanks and we have bank failures.\n  So the Congress in the 1930s passed a bill called Glass-Steagall \nwhich said: Learn the lessons; my gosh, let us not put activities \ntogether with banks that are so inherently risky. We should separate \nthem forever.\n  So we did. And we prohibited certain kinds of investment and \nacquisition by banks and required that certain enterprises do business \nand compete in their own sphere. Banks were prohibited from being \ninvolved in most of the securities issues, underwriting securities and \ninsurance and more.\n  Over the years that served this country pretty well. Banks have made \nthe case in recent years--and they are right about this--everybody else \nhas wanted to invade their territory. Everybody now wants to be a bank. \nIf you are selling cars, you want to finance the cars; you want to be a \nbank. Everybody wants to create some sort of homogenized one-stop \nstation where people can buy their insurance, buy their home, finance \nit. So banks say people are intruding on their turf and the only \nconceivable way we can compete is if we can compete on their turf as \nwell. They want Glass-Steagall repealed.\n  Guess what? Here it is. The bill that sits on the floor of the Senate \ntoday repeals Glass-Steagall. It forgets apparently 60 or 70 years of \nhistory. It will all be all right. Don't you see, the economy is \ngrowing, unemployment is down, inflation is down, the stock market is \nup. Don't you understand, Senator Dorgan?\n  I guess not. Maybe I am hopelessly old fashioned. I think it is a \nfundamental mistake to decide to repeal Glass-Steagall and allow banks \nand all of the other financial industries to merge into a giant \nsmorgasbord of financial services. Those who were around to vote to \nbail out the failed savings and loan industry, $500 billion of the \ntaxpayers' money, are they going to want to be around 10 or 15 years \nfrom now when we see bailouts of hedge funds putting banks at risk? Or \nhow about the banks not just bailing out a hedge fund but banks having \nthe ownership of the hedge funds?\n  That is what we have now. This bailout of Long Term Capital \nManagement says we have significant investments by some of the largest \nbanks in these hedge funds.\n  Or how about derivatives? I am not an expert in this area, but I \nwonder how many Members of this body know about derivatives. How many \nknow that banks in this country are trading in derivatives--not for \ncustomers, but in their own proprietary accounts? They could just as \nwell set up a bingo parlor in their lobby. They could just as well \ndecide to have a casino somewhere in their lobby. The kind of betting \nand wagering that is going on in proprietary trading of derivatives in \nan institution whose assets are guaranteed by the taxpayers of this \ncountry is just wrong. Someday somebody is going to wake up and say: \nWhy didn't we understand that? Why didn't we understand the \nconsequences of hundreds of billions of dollars or, yes, even trillions \nof dollars of wagers out there with deposits at risk? Why didn't we \nunderstand that did not make any sense?\n  I wrote an article about this in 1994 that was published in the \nWashington Monthly. At that point there were $35 trillion in \nderivatives being traded. Now it is $70 trillion. It is hard for me to \neven say the number; $70 trillion in derivatives. Does anybody here \nknow the exposure that exists in the largest banks of proprietary \ntrading on derivatives? I will bet not. Does anybody understand what \nthis bill does in these areas? It says: Hedge funds, we don't want to \nmanage those; let them go, let them do what they will. How about \nderivatives? It doesn't do anything.\n  This is a GAO report from May, 1994. It is 5 years ago: ``Financial \nDerivatives, Actions Needed To Protect The\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\nFinancial System.'' That report has been available for 5 years to all \nof the Members of Congress. If this legislation really was a \nmodernization bill for financial institutions, you would have a \nsolution to this issue in it. It would include my amendment that says \nno institution whose deposits are guaranteed by the American taxpayer \nwill trade derivatives in their proprietary accounts--none of them. We \nwill not allow gambling in the bank lobby. But of course the bill does \nnot have that, so I will offer the amendment and it will be defeated \nbecause it is not in vogue, it is not in fashion. This bill moves in \nthe other direction. It says, not only are things not wrong, don't be \nalarmed by hedge funds and derivatives; it says, let's just do more of \nwhat we have been doing that has caused some of this alarm.\n  As I mentioned, the piece of legislation before us repeals provisions \nof the Glass-Steagall Act that restrict the ability of banks and \nsecurity underwriters to affiliate with one another. The bill repeals \nprovisions in the Bank Holding Company Act by allowing a new category \nof financial holding company. This structure allows for a wide range of \nfinancial services to be affiliated, including commercial banking, \nsecurities underwriting, and merchant banking. And the new financial \nholding companies, by the way, may engage in the following: Lending and \nother traditional banking activities, insurance underwriting and agency \nactivities, provide financial investment and economic advisory \nservices, issue instruments representing interests in pooling of assets \nthat a bank may own directly, securities underwriting and dealing, and \nmutual fund distribution, merchant banking. I think most listening to \nme understand my concern and deep reservations about the direction we \nare heading.\n  What about timing? This bill almost came to the floor of the Senate \nlast year. I was one of those who objected, and as a result the \nlegislation was not enacted. In fact, some of the folks who bring it to \nthe floor today also objected because of some other issues. But it is \nnow on the floor. It is in a different form than was passed out by the \ncommittee last year. But what about timing? It seems to me the past \nexperiences we have had with banking and financial conglomerates in \nthis country in this century, whose collapse has led to the adoption of \nthe very financial protection laws they seek to repeal today, ought to \nbe a cautionary note to those of us in Congress and to the American \npeople. It seems to me the recent experiences we had with a nearly \n$500-billion bailout of a collapsed savings and loan industry ought to \nhave some consequences, at least in terms of awareness of those in \nCongress who had to go through that experience.\n\n  It seems to me the question marks that hang over the international \nmarketplace and the international economy ought to give pause to some--\na very difficult collapsed economy in some parts of Asia, a Russian \neconomy that has virtually collapsed, economic problems in other parts \nof the world, a description in the country of Japan of the keiretsu--\nthe circumstances in a market system in Japan where a keiretsu allows \nthe combining of virtually all economic activities into four or five \nfirms that work together as partners to accomplish ends; you put the \nbank and the manufacturer all together.\n  What has happened as a result of that Japanese experience? Would we \nwant to trade our economy for the Japanese economy? I don't think so. \nOne would think that would give some folks pause.\n  Or how about the red flags that ought to have been flying for all of \nus with respect to the regulators' recent experiences dealing with \nexcessive risk-taking in our system? Does it give anybody pause that on \na Sunday night some of the smartest folks, the folks who were viewed as \ngeniuses in New York, who put together this hedge fund, they had to be \nbailed out by the Federal Reserve Board running some folks across the \nstreet to convene an emergency meeting and then sitting there, \napparently convening a group in which substantial numbers of large \nbanks ante up billions of dollars to bail out a private firm? Is that a \nred flag for anybody? It suggests a conflict of interest for the \nFederal Reserve Board, of course, because they regulate the very banks \nthat were incentivized to ante up money to bail out a private firm in \norder to avoid some sort of economic catastrophe, an economic \ncatastrophe for the country. That is why the Fed was involved--because \nthis private firm, too, was too big to fail. Does that raise any red \nflags with anybody? It does with me.\n  Or we are told, if we do not do this, it is going to be a \ndisadvantage. To whom? Are the banks doing well in this country? You \nare darned right they are doing well, making lots of money. Security \nunderwriting firms, merchant banking firms, are we doing well? \nAmerica's corporations, are they doing well? Sure. Look at the stock \nmarket. Look at the profit reports. When we pass this bill, everybody \nin this Chamber knows what is going to happen. The first thing that is \ngoing to happen is, we are going to have more and more and more mergers \nbecause this turns on the green light at the intersection. It says if \nyou all want to get together and just get into one big financial swamp \nhere and have a smorgasbord of financial services, then buy each other \nup, that's just fine. This orgy of mergers we have already seen will \nsimply accelerate. Will that be good for this country? Of course not.\n  Those who preach the loudest about the free market system do the \nleast to protect it. I guarantee it is true. It has been true ever \nsince I came to the Congress. Those who bellow the loudest about the \nfree market do the very least in this country to protect it. We are \ngoing to have a fight a little later this year about antitrust \nenforcement. One way to be sure the free market remains free, open to \nfair, competitive competition, is to make sure you enforce your \nantitrust laws against cartels and monopolies. Interestingly enough, \nthose, again, who talk a lot about the free market are the least likely \nto be supportive of aggressive antitrust enforcement, to make sure the \nmarket is free, open, and competitive.\n  This is a highly complicated issue. I know there are big stakes all \naround. We have the biggest economic interests in the country working \nvery hard to see their interests are served versus other interests.\n  I understand all that, and I understand my view is not the prevailing \nview. George Gobel once said: ``Did you ever think the world was a \ntuxedo and you were a pair of brown shoes?'' I feel like George Gobel \non this issue.\n  I understand this bill is on the floor, and it is going to get passed \nby the Congress. People do not want to entertain this notion, that, \ngee, there might be some inherent risk out here. This is a case, as I \nsaid earlier, of deciding this is where the industry has decided it \nwants to go, so let's go ahead and put a lodge up so we can accommodate \nall their interests and where they want to be.\n  We have been through this before. Where they want to be is not \nnecessarily where this country ought to have them. This country ought \nto be concerned about safety and soundness of its financial \ninstitutions first and foremost. That does not fit--it has never fit--\nwith the understanding that you can merge the interests of banks and \nother financial and economic activities that are risky.\n  When you put things together that require safety and soundness with \nenterprises that have an inherent high risk, you are begging for \ntrouble, and this country will get it. Our banks say to us, ``Well, \nothers have done it; you can do it in other countries.'' Do you want to \ntrade our economy for any other country at the moment? I don't think \nso. What they are doing in other countries is not the litmus test for \nwhat we decide as Americans to do to strengthen our economy, and this \nbill, in my judgment, if passed, will represent a giant step backward \nfor our economy.\n  Let me ask one additional question. With all of the debate that I \nhave heard since this legislation came to the floor of the Senate, do \nyou know I have not heard anything about whether or why or if this bill \nis good for people. Nothing. I wonder if anybody can describe one \nsingle thing in this legislation that will be helpful to ordinary \nfolks?\n  This morning, I talked about the fact we have banks and credit card \ncompanies that are saying to their customers these days--it is 1999, so \nthings have changed. I wonder what my grandmother would think if she \nheard me\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\nsay there are banks and credit card companies saying to customers: If \nyou pay off your bill every month, we are going to penalize you.\n  Isn't that Byzantine--we are going to penalize you for paying off \nyour bill. In the old days, you got penalized for not paying your bill. \nNo, the way you make money is for people to carry over a balance and \ncharge a high interest rate. People who use a credit card to purchase \nevery month and pay the full bill off every month are not very good \ncustomers; credit card companies do not want those folks around.\n  I read some examples this morning of companies that say, ``Well, you \npeople, if you're going to pay off your bill like that, shame on you, \nwe're going to charge you a service charge.''\n  Shame on them. What has financial service come to with this sort of \nbehavior?\n  Another point. We have a circumstance in this country where --we are \ngoing to have a bankruptcy bill later this year, and we will have this \ndiscussion later--credit cards, of course, are distributed to everybody \nin America. I have a 12-year-old son. His name is Brendon. He is a \ngreat young guy, a wonderful baseball player. He is a great soccer \nplayer. He is a good student. For his benefit, I should say a great \nstudent, but he is a good student.\n  I can describe how wonderful he is in a thousand different ways, but \nhe is only 12. He received a letter in the mail one day from the Diners \nClub. The Diners Club said: Brendon Dorgan, we want to send you a \npreapproved Diners Club credit card. So my 12-year-old son appreciates \nDiners Club. I am sure he has an appetite to spend money. I see it from \ntime to time. It is normally not on big purchases. Normally it is \nsomething sweet or something that fizzes at the 7-Eleven, but my son \ndoes not need a Diners Club card.\n\n  Why would a 12-year-old get a Diners Club card? Why would Diners Club \nsend my son a card? Because they send everybody a card. I assume it was \na mistake, he got on the wrong list someplace. They send cards to \ncollege kids who have no income and no jobs and say, here is a \npreapproved bunch of credit for you; here is a card. It is just like a \ncheck. You go spend the money. We don't care you don't have a job. We \ndon't care you don't have an income. Here is our card. Take it, please.\n  That is what is going on in our country today--penalizing people for \npaying their bills, sending credit cards to 12-year-old kids, sending \ncredit cards to people who have no income or no job. Why, my \ngrandmother would be mortified to think that is the ethic we think \nmakes sense in this kind of an economy.\n  We cannot correct all of that in this discussion, but we can correct \na couple things. I described not my son's credit card solicitation; I \ndescribed derivatives traded on proprietary accounts in banks. I \ndescribed potential regulation of risky hedge funds. Those are two big \nissues and very complicated issues. We can correct that.\n  I intend to offer two amendments. I will send the first amendment to \nthe desk and then ask that it be set aside by consent, and then I will \nsend to the desk the second one and describe it. The committee chairman \nand ranking member will then proceed with the bill. They have other \namendments I know they are going to have to consider today. I know they \nwant to move ahead and finish whatever business they have with this \nlegislation.\n  My hope of hopes is enough Members of the Senate will take a look at \nthis bill in final form and say this is a terrible bill, a terrible \nidea coming at a terrible time, and enough Members would vote against \nit to say: This is not modernization, this is a huge step back in time, \nand a huge pit in which we have lost the lessons that we learned \nearlier in this century. I do not have great hope that will happen, \nbut, who knows, lightening strikes and perhaps at the end of this day, \nMembers of the Senate will say: You know, this wasn't such a good idea \nafter all.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 312\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit insured depository institutions and credit unions \n  from engaging in certain activities involving derivative financial \n                              instruments)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the first amendment that I send to the \ndesk is an amendment dealing with derivatives. I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will not explain this in great detail, \nexcept to say, as I described in my earlier remarks, my intention is to \nsay it is inconsistent with the obligations and our expectations of \ninstitutions whose deposits are insured by depository insurance and, in \nfact, guaranteed by the American taxpayer for them to be trading in \nderivatives on their own proprietary accounts.\n  I understand banks being a conduit for the trading of derivatives for \ncustomers, but for banks in their own proprietary accounts to be taking \nthe kinds of risks that exist in derivatives I think exposes all \ntaxpayers in this country who are the guarantors of that deposit \ninsurance to those kinds of risks. They may just as well put some kind \nof a slot machine in the lobby of a bank if they are going to trade in \nderivatives on their own account.\n  I say to the people who own the capital in these banks, if you want \nto gamble, go to Las Vegas. If you want to trade in derivatives, God \nbless you. Do it with your own money. Do not do it through the deposits \nthat are guaranteed by the American people and by deposit insurance. My \namendment prohibits the trading of derivatives on their proprietary \naccount.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 313\n\n  (Purpose: To subject certain hedge funds to the requirements of the \n                    Investment Company Act of 1940)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send a second amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 313.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 312. TREATMENT OF LARGE HEDGE FUNDS UNDER INVESTMENT \n                   COMPANY ACT OF 1940.\n\n       Section 3(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 \n     U.S.C. 80a-3(c)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), in the first sentence, by inserting \n     ``, which has total assets of less than $1,000,000,000, and'' \n     after ``hundred persons''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (7), in the first sentence, by inserting \n     ``which has total assets of less than $1,000,000,000,'' after \n     ``qualified purchasers,''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to tell a story as I describe this \namendment. About 10 years ago, I was serving in the House of \nRepresentatives on the Ways and Means Committee. Ten years ago, as you \nmight recall, in this country we had the marketing of junk bonds; that \nis, noninvestment grade bonds by Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken. \nJunk bonds were used increasingly for hostile takeovers. It was a go-go \neconomy. They held conferences and talked about how you could turn a \nminnow into a whale and arm a minnow with junk bonds and they will go \nand bite the tail off the whale. You had little companies buying big \ncompanies. It was a remarkable thing to see.\n  One of the things that occurred to me was how unhealthy and unholy it \nwas in this country that junk bond sellers were parking junk bonds with \nsavings and loans. Our savings and loans, whose deposits were insured \nby the Federal Government, were then ending up with junk bonds, \nnoninvestment-grade bonds, in their portfolios, so that if the \nenterprise went belly up, the American taxpayers would end up paying \nthe bill.\n  Let me give you the creme de la creme, the hood ornament on the \nexcess. The hood ornament was that we had one of biggest casinos in the \ncountry built in Atlantic City, glitzy and big. Junk bonds were for the \ncasino, noninvestment-grade bonds. With junk bonds they build the \ncasino. The junk bonds get parked with the savings and loan. The \nsavings and loan goes belly up. Guess who ends up with the junk bonds \nthat are nonperforming and a big casino. The American taxpayer. The \nU.S. Government and the American taxpayer end up holding junk bonds \nthat are nonperforming junk bonds in a casino.\n  How did that happen? Because it was all right according to our \nregulators, and all right according to law, for our savings and loans \nto go out and buy junk bonds and load up. One California S had, I \nthink, nearly 60 percent of its assets involved in junk bonds.\n  So I got an amendment passed. It is now law. Some people have never \nforgiven me for it, because I got an amendment passed that said savings \nand loans--that is, those whose deposits are insured by the Federal \nGovernment--cannot purchase junk bonds and must divest those they have.\n  I had a devil of a time getting it passed, just an awful time. I got \nit passed. It became law and caused all kinds of chaos for those who \nwere parking all these bonds at S, playing the financial roulette \ngame they were playing. It was the right thing to have done for the \ntaxpayers of this.\n  I mention that only because financial institutions will do what they \nmust and will do what they can under the rules as long as we are \nlooking the other way. I am not saying they are all irresponsible. I am \nsaying they are all going to try to pursue the largest rate of return \nthey can possibly pursue, especially if you have the deposits \nunderwritten. Those institutions are going to take advantage of these \nopportunities. It was true in the 1980s; it will be true in the next \ndecade as well.\n  The lesson with respect to junk bonds, the lesson with respect to \nderivatives and hedge funds, is that we have to be vigilant. Did the \nbank regulators jump on this and deal with it? No. In fact, the \nSecretary of the Treasury would come to the Ways and Means Committee. I \nwould say: Mr. Secretary, we have a crisis going on here. What on earth \nare you doing? Sitting on your hands? Oh, no, Congressman Dorgan, there \nisn't a crisis at all; there's no problem. There is no problem here at \nall.\n  Well, the problem turned out to be hundreds of billions of dollars \nfor the American taxpayer, because those who were supposed to be \ninvolved in regulation looked the other way.\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\n  As we pass this piece of legislation today, we would do ourselves a \nfavor, I think, passing an amendment that would prohibit proprietary \ntrading in derivatives by banks and also passing the amendment I just \nsent to the desk that would provide regulation for risky hedge funds \nthat have at least $1 billion or more in assets. It is a handful of \nhedge funds, perhaps fewer than 50. They have aggressive leverage. It \nseems to me that while I would like to be more aggressive in the \nregulation of hedge funds, at least this should be a start in dealing \nwith this issue.\n  Mr. President, I will not offer a third amendment. I will offer only \nthese two amendments. I believe that the legislation is inappropriate \nat this time, and I intend to vote against the legislation on final \npassage. As I have said on a couple occasions this afternoon, I think \nthis is a giant step backward. I think it is exactly the wrong \ndirection for our country. I think it does nothing for ordinary people, \ndoes not address any of the issues. It is something that will make a \nnumber of the largest enterprises in this country that are already \nmaking substantial profits very, very happy. I guarantee every Member \nof this body that if this legislation is passed, when you wake up day \nafter day, week after week, and month after month, you will read the \nnews of more and more and more mergers and greater concentration.\n\n  Then don't you come to the floor of the Senate and talk to me about \ncompetition and don't you come to the floor of the Senate and started \npreaching about free markets. The opportunity to respond to real \ncompetition and free markets, in my judgment, is, by turning this \nlegislation down, enforcing strong antitrust enforcement, and being \nthoughtful about the things we have to do in the future to preserve the \nsafety and soundness of our banks and, yes, to encourage investment and \nencourage economic activity in other sectors of our economy.\n  Let me conclude by saying I am not someone who thinks that big firms \nare bad. I don't believe that at all. Nobody is going to build a 757 \njet airplane in the garage in Regent, ND. Economies of scale are \nimportant. Some of the largest enterprises in our country have \ncontributed mightily to this country and its economy. But I also \nbelieve that what contributes most to this country is good old-\nfashioned healthy competition, broad-based economic ownership. I know \nit is a timeworn and, some consider, old-fashioned Jeffersonian notion \nof democracy that broad-based economic ownership is what eventually \nguarantees economic freedom and what eventually underscores and \nguarantees political freedom as well. That is something that is very \nimportant to this country's future.\n  We do not advance in that direction by passing legislation that will \nfurther concentrate and further provide inducements for more mergers \nand bigger, more concentration and bigger companies. That will not \nadvance this country's interests.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our current blueprint is that we are going \nto vote on the unitary thrift amendment at 3:45. Each side will have 3 \nminutes to speak on that issue. I will ask Senator Gorton to speak on \nbehalf of the majority.\n  At the conclusion of that vote, the Shelby amendment will be \nconsidered. That is the amendment which would allow banks to provide \nbroad financial services within the structure of the bank rather than \nthrough the holding company. We have agreed to a 2-hour debate on that \namendment. If we were on that amendment, say, at 10 after 4, we would \nbe through with that amendment at 10 after 6.\n  I do not know of another major amendment. I urge my colleagues who \nhave amendments, since we have a lot of Members hoping not to be here \ntomorrow--Members walking by do not object to that, I assume--who would \nlike to catch a flight back to their States at a reasonable hour, if \nthey could, not to convenience me or to convenience my colleague, \nSenator Sarbanes, but to convenience all 100 Members of the Senate, I \nurge Senators who have amendments to come to the floor and present \nthem. Please don't show up at 6:10 and say, oh, by the way, I just had \nan idea last night while I was having dessert that I would like to redo \nthe whole banking system of the United States of America and I would \nlike to change the number of people on the Federal Reserve Bank board \nand I talked to the newspaperman today and he thought it was a great \nidea.\n  If you have an amendment, I hope you will come and let us look at it \nand talk about it. Hopefully, we can take some of these amendments and \nsave time. I urge my colleagues, for the convenience of all of our \nMembers, if you have amendments, to come down here before 4 and let us \ntalk about them.\n  Please don't show up when the Shelby amendment is finished at 6:10 \nand say I have all these ideas and I want to deal with them.\n  I thank my colleagues in advance for their cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nunanimous-consent agreement that we are operating under be temporarily \nset aside so that Senator Schumer can offer an amendment. If I \nunderstand the amendment correctly, I intend to accept it, and I assume \nSenator Sarbanes will accept it. I think it is important to go ahead \nand get that amendment out of the way. Whenever he is ready, I wanted \nto be sure that we were in a position that he could be recognized \nwithout undoing any of the agreements on the vote at 3:45, or the \nunanimous-consent request on the Shelby amendment, starting whenever \nthat vote is finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, May 2-8 is National Tourism Week, and I \nwould like to take a few minutes to encourage anyone planning their \nsummer vacation--and this is the time; this is the time to plan the \nsummer vacation. Let me tell you where the place is. This is the place: \nWest Virginia. Anybody who is planning the summer vacation--or looking \nfarther ahead to next year's winter vacation--should consider my \nfavorite destination: West Virginia.\n  I have been in Rome. I have traveled to Agra. I have seen the Taj \nMahal. I have walked in the shadows of the pyramids. I have seen the \nPantheon and the Parthenon. I have met with great leaders all over the \nworld, face to face, such as the late President Sadat and Generalissimo \nChiang Kai-Shek. I joined with the Generalissimo and the madam on their \nbirthday up at Sun Moon Lake many years ago. But let me tell you, after \nhaving been to these four points of the compass, my favorite \ndestination is still West Virginia. And I have visited Texas, may I say \nto my friend, the senior Senator from the Lone Star State. I made 26 \nspeeches in the Bible Belt of Texas in 1960. I traveled over the \nnortheastern part of Texas making speeches--26 in 3 days. I even took \nmy fiddle with me and played a few tunes. Anyhow, there is just nothing \nlike West Virginia. That is my favorite destination.\n  Within an easy drive of much of the Nation, West Virginia offers one \ndelight after another, whether for families, adventurers, romantic \ncouples, or groups.\n\n[[Page S4846]]\n\n  If you are interested in history, may I say to my Senate colleagues, \nWest Virginia has plenty, from delicate millennia-old fern and \ntrilobite fossils embedded in her coal seams and rock outcroppings to \nthe monumental burial mounds of the mysterious Adena people that date \nback to 1000 B.C. And I can tell you about history that goes much \nfarther back than that.\n\n  Frontier forts that mark West Virginia's time at the leading edge of \nAmerican expansion are scattered across the State, and are populated \nwith costumed, re-enactors who can weave fascinating true stories of \nthe sometimes harrowing escapades experienced by our Nation's early \nsettlers. Point Pleasant, WV, marks the site of the first land battle \nof the Revolutionary War. Numerous Civil War battlefields abound from \nWest Virginia's tumultuous birth as a State, none more famous than \nHarper's Ferry, where in 1859 abolitionist John Brown led a raid on the \nU.S. arsenal, sparking a chain of events leading to that epic struggle.\n  Industries that sparked a different kind of revolution still operate \nin West Virginia, from the steel mill in Weirton, WV, where we have the \nlargest ESOP in the world--that is, Employee-Stock Option Plan--to the \ncoal mines in southern West Virginia. In Beckley, you can visit a coal \nmine and see firsthand the danger and effort involved in extracting the \ncompressed energy that still provides almost half of the Nation's \nelectricity. And those who love classic locomotives would feel at home \nthere, as several steam excursions offer the opportunity to chug behind \na puffing engine as it clickety-clacks through scenes of pastoral \nharmony.\n  West Virginia's history sings through the music festivals scheduled \nacross the state throughout the year, ranging from classical to \ncountry, bluegrass to jazz. History also comes to life in the fine \ncrafts produced in small village potteries and quilting bees as well as \nby storied West Virginia glass makers whose wares have been presented \nto presidents and foreign heads of state. And history continues to be \nmade by her artisans, musicians, and writers, many of whom are \naccessible at craft and music festivals, or through factory tours.\n  West Virginia is not just for lovers of history, however. It is also \nfor lovers of fun. The state boasts a great array of state parks with \nlodges and cabins perfect for family entertainment. All these one can \nsee in West Virginia. At these public parks, as well as at many \nprivately-owned facilities, activities can be found to suit everyone in \nthe family, from golf courses designed by the greats in the game to \nhorseback riding along mountain trails, from fishing in coursing \nstreams or placid lakes to hiking to breathtaking vistas, and, of \ncourse, skiing at five major ski resorts.\n  Every season in West Virginia offers its own attractions. In the \nspringtime, coursing white water thunders through rocky causeways \nbedecked in snowy rhododendron and dogwood, vibrant redbud and delicate \ntrillium. In summer, cool springs bubble in shadow-filled woods where \nwild ginseng grows, while in meadows, Queen Anne's Lace, purple \nconeflowers, golden Rudbeckia, and blue chicory weave a madras plaid of \nwildflowers as ruby throated hummingbirds flit among the honeysuckle. \nIn the fall, West Virginia's sugar maples, tulip poplars, sweetgums, \nand hickories flame in colors rivaling any in New England, and herds of \nwhitetail deer and flocks of elusive wild turkeys fatten on the \nbeechnuts, walnuts, and acorns. Winter's snows fall thick and white, \ncreating an austerely beautiful palette of linear grey, black, and blue \nshadows on the hillsides that make the color and light of numerous \nChristmas festivals a welcome contrast.\n  If enjoying the scenery is not enough for the daredevil in you, then \nsee if you can tame Seneca Rocks with a pair of climbing shoes, a bag \nof chalk, and a length of rope. Venture into the depths of Organ Cave \nin Ronceverte, where Thomas Jefferson, when he visited, did little more \nthan sample the over forty miles of passages that have been mapped to \ndate. Or challenge the mighty Gauley River, or the wild and scenic New \nRiver, in a raft or kayak, to learn just how powerful and devious a few \nthousand cubic feet of water can be when they are moving at great speed \nover car-sized boulders. Set your mountain bike upon trails that will \nstrain your thighs as well as your bike brakes. Then, to relax, float \nlazily down the South Branch of the Potomac River in West Virginia, \nwhere it still looks as it must have to the early settlers, with mist \nrolling off the crystal waters as they wend their way between canyon-\nlike walls, with bald eagles soaring overhead.\n  When the day is done, you can count on good food and a soft pillow \nanywhere in West Virginia. Bed and Breakfast establishments cater to \nevery fancy, from homespun log cabins bedecked in quilts to antique-\nfilled `stately ladies' whose names reflect their historic pasts. \nRomance is easy to find before a crackling fire laid on a stone grate \nor on a porch swing overlooking the last violet rays of sunset. Hidden \nin the hills, too, are grand resorts and spas offering every amenity \nfor the weary traveler. Some colonial-era spas are still active, while \nothers have been more recently developed, but all offer blissful \nrelaxation. Some also offer award-winning water. Berkeley Springs was \nfounded by George Washington and others and originally called Bath \nafter the spa town in England. The world famous Greenbrier in White \nSulphur Springs lists royalty as well as Presidents, Senators, and \nGovernors in its guest book.\n  The comforts of your home away from home may make it difficult to get \nout of bed, but the allure of shopping is strong in those hills. Outlet \nmalls with true bargains compete with artist studios, artisan \nworkshops, and factory stores to fill your car trunk, but with only a \nlittle planning, your Christmas and birthday giving may be highlighted \nby unique and thoughtful treasures.\n  Of course, the greatest treasure in West Virginia is her people. \nFriendly, smiling, and helpful, they can even make getting lost a \npleasurable adventure. So do come, do come and share in the beauty, in \nthe history, in the romance, in the adventure that is West Virginia. \nCome a tourist and leave a friend.\n  I hope I have sparked a little curiosity in the state that I am so \nproud to represent. As long winded as politicians are reputed to be, \nand it may be the case in my instance, I could filibuster for days on \nthe things to see and do in West Virginia without beginning to name \neverything. For more information, come by and visit my office. My staff \nwill give you a telephone number for the State's official travel guide \nso you can visit West Virginia, and you can also find a lot of these \nthings on the World Wide Web.\n\n  I yield the floor and I thank Senators for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nIt was pure delight to sit here and listen to the virtues of his State. \nI have now a thirst, a curiosity, to visit the parts of the State that \nI haven't been to.\n  Anyone who thinks that eloquence is no longer around, all they have \nto do is listen to our friend, the Senator from West Virginia, and they \nare sure to know it has reached its senatorian heights.\n  I thank the Senator. I am glad I had the pleasure of listening to his \nbeautiful and rapturous remarks about his wonderful State.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me thank the Senator for his courtesy, for his patience \nin allowing me to proceed. I think I took a bit of advantage of his \nbeing off the floor temporarily. I thank him very much for his kind \nwords, especially about West Virginia.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am delighted to yield to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Byrd, I want to say you commented that you \ncould filibuster for many days about the beauty of your State. I am \nparticularly pleased that you did it this way rather than a filibuster.\n  A filibuster for some has a little bit of a negative connotation, and \nthe remarks made don't deserve the slightest interference from anything \nelse, just a straight up great speech about your State.\n  I was glad to be here.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank our friend, the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico. He is always most generous in his remarks \nconcerning me and I am very grateful.\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\n  When I saw his fine wife this morning as I came into the Capitol, I \nstarted the day off right.\n  I thank the Senator for his kind words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4847-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4847-S4848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 314\n\n     (Purpose: To make an amendment with respect to ATM fee reform)\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I very much appreciate the chairman from \nTexas accepting the amendment, which he has told me he will do, and I \nbelieve he mentioned it on the floor.\n  This important amendment involves, very simply, disclosure on ATM \nmachines of fees. As many may know, on April 1, 1996, Visa and \nMasterCard, which run the largest ATM networks in the United States, \nended their prohibition against surcharging ATM users. Before that, \nthere could not be a second surcharge. This fee was in addition to any \nfee already imposed on a transaction from other bank customer \nwithdrawals.\n  Three years later, 93 percent of all banks are imposing ATM \nsurcharges on customers. That is 31 percent more than last year. The \nbigger the bank, the more likely they are to surcharge and at a higher \nrate. What this means is, if you have a BankAmerica card and you go to \na Bank One machine, you will pay two fees, one to the Bank One \nmachine--which everyone expects to pay--and the other to the \nBankAmerica card. People are paying two fees. It is very difficult to \nfigure out what they are.\n  When the banks first started charging these fees, many of them didn't \nbother to tell their customers they would be charged. They had to \nfigure it out by looking at the monthly statement. For anyone who has \nlooked at their monthly bank statements and all the fine print, it is \nclear that the fees were not transparent. So, unsurprisingly, there was \nan outcry. I took to the House floor, when I was in that body, to show \nthat banks were not disclosing these fees. I remember surveying the \nbanks in New York City and finding out they were not disclosing them.\n\n[[Page S4848]]\n\n  So what we are proposing to do here is to rectify that wrong. This \namendment is in the great traditions of Adam Smith, pure capitalism. \nSome have said we ought to eliminate the fees. Some have said we ought \nto cap the fees. My view is to let the free market prevail. Let people \nsee what the fee is before they enter into the transaction and then \nthey can make a decision. That is the way it ought to work in \ncapitalism, in free market enterprise. So that is what this amendment \ndoes.\n  Last year, a record $124 billion was generated in all-fee income. \nThat is up 18 percent in 1 year from banks. The fees are going up. This \namendment will not take away a penny of that, except from knowing \nconsumers who decide not to enter into this transaction. We must do \nthis. Awhile ago we forewent this amendment because most banks promised \nthey were not going to impose surcharges, and to their credit for a few \nyears they did not. But now they all do. It is time we have disclosure \nso when they say that they will always disclose, because some do it \nvoluntarily, I simply say, ``trust but verify.''\n  This is a simple, straightforward, reasonable, balanced amendment. I \nhope it will pass without hesitation.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time. Is someone available to just accept \nit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas is unable to be \nhere. He has been gone for a couple of minutes. I am aware of his \nwillingness to accept the amendment, and there is no objection on our \nside. I indicate that on behalf of Senator Gramm.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 314) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask consent I be permitted to speak \nfor 7 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici and Mr. Dodd pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. Res. 98 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Chair and I \nthank the Senator from Texas for letting me talk about the tragic death \nof two great Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4848-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO TWO BRAVE AMERICAN SOLDIERS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

He was 38 years old, married \nand had three children.\n  David joined the Marine Corps right out of Washington High School \nback in 1980. After 4 years of service, he left the Marines, only to \nenlist in the Army 18 months later.\n  His mother, Dorothy Gibbs, said he enlisted in the Army so he could \nfly helicopters. She said it was ``his dream'' and ``he was so happy \nwhen he flew.'' She also said he hoped to retire in 2 years to pursue a \ncareer in airport management.\n  From all accounts, David had accepted the dangers of flying military \naircraft. He knew there was a chance there could be a problem.\n  David told his mother that he was so concerned about his mission in \nKosovo, and she is quoted as saying:\n\n       He didn't feel prepared enough because he didn't know \n     enough about the terrain.\n\n  She also said:\n\n       He hadn't gotten the terrain map and he was concerned about \n     that.\n\n  A couple of weeks ago, I spoke to the Senate Armed Services Committee \nchairman, Senator Warner, and I expressed my concern to him about the \nnumber of Ohioans who have been killed in helicopter accidents.\n  To illustrate, since 1991, 32 men and women from Ohio have died \nserving their Nation, not counting the Persian Gulf war. Of this \nnumber, 11 died in helicopter crashes. That is 34 percent of them. Why \nso many deaths from helicopters? All these deaths, but for one, were in \nnoncombat situations.\n  Our military operates sophisticated machinery. Our mechanics are the \nbest trained in the world. Our pilots are trained to meet and respond \nto all contingencies. Again, the question is: Why so many deaths due to \nhelicopter accidents?\n  Remember, this is the second such accident in 9 days involving Apache \nhelicopters in Albania. Are we giving our pilots specific and correct \nintelligence so they can avoid accidents or, worse, possible enemy \nfire?\n  Mr. President, I will not go into what is right or wrong about being \nin Yugoslavia, but we are at war and we have to ensure that our men and \nwomen have all the necessary tools to do their job and that the \nequipment they use is the best and we have the finest maintenance.\n  In the investigation that will follow the accident, I think it is \nimperative--in fact it is essential--that we find out whether there was \na problem with the equipment in the helicopter or, in the alternative, \nwhether it had proper maintenance.\n  War is serious business. People's lives are on the line, and there \ncan be no room for error. If faulty equipment, lack of equipment, lack \nof communications, or improper information led to the death of these \ntwo men, it is critical that our military take necessary steps to \ncorrect such errors.\n  I am heartened in the knowledge that a peaceful settlement of this \nwar appears to be in the works. However, I am saddened that it could \nnot have come sooner to prevent the deaths of these two brave men and \nthe destruction of Yugoslavia.\n  The United States owes David and Kevin a debt of gratitude that we \nwill never be able to repay for they have paid the ultimate sacrifice. \nAs John says in chapter 15:13, ``Greater love has no man than this, \nthat a man lay down his life for his friends.''\n  Our thoughts and our prayers go out to David's family and especially \nto his wife Jean and three children, Allison, Megan, and David, and \nalso his mother Dorothy, who lost David's father just this past \nChristmas.\n  As one who has lost a child, I know the days and months ahead will be \ndifficult as the family deals with their grief and the absence of the \nphysical presence of their father. I pray that the words of Matthew \n5:4, ``Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted,'' \napply to their family.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4848-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4848-S4878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, financial modernization should go forward \nbut without mixing financial services and commerce. Preserving the \nunitary thrift loophole should not be allowed. Who believes this should \nbe closed? Chairman Leach, Chairman of the House Banking Committee, Fed \nChairman Greenspan, and former Fed Chairman Volcker, Treasury Secretary \nRubin, and banking and consumer organizations. There is bipartisan and, \nfrankly, overwhelming support for loophole closure. I think there is a \nsense we do not want to go down the road of financial services and \ncommerce mixing at this particular juncture. Allowing financial \nmodernization to go forward should occur, but allowing unitary thrifts \nto merge with other financial institutions is the road to go rather \nthan allowing merger with commerce at large.\n  I think we need to heed the urgent warnings of our Nation's leading \neconomic minds. We appreciate that this issue is arcane in the minds of \nmany in this body, no doubt. But when we have the support for closure \nof this loophole coming from the chairman of the House Banking \nCommittee, Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Rubin, and Mr. Volcker, I think that \nought to be compelling support for taking this step to make sure, in \nfact, we get a financial modernization bill out of this body that will, \nin fact, be signed by the President and will serve this country in good \nstead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield my 3 minutes to Senator Gorton.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, financial modernization should be about \nexpanding chartering options and choices for consumers, not about \nstripping away the fundamental characteristics of consumer-oriented \ninstitutions. It is a paradox that the banks that are here seeking more \npowers wish to restrict the powers of their competitors in the same \nbill and are using this amendment to do so.\n  Proponents of this amendment contend that the unitary thrift charter \nis a ``loophole'' that allows for the mixing of banking and commerce. \nThose concerns are both misplaced and impossible under the very \nconditions of charter.\n  Federal law now expressly prohibits a unitarian thrift from lending \nto a commercial affiliate. By law, a thrift must focus on providing \nmortgage, consumer, and small business credit, and its commercial \nlending is severely restricted.\n  The thrift charter is unique. Martin Mayer, who is a guest scholar at \nthe Brookings Institution and a foe of mixing banking and commerce, \nsupports the commercial ownership of thrifts because of their unique \nlending focus on consumers and small businesses. In the more than 3 \ndecades that unitary thrift charters have existed, there is a total \nabsence of any evidence that unitary thrifts' commercial affiliations \nhave either led to a concentration of economic power or posed a risk to \nthe consumer or the taxpayer. To the contrary, the FDIC has testified \nthat limits such as those proposed in this amendment would restrict ``a \nvehicle that has enhanced financial modernization without causing \nsignificant safety-and-soundness problems.''\n  The issue under debate is not the creation of a banking-commerce \nFrankenstein. It is, rather, about the proper treatment of longstanding \ninstitutions focused on serving local communities. Congress should not \nlimit the authorities of existing consumer-oriented companies without a \ncompelling reason. To do so would be anticompetitive and anticonsumer.\n  I am adamantly opposed to any initiative that eviscerates the unitary \nthrift charter and urge Senators to oppose the Johnson amendment as a \nserious step backwards in our efforts to modernize our Nation's \nfinancial services laws.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I move to table the \nJohnson amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment, \nentitled the American Bank Fairness Amendment, to S. 900, the pending \nbill.\n  This amendment, which, as I have said, is cosponsored by Senator \nDaschle, the minority leader, and Senators Grams, Reed, Bennett, \nEdwards, Hagel, and Landrieu, would permit national banks to conduct \nequity securities underwriting and merchant banking activities in an \noperating subsidiary, much as their foreign bank competitors that are \nallowed to conduct such activities in the United States today. I note \nthat six of the seven sponsors of this amendment are members of the \nBanking Committee.\n  We are talking this afternoon about defining a fair and an efficient \nframework to allow all--yes, all--financial institutions to better \nprovide service to their customers in America. This country needs \nfinancial modernization. I support national modernization.\n  I have great respect for the chairman, the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm, and I supported the chairman in the committee. He helped to get \nthis bill to the floor.\n  Unfortunately, this bill does more for the institutions in the top \nworld financial centers--New York, Hong Kong, London--than it does for \nthe average bank that serves the average person in America. That is the \nissue at hand.\n  I know many of my colleagues have made up their mind on this issue. \nBesides, in all honesty, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan \nGreenspan, may not even be the Chairman of the Federal Reserve after \nnext year, although I wish that he would continue. It is often reported \nin the press that Laura Tyson, Alice Rivlin, or even Catherine Bessant \nwill be the next person President Clinton nominates to the Federal \nReserve Board. Therefore, I do not believe it is fair for the issues of \nthis debate to revolve around any one individual, although it is an \nindividual I hold in great respect.\n  The truth is, we are here today to write the laws that will determine \nthe future of the American financial system for the next 60 years. We \nare talking about the issues of banking law, corporate law, industrial \norganization.\n  Senators Grams, Reed, and Bennett have been the lead proponents of \nthe operating subsidiary for several years and they should be commended \nfor their deep understanding of the issue and the banking expertise \nthey bring to the Senate Banking Committee.\n  Let me say from the very beginning, this debate is not about Chairman \nAlan Greenspan. It should never be. As I said, I have a deep respect \nfor Chairman Greenspan. I hold him in very high regard. He is a \ntremendous central banker. I am not here to dispute that in any way.\n  The operating subsidiary amendment is not about monetary policy. Let \nme repeat, the operating subsidiary amendment is not about monetary \npolicy. It is not about inflation, the money supply, or even the \nunemployment rate. I plead with Senators to listen to the facts. The \nkey banking committee Senators supporting this amendment are not from \nbig cities. They are not doing this for Citigroup or Merrill Lynch, \nDean Witter, or Chase Manhattan Bank. The truth is, the large financial \ninstitutions want a bill so badly, they have forced their associations \nto oppose this amendment based on press reports that this bill will be \npulled if it passes. We all know it is the multibillion-dollar \nfinancial institutions that control the associations, and they are the \nones pushing this bill.\n\n  I just do not believe that, in passing a financial modernization \nbill, we should forget about the smaller, midsized, and regional banks \nthat serve our local communities and our States. Those banks--the \nsmaller, midsized, and regional banks--are the ones that are not being \nheard on this issue. They are being shut out and they have been \ndiscounted.\n  I am sorry, but I do not believe financial modernization should be \nonly for the folks on Wall Street. I do not understand why this body \nwould knowingly pass a financial modernization bill that would \nintentionally discriminate against domestic banks in favor of foreign \nbanks.\n  If you want to talk about competition, free markets, and fair and \nequal treatment under the law, Senators should seriously consider the \namendment that is before the Senate. The Shelby-Daschle and others \namendment would provide more fair and equitable treatment of our \nnational banks in comparison with our foreign competitors.\n  The American Bank Fairness Amendment, as we called it, would ensure\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\nthat foreign banks receive no competitive advantage over our banks here \nin America.\n  S. 900, at the moment, as it is written, discriminates against \ndomestic banks. Ask yourself, Why are we even here in the first place? \nWhy are we even considering financial modernization, if it is to be \nglobally competitive? Is it to ensure that our banks can compete on an \ninternational scale?\n  I received a letter from John Reed and Sanford Weill, cochairmen of \nCitigroup, this morning. They wrote to inform me that passage of \nfinancial modernization is imperative.\n  They said,\n\n       As our financial services firms contort to comply with the \n     current legal and regulatory structure, we become much less \n     competitive with our non-U.S. counterparts. Our country's \n     competitive position as the world's leader in financial \n     services is at risk of being lost if we don't act now.\n\n  So, according to our friends at Citigroup, it appears we have become \nless competitive with our foreign competitors, and that our position as \na world leader is at risk.\n  I received a similar letter from Phil Purcell, chairman of Morgan \nStanley Dean Witter & Co. He said that Congress needs to pass this bill \nbecause:\n\n       Financial modernization legislation is critical to the \n     maintenance of the preeminence of American financial firms in \n     global markets.\n\n  American preeminence, Mr. President? Is that the reason we are \nconsidering this legislation? If these are, indeed, the reasons, I must \nconfess I am really confused. The reason for my confusion is S. 900, \nthe bill we are debating today actually discriminates against domestic \nbanks in favor of foreign banks. Simply put, national banks are not \nallowed to conduct merchant banking activities or equity underwriting \nactivities in an operating subsidiary. Foreign banks, however, can \nconduct those activities today, and will actually expand their range of \nactivities to include insurance underwriting, if this bill becomes law.\n  I actually have some charts to share with you to help demonstrate the \nblatant discriminatory treatment of our own national banks versus those \nof foreign banks' operating subsidiaries in America. Under current law, \nnational bank subsidiaries are not permitted to conduct merchant \nbanking activities. Merchant banking basically means that banks are \npermitted to make investments in a company subject to conditions \ndesigned to maintain the separation between banking and commerce. \nForeign subsidiaries operating today in America can, however. Under \ncurrent law, national bank subsidiaries are not permitted to underwrite \nany deal in equity securities. However, foreign bank subsidiaries can.\n  The last row under the ``current law'' is blank. That is, neither \nforeign bank subsidiaries nor national bank subsidiaries may underwrite \nnoncredit-related insurance.\n  Let's look at a chart of permitted subsidiary activities that I have \nhere if this financial modernization bill were enacted into law. Please \nnotice that under the first column, here, national bank subsidiaries \nstill will not enjoy the ability to conduct merchant banking activities \nor conduct equity securities underwriting. Foreign bank subsidiaries \nwill not only be allowed to conduct those activities--merchant banking, \nunderwriting and dealing in equity securities and insurance \nunderwriting, as shown on the chart--but S. 900, as currently written, \nwill actually expand their permissible activities to include noncredit-\nrelated insurance underwriting. This completely undermines the whole \nrationale for the bill.\n  That is the major flaw with this bill. How can the supporters of this \nbill say this will help our national banks compete when they are \nclearly put at a disadvantage by their own Federal Government? How can \nwe in good conscience support a bill that discriminates against our own \nnational banks?\n  Senator Gramm and Chairman Greenspan say if national banks are \nallowed to conduct such activities in an operating subsidiary, these \nbanks would have a funding advantage over their competitors because of \nan alleged ``subsidy.''\n  However, neither Senator Gramm nor Chairman Greenspan can reconcile \nthis argument with the competitive advantage of foreign bank \nsubsidiaries. Since 1990, the Federal Reserve Board has issued \napprovals for 18 foreign banks to own subsidiaries that engage in \nsecurities underwriting activities in the United States. In fact, the \nsize of these subsidiaries exceeds $450 billion in assets. The Federal \nReserve admits that foreign banks may enjoy a ``home country'' subsidy. \nIn approving the section 20 subsidiary application for the Canadian \nImperial Bank of Commerce in 1990, the Federal Reserve noted:\n\n       Although as banks, applicants [that is foreign banks] are \n     not supported to any significant extent by the U.S. federal \n     safety net, they have access to any benefits that are \n     associated with their respective home country safety nets, \n     from which they may derive some competitive advantage over \n     U.S. bank holding companies operating under the section 20 \n     framework or other U.S. securities firms.\n\n  Not only does the board basically admit there may be home country \nadvantages, they also admit:\n\n       . . .  a foreign bank may establish and fund a section 20 \n     subsidiary, while a U.S. bank may not.\n\n  Further, in their 1992 joint report on foreign bank operations \nentitled ``Subsidiary Requirements Study,'' the Federal Reserve Board \nand the Department of Treasury agreed that, ``. . . subject to \nprudential considerations, the guiding policy for foreign bank \noperations should be the principle of investor choice. The right of a \nforeign bank to determine whether to establish a branch or a subsidiary \nis consistent with competitive equity, national treatment and equality \nof competitive opportunity.''\n  Why is investor choice the guiding principle for foreign banks but \nnot for our domestic banks? Why do foreign banks have the right to \nchoose their own corporate structure but domestic banks do not?\n  The Federal Reserve Board stated that while a subsidy for foreign \nbanks may exist:\n\n       [T]he Board believes that any advantage would not be \n     significant in light of the effect on them of the overall \n     section 20 framework and the circumstances of these cases, \n     and should not preclude foreign bank ownership of section 20 \n     subsidiaries.\n\n  Basically, that means the rules and the regulations that apply to \nforeign section 20 subsidiaries should contain any possible subsidy.\n  Why do the rules and regulations in place contain any possible \nsubsidy for foreign banks but not domestic banks, our banks? Why should \nany alleged subsidy preclude operating subsidiaries for U.S. banks but \nnot for foreign subsidiaries? Fundamental fairness would suggest that \nforeign banks not be allowed to have a competitive advantage over \ndomestic banks. It just makes no sense. Fundamental fairness suggests \ndomestic banks should also have the choice of an operating subsidiary \nthat our foreign banks have.\n  Critics of the operating subsidiary have voiced concerns about safety \nand soundness. But this is a red herring, I believe, and really no \nissue at all. Even Chairman Greenspan testified that safety and \nsoundness is really not the issue with regard to operating \nsubsidiaries, when asked by Congressman Bentsen in the House. I will \nquote the chairman:\n\n       My concerns are not about safety and soundness. It is the \n     issue of creating subsidies for individual institutions which \n     their competitors do not have. It is a level playing field \n     issue. Non-bank holding companies or other institutions do \n     not have access to that subsidy, and it creates an unlevel \n     playing field. It is not a safety and soundness issue.\n\n  The amendment before us, the operating subsidiary proposal, includes \nthe same safety and soundness protections and lending restrictions as \nthe Federal Reserve imposes on section 20 subsidiaries. But to further \naddress any safety and soundness concerns, the amendment would also \nrequire that the parent bank deduct--yes, deduct--its entire equity \ninvestment in the subsidiary from its own capital and still remain well \ncapitalized.\n  Furthermore, under the operating subsidiary, any alleged ``subsidy'' \ntransferred to the subsidiary would be identical to that transferred to \nan affiliate because investments in the subsidiary would be limited to \nthat which the bank could transfer to holding company affiliates in the \nform of dividends.\n  Lastly, the current Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation and three former chairmen--two Democrats, two Republicans--\nhave stated that the operating subsidiary is more safe and more sound \nthan the affiliate structure.\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\n  The FDIC chairmen argue that forcing activities in an affiliate \nactually exposes insured banks to greater risks than that of an \noperating subsidiary.\n  I want to respond to a letter Chairman Alan Greenspan wrote to \nChairman Gramm on May 4 in response to my ``Dear Colleague'' dated May \n3. I believe this is a great letter in support of the operating \nsubsidiary. In Chairman Greenspan's effort to explain why foreign bank \nsubsidiaries do not have a competitive advantage and are justified, he \nactually makes the case for an operating subsidiary and confirms \neverything proponents have been saying all along.\n  In paragraph 2, Chairman Greenspan says that the International \nBanking Act requires foreign banks be allowed to operate in this \ncountry through operating subsidiaries. His major point is that it is \nnot his choice, but that the law makes him do it, and this is due to \nthe national treatment principles to which he refers in paragraph 3.\n  I understand the national treatment principles. However, those \nprinciples are not and should not be interpreted to mean that foreign \nbanks be given advantages over U.S. banks.\n  In both the International Banking Act and the Bank Holding Company \nAct, the Federal Reserve Board is mandated to deny an application by a \nforeign bank to establish a U.S.-subsidiary if the Board finds that the \nproposal will result in ``decreased or unfair competition, conflicts or \ninterests, or unsound banking practices.''\n  This is a very important point, I submit to my colleagues. By law, \nthe Federal Reserve must have determined that foreign bank subsidiaries \nconducting securities underwriting and equity underwriting does not \nresult in unsound banking practices.\n  Otherwise, the Federal Reserve would be in violation of the \nInternational Banking Act and the Bank Holding Company Act. That very \nfact supports our argument that conducting such activities in an \noperating subsidiary is both safe and sound.\n  In the third paragraph, Chairman Greenspan says:\n\n       In the absence of any evidence that foreign banks are using \n     their government subsidy to an unfair competitive advantage \n     in the United States, there does not seem to be any \n     compelling reason to abandon the current approach to foreign \n     bank participation in this country.\n\n  Chairman Greenspan once again admits there is a government subsidy \nfor foreign banks. He confirms what I shared with everyone in my ``Dear \nColleague'' letter in the Senate. He then changes the subject to say \nthere is no reason to abandon foreign banks subsidiaries. I never \nsuggested such a thing in my ``Dear Colleague'' letter. In only asked \nthat if it is appropriate for foreign banks, why isn't it appropriate \nfor national banks?\n  The fifth paragraph of the letter states that, ``foreign banks have \nnot been able to exploit their home country subsidy . . .'' and that \nforeign bank subsidiaries ``have substantially underperformed U.S. \nowned section 20 companies.'' He actually admits that ``the subsidy \ndoes not travel well.'' In other words, foreign banks have not been \nsuccessful transferring their home country subsidy to their subsidiary \nin the U.S.\n  But wait a minute. You cannot have it both ways. I do not care who \nyou are.\n  Chairman Greenspan just presented evidence to us in the fifth \nparagraph that foreign bank subsidiaries, which in the third paragraph \nhe admits receive a home country subsidy, underperform their American \ncompetitors. Thus, if there is a subsidy, it must either be (1) \ninsignificant, and not enough to affect market performance or (2) \ncontained in the section 20 regulatory framework and therefore not an \nissue. In either case, the Chairman has just confirmed the arguments \nthat proponents of operating subsidiaries have made.\n  To sum up, Chairman Greenspan, just 2 days ago, confirmed that: \nforeign bank subsidiaries receive home country subsidies; conducting \nsuch activities in a subsidiary does not result in unsound banking \npractices, otherwise the Fed is violating the law with regard to \nforeign bank subsidiaries; and the subsidiary does not ``travel well,'' \nthat is, it is not easily transferred from the bank to the sub.\n  The logic and the evidence presented by Chairman Greenspan in defense \nof foreign bank subsidiaries is the exact same logic and evidence that \nsupports the Shelby-Daschle operating subsidiary amendment.\n  To be honest, I am quite surprised at the Chairman's uncompromising \nposition on the issue. As a student of Public Choice economics, I am \nsure he is aware of the benefits of competition among regulators. I am \nsurprised he supports making the Federal Reserve the monopoly umbrella \nregulator. Monopolies restrict output and increase prices.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that making the Federal Reserve the \nmonopoly regulator will create even more bottlenecks in bank \napplications thereby increasing the regulatory cost of banks doing \nbusiness with the Federal Reserve.\n  For the sake of competition, for the sake of free markets, for the \nsake of choice, I respectfully request that you support the Shelby \namendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think if anyone knows me and knows \nRichard Shelby, they know that we came to Congress on the same day. We \nserved on the House Energy and Commerce Committee together. We were \nboth Democrats then. We both changed parties. We both ran for the \nSenate. And Richard and I have been very close friends since the first \nday we came. I think you always regret when you have these kinds of \ntough battles, but this is a tough battle. This is vitally important.\n  Let me basically outline what I want to say and then let me go about \ntrying to say it.\n  First of all, there has been some speculation about whether or not, \nas chairman of the Banking Committee and a new chairman, chairman only \nfor a few months, whether or not I would pull my own bill, which, as \nthe Presiding Officer knows as a member of the committee, has been a \ngreat labor of mine for all these many months and has been the labor of \nCongress for 25 years. As to whether I would pull the bill over this \nissue, let me leave no suspense: I will pull this bill if the Shelby \namendment is adopted.\n  You might think that is a very strong statement to make, but I think \nwhen you hear my presentation, you will understand why I make it, \nbecause with all the good things in the bill, I want people to \nunderstand that all of them combined together would not undo the harm \nthat would be done by this amendment.\n  What I will do is answer Senator Shelby on foreign banks. I will then \ngo through and talk about the real issue: What is the issue for \nDemocrats who are hearing from the Secretary of the Treasury? What is \nthe issue for Republicans who are hearing from big banks? What is the \npublic interest?\n  I will try to answer those issues. Let me begin with the foreign \nbanks.\n  Senator Shelby would have us believe that we need to start \nsubsidizing American banks because foreign banks are subsidized. He \nwould have us believe that somehow we have given foreign banks a \ndifferent set of regulations to abide by in America than American banks \nhave had and that therefore we need to do something about it.\n  Let me address that. And I want to address it first by reading Alan \nGreenspan's thoughtful letter. Interestingly enough, Senator Shelby \nreferred to part of it. But I think it goes right to the heart of the \nissue.\n  Reading his letter of May 4:\n\n       First, the Board did not simply choose to let foreign banks \n     operate in this country through subsidiaries. The law \n     required it. The International Banking Act . . .\n\n  That was passed in 1978--\n\n       . . . provides that a foreign bank shall be treated as a . \n     . . holding company for purposes of nonbanking acquisitions.\n\n  That is the law of the land. That was adopted by Congress. That was \nsigned by the President. The Chairman of the Board of the Federal \nReserve had nothing to do with that. He simply had the responsibility \nof implementing it.\n\n       Therefore, when the Board allowed U.S. bank holding \n     companies to own securities companies, the Board was required \n     to permit foreign banks that met the statutory conditions \n     also to acquire such companies.\n       The law treating foreign banks as holding companies was a \n     practical response to an existing situation: most foreign \n     banks do not have holding companies.\n\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\n\n  And I will get to that point in a minute because it is important.\n\n       Without the [International Banking Act's] approach, foreign \n     banks generally would be excluded from the U.S. market, in \n     violation of the national treatment principles embedded in \n     U.S. law. . . .\n       The Board stated it would monitor, and in fact has \n     monitored, this situation to assure that foreign banks do not \n     in fact operate to the detriment of U.S. banking \n     organizations. . . .\n       A recent Federal Reserve study of the performance of \n     section 20 companies over the last eight years demonstrates \n     that foreign bank-owned section 20 companies have \n     substantially underperformed U.S.-owned section 20 companies. \n     . . .\n       To cite the fact of foreign bank structure to support a \n     similar structure in the United States is not only \n     misleading, it is potentially harmful.\n\n  Let me explain what all that means in English. What it means is, we \npassed a law, and the law said that since foreign banks do not use \nholding companies--they use operating subsidiaries because it is \npermitted under their law--that for treatment purposes, they would be \ntreated as holding companies in the United States. Senator Shelby says \nthis is unfair.\n  I would like to note that the Federal Reserve, noting a potential \nproblem with it, set out a monitoring process to see if these foreign \nbanks are benefiting relative to our banks in promoting unfair \ncompetition.\n  What the Fed found in 1995 was that not only were they not \nbenefiting, but they lost 11 percent. In 1996, their rate of return was \nminus 8 percent. In 1997, their rate of return was 18 percent. And in \n1998, their rate of return was 25 percent.\n  So the plain truth is, these foreign banks are poorly run, their \nsubsidiary operations are a disaster, but if they were well run, and if \nthey were getting a competitive advantage, we would do something about \nit. The point is, it has not created a problem.\n  Nineteen of these foreign banks are in the securities business. \nTogether, they make up less than 2.6 percent of the American market. In \nterms of underwriting revenues, they earn 3.8 percent of the revenues. \nSo the point is, these foreign banks are not effective in competing \nagainst American banks. The point is, because foreign governments \nsubsidize their banks, do we want to subsidize our banks? As chairman \nof the Banking Committee, I can tell you, if these foreign subsidies \nstarted having an unfair effect in our market, we would take action to \nchange the law and prevent this advantage.\n\n  But we have allowed this situation to exist for two reasons: One, it \nhas not done us any harm, and, two, we sell $10 of financial services \nabroad for every $1 of financial services sold in America. So the last \nthing we wanted to do is get into a trade war in banking, because we \nare the world's greatest bankers, we are the world's greatest exporters \nof banking services. And so it was to our advantage to allow this to \nhappen as long as it was doing no harm.\n  What is the real issue at stake in this amendment? I want to begin \nwith a quote from Secretary Rubin. In fact, many people on the Democrat \nside of the aisle have been called by Secretary Rubin in the last few \ndays. Some people on our side of the aisle have been called. I want to \nread you a quote from Secretary Rubin. And then I want to pose a \nquestion: What could this quote possibly be referring to?\n  This is a quote from the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, on \nMay 5, 1999, before the Finance Subcommittee of the House Commerce \nCommittee. And I will read you the quote:\n\n       [O]ne of an elected Administration's critical \n     responsibilities is the formation of economic policy, and an \n     important component of that policy is banking policy. In \n     order for the elected Administration to have an effective \n     role in banking policy, it must have a strong connection with \n     the banking system.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that the Comptroller of the Currency, who \nworks for Robert Rubin, regulates national banks. And national banks \nmake up 58 percent of the assets in American banks. Why isn't that ``an \neffective role in banking policy''? Why is it not ``a strong connection \nwith the banking system''? I can tell you, Secretary Rubin is right: It \nis not a strong connection. The Comptroller of the Currency is an \naccountant. Banking policy is run by the Federal Reserve. And I thank \nGod for that every single day.\n  I thank God every single day that in 1913, after the Treasury had run \nmonetary policy in this country--we had a giant panic in 1907; the \ncountry had gone through continuing economic convulsions--the Congress \nput an end to it by setting up an independent monetary authority called \nthe Federal Reserve.\n  The Federal Reserve, with an independent board--appointed by the \nPresident, confirmed by the Senate for very long terms--exercises \nindependent monetary policy. So when the President wants to inflate the \neconomy to get reelected, the Fed says no. When Congress feels we need \nto print more money to get things moving to help them in their \nelections, the Fed says no. We have an independent monetary authority.\n  So while the Comptroller of the Currency is an accountant that \nprimarily audits national banks, he has no policy authority at all. \nWhy? Because the Federal Reserve regulates the holding companies, and \nthere are 6,867 holding companies in America that together make up \nabout 96 percent of bank assets.\n  So sure enough, the Treasury sends out all of the accountants and \nauditors, but the Federal Reserve sets the policy. And what Robert \nRubin is saying, in the clearest possible terms, is he wants to set \nbanking policy, he wants to set monetary policy. That is exactly what \nhe is saying.\n  The question is, Do we want to put the Treasury back in the position \nof setting banking policy in America? Do we want the President to have \nthe ability to use banking policy as a political tool? Are we not \ntalking about repealing the Federal Reserve Act?\n\n  Now, how all this comes about is a little complicated, but with a \nteeny bit of detective work, it becomes very, very clear.\n  Remember, the Fed does not regulate banks. Not a single bank in \nAmerica is regulated directly by the Fed. But it regulates holding \ncompanies that control banks, and those holding companies have 97 \npercent of the assets of banks. Why do they have it? Because our law \nrequires that banks not provide other financial services within the \nbank, for safety and soundness reasons, and so big banks and banks that \nhave large assets are holding companies and they come under the Federal \nReserve.\n  Now, if we adopted the Shelby amendment, let me read what Alan \nGreenspan and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve say would \nhappen:\n\n       As I have testified, if profit is their goal, there is no \n     choice. Because of the subsidy implicit in the Federal safety \n     net, profit-maximizing management will invariably choose the \n     operating subsidiary. As a consequence, the holding company \n     structure will atrophy in favor of bank operating \n     subsidiaries. Our [and ``our'' being the Federal Reserve] \n     current ability rests principally on our role as holding \n     company supervisor.\n\n  So here is the point: If you let banks perform these services within \nthe bank itself, their securities affiliate or, in the future, their \ninsurance affiliate or any other thing you allow them to do can get the \nadvantage of the bank's FDIC insurance and the ability to borrow money \nfrom the Fed, which is the lowest interest rate in the world, and if \nthey can use the Fed wire, the Fed has estimated that doing these \nthings within the bank creates about a 14 basis points advantage over \ndoing them outside the bank. Those little margins make a very big \ndifference.\n  So, obviously, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve believe and both \nagree that if you let banks perform these functions inside the bank, \nbanks will tend to close down their holding companies and bring these \nfunctions inside the bank.\n  Now, I am going to talk about that issue separately. But what does \nthat mean in terms of monetary policy? It means that the Comptroller of \nthe Currency, who will be regulating banks that will no longer be \nholding companies, will become the banking authority in the country, \nand the Federal Reserve will see the number of holding companies it \nregulates decline, decline, decline, and decline.\n  Now, interestingly, the Treasury and the Shelby amendment, one and \nthe same, recognize this. They say, OK, for the 43 largest holding \ncompanies, we will force them to maintain their holding company, so \nthat the Fed will continue to regulate them. That means that 6,824 \nother holding companies will be allowed to change their structure. They \nwill be driven by the profit motive to do it. Therefore, over time the\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\ncontrol of banking policy and ultimately monetary policy--because bank \nregulation is a source of strength for the Fed in implementing much of \nits policy--will shift from the Federal Reserve to the Treasury, from \nan independent agency to an arm of the President of the United States.\n  Now, you might say, well, the Federal Reserve still regulates 43 \nholding companies. But the holding companies have every incentive to \nconduct all of their activities within the bank, so the holding \ncompanies, the 43 left that the Fed would regulate, will be empty \nshells.\n  The Fed's power comes from the power to regulate banks. Their ability \nto get banks together to prevent a financial collapse--such as the Long \nTerm Capital Management case in New York--was their ability, using \nmoral suasion by the fact that they regulated the holding companies \nthat were involved, to get people together and basically nudge them, \nencourage them, and, if you like, pressure them into dealing with that \ncrisis before it got moving.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues on the first point: Do you want this \nadministration, or any administration, to control banking policy? The \nSecretary of the Treasury says they should; it is part of the tools \nthey say they need to conduct economic policy.\n\n  Let me tell you something, Mr. President. We had this debate in 1913. \nWe decided we didn't want the President, in 1913, controlling banking \npolicy. We have decided we do not want any President or did not want \nany President since that time.\n  Would we have been better off in the last 2 years of the Reagan \nadministration if the Treasury had controlled banking policy instead of \nthe Federal Reserve? I do not think so. When the Bush administration \nwas in a reelection campaign and losing the election because the \neconomy was recovering slowly, would we have wanted the Secretary of \nthe Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency--appointed by the \nPresident, removable by the President--would we have wanted them to \nhave the ability to turn on the printing presses or to use expansionary \npolicy with the banks? I do not think we would.\n  Do we want this President to have the ability to control banking \npolicy when he orders the Comptroller of the Currency, who would be the \nnew central banking regulatory authority under the Shelby amendment, to \ncome to the White House for a fundraiser with bankers?\n  This is not a partisan matter. Bill Clinton is going to be President \nfor 18 more months. We may well then have a Republican President. I \nhope so. But I do not want a Republican or Democratic President to \ncontrol banking policy. We set up an independent Fed to do that, and I \nwant them to do it. Have no doubt about it, when Robert Rubin is saying \nthat this amendment is a way of expanding the administration's \neffective role in banking policy, he means transferring from the Fed to \nthe Treasury the ability to set banking policy.\n  Now, if you are for that, if you believe the executive branch of \nAmerican government ought to set banking policy, you should vote for \nthe Shelby amendment. But if you believe we have done pretty well under \nAlan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, if you believe that since 1913 \nthe American economy has performed pretty well by taking banking policy \naway from Congress and away from the executive branch of government and \nputting it in an independent agency, if you believe that, do not vote \nfor this amendment. This amendment is clearly an effort to transfer \nregulatory authority over banking from the Federal Reserve to the \nTreasury. That would be a disaster for America. That would be far more \nimportant in its negative impact than anything we could possibly do in \nterms of letting banks get into a few other areas of providing \nservices.\n  This is a fundamental issue. I urge my colleagues not to get caught \nup on the Democrat side of the aisle with the fact that there is a \nDemocrat President or that we have a very friendly, nice, and competent \nSecretary of the Treasury who is calling them up and saying, ``We need \nyou to vote with us.'' This is not a partisan matter. An independent \ncontrol of banking policy in America, an independent agency controlling \nbanking policy, is not a partisan matter, it is a matter that this \nCongress, on a bipartisan basis, has stood for since 1913. I don't want \nto take any step, and I don't believe America, if it understood this \nissue, would want to take a step backward from that.\n\n  Let me talk to my Republican colleagues. We have written a bill, and \nI think it is a good bill. I had a lot to do with writing it, so \nobviously I think that. But I think other people are beginning to think \nit, too. This is a big bank, big securities, big insurance bill. That \nis just a reality. And I have to say that there is something a little \nbit obscene about big banks calling up Members of the Senate and \nsaying: ``Well, you know we only got 95 percent of what we wanted in \nthat bill. We could get another 15 percent and go up to 110 percent if \nyou could let us provide these services within the bank, rather than \ndoing it outside the bank.''\n  Now, the banks are not caught up in who is going to conduct banking \npolicy. They are caught up in the fact that they are going to make more \nmoney if they can provide these services inside the bank, because they \nget the subsidies from the FDIC insurance, the Fed window and the Fed \nwire.\n  I don't so much complain about them taking this sort of narrow self-\ninterested view as I complain about our responding to it, let me say. \nWe have all heard: What is good for General Motors is good for America. \nThat is not right. What is good for America is good for General Motors. \nI just say to my colleagues, whatever commitments you have made on \nthis, whatever partisanship you feel on this, ask yourself a question: \nIs it good for America to give the Treasury--an agency controlled by \nthe President--control over banking policy in this country and take \nthat control, at least partially, away from the Federal Reserve?\n  Do we want monetary policy to continue to be based on an objective \nset out to maintain stable prices and economic growth, or do we want to \nbring politics into it? Obviously, Secretary Rubin wants the \nadministration to conduct banking policy, and that is why he asked for \nthis amendment. He says it in clear English. I don't want this \nadministration to conduct banking policy, but at least you have to say \nI am a little broad-minded. I don't want any administration to conduct \nmonetary policy.\n  To try to summarize, because it gets complicated: The Secretary of \nthe Treasury wants this amendment adopted because banks, by providing \nthese new services inside the bank, will find it cheaper to do that, \nmore profitable, and they will fold their holding companies, which they \nonly set up because the law required them for safety and soundness to \nundertake these riskier activities outside the bank. As they fold up \nthese holding companies, the Federal Reserve loses regulatory control \nover them and the Comptroller of the Currency, and therefore the \nPresident, gains regulatory control over them. So what Secretary Rubin \nis talking about is basically giving the Treasury regulatory authority \nthat the Federal Reserve now has.\n  Nothing in our bill takes power away from the Treasury. A lot of \npeople have gotten confused that this is just a power struggle, where \nthis bill would give the Federal Reserve more authority, and the \nTreasury wants to share it, or the Treasury wants more. Look, the Fed \nregulates bank holding companies. Virtually all the wealth is already \nin bank holding companies. The Comptroller audits national banks. There \nis no shift in the regulatory authority in our underlying bill.\n  But the amendment that Senator Shelby has offered with Senator \nDaschle, supported by the Clinton administration, is the biggest \nregulatory shift, the biggest power grab, by a Federal bureaucracy that \nI have seen in my 20 years in Congress. And it is absolutely critical \nthat we slam the door on this power grab, not because Rubin is a bad \nguy and Greenspan is a good guy, but because Rubin is a political \nappointee controlled by a President who, by the very nature of the \nPresidency--whether it is President Ronald Reagan or President William \nClinton--he has political concerns to deal with, as he should.\n\n  We decided in 1913 to take banking policy out of the hands of \npoliticians and put it into the Federal Reserve. We dare not take \naction to take it back.\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\n Maybe Robert Rubin would do a good job with it. Maybe Bill Clinton \nmight fire Rubin and appoint somebody else, or maybe Rubin might leave. \nBut the point is, the Fed, whoever is there--and I hope Alan Greenspan \nwill be there forever--will be independent, with a long term, and will \nbe independent of the President, and so will the board members who \nshare that power.\n  If this issue doesn't move you, then I have done a poor job, because \nI have been standing on the floor for 3 days and I am tired. If this \nissue doesn't move you, it is not because the issue is not moving; it \nis because I am not moving. I want to urge my colleagues to think long \nand hard before we take an action that, in reality, is a step toward \nrepealing the essence of the Federal Reserve Act.\n  Let me turn to the other side of the story. It is an important story. \nI have explained first how this amendment is a step toward repealing \nthe Federal Reserve Act by giving the control of bank regulation to the \nTreasury instead of the Federal Reserve. But let me explain that, for \nsafety and soundness, for the well-being of the taxpayer, and for \ncompetition, this amendment is also a bad thing. Banks receive a \nsubsidy from the Government because they have their principal asset--\ndeposits--insured by the FDIC. They have deposit insurance. No other \nnonbanking institution has that guarantee. Your insurance salesman \ndoesn't have it. Your securities broker doesn't have it. The stock \nexchange doesn't have it. The bank has it.\n  The bank also has the ability to go to the Federal Reserve and borrow \nat the lowest interest rates in the country. And they have the ability \nto use the Fed wire to transfer money that is guaranteed. What all that \nmeans is that if you let banks provide broad-based financial services, \nwhich this bill does--but it requires them to do it outside the bank--\nif you let them do it inside the bank, these huge banks with massive \ncapital, when they are selling securities or underwriting them--or, \nultimately, because if you let them do securities today, in 5 or 10 \nyears, you are going to let them do insurance within the bank, and we \nall know it--these banks will have an enormous and unfair competitive \nadvantage due entirely to the Federal subsidies they are receiving.\n  When they are selling securities, or selling insurance or \nunderwriting it, they are going to have a competitive advantage because \nthey can borrow money more cheaply than an insurance company or an \nindependent stockbroker. So what is going to happen over time is, with \nthat competitive advantage, they are going to end up dominating the \nsecurities industry, and in the long run, dominating the insurance \nindustry.\n  I ask you the question: Do we want a banking industry that dominates \nthe entire financial services industry? I helped write this bill to \npromote more competition. I did not write this bill so that 20 years \nfrom now we look like Japan, with 10 banks dominating the entire \nfinancial services area. I know about the Presiding Officer, but I \ndon't know about other people. I happen to love my independent \ninsurance agents and they love me, and I appreciate it. I happen to \nlove my little independent stockbroker in my hometown; he was my \ncampaign manager the first time I ever ran for Congress. I don't want \nto force these people out of business by giving an unfair competitive \nadvantage to banks.\n  We are not talking about foreign banks who don't know how to do it, \neven with a Government subsidy; we are talking about American banks \nthat know how to do it.\n  Now, Mr. President, the next problem is that we are going to create \nan unlevel playing field, and banks are going to dominate these \nindustries not because they are better, but because their structure of \nbeing able to provide these services within banks is one that is \ncheaper to operate in.\n  The third and final problem is selling insurance--underwriting \ninsurance--which ultimately will happen if we go this direction with \nop-subs on securities--selling securities; underwriting securities is \nrisky business.\n  What we are doing, if we put that power within the structure of the \nbank, is that taxpayers are underwriting it, at least implicitly with \nFederal deposit insurance. So we are putting the taxpayer on the hook.\n  The alternative in the bill is, except for very small banks that \ncan't afford to have holding companies, to require banks that have \nholding companies--and they are large enough to have them, they can \nprovide all these new services--but they have to do them outside the \nbanks. So the taxpayer is not on the hook for the deposit insurance for \nthese activities, and the banks don't get a subsidy to conduct these \nactivities due to the fact that capital is cheaper inside the bank, and \nwe don't create a structure where the Treasury--a political \ninstitution--exercises more banking regulation and the Fed less.\n  Alan Greenspan, testifying before the House Commerce Committee last \nweek, made a very strong statement. Those of you who know Alan \nGreenspan know that he is not prone to get to the point. In fact, we \nhave reporters in this town who have become very successful by figuring \nout what Alan Greenspan is saying. He will go around the barn and the \nouthouse, and all over the barnyard, before he finally gets to the \npoint. And, if he is saying something that he knows somebody isn't \ngoing to like, he is even more roundabout so as not to hurt anyone's \nfeelings. Quite frankly, he does it perfectly. Every central banker in \nthe world models himself after Alan Greenspan, who is the greatest \ncentral banker probably in the history of the world.\n  But he wasn't beating around the bush when he talked to the House \nCommerce Committee. He said, ``I and my colleagues''--he means members \nof the Federal Reserve Board--``are firmly of the view that the long-\nterm stability of U.S. financial markets and the interests of the \nAmerican taxpayer would be better served by no financial modernization \nbill rather than one that allows the proposed new activities to be \nconducted by the bank. . . .''\n  This is not just an average kind of Joe talking.\n  It is interesting to me that we talk to a few bankers on the \ntelephone, and all of a sudden we think we know as much about banking \npolicy as Alan Greenspan. This is the most successful central banker in \nhistory who is saying that when you look at the three problems with \nthis approach, one, you put the taxpayer on the hook in a risky \nbusiness that ought not to be inside the bank; that, two, you create an \nunfair playing surface that will create unfair competition and hurt the \neconomy, and make the economy more vulnerable; and, finally, you \ntransfer control of bank regulations from an independent agency--the \nFed--to the Treasury and, therefore, to the President.\n  Based on those three things, Alan Greenspan--who is a strong \nsupporter of this bill; he is for this bill; at the end of the last \nCongress, he spent numerous hours trying to get it passed, and he is \nfor it now--says, if you adopt this amendment then the country would be \nbetter off with no bill at all.\n  My colleagues, it has been a long 3 days of debating. I never \nchallenge anybody's sincerity. But I want to urge my colleagues, my \nDemocrat colleagues who are getting all this pressure now, you know--\nRepublicans have won on many of these issues, this is an opportunity \nfor Democrats to win; the Secretary of the Treasury has said that the \nPresident will veto the bill if you do not give the Treasury control \nover banking policy. And I know that my Democrat colleagues are under a \nlot of pressure.\n  But I want to urge my colleagues to look at what we are doing here in \nterms of moving away from an independent banking authority toward \nputting the control of banking policy under the President. It is a \nvery, very dangerous thing to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist the pressure and vote against this. \nOrdinarily two-thirds of the Democrat Members of Congress would oppose \nthis amendment. But what is happening here, in part because the issue \nhas become so partisan--and I am partly to blame for this--but what is \nhappening is we have a dynamic where an amendment that should not be \neven seriously considered is going to have a very, very close vote, and \ncould very well pass.\n  I just urge my colleagues, if you are not swayed by risk to the \ntaxpayer, if you are not swayed by unfair competition and concentration \nof industry--and many of my Democrat colleagues are swayed by those \nthings in most of the issues--if you are not swayed by\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\nthat, be swayed by Secretary Rubin who thinks the administration ought \nto control banking policy. We decided in 1913 not to let him do it. Do \nwe want to go back and change that decision today? I don't think so.\n  I want to conclude by saying to my Republican colleagues--I know \nSenator Shelby is very persuasive. That is one of the reasons that I \nlove him and that we are very good friends. I know a lot of people have \nbeen torn with me grabbing them and screaming in one ear, and Senator \nShelby grabbing them and screaming in their other ear. I know they are \nready for this thing to be over. But this is not a parochial issue, or \na personal issue, or a regional issue.\n  When we are talking about reversing a policy established in 1913 for \nindependent banking authority because the Secretary of the Treasury \nwants the President to conduct banking policy, something we rejected in \n1913, this goes way beyond hearing from your bank back home that says, \n``Gee, I would rather do it this way. I appreciate the bill. You have \ndone it. It is going to help me. But you could help me more by letting \nme do it this way.'' I think we have to resist that siren song.\n  I don't want to sound too preachy, so let me just stop and urge my \ncolleagues to give some long and prayerful deliberation on this \namendment, because I think it is very important. I know it is a hard \nvote. I wish it weren't so hard.\n  But I think it is a very clear vote. I think if you stand back and \nlook at it, it is hard to think of a vote we have cast around here that \nwas much clearer in terms of what is the national interest. It can't be \ngood for your bank back home if it is bad for America. I think that is \nthe key issue I would like people to remember.\n  Mr. President, can you tell me how much time I have left, and how \nmuch time Senator Shelby has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 19 minutes 53 \nseconds; the Senator from Alabama has 37 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I had better let him talk more. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator may \nconsume to the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I am \npleased to support his amendment, together with Senator Daschle.\n  I think it underscores the bipartisan nature of this amendment that \nboth Senator Shelby and Senator Daschle are here today to advance a \nvery important issue. It is a very important issue that I have been \nworking on for over a year.\n  In fact, in the last Congress, I had an amendment in the Banking \nCommittee that was very similar to this, and my impetus is to suggest \nthis amendment was based upon my experience as not only a Senator but \nalso as someone who was a lawyer and involved in banking matters in my \nhome State of Rhode Island.\n  It is very important to clear up a misconception that might be \noperating at the moment that the Federal Reserve is the exclusive \nrepository of banking direction and regulation in the United States. \nSuch a claim is just wrong. Banking policy in the United States is the \nprovince of many different organizations. The Federal Reserve \nprincipally, starting in 1956 with the Bank Holding Company Act, \nregulates the operations of bank holding companies.\n  Here is a simple schematic of what a bank holding company is. It is a \nholding company--a corporation under State law usually owning a bank, \nand also owning the other affiliates.\n  This bank holding structure became an issue in the 1950s, and as a \nresult the Federal Reserve was empowered by Congress--I should emphasie \n``by Congress,'' not by its own direction--to regulate bank holding \ncompanies. But long before that, beginning in the 1860s, national banks \nwere regulated under the Department of the Treasury and the Comptroller \nof the Currency. Indeed, other financial entities, other depository \nentities, are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision.\n  We should be very clear. This is not an attempt to wrench away from \nthe Federal Reserve their exclusive prerogative to run the banking \nsystem in the United States. This amendment is attempting to provide \nflexibility to banking organizations so they can conduct a limited \nrange of activities in either a subsidiary of the bank or an affiliate \nof the bank.\n  If they are conducted in the affiliate, they will be regulated under \ncurrent law and under our anticipated legislation by the Federal \nReserve; if they are conducted in the subsidiary, they will be \nregulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the other \nregulator of this particular bank.\n  It is also important to note that there are only two rather narrowly \ndefined activities that could be conducted under the Shelby-Daschle \namendment: Securities underwriting or merchant banking activities. I \nshould hasten to add that these two activities would also be regulated \nby the functional regulator. If it is securities activities, it would \nbe regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are talking \nabout a very narrow band of activities. It is important to keep that in \nmind.\n  We are in no way talking about displacing the Federal Reserve as a \nprincipal regulator of bank holding companies. What we are talking \nabout is giving banking organizations the flexibility to decide, based \nupon their own analysis, whether they want to conduct these two limited \nactivities, either an affiliate or a subsidiary of the bank.\n  What the underlying legislation, S. 900, would do essentially is give \nthe Federal Reserve all the authority. It would cut out effectively \nwhat currently exists, the regulating authority of the Comptroller of \nthe Currency to determine a limited range of activities that either \ncould or could not be done either in the bank itself or a subsidiary \nbank.\n  Many have described this as a turf fight. I don't think that is a \nproper description. What we should be doing and what the Shelby \namendment is attempting to do is to provide the type of regulatory \nbalance necessary, first, to guarantee safety and soundness; and, \nsecond, to give banking institutions the flexibility to conduct the \nbusiness the way they decide rather than the way we might dictate here \nin Washington.\n  Now, one of the interesting things to know is that we are attempting \nto change a high bond regulatory structure that was erected in the wake \nof the 1930s. I note that the Senator from Texas noted that all of our \nfinancial problems were solved in 1913 when we created the Federal \nReserve, but there was a brief interlude in the 1930s where the economy \nwas in disarray during the Depression.\n  As a result of that, we created the Glass-Steagall Act that separated \nvarious activities. We now recognize, because of many different \nfactors, that we should in fact undo this very rigid structure and \nprovide flexibility for a combination of different financial \nactivities--insurance activities, security activities, depository \nactivities. However, this amendment, the Shelby-Daschle amendment, goes \nto the heart of that flexibility by providing the kind of business \nflexibility that banks should have in this new, very fast paced \ninternational economic environment.\n  I explained basically the structure of the typical bank holding \ncompany, and I think that is useful because for the last several weeks \nwe have been hearing jargon such as ``op-sub'' and ``affiliate,'' et \ncetera. It is exactly what I suggested before: A bank holding company, \na company that is typically a commercial enterprise, a State-chartered \ncompany, owns a depository institution; in turn, they operate some \nactivities and subsidiaries throughout the affiliate. That is basically \nwhat we are talking about now.\n  The question is, What should we do to ensure that, first, safety and \nsoundness is protected; and, two, that the banks have the kind of \nflexibility they need and the corporate governance to operate \neffectively?\n  What we are proposing with this amendment is that in these two \nlimited activities--securities activities and merchant banking--the \nbank holding company have the choice of either doing it in a subsidiary \nor affiliate. As I understand it, the underlying legislation would \nallow a very small bank holding company to conduct these activities in \na subsidiary. So this is, in some respects, an issue of size. But the\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\nprinciple already exists within the context of the underlying \nlegislation that these activities can, in fact, be conducted in \nsubsidiaries.\n  Looking ahead at what the amendment requires, it is very important to \nnote that in order to conduct these activities a bank would have to \nmeet certain tests. First of all, the bank would have to be well \nmanaged and well capitalized. This is a requirement that would be \nsimilar on bank holding companies.\n  In addition to this, the bank would also have to do specific things \nto allow or qualify for the conduct of these activities. First of all, \nif the bank was going to conduct the activities in a subsidiary, it \nwould have to deduct its equity investment in the subsidiary from its \nown equity. As a result, this provides protections for the bank and for \nthe overall depository system. In addition, it would have to remain \nwell capitalized after the equity deduction.\n  The point here is that the regulators essentially could be satisfied \nthat even as this subsidiary failed, even if the whole investment were \nlost, it would not adversely affect the capital bank, which is at the \nheart of their notion of protecting safety and soundness.\n  In addition to that, they would be limited to the amount of money \nthey could invest in a subsidiary. It would be limited to this same \namount of money they could ``dividend upwards'' to the bank holding \ncompany--another check on the safety and soundness provisions in this \nlegislation.\n  Moreover, if these activities are conducted in a subsidiary, the \nwhole relationship would be governed by section 23(a) and 23(b) of the \nFederal Reserve Act. These two sections govern transactions between \nbank affiliates and other holding company affiliates. Essentially, it \nrequires that there be arm's-length dealing between these two entities.\n  For example, section 23(a) imposes a percentage cap on transactions \nbetween a bank and our operating subsidiary--the subsidiary cannot be \nthe exclusive source of business for the bank, and vice versa. In \naddition, section 23(a) provides safeguards with respect to collateral \nthat could and must be used for lending transactions between the bank \nand subsidiary. In sum, there are provisions in the amendment to guard \nagainst the self-dealing that would lead to breaches of safety and \nsoundness.\n  All of these things together suggest very strongly that what we are \nproposing is entirely consistent with the safety and soundness of the \nbanking system. Indeed, that should be our primary legislative \nmotivation, to be sure that whatever we do here is consistent with \nsafety and soundness.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion about the mysterious \nsubsidy that Chairman Greenspan is talking about, the fact that \n``...the reason I oppose this is because of this hidden subsidy,'' \nbecause of this transfer.\n\n  In his words, ``My concerns are not about safety and soundness.'' I \nam glad, because I think we have convinced or at least we have \nsuggested that we have considered very thoroughly and carefully the \nsafety and soundness issues.\n\n       It is the issue of creating subsidies for individual \n     institutions which their competitors do not have. It is a \n     level playing field. . ..\n\n  The subsidy, as explained before, rests upon essentially the \nguarantee of deposit by Federal deposit insurance.\n  Now, what we have done, first, is protected safety and soundness; \nsecond, these subsidies are frequently offset in discussions--indeed, \nmany times complaints--about the restrictions that go along with the \ndepositor insurance. We debated yesterday at length about CRA. That \nadheres to a bank because of its deposit insurance. That is a cost that \nother competitors could not have.\n  So when we look at this whole notion of subsidy, there is a very real \nargument, when it is balanced out, that this subsidy is not \nparticularly significant, that in the margin it will not make a \ndifference whether you conduct this activity in a subsidiary or in an \naffiliate. Moreover, when a bank holding company is attempting to go to \nthe equity markets to raise equity through stock offerings or through \ncommercial debt paper, no one looks exclusively, uniquely, solely at \nthe bank; they look at the combined activities of the holding company.\n  So if there is a subsidiary at the bank, that all washes out through \nthe bottom line of the bank holding company balance sheet. This notion \nthat the subsidiary is the driving force I don't think is entirely \ncorrect.\n  Moreover, when you look at experts who have dealt with this whole \nissue of whether or not these activities should be conducted in a \nsubsidiary, those in fact who have been responsible for the operation \nof the FDIC, most of the recent chairpersons--Ricky Halperin, William \nIsaac, and William Seidman--have argued very strongly and forcefully \nthat in fact placing these activities into a subsidiary would, in fact, \nbe a beneficial and not a detrimental aspect and, in fact, potentially \ncould be a plus for the Bank Insurance Fund.\n  It would be so because if, in fact, there was a troubled bank with a \nhealthy subsidiary, either in the securities business or in the \nmerchant banking business, those healthy assets would be a source of \nfunds to cover depository losses, potentially in the bank. Such \ncoverage from a subsidiary would offset the need for a contribution by \nthe taxpayer-supported deposit insurance fund.\n  It has been mentioned before that foreign banks, in fact, have these \npowers within the continental United States because of international \nbanking agreements. In fact, there are 19 foreign banks with securities \nunderwriting subsidiaries in the United States and these banks have \nabout $450 billion in assets and they would be allowed to continue \ntheir operations under the S. 900 bill, the underlying legislation. As \nSenator Shelby pointed out, this is on the surface a disparate \ntreatment between domestic banks and foreign banks, but I think it \nreveals something else. It goes right back to that issue of: Is there a \nsubsidy? Because these foreign banks are also subsidized by deposit \ninsurance, in most cases, in their country of origin, the country of \nincorporation. And they are also subsidized in the same way as are our \nbanks, by government policies, by access to the central bank's discount \nwindow, by a whole series of governmental programs that assist banking \ninstitutions.\n  If you put back Chairman Greenspan's words--again, let me remind you, \nhe is not talking about safety and soundness. He is talking about this \nmysterious subsidy. Those are his words, but what are the actions of \nthe Federal Reserve when it comes down to approving the applications of \nthese foreign banks to operate security subsidies in the United States?\n  First of all, the Federal Reserve, in the applications they had to \napprove, looked at the whole subsidiary issue. And they found that \ntechnically there was probably a subsidy to the subsidiaries. But what \nthey suggested in approving these applications, which they did, is that \nby essentially imposing restrictions, as we have done, in terms of \ncapital contributions, in terms of the possible transactions between \nthe bank and subsidiary--that they would be offset. So essentially what \nthe Chairman says and what the Federal Reserve does are two different \nthings. He says this is a dangerous subsidy, yet when they have to \napprove an application of a foreign bank to operate a subsidiary in the \nUnited States, they say they can control that subsidy, essentially, by \nthe same means that we are suggesting--capital contributions and other \ntechniques.\n  So, if you listen to what is being said but look at what is being \ndone in the world, I think, deeds speak louder than words. And the \ndeeds are that this subsidy issue is a false one. Any subsidy is either \ndissipated through the holding company system or is offset in our \namendment by the requirements to deduct capital, by the requirements to \nlimit the investment into a subsidiary to the amount that you could \nupstream to a holding company for further investment in an affiliate.\n\n  There is another aspect which I think is telling with respect to the \nFederal Reserve, their position. I think this could come as a surprise \nto lots of people. American banks today can own operating subsidiaries \nand do own operating subsidiaries which can in fact perform merchant \nbanking activities and securities activities--the activities that we \nare authorizing in this amendment. But they can only have these \nsubsidiaries overseas, and interestingly enough, these subsidiaries are \nregulated by the Federal Reserve Bank. They are called Edge Act \ncompanies.\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\n  So what we are proposing today in this amendment is no novel \nredistribution of regulatory opportunities or banking opportunities, \nreally. What we are saying, essentially, is if the Federal Reserve can \nregulate and authorize American banks through foreign subsidiaries to \nconduct insurance activities and securities activities and merchant \nbanking activities overseas, why do they object to American banks doing \nthe same thing in the United States? The same thing--limited, of \ncourse, to securities activities and merchant banking.\n  There are, as we estimated, subsidiaries with $250 billion in assets, \nsubsidiaries of American banks operating overseas, subject to the \nregulation not of the Securities and Exchange Commission, but whatever \nforeign regulator is looking at their operation. Of course, the Fed \nconcludes--they must conclude--this does not pose a threat to the \nsafety and soundness of American banks. Of course, they must conclude \nthat whatever subsidy they are getting through deposit insurance, it is \nnot unfair for them to apply that overseas to invest in foreign \nsubsidiaries to conduct these activities. In fact, the operations of \nthese banks' subsidiaries overseas, these Edge Act companies, are far \nless regulated than what we are proposing in our amendment. These are \nnot bound by section 23 (a) and (b). They are also not bound by our \nrestrictions, by the amount of money that can be invested in the \nsubsidiary.\n  So I think the Federal Reserve position--in terms of the facts, not \nthe rhetoric, not the appeals to the history--is very weak indeed. The \nfacts establish, No. 1, that in fact they have no objection to American \nbanks' operating subsidiaries' overseas securities activities. It does \nnot pose a threat to safety and soundness in their view. It is not an \nunfair use of the subsidy if that subsidy exists.\n  So I think we have to be very careful to conclude that what we have \nhere is an amendment that gives banks flexibility, that does not \nimplicate the safety and soundness of the banking system, that does not \nin any way distort the monetary policymaking role of the Federal \nReserve. That in fact is consistent with over 100 years of banking \nregulation in the United States, which is a shared function between \nmany different banking regulators in the United States. In fact, it is \nsomething that will provide the flexibility that is at the heart of \nthis legislation.\n  I hope we will, in fact, support this amendment. It represents a \nbipartisan attempt to be consistent with the overall theme of this \nlegislation, which is to unshackle our banking institutions from the \nhidebound rules of the Glass-Steagall Act, to give them an opportunity \nto compete but to do so in a way that does not implicate, intimidate \nor, undermine the safety or soundness of the banking system which is \nour ultimate responsibility.\n  I hope, again, we will accept, adopt and support this amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  (Mr. GRAMM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to address \nwhat we have been looking at in the Banking Committee now for a couple \nof years. We have had very detailed hearings, where both Alan Greenspan \nand Secretary Rubin have presented their case. I have to admit, during \nmost of those everybody has said: What kind of a turf battle are we \nlooking at here? The comments have been kind of mixed because it is an \nextremely difficult area to understand. It is an area between the \nFederal Reserve and the Treasury. But it is an area that affects the \nways that banks will operate. We are trying to design, under this bill, \na mechanism for the American banking system to succeed, to provide for \nsecurity and soundness for the banking system, to provide for safety. \nNow, is that done under the Treasury or is it done under the Federal \nReserve?\n  As one of those accountants, I suggest that the Treasury handles the \naccounting function very well. They do an excellent job of auditing our \nbanks. They do an excellent job of overseeing the accounting aspects of \nthe bank. But the Federal Reserve does the outstanding job of \noverseeing the banking policy for our country. If we begin to establish \na system where the administration, who can reflect to times of \nelection, has control over the banks and the banking establishment and \nthe banking policy, our country could be in trouble.\n  If the banking policy is established by the administration with the \nbenefit of the Federal wire and the Federal funds and the lower loan \nrates, our country could begin to react more to elections than to the \neconomy.\n  We have had a fantastic system that has brought our economy to new \nheights, and it has been working under the Federal Reserve System. \nLet's not shift all of this around and allow the banks to have another \ntechnique where they can put businesses under their bank and have \ntransactions--and I think everybody realizes that the transactions, \nwhile there are generally accepted accounting principles for how those \nare done, they are not nearly as much in the open under a subsidiary as \nthey are under an affiliate.\n  We have some accounting techniques here that provide daylight for the \nbanking industry which provide safety and soundness for the banking \nindustry and the consumers.\n  I suggest that Alan Greenspan and whoever holds that position has to \nhave enough ability to control the economy of the banks and the power \nof the banks to keep the economy of this Nation going.\n  This is an issue that is extremely difficult to understand. After all \nof the hearings we have held on it, it is possible to see it still is \nunder a cloud of misunderstanding. I hear the terms brought out about \nhow foreign banks are involved and how foreign banks are allowed to \noperate. The foreign banks are not the ones providing the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation money. They are not the ones insuring the \nmoney of the consumers of this country. I opt for the safety and \nsoundness provided by the Federal Reserve. I ask that you defeat the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The authors of the amendment have 16 minutes, \nand the opponents of the amendment have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me 4 minutes?\n  Mr. REED. I do not control time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me 4 minutes?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield to the Senator from Maryland 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Maryland for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in view of the comments that were just \nmade by my able colleague from Wyoming, I want to address this safety \nand soundness issue. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to \nwhich he referred, the regulatory agency with the most at stake in \nterms of protecting the deposit insurance funds, sees the op-sub as \nequivalent to the holding company structure for safety and soundness \nreasons.\n  The argument was just made that there are some safety and soundness \nproblems. The FDIC Chairman, Donna Tanoue, wrote a letter to the \nBanking Committee:\n\n       With the appropriate safeguards, the operating subsidiary \n     and the holding company structures both provide adequate \n     safety and soundness protection. We see no compelling public \n     policy reason why policymakers should prefer one structure \n     over the other. And absent such a compelling reason, we \n     believe the Government should not interfere in banks' choice \n     of organizational structure.\n\n  That is the current Chairman of the FDIC. Lest someone says that is \nonly the current Chairman, let me refer to an article written by three \nprevious FDIC Chairmen, both in Democratic and Republican \nadministrations: Ricki Tigert Helfer, William Isaac, and William \nSeidman, all of them with many years of direct experience in this area. \nThey all agree with the current FDIC Chairman and have offered strong \nsupport for the operating subsidiary approach.\n  In fact, I will quote from their article. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. The article says:\n\n       The debate on banks conducting financial activities through \n     operating subsidiaries has been portrayed as a battle between \n     the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. The Treasury believes \n     banks should be permitted to conduct expanded activities \n     through direct subsidiaries. The Fed wants these activities \n     to be conducted only through holding company affiliates.\n       Curiously, the concerns of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corp. have been largely ignored. The FDIC, alone among the \n     agencies, has no ``turf'' at stake in this issue, as its \n     supervisory reach extends to any affiliate of a bank. The \n     FDIC's sole motivation is to safeguard the nation's banks \n     against systemic risks.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Every subsequent FDIC chairman, including the current one, \n     has taken the same position . . .\n\n  In other words, allowing with the view toward bank subsidiaries \nconducting these activities.\n  In fact, they point out that requiring the bank-related activities be \nconducted in holding companies will place insured banks in the worst \npossible position. They will be exposed to the risk of the affiliates' \nfailures without reaping the benefits of the affiliates' successes.\n  It is very clear that the regulator concerns of the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation are supportive of doing it either way.\n  Will the Senator yield me 1 more minute?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be glad to yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, let me quickly run through some \nimportant safety mechanisms that are in the Shelby-Daschle-Reed \namendment:\n  One, a full capital deduction for investments in subsidiaries so that \nall such investments would be fully deducted from the bank's regulatory \ncapital. Banks must remain well capitalized after this deduction, \nmeaning even if the subsidiary fails, the bank's capital will remain \nintact.\n  Two, downstream investments in subsidiaries be no greater than the \ntotal amount that a bank could upstream as a dividend to a holding \ncompany. So they have exactly the same extent to which they can engage \nin new financial activities between the subsidiary or the affiliate.\n  We remove any advantage for subsidiaries in terms of transactions \nwith their parent banks by applying sections 23(a) and 23(b) of the \nFederal Reserve Act to subsidiaries, just like affiliates. It would \nrequire the maintenance of subsidiaries as separate corporate entities.\n  The bank's credit exposure to a subsidiary be no greater than it \ncould have been to an affiliate.\n  Real estate investment and insurance underwriting is not permitted in \nthe subsidiary.\n  All of these features, I think, go to ensuring the safety and \nsoundness of the approach contained in the Shelby-Daschle-Reed \namendment, and I am supportive of this amendment.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the American Banker, Sept. 2, 1998]\n\n         Ex-FDIC Chiefs Unanimously Favor the Op-Sub Structure\n\n   (By Ricki Tigert Helfer, William M. Isaac, and L. William Seidman)\n\n       The debate on banks conducting financial activities through \n     operating subsidiaries has been portrayed as a battle between \n     the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. The Treasury believes \n     banks should be permitted to conduct expanded activities \n     through direct subsidiaries. The Fed wants these activities \n     to be conducted only through holding company affiliates.\n       Curiously, the concerns of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corp. have been largely ignored. The FDIC, alone among the \n     agencies, has no ``turf'' at stake in this issue, as its \n     supervisory reach extends to any affiliate of a bank. The \n     FDIC's sole motivation is to safeguard the nation's banks \n     against systemic risks.\n       In the early 1980s, when one of us, William Isaac, became \n     the first FDIC chairman to testify on this subject, he was \n     responding to a financial modernization proposal to authorize \n     banks to expand their activities through holding company \n     affiliates.\n       While endorsing the thrust of the bill, he objected to \n     requiring that activities be conducted in the holding company \n     format. Every subsequent FDIC chairman, including the current \n     one, has taken the same position, favoring bank subsidiaries \n     (except Bill Taylor who, due to his untimely death, never \n     expressed his views). Each has had the full backing of the \n     FDIC professional staff on this issue.\n       The bank holding company is a U.S. invention; no other \n     major country requires this format. It has inherent problems, \n     apart from its inefficiency. For example, there is a built-in \n     conflict of interest between a bank and its parent holding \n     company when financial problems arise. The FDIC is still \n     fighting a lawsuit with creditors of the failed Bank of New \n     England about whether the holding company's directors \n     violated their fiduciary duty by putting cash into the \n     troubled lead bank.\n       Whether financial activities such as securities and \n     insurance underwriting are in a bank subsidiary or a holding \n     company affiliate, it is important that they be capitalized \n     and funded separately from the bank. If we require this \n     separation, the bank will be exposed to the identical risk of \n     loss whether the company is organized as a bank subsidiary or \n     a holding company affiliate.\n       The big difference between the two forms of organization \n     comes when the activity is successful, which presumably will \n     be most of the time. If the successful activity is conducted \n     in a subsidiary of the bank, the profits will accrue to the \n     bank.\n       Should the bank get into difficulty, it will be able to \n     sell the subsidiary to raise funds to shore up the bank's \n     capital. Should the bank fail, the FDIC will own the \n     subsidiary and can reduce its losses by selling the \n     subsidiary.\n       If the company is instead owned by the bank's parent, the \n     profits of the company will not directly benefit the bank. \n     Should the bank fail, the FDIC will not be entitled to sell \n     the company to reduce its losses.\n       Requiring that bank-related activities be conducted in \n     holding company affiliates will place insured banks in the \n     worst possible position. They will be exposed to the risk of \n     the affiliates' failure without reaping the benefits of the \n     affiliates' successes.\n       Three times during the 1980s, the FDIC's warnings to \n     Congress on safety and soundness issues went unheeded, due \n     largely to pressures from special interests:\n       The FDIC urged in 1980 that deposit insurance not be \n     increased from $40,000 to $100,000 while interest rates were \n     being deregulated.\n       The FDIC urged in 1983 that money brokers be prohibited \n     from dumping fully insured deposits into weak banks and S \n     paying the highest interest.\n       The FDIC urged in 1984 that the S insurance fund be \n     merged into the FDIC to allow the cleanup of the S problems \n     before they spun out of control.\n       The failure to heed these warnings--from the agency charged \n     with insuring the soundness of the banking system and \n     covering its losses--cost banks and S, their customers, \n     and taxpayers many tens of billions of dollars.\n       Ignoring the FDIC's strongly held views on how bank-related \n     activities should be organized could well lead to history \n     repeating itself. The holding company model is inferior to \n     the bank subsidiary approach and should not be mandated by \n     Congress.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Ten minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I rise in strong support of the Shelby amendment and urge the Senate \nto approve this amendment today. I say this with utmost respect for my \ncommittee chairman, Senator Phil Gramm. As you know, I support Phil \nGramm and we agree on so many issues across the board, but this is one \ntime when I have to disagree with my chairman. As I say, even his \nlovely wife Wendy disagrees with Senator Phil Gramm on a few issues. I \nhope he realizes the respect I have for him and his arguments on this \namendment, but I feel that I have to support this.\n  As a Senator who worked on a bipartisan basis last year with Senator \nReed of Rhode Island to draft a compromise operating subsidiary \namendment, I have invested a great deal of time studying the pluses and \nminuses of this option. I have come to the conclusion that it is \nappropriate for national banks to conduct full financial activities, \nwith the exception of insurance underwriting and real estate \ndevelopment in the operating subsidiary.\n  This amendment preserves corporate flexibility by allowing \nsubsidiaries of well-capitalized and well-managed national banks to \nconduct many of the same activities--such as securities underwriting \nand merchant banking--as bank holding companies and foreign bank \nsubsidiaries.\n  I would like to note that insurance underwriting and real estate \ndevelopment are not permitted in the subsidiary.\n  Although some have claimed that the subsidiary approach could lead to \na competitive advantage for banks, the amendment prevents competitive \nadvantages by imposing the same prerequisites for conducting new \nfinancial\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nactivities on national banks as are placed on bank holding companies.\n  The subsidiary also is safer for national banks. First, the amendment \nincludes a number of appropriate safety and soundness ``firewalls'' to \nensure that the subsidiary remains an asset to--and not a liability \nof--the bank.\n  These firewalls include: one, requiring that capital invested in the \nsubsidiary be deducted from the capital of the bank and that the bank \nremains well-capitalized after the deduction; two, prohibiting the \nconsolidation of assets of the subsidiary and the bank; three, limiting \nthe investment the bank may make in the subsidiary to the same amount \nthat the bank could ``upstream'' to holding company affiliates by way \nof dividends; four, requiring the bank to maintain procedures for \nidentifying and managing financial and operational risks posed by the \nsubsidiary; five, requiring the bank to maintain--and regulators to \nensure--a separate corporate identity and separate legal status from \nthe subsidiary; and six, imposing the lending restrictions found in \nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit \nfrom the bank to the subsidiary--total extensions of credit to any one \nsubsidiary may not exceed 10 percent of the bank's capital and total \nextensions of credit to all subsidiaries may not exceed 20 percent of \nthe bank's capital.\n  The operating subsidiary approach adds another safety and soundness \nelement because the subsidiary could be used as an asset to protect the \ntaxpayer if the bank runs into trouble.\n  FDIC Chairman Donna Tanoue--the Federal Government's point person \nprotecting the taxpayer against claims on the deposit insurance fund--\ntestified that:\n\n       From a safety and soundness perspective, both the bank \n     operating subsidiary and the holding company affiliate \n     structure can provide adequate protection to the insured \n     depository institution from the direct or indirect effects of \n     losses in nonbank subsidiaries or affiliation.\n       Indeed, from the standpoint of benefits that accrue to the \n     insured depository institution, or to the deposit insurer in \n     the case of a bank failure, there are advantages to a direct \n     subsidiary relationship with the bank.\n       When it is the bank that is financially troubled and the \n     affiliate/subsidiary is sound, the value of the subsidiary \n     serves to directly reduce the exposure of the FDIC.\n       If the firm is a nonbank subsidiary of the parent holding \n     company, none of these values is available to insured bank \n     subsidiaries, or to the FDIC if the bank should fail. Thus, \n     the subsidiary structure can provide superior safety and \n     soundness protection.\n\n  The last point made by FDIC Chairman Tanoue actually argues against \nthe purported subsidy argument point put forward by some. Take for \nexample two identical banks--Bank A and Bank B.\n  Bank A conducts its nonbank activities in a subsidiary and Bank B \nconducts its nonbank activities in the holding company.\n  In this case, the FDIC's exposure in Bank A is less than in Bank B \nbecause the amount of capital which could be raised either from the \nsub's assets or from the sale of the sub would actually reduce the \nlosses of Bank A.\n  Thus, the FDIC's exposure in Bank B is higher because, as proven in \nthe Bank of New England case, the sale of the affiliate cannot be \ncounted on to reduce the banks losses.\n  Since both banks are identical and thus, have paid identical FDIC \ninsurance premiums, Bank B receives a higher subsidy from deposit \ninsurance because their return on FDIC insurance premiums paid is \nhigher than Bank A, whose losses were lessened by the amount of capital \nraised by the sub.\n  Therefore, the operating subsidiary structure is safer from a safety \nand soundness perspective.\n  The amendment also removes the arbitrary $1 billion cap which is \ncontained in the underlying bill. FDIC Chairman Donna Tanoue testified \nbefore the Senate Banking Committee that ``There is no valid reason to \nthreat national banks differently on the basis of size or holding \ncompany affiliation.''\n  Another benefit of this amendment is that it provides competition \namong regulators. And that is so important. A recent conversation I had \nwith a banking lawyer convinced me that this amendment is prudent \npublic policy.\n  The attorney shared with me that in his dealings with the Federal \nReserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of \nthe agencies had been cooperative in helping his client work through \nissues and find creative ways to deal with their problems while the \nother had done nothing to help.\n  If we were to eliminate the competition, regulators would have no \nincentive to be responsible to the institutions they regulate and \nAmerican banks would have nowhere to turn if they are unhappy with \ntheir treatment.\n  In closing, I think this amendment should not be portrayed as a \nkiller amendment. And I hope and I urge the chairman and the majority \nleader to accept the will of the Senate and to allow the vote. Whether \nthe amendment passes or fails, I pledge to vote for the bill--no matter \nhow the amendment turns out.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I thank the Presiding Officer for \nrecognizing me.\n  First, I compliment Senator Gramm on the marvelous work he has done \non a very complicated bill. And I hope we get new legislation in this \narea before the week is out. Coming out of conference, I hope that we \nwill have something fundamentally positive for the banking industry of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, I have been in the Senate about 27 years. And I guess \nI would have to say, the institution of the United States for which I \nhave the most respect is the Federal Reserve Board. In fact, I marvel \nat the 1913 act, the Federal Reserve Act. Frankly, I marvel at the \ncaliber of people that have chaired the Fed and who act with total \nindependence once they are appointed. Only one time in my 27 years have \nI thought that the Federal Reserve Board Chairman and the President of \nthe United States were negotiating among themselves about interest \nrates and the like. For the most part, the Federal Reserve has been a \nmarvelous institution for stability and nonpolitical involvement in the \nbanking industry of America and for conducting the monetary policy of \nAmerica.\n  I see this issue as a very simple one. Do you want the Federal \nReserve Board to continue to be a major, major player in the banking \nsystem of the United States or do you want to send responsibility over \nto the White House?\n  When Congress created the Federal Reserve Board, there was a \ndifferent problem. But we decided to create the Fed independent of the \nWhite House and keep it out of politics. Now we are here engaged in a \nfight, in an argument, in a close vote on sending a big part of the \nFederal Reserve Board's responsibility back to the White House. This \namendment would allow a substantial portion of bank policy to be \ndictated by the White House. I do not believe it belongs there.\n  I am not saying this because of Secretary Rubin. I have agreed with \nalmost all of his policies. As a matter of fact, I have said his \neconomic policies remind me of Republicans and that probably is what \nsaved the President in terms of the policies that he has put into \neffect. I have told the Secretary that. I do not know whether he was \npleased or not so pleased to hear that, but I congratulated him \nnonetheless.\n  Essentially, this is the issue: Do you want to take a big piece of \nAmerican banking policy and put it back in the political arena? Because \nno matter what we think of the Comptroller of the Currency, he is a \npolitical appointee. And it is most amazing, in the hierarchy of those \nwho have power in America, it is not even a powerful position. It will \nbe powerful if the amendment before us passes, because we will be \ngiving the Comptroller tremendous control over our banking policy \ninstead of vesting it where it truly belongs, with the most significant \nindependent group in America's economic recovery since 1913--the \nFederal Reserve Board and its Chairman. I hope we do not do that.\n  I am amazed. It seems as though the White House believes that this is \none of\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\nthe most important issues it has ever faced. The lobbying pressure is \nenormous, with different levels of White House people--not the \nPresident,--but in the White House, Secretaries, Cabinet members. Maybe \nit is because they like Mr. Rubin so much they do not want him to lose \nthis one. Maybe that is it. But it can't be that kind of issue unless \nit is seen by the executive branch as involving such power that \nPresidents might want to have it, rather than leave that power in the \nhands of the independent, successful management of the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n\n  I thank you for yielding me time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SHELBY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. How much time does the Senator from Texas have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes, give or take a few seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Mack.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank Senator Gramm for \nyielding me time.\n  This was an issue that I did not expect to be drawn into as far as \nthe debate was concerned. But as I have listened to it, and as I have \nobserved my colleagues over the last several days, as the lobbying on \nboth sides of this issue has been going on, and seeing people move back \nand forth, I have become concerned about how people are making \ndecisions.\n  Finally, we have gotten down to the crux of the matter here, and that \nis, at least in my opinion, how monetary policy in the United States is \ngoing to be carried out.\n  I believe it is so important that we focus on the issue of monetary \npolicy, because one of the underlying strengths, one of the major \nfactors in the economic growth that we have experienced for almost 16 \nyears is the role of the Federal Reserve, a Federal Reserve that has \nbeen committed to price stability. To do something that will weaken the \ninfluence of the Federal Reserve with respect to monetary policy would \nbe a tragic mistake.\n\n  Here is my reasoning as to how this will come about. The Treasury is \nselling their idea to Members that all we really want to do is give the \nbankers a choice--that seems to be a fair and reasonable thing to do--\nlet them decide.\n  I was in the banking business. This is really not a choice. You are \nsaying to the bankers, you make a choice about where you are going to \nput this. They know where the cost of capital is the cheapest, and the \ncost of capital is going to be the cheapest in an operating subsidiary.\n  Why is the operating subsidiary going to be the cheapest cost to \nthem? Because there is a subsidy attached to the bank, and so the \nbankers naturally will go to where their costs are the cheapest. They \nwill, in fact, put these new powers into an operating subsidiary. \nHaving done that, there is no longer a need for them to be involved in \na holding company. The holding company is the vehicle, if you will, \nthat allows the Federal Reserve to carry out its monetary policy.\n  The second thing that is going to occur is by voting for the use of \nan operating subsidiary, you are really saying you want the taxpayers \nto expand the subsidy that goes into the banking industry or into the \nfinancial services industry. That is an individual decision that people \ncan make. But I think it is wrong to try to approach this question \nabout whether I am for the bankers or whether I am not for the bankers. \nThis is an issue about whether you want to have a monetary policy that \nis of value to this country.\n  I ask Members to consider what has happened in this country in these \npast 16 years as far as growth is concerned. The foundation of that \ngrowth has been the commitment that this Federal Reserve, and Alan \nGreenspan in particular, has had to the objective of price stability. \nWe have finally reached the point where we have attained price \nstability, and we are talking about tinkering around with legislation \nthat could lessen the influence of the Federal Reserve.\n  As Senator Domenici indicated earlier, as you lessen that influence, \nyou are going to increase the influence in the executive branch over \nthe banking industry and monetary policy in this country. That would be \na tragedy.\n  I ask my colleagues who may be wavering on this issue, this is not a \nchoice between Secretary Rubin or Alan Greenspan or commercial banks. \nThis is a decision about monetary policy in this country and who \nshould, in fact, have control of it.\n  I ask you to support the position outlined by the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator Gramm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  First, I point to the fifth paragraph of the Greenspan letter to \nChairman Gramm. It says, basically, that foreign bank-owned section 20 \ncompanies have substantially underperformed U.S.-owned section 20 \ncompanies. He goes on to say, ``The subsidy does not travel well.''\n  Are you suggesting the subsidy travels from New York to London but \nnot London to New York? In other words, not from foreign banks to the \nUnited States? The Federal Reserve's own letter says the subsidy is \nnontransferrable.\n\n  Safety and soundness? In Chairman Greenspan's own words, he says:\n\n       My concerns are not about safety and soundness. It is the \n     issue of creating subsidies for individual institutions which \n     their competitors do not have. It is a level playing field \n     issue. Nonbank holding companies or other institutions do not \n     have access to that subsidy, and it creates an unlevel \n     playing field. It is not a safety and soundness issue.\n\n  That is Chairman Greenspan's own words.\n  Lastly, is this a power grab? This legislation makes the Federal \nReserve the monopoly umbrella regulator. I do not have to educate the \ndistinguished chairman, who is a smart Ph.D. economist, on the abuses \nof a federally sanctioned monopoly. He has talked about it since I have \nknown him, and he is right on that.\n  My amendment would allow for competition for banks to choose their \nregulator. It does not mandate that any bank in the United States must \nconduct such activities in an operating subsidiary. It allows the bank \nto choose.\n  I am sure a free market economist like Senator Gramm understands more \nthan I do the benefits of market discipline. Competition among \nregulators will not allow a national bank regulator to run amok.\n  Does Chairman Greenspan support the bill? Of course. We are granting \nhim a monopoly. We are granting his successor a monopoly, whoever that \nis. I can't believe that Chairman Gramm, a distinguished economist in \nhis own right, is advocating a monopoly.\n  This amendment I am offering will promote competition. It promotes \nchoice. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I guess the best place to conclude is to \nquote the principals in this debate. Secretary Rubin before the House \nCommerce Committee said:\n\n       [O]ne of an elected Administration's critical \n     responsibilities is the formation of economic policy, and an \n     important component of that policy is banking policy. In \n     order for the elected Administration to have an effective \n     role in banking policy, it must have a strong connection with \n     the banking system.\n\n  What is being said here is that the Secretary of the Treasury \nbelieves that the President should exercise more control over the \nbanking system. Now, if you believe the time has come to turn back the \nclock to 1913 and take banking policy away from the independent Federal \nReserve, you agree with Secretary Rubin. I do not agree with Secretary \nRubin. The fact that I do not agree has nothing to do with the fact \nthat he is a Democrat and Bill Clinton is President. I do not believe \nany President should have control of banking policy. We decided in 1913 \nto put it in an independent agency, and that should not change.\n  All of you know that Alan Greenspan is not prone to overstatement--\nquite\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\nthe contrary--but Alan Greenspan has said that he and every member of \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, most of them appointed \nby President Clinton, are firmly of the view that the long-term \nstability of U.S. financial markets and the interests of the American \ntaxpayer would be better served by no financial modernization bill \nrather than adopting this amendment.\n  Now, that is as clear as you can make this debate. It is partly about \nrisk. It is riskier to be in the securities business inside a bank than \nit is outside the bank, when the taxpayer guarantees the bank \ndepositors. That is part of the reason to vote no on the Shelby \namendment. You do get a subsidy for a bank when they are doing \nactivities inside the bank, instead of having to take capital out and \ninvesting it like everybody else. And if you are worried about a level \nplaying surface, that is a reason to vote against the Shelby amendment. \nBut finally, if you believe that the Federal Reserve ought to conduct \nbanking policy, and not the Treasury, that is the strongest reason to \nvote against the Shelby amendment.\n\n  Finally, two points: No. 1, if my colleagues will vote to table the \nShelby amendment, we will work in conference to preserve the primacy of \nthe Fed to deal with problems of unfair competition and subsidy, and \nyet try to find a way to let banks choose between operating \nsubsidiaries and affiliates, to do these activities inside the bank or \nout.\n  Secondly, as hard as I have worked on this, and as strongly as I feel \nabout it, given Alan Greenspan's position and given that I believe he \nis right, we are not going to pass this bill tonight if we adopt the \nShelby amendment. So I urge my colleagues, if you want this bill, if \nyou want an independent banking policy, give me an opportunity in \nconference to sit the Secretary of the Treasury down and sit the head \nof the Federal Reserve down and give us a chance to come up with ways \nto do op-subs without letting the Treasury take over banking policy.\n  We can do that by simply not changing the regulator based on whether \nyou have a holding company or not, or what the holding company does. \nAnd we can find ways to require banks to have good capital and to see \nthat the subsidy doesn't exist. But to do that, we need to defeat this \namendment and pass this bill.\n  I know my colleagues are tired of being cajoled. They think a lot of \noverstatements have been made. I simply would like to say, from my \npart, I believe this is a critical vote. If you think passing the \nFederal Reserve Act was a good thing, if you think we prospered under \nan independent banking authority--and I do--then you want to vote \n``no'' on this amendment.\n  That doesn't mean that we can't later come up with a way of trying to \ndo this that works, and I pledge to my colleagues my best effort in \nconference to do that. But we can't do that if we can't pass this bill. \nAnd we can't pass this amendment and pass this bill. So that is where \nwe are. I know people have commitments out everywhere, and they are \ngoing to make somebody mad no matter what they do. But there is an old \nadage my grandmother used to say: ``If you are going to catch hell no \nmatter what you do, do the right thing.'' That is what I ask my \ncolleagues to do--the right thing.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to make a few \nremarks on this amendment prior to the time we have our vote.\n  I am very appreciative of the efforts made by the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama and the Senator from Maryland and for their \nextraordinary leadership in offering this amendment. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor.\n  We call this proposal the American Bank Fairness Amendment. It is \ncosponsored by a number of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \nOn this side, the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, is a leading \nexpert and a long-time champion of this measure. We are grateful to him \nfor the work he has done.\n\n  In a nutshell, this amendment, as my colleagues have noted, would \ngive American banks the freedom to organize their activities in a way \nthat makes the most sense to them. That is basically what it is. It is \nthat simple. Let's give the banks the freedom and the opportunity to \nmake their own choice. We are not going to have Government tell them \nwhat is the best choice; we are going to let them make up their own \nminds. Instead of forcing the banks to organize using an expensive \nholding company structure, as the underlying bill does, our proposal \nsimply gives banks an option. They can conduct activities through a \nholding company, or they can conduct their activities through an \naffiliated operating subsidiary.\n  By giving banks this choice, our amendment will lead to better \nservices at lower costs for all sorts of financial services, from \nbanking to brokerage services to insurance.\n  I want to talk about two specific points--two specific and \nsubstantial ways in which our amendment improves on the pending bill.\n  On the issue of safety and soundness, our proposal is actually \nstronger than the bill offered by the chairman. That is not my \nassertion. The current Chairman of the FDIC and his four predecessors--\nthree Republicans and two Democrats--all agree. They say that banks \nface greater risks if forced to use the holding company structure.\n  I think everybody ought to know here that we are talking about an \nentirely new system. We are talking about moving into uncharted waters. \nWe are talking about making sure that each financial institution has \nthe best option available to it to make the best choice. What we are \nsaying is that as a financial institution makes the choice as it goes \ninto all these uncharted waters, the most important thing we can do is \nguarantee its safety and soundness.\n  What are we getting? We are getting a virtually unanimous report from \nthe FDIC Chairmen--the current one and four predecessors--that we are \nusing an option here advocating a position that creates more safety and \nsoundness than we have in this bill.\n  So if you want safety and soundness, vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the chairman's bill exposes banks. And I have to say \nbecause it exposes banks, it exposes taxpayers to greater risks than \nour alternative.\n  There are two reasons for that. First, subsidiaries are assets of the \nbank. They can be sold to satisfy creditors. Affiliates are not \nconsidered bank assets.\n  The second reason subsidiaries are safer is because profits from a \nsuccessful bank subsidiary accrue to that bank. But the profits from a \ncompany that is part of a holding company do not directly benefit the \nbank.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that of all the issues pending before \nus, one of those issues into which our Treasury Secretary has put the \ngreatest amount of time and the greatest amount of effort, because he \nis so concerned about safety and soundness, is this. He wants a tough \nbill when it comes to safety and soundness. He agrees with the FDIC \nChairman and her predecessors, that if we are going to have strong \nsafety and soundness, it is absolutely critical that we ensure we have \nthe structure available to make it happen.\n  Even Fed Chairman Greenspan, who the chairman likes to cite in \nconnection with this bill, agrees that safety and soundness is not the \nissue here.\n  In his exact words, ``My concerns are not about safety and soundness. \n. . . It is not a safety and soundness issue.''\n  Our proposal corrects a second serious flaw in the underlying bill as \nwell. It does so by giving American banks the same freedom as foreign \nbanks to choose their operating structure.\n  It is absolutely astounding to me that the chairman, who talks so \npassionately about free markets, actually\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\ndictates in his bill how financial services companies must organize \ntheir activities. He gives them one--and only one--choice, which means \nhe gives them no choice at all.\n  Forcing activities into affiliates would place American banks at a \ncompetitive disadvantage not only in the international markets; it \nwould actually place American banks at a disadvantage in America.\n  We already give foreign banks the freedom to choose the structure \nthat best serves the business plan. Since 1990, the Federal Reserve has \nissued approvals for 18 foreign banks to own subsidiaries that engage \nin securities underwriting activities in the United States. All told, I \nam told these foreign-owned subsidiaries exceed $450 billion in assets.\n  In a 1992 joint report on foreign bank operations, the Federal \nReserve Board and the Treasury Department agreed that ``subject to \nprudential considerations, the guiding policy for foreign bank \noperations should be the principle of investor choice.''\n  The bottom line, therefore, Mr. President, is this: The chairman's \nbill discriminates against American banks in favor of foreign banks. We \nsay that is wrong. Our amendment levels the playing field. Safety and \nsoundness, basic fairness, these are the important issues that are \nunderlying this amendment that we will be voting on in just a couple of \nminutes.\n  There is one other important point we need to consider. The President \nmade it absolutely clear that he will veto the financial services \nmodernization bill unless we fix the problem with operating \nsubsidiaries. So the choice is ours--or perhaps I should say it is the \nchairman's choice.\n\n  Does he really want a bill badly enough to negotiate and find some \nsolution? Does he want a bill badly enough to give up some potential \nleverage he might get in conference to deal with this legislation in a \nway that allows us to focus on the real problems?\n  I hope he will reconsider what threats he has made to pull this bill \nif his position does not prevail on this amendment.\n  Let's recognize for the good of our country, for the good of our \nfinancial institutions, for the good of choice, for the good of safety \nand soundness, for moving this bill along, that we only have one \nchoice. It is to pass this amendment, and I hope we will do it tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to table the Shelby amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Texas to table the amendment of the Senator from \nAlabama.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to.\n  Mr. MACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, while there are so many Members on the \nfloor, I want to engage the chairman of the committee in a discussion \nand maybe we can let Members know where we are going.\n  This was the last of the very large--I do not want to suggest that \nany amendment any Member has to offer is not a large amendment; I \nrecognize that, but this was the last of a series of large amendments \nthat we had lined up. I know the chairman and leader's intention is to \ntry to finish this evening. As I understand it, there are some \namendments around. I guess we will find out very shortly. Maybe we can \ndispose of them or deal with them in a fairly reasonable way in a short \nperiod of time and then go to the final vote on this bill.\n  As I understand it, the leader said that if we voted final passage \ntonight, there would be no votes tomorrow. Members, I think, would have \nto figure whether it is worth investing a little more time this evening \nin order to finish up. That is how I see the lay of the land. I just \nask the chairman to comment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We have a cleanup amendment. I think it is ready. We can \ndo it. I hope there are no other amendments, and I am ready to vote. I \nyield to Senator Bryan.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I may engage the floor manager and the distinguished \nchairman, I have an amendment, and I would like about 10 to 15 minutes. \nI do not intend to ask for a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Can the Senator let us move ahead for the convenience of \neverybody who have flights and have you do that after the vote? If the \nSenator can do that, it would be very much appreciated.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I want to accommodate the Senator in any way I can. I want \nto make sure what I am agreeing to. There are several other Senators \nwho may have amendments. I do not want to be at the end. I am simply \nwilling to yield for the purpose of the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If there is no other amendment, if the Senator can do \nthat, I am sure Members will accommodate and I will stay and listen to \nit if he would like me to.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am not sure I understand. I want to offer the amendment \nbefore we have a final rollcall vote itself.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Can the Senator offer it and, if he is going to withdraw \nit, withdraw it and then speak after the vote? Can that be done? If \nnot, let's go ahead and start.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am willing to enter into an agreement of 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. All right. Whatever works, I am willing to do.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Before my colleague starts, I do have an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). There is a pending amendment, the \nDorgan amendment No. 313.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have two amendments at the desk that I believe will be \naccepted by both sides after modification. I would like the opportunity \nto call those up before the final vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will let us just work on them and put them \nin the managers' package and we will do them all at once, if he can get \nthose to us.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed Chair.\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I am likely to \noffer, but I need to engage in some floor discussion with the managers \nprior to making that decision. I think it may take about a half an hour \nto an hour to go through a discussion with the managers on this \nsubject.\n  It is a very important subject. It has to do with whether or not the \nSEC is going to be able to regulate the purchase and sale of stock when \nthey are done by banks. The SEC sent me a letter yesterday strongly \nobjecting to language in this bill, and what they are pointing out is \nthat the language in the committee report is different from the \nlanguage in the bill.\n  I want to talk to the managers about an amendment which would \nincorporate in the bill what the committee report says is the intent of \nthe bill. It is possible that this will be accepted because this is \ncommittee report language which I am trying to get into the bill, but I \ndo not know until after we go through the discussion process on the \nfloor. I just want to alert colleagues that could take perhaps a half \nan hour to an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just on the order of business, I have \nan amendment I was going to offer with Senator Harkin. I know \ncolleagues want to leave. I need to talk with Senator Harkin and make a \ndecision as to what we want to do here, if the manager can give us a \ncouple of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to both managers of the bill. \nSenator Dorgan and I have an amendment. It is simple in nature. I think \nit is something that should be accepted. It is something that could be \nreviewed in conference. It would require an independent audit of the \nFederal Reserve Board. Otherwise, we will offer that amendment. It will \nnot take long.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will give us that amendment and let us look \nat it, we might be able to include it in the managers' package.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I suggest to the chairman, maybe if we take about 5 or \n10 minutes to engage in a discussion with the people who have these \namendments, we can find a way to perhaps accept some of them and go to \nconference with them at least and deal with the others, and then we can \nstill move to final passage this evening and complete this legislation, \nwhich I think is highly desirable.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I agree with that. The thing to do is to plow ahead. Is \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada going to withdraw the amendment?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Can I suggest, again, the Senator offer the amendment and \nspeak for a couple of minutes and withdraw it, and then after the vote, \nif he wants to speak longer on it, he can. Will that work? If not, go \nahead and speak.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I will be willing to do that. Can I have a \nlittle flexibility, if you are still trying to work things out. I am \nnot trying to delay this.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let's just start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 316\n\n(Purpose: To give customers notice and choice about how their financial \n  institutions share or sell their personally identifiable sensitive \n             financial information, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Procedurally, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment, and I ask that an amendment dealing with personal \nprivacy be sent to the desk for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 316.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 150, after line 21, add the following:\n\n                TITLE VII--FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY\n\n     SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Financial Information \n     Privacy Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 702.

I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\n  Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate adopted an amendment offered \nby the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee dealing with the \nfraudulent procurement of personal information by information brokers. \nLast Congress, Senator D'Amato and I offered an identical provision, \nand we were successful in incorporating that in last year's financial \nmodernization bill, H.R. 10.\n  Unfortunately, that measure died along with H.R. 10 which was \nfilibustered at the end of the last session. I commend the Senator from \nTexas. The antifraud provision is a good first step, but as Senator \nSarbanes articulated earlier today, it is in no way a substitute for \nmeaningful privacy protections.\n  The Gramm amendment deals with a small, but pernicious, group of \ninformation brokers that obtain personal information under false \npretenses. This practice should be shut down. In fact, the Federal \nTrade Commission recently brought action against such practices.\n  While thousands of Americans are harmed by fraudulent information \nbrokers, each and every American who has a bank account, stock \nportfolio or an insurance policy is subject to a massive invasion of \nhis or her personal privacy that cries out for legislative remedy.\n  I applaud the fact that the chairman has indicated we are going to \nhold a series of hearings.\n  I applaud the chairman's promise to hold a series of hearings on the \nfinancial privacy issue. Many of us who worked on the Community \nReinvestment Act would have hoped we might have had similar \nopportunities before moving forward with the CRA changes in this bill.\n  While the chairman's amendment and his hearings are good first steps, \nI encourage us to take one more step that Senator Sarbanes and Senator \nDodd and I have been urging for some time.\n  My amendment is quite simple. What we are talking about is financial \nprivacy. I want to make it very clear that I am a strong supporter of \nthe restructuring bill that is before us, the financial modernization. \nI freely acknowledge and recognize that we need a regulatory framework \nwhich comports with the realities of the marketplace today.\n  So my purpose in offering this amendment is in no way to denigrate \nthe need to make the kind of changes which essentially are outlined in \nS. 900, or a part of H.R. 10 in the previous session. But I think my \ncolleagues and the American people would be absolutely shocked if they \nknew how little privacy they have in their personal financial \ninformation with the very people who are going to be players in this \nfinancial reorganization--banks, security brokerages, and insurance.\n  Here is what the American people have to say on the issue of privacy. \nWhen asked recently: ``Would you mind if a company you did business \nwith sold information about you to another company?'' Ninety-two \npercent said yes, they would object to it. The source of that \ninformation is the AARP.\n\n  Let me cite an illustration of precisely what does occur and will \ncontinue to occur. This is a financial transaction, I say to my \ncolleagues, that occurred at a bank. A lady came in and deposited \n$109,451.59. At this bank, teller No. 12 made the following notation: \n``She came in today,'' referring to the depositor, ``and wasn't sure \nwhat she would do with her money.'' That is the bank teller.\n  This bank has a relationship with a brokerage house. Here is what the \nteller then did. The teller then contacts ``David''--David is the \nindividual with the brokerage house--and says, ``See what you can do! \nThank you.''\n  So in effect the privacy of this individual's personal bank account \nis compromised, as the bank teller then notifies the brokerage house: \n``You'd better get ahold of this lady. She has $109,000. She doesn't \nknow what she wants to do with it. You contact her.''\n  This is a real-life situation. Under the current law--under the \ncurrent law--your information with respect to your insurance accounts \nmay be freely sold to a third party, or maybe transferred to an \naffiliate under the proposed arrangements that are contemplated in this \nbill. Your bank account information can be sold to a third party--a \ntotal stranger to you and to your financial transaction.\n  So you have a situation in which all of a sudden you have a \ncertificate of deposit that is coming due next month, and you start to \nget a stream of information from vendors who are marketing financial \nservices and saying, ``Mrs. Smith,'' ``Mr. Jones, I know your \ncertificate of deposit is due next month. Let me show you what our \nfinancial package can provide for you.'' And you are saying, ``How does \nthis outfit know that I've got a certificate of deposit that is \nmaturing next month?'' And the answer is, that information can be sold \nto a third party, and that information is valuable to a particular \nvendor of services.\n  So the amendment that we propose does two things: No. 1--and I do not \nsee how you can argue against this proposition--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. If conversations \ndo not relate to the bill at hand, would you please take them into the \nother room. The Senator deserves consideration. Would conversations \nnear the Senator please cease.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The point that I was making is that your financial information with \nrespect to insurance brokerage accounts and bank accounts is not \nprotected under the present law. That information can be sold or \nmarketed to a total stranger. An outfit, for example, that may be \nselling penny stocks all of a sudden contacts you and says, ``Look, I \nknow you've got a certificate of deposit or bank account with a \nsufficient balance involved.''\n  So what we are proposing in this amendment is something very hard to \nargue against. We are saying that with respect to these financial \norganizations--banking, insurance and brokerage--that they cannot sell \nto a total stranger, a third party, without your consent. What is wrong \nwith that?\n  So rather than being able to sell to any vendor your very personal \nand private information--your insurance coverages, whatever information \nmight be available about any medical condition that you might have, \nyour brokerage account, your bank account--cannot be sold to a third \nparty without your prior consent. I suspect if you ask the American \npeople--Democrat, Republican, independent, whether they are to the \nright of center or to the left of center or in between--you would get \nalmost a unanimous vote that would say, ``That is what I want as a \nprotection for my privacy.''\n\n  I understand that in this modern consolidation of financial services \nthe thrust of this bill is going to permit banks and insurance and \nbrokerage to be involved in affiliated relationships. I understand \nthat. So we are told, ``Do not, Senator, do anything that would impair \nor compromise the synergy of the marketplace. Don't do that.''\n  Well, this is what we propose with respect to those affiliate \narrangements. This would not be a total stranger or a third party. If \nthey are going to transfer and make available that information, they \nneed to notify you and give you the opportunity to opt out. They do not \nhave to get your prior consent, but they have to give you the right to \nopt out.\n  That concept is recognized in the law. Many of you will recall that I \ntook the lead some years back in securing amendments to the Fair Credit \nReporting Act. And we said there, with respect to information that is \ncollected, with respect to your credit history, that before that \ninformation can be made available for marketers and others, they need \nto notify you where that information came from and that you had the \nright, after receiving a solicitation, to say, ``Look, no more. Take me \noff the list'' in effect the right to opt out.\n  So that is what we are proposing in this amendment--An absolute \nrequirement that if the information is made available to a total \nstranger, a third party, that has no affiliate relationship, a vendor \nof any number of financial services, they must obtain your prior \nconsent; that if the information, the financial information, is to be \ntransferred from one of their affiliates, they need to give you the \nopportunity to opt out if you choose to avail yourself of that \noption. Now, I am hard pressed to understand why anybody would object \nto that. I think any one of us would be somewhat surprised to know that \nour bank accounts, our insurance, and our brokerage accounts\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\ncan be made available to anyone under the existing law. If we are going \nto provide these new financial services, which I believe we ought to \nprovide to recognize the change in the marketplace, that does not \nstrike me as being an unreasonable proposition to advocate.\n\n  So this is a provision that I think needs attention. I must say that \nthe ranking member has taken a lead on this. He has been a strong \nadvocate, as has the senior Senator from Connecticut. I know he had a \nquestion or two to which I would be happy to respond.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, I commend the Senator for \nhis very strong statement. This is an extremely important issue. I \nappreciate the Senator speaking out on it. We have joined together, \nactually, in introducing legislation on this privacy question, along \nwith Senators Leahy and Dodd and Hollings. Earlier today we raised the \nissue with the chairman.\n  I think it would probably be helpful if the chairman could provide--\nthe Senator may want to question him himself--the similar assurances he \ngave earlier about the committee committing itself to examining this \nissue in a comprehensive way, with hearings and with the idea in mind, \nof course, to try to bring forth legislation that will address what the \nchairman himself has conceded is an important issue that needs to be \naddressed.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is pleased to yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator was not on the floor today when I offered the \namendment which adopted the provisions that were in the Sarbanes \nsubstitute. I said at the time that I did not believe it solved the \nproblem. I committed to hold extensive hearings. I committed to allow \nanyone who had any kind of substantive opinion to express it, and I \ncommitted that we would take a hard look at it.\n  This whole issue is a very serious issue, and it is one we have to \nlearn to live with. It is one about which I share a great deal of \nconcern with others.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's commitment. If I \nmight engage the distinguished chairman in a follow-up inquiry--I know \nthe Senator is trying to process this bill. As Henry VIII said to his \nthird wife, I shall not keep you long--the question I have of the able \nchairman is, Would the Senator not agree that before a financial \nservices institution sells personal information about your bank \naccounts, your insurance policies, about your brokerage accounts, it is \nnot unreasonable that they get your consent before doing so?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, if the Senator will yield, first of all, we adopted \nsome provisions today from the Sarbanes substitute that were a first \nstep.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. But I made it clear they were only a first step. I believe \nas a matter of principle they should. If the Senator will take yes for \nan answer, I will say yes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is delighted to take yes for an answer. I am \nmost appreciative of the response.\n  If the able chairman is saying that perhaps my time has expired, I \nwill be happy to yield the floor in just a moment. I inquire whether or \nnot the ranking member has further colloquy he wishes to engage me in.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I simply want to underscore, the importance of this \nissue and the contribution which the very able Senator has made to it. \nIsn't it correct, most people don't realize these things can happen?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I say to the senior Senator from Maryland, not only do \nthey not realize it, they are absolutely dumbfounded and amazed. Most \npeople believe that in the world of high finance, brokerage accounts, \ninsurance and banks, there is a system of Federal law that protects \ntheir privacy. I say to the Senator from Maryland, we all recognize \nthat we are entering a new era of financial transactions, the Internet; \ncomputers have transformed the way in which we transact our business; \nthe old green eyeshade guys are gone.\n  Today the right of privacy as we know it in America is threatened, I \nsay to my friend from Maryland. More than a century ago the able, later \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court advocated, in a Harvard Law Review \narticle, a right of privacy. That right was later enshrined in \nsubsequent opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I think the very essence of a right of privacy ought to be your \npersonal financial information--how much money you have in your bank \naccount; to whom you choose to make payments; your insurance coverages; \nany medical conditions that might be a part of that insurance record; \nwhat stocks and bonds and securities you hold; when those certificates \nof deposit might mature. To say that all of that can be sold, \ntransferred without your knowledge, without your consent, to some total \nstranger who may not, I say to my friend from Maryland, be a legitimate \nvendor--we don't know who these guys might be. All of a sudden you get \na ton of mail coming in and saying: Mrs. Smith, I know your husband \njust died last year, and I know you have some certificates of deposit. \nThey are getting a 5-percent return. As a widow, you need to know, if \nyou invest with us, we can quadruple that rate of return.\n  That is what is happening, I say to my friend from Maryland. That is \nsomething that I think is appropriate for the Congress and the Federal \nGovernment to say, that is wrong.\n  I appreciate the leadership of the ranking member on this. This is \nsomething that ought not to divide us, Democrat or Republican, liberal \nor conservative.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. I want to make it very \nclear, the provision that was adopted earlier today was an antifraud \nprovision. It was designed to get at people who get this information by \nfraud. The fact of the matter is, under the current arrangements there \nis no restriction that precludes a financial institution from providing \nthis information or selling this information to others.\n  I think you are absolutely right; people would be dumbfounded to know \nthat this information they are giving to their financial institution \nhas no privacy protections around it. I think it is extremely \nimportant, as the Senator has emphasized, to establish such \nprotections.\n  It has an issue of some complexity to it. We need to work through it. \nI think the hearings that have now been committed to will give us the \nopportunity to do it. There are many members on the committee on both \nsides of the aisle who are interested in this issue. I hope we can move \nforward and bring a significant piece of legislation to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I look forward to working with the senior Senator from \nMaryland on this.\n\n  Let me say, I am going to withdraw this amendment, because of the \nlateness of the hour and because we want to move forward to process \nthis.\n  I say to my friend from Maryland--I know he feels this very \nstrongly--the word should go out tonight from this Chamber to the \nindustry groups that believe this is an issue that is going to go away. \nIt is not going to go away. What we are talking about is the essence of \nreasonableness and fairness. If you are talking about selling some \ninformation or making it available to a total stranger, you as an \nindividual ought to have the right to make that decision. That is \nsomething that is fundamental and basic. As an accommodation to these \nnew affiliate arrangements that can be entered into under this new \nlegislation, we say, with respect to any transfers between the \naffiliates, an opt-out provision is a reasonable compromise.\n  I encourage our friends from the industry to work with us on this. I \nsay to the Senator from Maryland, because this is not going to go away, \nwe are going to address this issue, and the American people are going \nto be thoroughly outraged when they become aware that these new \narrangements permit this continuation of an invasion of their privacy \nin the most personal way possible.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, I echo his observation that \nthis is not an issue that is going to go away. Those who are involved \nneed to take a constructive attitude in arriving at effective ways to \nprotect the privacy of the American people. There is no doubt about it.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I am prepared to yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, from a procedural point of view, I would like to \nwithdraw\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\nthe amendment. May I do so, or do I need unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was going to introduce an amendment \ntonight with respect to low-cost lifeline bank accounts with Senator \nHarkin from Iowa and my colleague, Senator Schumer from New York. This \namendment would require banks that establish a bank holding company \nunder the S. 900 guidelines to offer low-cost banking services to their \ncustomers.\n  I am not going to talk about this amendment at all tonight, except to \nsay I think this is a most important consumer amendment; it is very \nimportant to senior citizens and very important to low- and moderate-\nincome citizens.\n  My understanding, with my colleague from Texas, the chairman, is that \nwe will have an opportunity to bring this amendment up when another \nbanking-related bill comes to the floor, and we will be able to debate \nthis and have an up-or-down vote; am I correct, I ask my colleague from \nTexas?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I told both of my colleagues that because \nin the past when they and others had sought to offer an amendment \nparliamentary maneuvers had been made to prevent that, on a future \nbanking bill--and as Senator Sarbanes noted, we already have reported \nthree banking bills out of the committee. So we will have banking \nbills--I will guarantee them an opportunity to offer the amendment and \nto have an up-or-down vote on it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the chairman. I yield to my colleague from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Texas for the assurance that we \ncan offer this amendment later on. Again, this is an important \namendment and we can't let it go too much longer. So I hope we will \nhave some kind of banking bill this year. I hope it doesn't go into \nnext year, because consumers are getting gouged. Most people don't \ncarry more than $1,000 in their checking accounts and they are the ones \nwho have to pay the fees. In all my life until just recently, checking \naccounts used to be free. Now if you have less than $1,000, you pay \nfees. Who has less than $1,000? It is the elderly, the low-income \npeople; they have to pay the fees to keep the checking accounts. It is \nnot fair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, the committee has brought \nout--in fact, it is on the calendar--a regulatory relief bill to lessen \nthe regulatory burdens on the financial institutions, and it seems to \nme in that spirit of lessening burdens, this basic banking amendment \nwould certainly be an opportune amendment to offer to that bill when it \nis before the Senate. I am pleased that the chairman has committed to \nhaving an up-or-down vote.\n  I think the Senators are onto a very important issue, and it really \nis just a basic issue of equity and fairness for small people. I very \nmuch appreciate not only their raising it, but insisting that at some \nreasonable point we be given an opportunity to vote up or down on this \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also thank the Senator from Texas and \nthe Senator from Maryland. We will certainly bring this amendment to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, last night the Senate approved a motion to \ntable the Bryan CRA amendment by a vote of 52-45. I voted in favor of \nthe tabling motion, and would like to take a moment to outline my \nposition on this matter.\n  What did Senator Bryan propose in his amendment? The Bryan amendment \nwould have stricken two provisions in the underlying bill related to \nthe Community Reinvestment Act, as follows: (1) the so-called CRA \nintegrity provision and (2) the exemption for small, rural banks. In \naddition, the Bryan amendment would have conditioned approval of a \nbank's affiliation with a securities firm or insurance company on CRA \ncompliance.\n  On this last point, linking approval of new financial activities to \nCRA compliance, I want to acknowledge Senator Bryan's efforts to \ndevelop a pragmatic approach to this issue. Unlike some of the more \nfar-reaching proposals that have been put forward, this provision would \nnot have expanded CRA to apply to nonbank institutions, nor would it \nhave required holding companies to divest themselves of a bank that \nfalls out of compliance. Despite the relative appeal of this portion of \nthe Bryan amendment, however, I found myself unable to support the \noverall package.\n  With regard to the integrity provision, I have long thought that \nbanks that do a good job under CRA should get some credit for it. Under \ncurrent law, however, a bank with an outstanding CRA rating that seeks \nto merge or expand potentially is subject to the same challenges from \ncommunity groups as a bank with a rating of substantial noncompliance. \nThis situation simply is not fair, in my judgment.\n  Now, the opponents of this provision point out that 97 percent of the \nbanks receive a satisfactory CRA rating, and thus the bill offers the \nprotection of the ``substantial, verifiable information'' standard to \nnearly every institution in the country. Admittedly, I would prefer to \nsee the integrity provision deal only with ``outstanding'' banks. \nUnfortunately, the procedural situation did not permit an opportunity \nto make such a change.\n  Turning to the small bank exemption, only one financial institution \nin my state fits the bill's description of a small, rural bank. \nNevertheless, I'm sympathetic to the hundreds of tiny banks across the \ncountry--institutions with only a handful of employees--that face a \ndaunting, expensive regulatory burden in terms of CRA recordkeeping. In \naddition, I found particularly persuasive Senator Gramm's observation \nthat of the 16,380 audits of these small, rural banks in the past nine \nyears, only three have been found to be substantially out of \ncompliance.\n  I fully recognize the important role CRA has played in expanding the \navailability of credit in Rhode Island and across the nation. Small \nbusiness owners, homebuyers, and renters alike have benefitted from the \npressure CRA exerts on banks to make loans in neighborhoods they might \notherwise overlook. At the end of the day, however, I determined that \nSenator Gramm's proposed CRA reforms had some merit to them. For these \nreasons, I voted against the Bryan amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we have been debating the subject of \nbanking in the Senate since the 18th century. We began to ask ourselves \na question, could we have a national bank, which Mr. Hamilton, of New \nYork, thought we could do and should do. We created one. It had a very \nbrief tenure. It went out of existence just in time that the Federal \nGovernment had no financial resources for the War of 1812. So it was \nreinstituted, as I recall, in 1816 for 20 years, and went out of \nexistence just in time for the panic of 1837. We went through \ngreenbacks. There must have been a wampum period. We went to gold \ncoinage. Then a free coinage of silver dominated our politics for \nalmost two decades, as farmers sought liquidity and availability of \ncredit. Finally, at the end of the century of exhaustive debate, we \nmore or less gave up and adopted what we now call the Federal Reserve \nSystem.\n  To say we debated this matter for a century is certainly true. In the \npast few years, we have turned our focus to the nonbank bank. You are \nreally reaching for obscurity when you define an issue as we have done, \nand yet that seems to be the term with which we have to deal.\n  The issue of the nonbank banks, also referred to as financial \nmodernization, is facing the Senate today. As we consider Chairman Phil \nGramm's (R-TX) bill I would like to make two points. The first being \nthat we need financial modernization, that depression era banking laws \nneed to be amended. We all agree on that. The second point that I would \nlike to make is that we must do this in a prudent manner--preserve the \nthings which need to be preserved, and remedy the things which need to \nbe remedied.\n  It strikes me as odd that most corporations are free to engage in any \nlawful business. Banks, by contrast, are limited to the business of \nbanking. It is generally agreed that the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and \nthe Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 need to be\n\n[[Page S4869]]\n\namended. Banks, security firms, and insurance companies should be \nallowed to offer each other's services. They already do by finding \nloopholes in the law. Congress must catch up, and pass a law that \ncondones this activity. London does it. Tokyo too. Why not New York, \nwhich, if I may say, is one of the world's banking capitals?\n  This is a real problem for the existing banks which find themselves \nunder serious constraints they have lived with under depression-era \nbanking laws. Suddenly, they find that their activities are encroached \nupon and they are not able to do things that they ought to do, that \nthey are going to need to do, if they are going to survive in a \ncompetitive world economy.\n  Now is the time to modernize our financial institutions. But the bill \nbefore us has certain problems. The most serious of which is that it \nweakens the Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA, enacted in 1977, has \nplayed a critical role in revitalizing low and moderate income \ncommunities. New York has benefited from this. A Times editorial states \nthat ``in New York City's South Bronx neighborhood, the money has \nturned burned-out areas into havens for affordable homes and a new \nmiddle class. The banks earn less on community-based loans than on \ncorporate business. But the most civic-minded banks have accepted this \nreduced revenue as a cost of doing business--and as a reasonable \nsacrifice for keeping the surrounding communities strong.''\n  It is for this reason that I cannot support Chairman Gramm's bill. I \nvoted for the Democratic substitute which was offered by Senator \nSarbanes. This bill too amends Glass-Steagall and the Bank Holding \nCompany Act. But it preserves the CRA. I want financial modernization \nas much as the next person. But we cannot do it at the detriment of the \nCRA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial from March \n17, 1999 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [The New York Times, Wednesday, March 17, 1999]\n\n                        Mischief From Mr. Gramm\n\n       Cities that were in drastic decline 20 years ago are \n     experiencing rebirth, thanks to new homeowners who are \n     transforming neighborhoods of transients into places where \n     families have a stake in what happens. The renaissance is due \n     in part to the Federal Community Reinvestment Act, which \n     requires banks to reinvest actively in depressed and minority \n     areas that were historically written off. Senator Phil Gramm \n     of Texas now wants to weaken the Reinvestment Act, \n     encouraging a return to the bad old days, when banks took \n     everyone's deposits but lent them only to the affluent. \n     Sensible members of Congress need to keep the measure intact.\n       The act was passed in 1977. Until then, prospective home or \n     business owners in many communities had little chance of \n     landing loans even from banks where they kept money on \n     deposit. But according to the National Community Reinvestment \n     Coalition, banks have committed more than $1 trillion to \n     once-neglected neighborhoods since the act was passed, the \n     vast majority of it in the last six years.\n       In New York City's South Bronx neighborhood, the money has \n     turned burned-out areas into havens for affordable homes and \n     a new middle class. The banks earn less on community-based \n     loans than on corporate business. But the most civic-minded \n     banks have accepted this reduced revenue as a cost of doing \n     business--and as a reasonable sacrifice for keeping the \n     surrounding communities strong.\n       Federal bank examiners can block mergers or expansions for \n     banks that fail to achieve a satisfactory Community \n     Reinvestment Act rating. The Senate proposal that Mr. Gramm \n     supports would exempt banks with assets of less than $100 \n     million from their obligations under the act. That would \n     include 65 percent of all banks. The Senate bill would also \n     dramatically curtail the community's right to expose what it \n     considers unfair practices. Without Federal pressure, \n     however, the amount of money flowing to poorer neighborhoods \n     would drop substantially, undermining the urban recovery.\n       Mr. Gramm argues that community groups are ``extorting'' \n     money from banks in return for approval, and describes the \n     required paperwork as odious. But community organizations \n     that build affordable housing in Mr. Gramm's home state \n     heartily disagree. Mayor Ron Kirk of Dallas disagrees as \n     well, and told The Dallas Morning News that he welcomed the \n     opportunity to explain to Mr. Gramm that ``there is no \n     downside to investing in all parts of our community.''\n       In a perfect world, lending practices would be fair and the \n     Reinvestment Act would be unnecessary. But without Federal \n     pressure the country would return to the era of redlining, \n     when communities cut off from capital withered and died.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Senate \nBanking Committee's bill, the Financial Services Modernization Act of \n1999, S. 900.\n  As a new member to Banking Committee, I am pleased to be part of the \nCommittee's effort to bring this bill to the floor. First, let me \ncommend the Chairman for his hard work and heavy-lifting in crafting a \nbill that will frame the way financial activities are conducted as we \nmove into the next century. The Chairman began this effort during a \nvery busy and trying time for this body at the beginning of the 106th \nCongress, and I appreciate his leadership in keeping the Committee \nfocused on our priorities and the work at hand.\n  Considering the scope of activities covered by a financial services \nmodernization bill, crafting a piece of legislation to update 60 year \nold laws while allowing flexibility for forward-thinking products is a \nHerculean task. At the heart of the bill is the matter of addressing \nstructure and regulation of financial services firms. Even a casual \nobserver has taken notice of the changing face of our domestic \nfinancial sector over the past several months. While merger-mania has \ndominated the news, other forces such as changing regulation, court \ndecisions, and market innovation have outpaced current law. And \nalthough S. 900 is a work in progress, with accommodations to be made \nby all interested parties, I believe the time is ripe to pass \nlegislation that allows for the affiliation among the various sectors \nof the financial services industry. This legislation provides a \nconstructive framework to tackle the issue of financial services \nmodernization while also including appropriate safeguards.\n  As with most major legislative initiatives, this bill has not been \nwithout controversy. Specifically, there has been an ongoing debate \nabout provisions in the bill pertaining to the Community Reinvestment \nAct (CRA). As many know, the Community Reinvestment Act was enacted by \nCongress in 1977 and required federally-insured banks and thrifts to \nmake loans in their service areas, including low- and moderate- income \ncommunities, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. \nCompliance with CRA requirements can encompass loans made for the \npurposes of mortgage lending; business lending; consumer credit; and \ncommunity investments. The benefit of capital investment and financing \nin such communities has strengthened parts of our nation that may not \nhave otherwise known their current prosperity. To date, CRA lending has \nsurpassed the $1 trillion mark for investment in low- and moderate-\nincome communities while private sector lending has increased 45% from \n1993 to 1997. As I have heard from many community reinvestment groups \nlocated throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, there has been one \nvery positive additional benefit that numbers can't quantify: the \nrelationships formed between members of the banking community and those \nadvocating on behalf of their neighborhoods and communities. These \nworking relationships now aim to meet the mutual goal of jumpstarting \nthe economic viability of urban and rural regions across the United \nStates.\n  For those very reasons, I chose not to support the amendment offered \nduring mark-up of S. 900 that would have exempted small, rural banks \nwith less than $100 million in assets from CRA requirements. I \ncertainly appreciate the very real concern of added regulatory and \npaperwork burdens that banks assume to comply with this law. In fact, \nreforms made in 1997 to the CRA recognized this very problem and \nstreamlined the examination process for small banks with less than $250 \nmillion in assets. However, I could not support a wholesale exemption \nfrom this Act.\n  As the Chairman outlined from the beginning of the process of \ndeveloping a financial services modernization bill, the role of the CRA \nwill be further examined by the Committee in a separate forum. I \nsuspect that a thorough evaluation of CRA successes and shortcomings \nwill be addressed within the context of oversight hearings, and I look \nforward to participating in that process. While CRA has made \nsignificant contributions to the empowerment of marginalized \ncommunities, I\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\nbelieve we still need to find the right balance to ensure prosperity \nfor low- and moderate- income neighborhoods and the flexibility for \nlenders to meet community needs.\n  Mr. President, while the future of this bill has been linked to the \nresolution of certain issues, like the CRA, I believe the heart of the \ndebate, financial services modernization, is larger than partisanship. \nThe time has come to make commonsense reform of our nation's financial \nstructure a reality in order to remain the strong competitive force in \nworld markets that our country has so capably demonstrated.\n  Mr. REID. I rise before you today, not to complicate an already \ncontroversial bill, but instead to try to accomplish what I have tried \nto do through legislation in past years.\n  This is, to pass legislation requiring an independent audit of the \nFederal Reserve System, as is standard in every other Government entity \nin this country.\n  In fact, back in 1993, Senator Dorgan and I, requested a GAO \ninvestigation of the operations and management of the Federal Reserve \nSystem.\n  We were concerned because no close examination of the Fed's \noperations had ever been conducted.\n  As you may recall Mr. President, we found out quite a bit about the \nFederal Reserve.\n  We found, among other things, that the Fed has a `slush fund', or \nwhat they refer to as a `rainy day fund,' that they have kept there for \nover 80 years.\n  At the time of the GAO investigation, the Fed has squirreled away \n$3.7 Billion in taxpayer money.\n  The last report that I have from January 1998, shows that this fund \nhas reached $5.2 billion.\n  You can bet that figure has gone up since then.\n  The Fed claims that this `slush fund' is needed to cover system \nlosses.\n  Since its creation in 1913, however, the Fed has never operated at a \nloss.\n  The report that Senate Dorgan and I requested in 1993 also found that \nthe Interdistrict Transportation Service had been engaging in \nquestionable business activities.\n  These activities included the awarding of non-competitive contracts \nfor the implementation of Interdistrict Transportation Services, gifts \nof payments for missing backup and grounded aircraft to nonperforming \ncontractors and a pattern of studied indifference by supervisors to \nclear evidence of waste, fraud and abuse within its operations.\n  It was further troubling to find that the activities sanctioned by \nthe Federal Reserve supervisors, was intended to have the practical \neffect of distorting marketplace behavior by competing unfairly against \nprivate sector companies in the air courier business.\n  In what remains as the first and only independent comprehensive \nreview of the Federal Reserve System, the conclusions reached by the \nGAO paints a dreary picture of internal Federal Reserve operations and \nbudgeting procedures.\n  This GAO report that I am referring to, makes a strong case for \nincreased Congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve System \noperations that are unrelated to monetary policy.\n  Furthermore, only 1,600 out of nearly 25,000 Federal Reserve \nemployees deal with monetary policy.\n  I have a Wall Street Journal article and I ask unanimous consent it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 12, 1996]\n\n  Showing Its Age: Fed's Huge Empire, Set Up Years Ago, Is Costly and \n                              Inefficient\n\n\n   it has far too many banks, often in wrong places; losses in check-\n                                clearing\n\n                     ``post office problem'' looms\n\n                           (By John R. Wilke)\n\n       Minneapolis.--Construction cranes rising above the \n     Mississippi River hoist the final stone blocks for the \n     elegant new Federal Reserve Bank headquarters here, the \n     latest monument to the U.S. central bank's immense wealth and \n     power.\n       The $100 million building site on nine acres of prime \n     riverfront, with a 10-story stone clock tower overlooking \n     terraces and gardens. It will offer fortress-like security \n     and robot-attended, automated vaults, plus an indoor pistol \n     range, a fitness center and subsidized dining. The Fed's \n     construction boom also includes the lavish new $168 million \n     Dallas Fed and a planned $178 million Atlanta Fed.\n       Located in a dozen cities--with branches in another 25--the \n     Fed's palatial banks suggest permanence and importance. They \n     operate with great independence far from the Fed's power \n     center in Washington and, with $451 billion of assets, are \n     staggeringly wealthy. Their job is to run the basic plumbing \n     of the nation's economy by monitoring local banks, \n     distributing currency, processing checks and settling \n     interbank payments.\n       But the plumbing at the Fed banks seems to be getting \n     rusty, despite their heavy spending. Rapid changes in \n     technology, consolidation in banking and rising competition \n     in some of their basic services threaten to make Fed banks \n     costly relics. Except for the New York Fed, the system's link \n     to world markets, many Fed functions could be centralized at \n     far less cost and some Fed banks could be closed, federal \n     auditors say.\n       ``It's not about saving nickels and dimes,'' says James \n     Bothwell, a General Accounting Office auditor who recently \n     completed a two-year study of the Fed's books. ``There are \n     serious, long-term questions about their mission and \n     structure.''\n       The Fed's best-known mission--steering U.S. monetary policy \n     and thus charting the course of the economy--isn't at issue. \n     Even its critics hail the Fed's success in holding down \n     inflation.\n       What concerns some in Congress and its GAO watchdog agency \n     is the sprawling Fed empire, which reaches far beyond its \n     marble headquarters in Washington to maintain a presence in \n     most major American cities. The Fed has 25,000 employees, \n     runs its own air force of 47 Learjets and small cargo planes, \n     and has fleets of vehicles, including personal cars for 59 \n     Fed bank managers. It publishes hundreds of reports on itself \n     each year--even Fed comic books on monetary policy for kids. \n     A full-time curator oversees its collection of paintings and \n     sculpture.\n       Yet Fed spending gets little public scrutiny, even as the \n     rest of the federal government struggles to tighten its belt. \n     That's because the Fed funds itself from the interest on its \n     vast trove of government securities acquired in its conduct \n     of monetary policy. Last year, it kept $2 billion of those \n     interest earnings for itself and returned the rest, $20 \n     billion, to the Treasury. Thus, every dollar spent on a new \n     building in Minneapolis--or anything else--is a dollar that \n     could have been used to cut the federal deficit. Unlike every \n     other part of government, the Fed doesn't have to ask \n     Congress for money, and that's the key to its independence \n     from political interference on monetary-policy issues.\n       The Minneapolis Fed would seem a prime candidate for \n     downsizing. Its spending is in striking contrast to the \n     cutbacks and consolidations at many of the commercial banks \n     it serves; only two major banks are left in its six-state \n     district. And its biggest job, processing and clearing checks \n     for local banks, is under increasing pressure from private \n     competitors and new electronic payment technologies.\n       Without check-clearing, the Minneapolis Fed might not need \n     its costly new building and the hundreds of employees who \n     work three shifts shuffling checks. It could eliminate huge \n     overhead costs and focus on distributing U.S. currency and \n     monitoring the local economy.\n       The basic structure of the Federal Reserve System has \n     changed little since it was created in 1913, despite huge \n     shifts in the nation's population and economy. Back then, Fed \n     banks were sited according to the politics of the day and the \n     quaint principle that a commercial banker should be able to \n     reach a Fed branch within one-day train ride, in case he \n     needed cash for unexpected withdrawals.\n       Today, these locations make little sense. Missouri, once an \n     economic and political power because of its riverboat \n     economy, has two Fed banks; booming Florida has none. \n     California and its vast economy have only one Fed bank--which \n     also serves eight other states and covers 20% of the U.S. \n     population. Yet when Fed policy makers meet in Washington, \n     the San Francisco Fed president can vote only one year of \n     three, less often than the presidents from Cleveland or \n     Chicago.\n       ``It reflects the economy and politics of a long time \n     ago,'' says Robert Parry, the San Francisco Fed's president. \n     ``If you were doing it today, you'd do it differently.'' \n     Michael Belongia, a University of Mississippi professor and \n     former Fed economist, says that three Fed banks and 16 \n     branches could be closed and that four other banks could be \n     downsized to branches. He calculates the savings at $500 \n     million a year, even without trimming back the check-clearing \n     businesses.\n       ``The taxpayer pays billions of dollars for this monolithic \n     system that isn't efficient anymore,'' he says.\n       Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan rejects many GAO findings, \n     especially the idea of closing some Fed banks. He says it \n     would take years to recoup the cost of closing one. ``We're \n     strongly committed to ensuring that the Federal Reserve \n     System is managed efficiently and effectively,'' he said in \n     recent congressional testimony. Most important, he defends \n     the Fed banks' independence as crucial to keeping the Fed \n     free of political interference and aware of regional economic \n     conditions.\n       Yet he has expressed some misgivings about Fed spending. \n     With the new Dallas building, for example, he said, ``My \n     first reaction was, `For God's sake, why do you have to build \n     a new building'? Dallas is in a state of commercial real-\n     estate recession. You\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\n     should be able to pick and choose at zero cost. But he added \n     that he was ultimately persuaded that no existing building \n     met the bank's special needs.\n       The Fed banks are even less accountable to Congress than \n     the Fed Board of Governors in Washington, whose seven members \n     are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. \n     The 12 Fed bank presidents, by contrast, are chosen by their \n     private-sector boards, though their annual budgets and \n     building plans are subject to review by the governors in \n     Washington. Congress has no say over who runs the regional \n     banks, despite their important role in running the nation's \n     monetary system.\n       Congress doesn't even set the regional presidents' \n     salaries. The Minneapolis president gets $195,000 a year, and \n     others range as high as $229,000, far exceeding Chairman \n     Greenspan's $133,100.\n       Even so, only 1,600 Fed employees, including a stable of \n     economists and statisticians, work on monetary policy. Most \n     of the rest, and the lion's share of the Fed's $2 billion \n     budget, go to the Fed banks' check-clearing and other \n     services--the jobs under the most pressure from competitors \n     and changes in banking. The Fed banks also process Treasury \n     checks, but a new law mandating electronic distribution will \n     eliminate 400 million Treasury checks annually in three \n     years.\n       As their workload dwindles, Fed banks could be left with \n     what insiders delicately term ``the Post Office problem'': \n     They will be handling checks for mostly small, high-cost \n     customers such as rural banks. Already, less than 25% of Fed \n     customers create 95% of check volume. So, the Fed is \n     vulnerable as major banks begin processing more checks \n     through private clearinghouses or other cheaper alternatives, \n     such as Visa International.\n       At the Minneapolis Fed, check-clearing already resembles \n     the work inside the city's main Post Office nearby. Every \n     day, trucks back up to the Fed's loading dock and drop off \n     pallets of checks. Workers feed them into 25-foot-long \n     automated sorters, and the checks, guided by codes \n     identifying the paying bank, cascade into pouches. Lately, \n     many of the tens of thousands of checks have been small--$2 \n     razor-blade rebates and $4.69 drafts cashed by Huggies diaper \n     customers. Minneapolis handles three million checks a day--a \n     low-margin, labor-intensive business, not unlike delivering \n     the mail.\n       In most countries, private companies or banks handle check-\n     processing, with central banks playing a supervisory role to \n     ensure the payment system is sound. In the U.S., new players \n     ranging from Microsoft Corp. to Merrill Lynch & Co. are \n     racing to offer electronic alternatives to bank-based payment \n     systems, and some bankers fear the Fed's dominance will \n     impede innovation and leave them behind.\n       Lee Hoskins, who once ran the Cleveland Fed and now heads \n     Ohio's Huntington National Bank, says the Fed should get out \n     of check-clearing. ``The central bank no longer has a \n     legitimate role as a provider of payment services,'' he says.\n       Huntington helped start the National Clearinghouse \n     Association, which includes most large U.S. banks and has \n     begun competing head-on with the Fed at lower prices. The Fed \n     is fighting back with a new, lower-priced national check-\n     sorting service and has cut prices in some cities where it is \n     losing market share. As the Fed's volumes have declined, Fed \n     officials concede, its check-clearing failed to cover costs \n     two years ago and fell short again last year. But they say it \n     turned the corner in the first half of 1996.\n       Despite its problems, the Fed is a tough competitor and has \n     continued investing in check-clearing and other services. It \n     changed the formula used to figure whether or not it is \n     making a profit and made unusual transfers, including some \n     $36 million a year from an overfunded pension plan, into the \n     check business, federal auditors say. It also let at least \n     one Fed bank defer the huge cost of a new computer system so \n     the outlay wouldn't be included in profit calculations, \n     effectively understating the cost of clearing checks.\n       The Fed has also squeezed smaller firms that haul bank \n     checks in competition with the Fed's own transport service, \n     which flies pouches of checks overnight from bank to bank. It \n     tried to force an aggressive rival, the U.S. Check unit of \n     AirNet Systems Inc., of Columbus, Ohio, from the Florida \n     market by providing its own contractor with subsidized jet \n     fuel, according to documents and depositions collected by \n     Rep. Henry Gonzalez. The Texas Democrat, a longtime Fed \n     critic, says the Fed also subsidizes its higher costs by \n     putting other cargo, such as its own interoffice mail, on its \n     planes, and charging Fed banks for the service.\n       ``I'm not saying they are competing unfairly, but I'd like \n     to know how they cut prices when they're losing money,'' says \n     Andy Linck, administrator at the National Clearinghouse. \n     Under a 1980 law, the Fed is supposed to price services by \n     commercial standards, but its rivals are reluctant to \n     complain. ``We're forced to compete with our own regulator,'' \n     says an executive of a major Western bank with a big check \n     business. ``They can make life pretty difficult for us if we \n     make trouble.''\n       Fed officials say they play by the rules and use \n     appropriate bookkeeping.\n       ``We're competing fairly--and we're doing it with one arm \n     tied behind our backs,'' says Ted Umhoefer, a check-clearing \n     manager at the  Minneapolis Fed. ``I have to charge the same \n     price to the Citizen's State Bank of Pembina, North \n     Dakota, that I charge to them,'' he says, waving toward a \n     big commercial bank in a nearby skyscraper. ``Yet my \n     counterparts in the private sector can cut volume deals \n     with other big banks, leaving us with all the junk they \n     can't make money on.''\n       In Washington, Fed officials reject the suggestion they \n     should leave check-clearing to private companies. ``That's \n     how the Fed banks make their living,'' says Edward Kelley, \n     the Fed governor who oversees many Fed bank activities and is \n     leading an effort to improve planning and efficiency. ``We'll \n     be in that business until checks disappear or the Congress \n     takes us out of it.'' The Fed grosses nearly $800 million a \n     year from check-clearing and bank services.\n       Until recently, Chairman Greenspan spent almost all his \n     time on monetary policy and rarely focused on Fed operations. \n     But in recent testimony before Congress, he said he is now \n     ``actively reviewing the appropriate infrastructure for \n     providing certain financial services, taking into \n     consideration both cost efficiency and service quality.'' He \n     said that although he believes the Fed should have a \n     continuing role in the payments system to ensure its \n     integrity--particularly the wholesale cash-transfer system \n     known as Fedwire, which handles $1.5 trillion a day--he \n     hinted for the first time that the Fed might privatize or \n     downsize its retail check business.\n       ``It is quite possible, if not likely, that as changes \n     occur in the financial services marketplace . . . our role in \n     providing other services such as check collection may \n     change.'' But he said something will have to be done to \n     ensure that small banks have access to check services \n     ``because I don't think that they believe they're going to be \n     able to pay the prices (they) will be forced to pay by the \n     market.'' He said Congress may be asked to subsidize these \n     small-bank services so that bank customers in small towns \n     don't have to pay higher check fees.\n       Officials say the Fed banks already are taking steps to \n     scale back check-clearing and have cut 600 jobs at various \n     locations. But Fed critics contend that the institution is \n     unlikely to undertake the fundamental reform they say is \n     needed because it could require thousands of layoffs--and the \n     loss of substantial prestige.\n       Prestige seemed important in Minneapolis when Fed officials \n     decided to abandon their grand looking but poorly designed \n     downtown tower. They considered moving to a cheaper, more \n     convenient site by the airport, but that idea was dropped \n     after it raised eyebrows at the Fed in Washington. ``What \n     would we have called it, the Federal Reserve Bank of Eagan, \n     Minnesota?'' one official asks. ``The location is written \n     into the law, and changing it would have required an act of \n     Congress.''\n       Indeed, that may be what the Fed fears most. ``Do we really \n     want to have 435 congressmen tinkering with what is supposed \n     to be an independent institution?'' asks Ernest Patrikis, \n     first vice president of the New York Fed. Arthur Rolnick, \n     research director at the Minneapolis Fed, says Congress \n     ``didn't have economic efficiency in mind when it created the \n     Fed.'' Above all, he says they wanted a decentralized \n     institution, independent of both big banks and politicians.\n       ``I wouldn't be surprised if a hard look at the system \n     shows that some of Fed branches should be closed,'' Mr. \n     Rolnick adds. ``The market has changed, and the technology \n     has changed. . . . [But] do we really want to fool around \n     with the Fed's independence just to save a few hundred \n     million dollars a year?''\n\n  Mr. REID. In this article, it states that the rest of these 25,000 \nemployees deal with the Federal banks' check-clearing and other \nservices.\n  Also cited in this article is another example of extreme waste by the \nFederal Reserve--that is, that the Federal Reserve has a fleet of 47 \nLearjets and small cargo planes.\n  Furthermore, the Fed publishes hundreds of reports on itself each \nyear that includes something that strikes me as an absurd waste of \nfunds--the Fed publishes a comic book for children on monetary policy--\nnow, Mr. President, I know that we have advanced children in this \ncountry, and I'd like to think of my grandchildren as being part of \nthat group, but I don't know many children that have an interest in the \nFederal Reserve's monetary policy, nor do I know any that would \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, in requiring a yearly audit, would \nhelp ensure, to the American taxpayers, and my constituency in Nevada, \nthat the Federal Reserve is run more efficient and responsibly.\n  This amendment intentionally leaves monetary policy to Chairman \nGreenspan and his team.\n  It is my belief that the economy is great and that Chairman Greenspan \nis doing a great job.\n  In fact, many would say that our economy has never been better, which \nbrings to mind the saying ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.''\n  Well, Mr. President, while the economy is not broken, much of the \ninner workings of the Federal Reserve is, and I, along with many \nothers, intend to fix it.\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\n  Again, I want to make it very clear--I do not rise before this body \ntoday to meddle with monetary policy.\n  I am not attempting to interfere with, or impugn, the monetary policy \nof the Fed.\n  I am seeking greater accountability in the operating expenses and \ninternal management of one of our more influential institutions.\n  This amendment simply requires a yearly audit that covers the \noperations of each Federal Reserve bank, the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors, and the Federal Reserve System in the form of a consolidated \naudit.\n  As my good friend and colleague Senator Bennett pointed out to me \nlast night, an audit of each of the 12 regional reserve banks is \nconducted now--however, these audits are not conducted in accordance \nwith generally accepted accounting principles.\n  For the audits that take place now, the accounting information is \ngiven to the auditor by the regional bank staff and the banks basically \nsay, ``accept our figures, that's all you get.''\n  In short, this amendment requires the Fed to use an independent \nauditor and for that auditor to use generally accepted accounting \npractices.\n  This amendment also requires that the report be made available to \nCongress, in particular the Committee on Governmental Affairs in this \nbody and the Committee on Governmental Reform in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I believe that the Federal Reserve could do more to increase its cost \nconsciousness and to operate as efficiently as possible.\n  This amendment will be one step closer to that end.\n  I encourage all Senators to support this amendment and to show our \nbosses, the American taxpayers, that we are looking out for them by \nensuring accountability at the Federal Reserve.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Gramm for the \nfairness in which these proceedings have been held, and my colleague \nfrom Maryland, Senator Sarbanes should also be commended for his \nleadership.\n  We will soon vote on final passage of S. 900, the Financial Services \nModernization Act. I will, unfortunately, be unable to support what I \nbelieve in many ways is a very good product.\n  I am a strong supporter of financial modernization. If the anti-CRA \nprovisions were corrected, I would help to lead the charge in \nsupporting this bill. There are important differences of opinion on \nvarious facets of this legislation. We have had good debates on many of \nthese facets.\n  Although I did not support the amendment offered by Senator Johnson \nto restrict the transferability of unitary thrifts, He should be \ncongratulated for his fine work on the amendment. It is an important \nissue that I am sure that we will revisit in conference.\n  The chairman earlier today staked his support of this bill on the \noutcome of the operating subsidiary amendment which was narrowly \ndefeated. I admire the stand he took and the conviction with which he \nmade his arguments. He should be congratulated for prevailing on his \npoint of view.\n  I would also like commend Chairman Gramm for broaching one of the \nmost critical issues that Americans face as we approach the dawning of \nthe new millennium, and that is the steady erosion of the privacy of \nconsumers' personal, sensitive financial information. Although I \nsupported the chairman's amendment that addresses the subject of \npretext calling, I believe that it simply does not go far enough.\n  Several factors have contributed to the erosion of financial privacy. \nWe must examine each of these factors in order to craft legislation \nthat will protect financial privacy in a meaningful, effective way.\n  Although advances in technology have produced many positive results \nand benefits for our economy over the years, one of the potential \ndrawbacks has been that they have also facilitated the collection and \nretrieval of a vast amount and array of citizens' financial \ninformation. That personal information has become a very valuable \ncommodity and is being sold and traded among businesses all over the \nworld.\n  In addition, the formation of new, diversified business affiliations \nhas allowed companies quick access to personal data on each other's \ncustomers. Financial modernization legislation, if it becomes law, will \nonly make it easier for companies to share their customers' personal \ndata.\n  Much of the data ``mining''--searching, collecting, and sorting--and \nactual use of that personal data is nearly imperceptible to the \nconsumers whose very own information is being conveyed. Companies do \nnot generally tell their customers about the personal data they obtain \nand they sell or rent.\n  Current Federal law permits bank affiliates to share information from \ncredit reports and loan applications as long as the customer gets one \nopportunity to notify the bank not to disclose the information. Most \nconsumers are unaware of this opportunity because the one notice that \nthe company gives them is buried in the fine print in lengthy materials \nmailed to the customer that most never read.\n  An even more critical factor causing the erosion of privacy rights is \nthat no current federal law prevents banks from disclosing \n``transaction and experience data,'' which includes customers account \nbalances, maturity dates of CDs, and loan payment history.\n  This erosion of the privacy of our most personal, sensitive financial \ninformation can and must be stopped. And we must take action to stop \nit.\n  We should have hearings to address these issues so that we may take a \nvery careful look at all of the factors involved, so that we may \naddress them in a careful, thoughtful and meaningful way. I was pleased \nto hear Chairman Gramm this morning commit to holding such hearings in \nthe Senate Banking Committee.\n  I am a coauthor of Senator Sarbanes' Financial Information Privacy \nAct, S. 187, introduced this Congress. This important legislation would \nrequire banks and securities firms to protect the privacy of their \ncustomers' financial records: their bank account balances, transactions \ninvolving their stocks and mutual funds, and payouts on their insurance \npolicies. Customers would be given the important opportunity to prevent \nbanks and securities firms from disclosing or selling this information \nto affiliates. Before banks or securities firms could disclose or sell \nthe information to third parties, they would be required to give notice \nto the customer and obtain the express written permission of the \ncustomer before making any such disclosure.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Gramm and Senator Sarbanes on \nthis important issue.\n  But like my good friend from Texas did for me earlier today, I would \nlike to make something very clear to him--I will not support any bill \nthat weakens the Community Reinvestment Act. Also, I will promise him \nthat no bill that weakens CRA will become law. If we do pass this bill \nout of this body, let me assure you that as hard as I will fight for \nfinancial services modernization, I will fight even harder for \npreserving CRA.\n  I know how strongly the chairman feels against the CRA. Let me tell \nhim, that if it is possible, I feel even stronger about preserving the \nCRA.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject any and all legislation that fails to \npreserve CRA.\n\n\n                blue cross/blue shield of north carolina\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I have a particular situation in my State \nof North Carolina that I want to make sure is not going to be affected \nby some of the insurance language in this bill.\n  A few years ago, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina was \nconsidering converting from non-profit status to for profit. The North \nCarolina legislature looked into the plan, and decided that if Blue \nCross were to convert to for-profit, it should be required to set up a \ncharitable foundation as part of the process. It did so in order to \nmake sure that funding for medical expenses would be available to many \nNorth Carolinians who had benefited from the services of the non-profit \nBlue Cross. During the Banking Committee's consideration of the bill, I \nwas concerned that the earlier insurance language would have preempted \nthe North Carolina law if a bank wanted to affiliate or purchase Blue \nCross after the conversion.\n  As a result of the Senator's amendment during the committee markup, \nthe insurance language in the bill now is quite different. But I want \nto make sure that my concern about the Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North \nCarolina conversion law is addressed by the new language in S. 900.\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I believe the situation the Senator \ndescribes would fall under Section 104(c)(2) of the bill. That language \nallows states to take action on required applications or other \ndocuments concerning proposed changes in or control of a company that \nsells insurance, unless the action has the practical effect of \ndiscriminating against an insured depository institution.\n  The concern the Senator voiced is one of the situations we envisioned \nwhen we made the changes from the earlier text, and it is my intent \nthat the current language would protect the North Carolina state law on \nthe Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina conversion agreement.\n\n\n                           low-income housing\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm for allowing me to \ndiscuss an important issue that is quickly becoming a serious national \nproblem--American families, elderly and disabled are increasingly \nunable to afford, or continue to live in, privately-owned housing \nunits.\n  Several recent studies have shown that low-income housing \nopportunities are on the decline nationwide. In Vermont, rents for \nhousing have increased 11 percent in three years, making it \nincreasingly difficult to find affordable shelter. The need to also \nexpand the number of housing units for low-income families is critical \nas the vacancy rate in areas such as Burlington has fallen to less than \none percent. On any given day there are only 60 available rental units \nin a city of over 40,000 people, making it simply impossible to find a \nplace to live, much less one that is affordable. Such problems are \nreflected in increased rates of homelessness, as the number of families \nseeking help from Burlington's emergency shelter rose from 161 in 1997 \nto 269 in 1998. Even though additional Section 8 federal subsidies will \nbe available next year, the 800 Vermonters on the Section 8 waiting \nlist would be hard pressed to find somewhere to use this voucher should \nthey receive one.\n  Fewer opportunities for affordable housing are also due to inadequate \nmaintenance. Vermont and the nation desperately need legislation that \nincreases new low-income housing opportunities--whether through new \nhousing construction, rehabilitation of existing housing, additional \nincentives to keep landlords in the Section 8 market, and expansion of \nexisting tax incentives such as the Private Activity Bond Cap and the \nLow-Income Housing Tax Credit.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his thoughtful \nremarks. As Chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and urban \nAffairs, which has jurisdiction over federal housing programs, I very \nmuch appreciate the Senator's strong interest in affordable housing.\n  I commend Senator Jeffords for bringing to our attention housing \nconditions which are national in scope and affect rural and urban areas \nalike. It is very important that we protect our nation's vulnerable \npopulations, particularly the elderly and disabled living on fixed \nincomes. It is also extremely important that we preserve the American \ntaxpayer's existing investment in affordable housing. Congress must \nseek to preserve our existing housing stock and protect current \nresidents first.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am developing legislation that will \nhelp preserve existing low-income housing stock, promote the \ndevelopment of new affordable housing, and increase opportunities for \nthe purchase of housing projects by resident councils through a dollar-\nfor-dollar matching grant program. My bill will establish a grant \nprogram for states to promote cooperation and partnership among \nFederal, State and local governments, as well as between the private \nsector in developing, maintaining, rehabilitating, and operating \naffordable housing for low-income Americans. These types of initiatives \nare critical components to meet the growing needs of low-income housing \nin Vermont and the nation.\n  While the State of Vermont has largely avoided an overwhelming \ndislocation of tenants from opt-outs and mortgage prepayments, it is \nunable to accommodate the hundreds of families that seek new federally \nsubsidized housing opportunities in the State. Reform efforts must \nfocus both on preservation of existing federally subsidized housing \nunits, as well as the creation of new opportunities for families \nseeking an affordable place to live.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I applaud Senator Jeffords for stepping \nforward with legislation to address affordable rental housing needs. It \nis my understanding that the bill which he plans to introduce will \npresent several options for approaching solutions to complex housing \nproblems.\n  I pledge to work with the Senator from Vermont, Housing and \nTransportation Subcommittee Chairman Allard, and Members of the Senate \nand House to craft comprehensive solutions to our nation's housing \nills. It is imperative that any legislative solutions be fiscally \nresponsible.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would like to reiterate Senator Gramm's remarks and \nthank Senator Jeffords for his interest and insights. As chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, I plan to hold a \nhearing to examine the need for preservation of affordable rental \nhousing. Specifically, I will focus on the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development (HUD) Section 8 program with particular attention to \nprepayment and opt-out issues. I also plan oversight of HUD's \nimplementation of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and \nAffordability Act.\n  I would like to invite Senator Jeffords to testify at this hearing. I \nshare many of his concerns and appreciate his willingness to work with \nme on these important issues.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank Senator Allard for his diligence and effectiveness \nas Subcommittee Chairman. The Subcommittee Chairman and I both welcome \nSenator jeffords' willingness to be a leader for affordable rental \nhousing and look forward to working with him throughout the legislative \nprocess.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I look forward to working with the \nchairmen of the Banking Committee and the Housing Subcommittee to \naddress this growing problem. I thank Senator Gramm and Senator Allard \nfor their kind remarks and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this \nissue on the floor today.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we now have one outstanding matter. We are \nlooking at several amendments. I urge staff to get together on these. \nSenator Levin is trying to work out his language right now.\n  I would prefer to go ahead and pass the bill tonight rather than put \nit off. We are going to try to do it quickly. But I hope we don't lose \nso many people that we would end up not passing the bill. I guess we \ncould move to reconsider and bring it back. But I urge my colleagues \nwith outstanding matters to move quickly. I am going to be here all \nnight. I would be willing to stay here and talk to anybody. A lot of \npeople want and need to leave, but I am not going anywhere. So I am not \nasking you to accommodate me but to accommodate both our Democrat and \nRepublican colleagues. Please give me your language in the next few \nminutes so we can move ahead and pass the bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me yield to our distinguished colleague \nfrom Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to send an amendment \nto the desk. But I want to explain exactly the reason for this \namendment.\n  A couple of days ago, I wrote to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and asked them what their reaction was to the bill as \ndrafted in terms of protecting investors. The answer that I got back \nfrom Arthur Levitt dated May 5 is that the provisions of the bill raise \nserious concerns about investors' protection, and, if adopted, could \nhamper the Commission's effective oversight of U.S. security markets.\n  The letter also indicated that:\n\n       A loophole exempting bank trust activities from Federal \n     securities laws would, therefore, seriously weaken the \n     commission's ability to protect investors.\n\n  And:\n\n       Adoption of the bank trust exemption in S. 900, in addition \n     to other securities provisions\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\n     in the bill, would undermine the important investor \n     protections that make our markets the most transparent, most \n     liquid in the world. It is for these reasons that the \n     commission strongly opposes the bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. \nLevitt be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           Securities and Exchange Commission,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for your letter of May 4 \n     requesting the SEC's analysis of provisions in S. 900 related \n     to bank trust activities. As currently drafted, these \n     provisions raise serious concerns about investor protection, \n     and, if adopted, could hamper the Commission's effective \n     oversight of U.S. securities markets.\n       The bank trust activities provisions in S. 900 would permit \n     banks to act as ``fiduciaries'' without being covered by \n     Federal securities laws. Virtually all bank securities \n     activities will be able to be labeled ``fiduciary'' under the \n     bill, and banks will be able to charge commissions for those \n     securities transactions without being subject to SEC \n     regulation. Under S. 900, a bank and its personnel could have \n     economic incentives--a so-called ``salesman's stake''--in a \n     customer account, without being subject to the strict \n     suitability, best execution, sales practices, supervision, \n     and accountability requirements under Federal securities \n     laws. Fiduciary law also varies by state, and, in many cases, \n     permits investor protections to be lessened, if not \n     eliminated entirely, by contractual provisions. In addition, \n     while broker-dealers are also ``fiduciaries,'' Congress has \n     determined that securities laws should apply to them to \n     provide customers with full investor protections. A loophole \n     exempting bank trust activities from Federal securities laws \n     would therefore seriously weaken the Commission's ability to \n     protect investors.\n       My main concern with any financial modernization bill is \n     the consistent regulation of securities activities, \n     regardless of where they occur. Adoption of the bank trust \n     exemption in S. 900, in addition to other securities \n     provisions in the bill, would undermine the important \n     investor protections that make our markets the most \n     transparent, most liquid in the world. It is for these \n     reasons that the Commission strongly opposes this bill. \n     Moreover, as I have testified, the securities provisions in \n     all of the bills currently under consideration in both the \n     House and the Senate have been so diluted that the Commission \n     opposes all of them. I appreciate your continued interest in \n     financial modernization legislation and look forward to \n     working with you as the bill moves forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arthur Levitt,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I also received a letter from the North \nAmerican Securities Administrators Association. This is the association \nthat was organized in 1919, and consists of the 50 States' securities \nagencies that are responsible to protect investors.\n  The letter from the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation indicates very strong problems with this bill, because, in \nits words, sections 501 and 502 would allow the bank to act as an \ninvestment adviser if the bank receives a fee, and ``as currently \ndrafted, despite the claim that S. 900 would facilitate functional \nregulation of the securities activity in banks, banks will remain \nlargely exempt from regulation as either a broker or dealer under the \nSecurities and Exchange Act of 1934.''\n  This is very, very troubling. This is a very big issue, because it is \nstated in the report which accompanies the bill that the bill generally \nadheres to the principle of functional regulation, which holds that \nsimilar activities should be regulated by the same regulator, and that \nthe bill is intended to ensure that banking activities are regulated by \nbank regulators, securities activities are regulated by securities \nregulators, and insurance activities are regulated by insurance \nregulators.\n  The report that accompanies the bill indicates that the intent is to \nadhere to the principle of functional regulation, which would mean that \nsecurities regulators would indeed regulate securities transactions, \nbut the securities regulators write us that that is not what the bill \ndoes because of the way in which the exemption is drafted in the bill; \nthat in effect all purchases and sales of stock by banks could be run \nthrough a trust department and be exempt from the Securities and \nExchange Commission protection and from local regulations.\n  That is a major problem with the bill. When you are a securities \nregulator, and when the people who are there intending to protect the \npublic who are buying stocks indicate strong opposition to the bill \nbased on that, it seems to me that some alarm bells ought to be going \noff in this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the North \nAmerican Securities Administrators Association be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         North American Securities\n\n\n                             Administrators Association, Inc.,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for requesting the views of \n     the North American Securities Administrators Association \n     (``NASAA'') on proposed Sections 501 and 502 of S. 900, the \n     Financial Services Modernization Act, and specifically, the \n     extent to which these bill provisions would exempt bank \n     securities transactions from state securities regulation and \n     oversight.\n       Cumulatively, the above-referenced provisions, in \n     conjunction with the proposed repeal of the Glass Steagall \n     Act, would permit banks to offer and sell securities on bank \n     premises through bank employees almost exclusively outside of \n     the purview of federal or state securities regulations. As \n     you have correctly pointed out, Section 502 of the bill \n     proposes to exempt from the definition of securities \n     ``dealer'' activities of a bank generally involving the \n     buying or selling of securities for investment purposes in a \n     fiduciary capacity. The bill goes on to define ``fiduciary \n     capacity'' to include wide-ranging activities that far exceed \n     activities performed under the common law concept of \n     ``fiduciary duty'' traditionally tied to persons acting as \n     trustees. Specifically, in Sections 501 and 502, the term \n     ``fiduciary capacity'' is defined to permit, among other \n     things, a bank to act as ``an investment adviser if the bank \n     receives a fee for its investment advice or services.'' A \n     similar exemption exists from the definition of ``broker.''\n       Thus, as currently drafted, despite the claim that S. 900 \n     would facilitate functional regulation of the securities \n     activities of banks, banks will remain largely exempt from \n     regulation as either a broker or dealer under the Securities \n     Exchange Act of 1934. In fact, banks will be permitted to \n     conduct ongoing and unlimited investment advisory activities \n     well outside traditional trust department activities, yet \n     will continue to be excluded from regulation as an \n     ``investment adviser'' under the Investment Advisers Act of \n     1940. Banks would no longer need to establish separate \n     investment advisory affiliates or subsidiaries and would \n     perform such activities in-house.\n       S. 900 purports to implement and foster functional \n     regulation of banks engaging in securities activities. The \n     reality is that given the breadth of the trust activities \n     exception, there will not be any such activities to \n     functionally regulate. The exception is so broad that all the \n     securities activities in which a bank may wish to engage \n     could be classified as ``trust activities,'' so that the \n     exception would consume the rule. Securities regulators would \n     have nothing to regulate. The ``trust activities'' exception \n     should be limited to those traditional banking activities by \n     a trustee involving fiduciary duty and nothing more. Retail \n     securities business should be conducted by and through \n     registered licensed broker-dealers, investment advisers and \n     their representatives regulated by state and federal \n     securities regulators.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this very important \n     matter.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 Philip A. Feigin,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the testimony \nof the Secretary of Treasury Rubin before a House commerce subcommittee \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Excerpted Testimony of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin Before House \n                   Commerce Subcommittee, May 5, 1995\n\n       Representative Diana DeGette. [I]n your prepared testimony \n     you say that you continue to believe that any financial \n     modernization bill must have adequate protections for \n     consumers, and you point out that you are hoping that this \n     committee will add additional protections over the bill that \n     came out of the Banking Committee. Are you talking \n     specifically there about the Federal Home Loan bank system \n     and the other issue on affiliations between commercial firms \n     and savings associations, or are there additional consumer \n     protections you would like to see?\n       Secretary Rubin. I was referring there primarily to trying \n     to work with the SEC in order to better enable them to \n     perform their function of regulation. Look, the SEC has \n     concerns, and I think they're well taken.\n       Representative DeGette. Me, too.\n       Secretary Rubin. I think they're well taken. As you know, \n     this bill was designed to eliminate the exemption from the \n     SEC of these various securities activities they conduct in \n     banks at the same time. Then there are all sorts of \n     exceptions to the exemptions. And the exceptions to the \n     exemptions--(laughs)--could be read so broadly as to \n     reestablish the exemption. And that's a concern\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\n     the SEC has. We share that concern, and what we'd like to do, \n     if there's a way that it can practically be done, is to work \n     with the SEC on these issues. And that was my primary \n     reference.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Schumer is a cosponsor of an \namendment which I am now offering which reads as follows. It is fairly \nshort. I simply want to read this amendment. Then I will send it to the \ndesk.\n  The amendment has now been accepted by the manager of the bill. I \nthink it will help somewhat to allay some concerns in this area. But \nthe critical issue is what will come out of conference. That, of \ncourse, we don't know. But this is the language of the amendment, which \nI will be sending to the desk on my behalf and on behalf of Senator \nSchumer.\n\n       It is the intention of this act, subject to carefully \n     defined exceptions which do not undermine the dominant \n     principle of functional regulation, to ensure that securities \n     transactions affected by a bank are regulated by securities \n     regulators notwithstanding any other provision of this act.\n\n  The intention is to keep the principle that securities transactions \nwill be regulated by securities regulators, and acknowledges that there \ncould be some carefully drafted exceptions which do not undermine the \ndominant principle.\n  That, it seems to me, would be an improvement in this area.\n  I want to again thank my friend from Texas for looking at this \nlanguage, indicating that it would be acceptable to him, and then, of \ncourse, the proof of the pudding as to whether we are really protecting \npurchasers of stock through the regulators who are there to protect \npurchasers and sellers of stock will be determined in conference. But \nthe general principle enunciated in this amendment would go to \nconference as the principle that is governing this bill.\n  I also want to thank my good friend from New York, because he has \nworked so closely with me on this issue.\n  I can't yield the floor to him. But I will yield the floor. But, \nbefore doing so, and I know he does wish to speak for a few minutes, I \nwill send the amendment to the desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 317\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure bank securities activities are regulated by \n                         securities regulators)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin), for himself, and Mr. \n     Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 317.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 124, line 25, before ``Section'' insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) It is the intention of this Act subject to carefully \n     defined exceptions which do not undermine the dominant \n     principle of functional regulation to ensure that securities \n     transactions effected by a bank are regulated by securities \n     regulators, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act.\n       (2)''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor but hope the Senator from New York will \nbe recognized briefly for a comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the President, and I thank both my colleague \nfrom Michigan and my colleague from Texas, the chairman, for their \nwork.\n  It is a very important amendment. In fact, if this amendment had not \nbeen adopted, we might have seen the virtual unraveling of the strong \nframework of securities law that we have built up in this country since \nthe 1940s.\n  When I see my friends on Wall Street sometimes complaining about the \nSEC--and they can be very, very strict and sometimes hardheaded on \nspecific issues--I remind them that in the general framework of \nregulation, a tough and strong disclosure has made our securities \nmarkets the strongest in the world. It is the reason that billions of \ndollars come from overseas to the United States, because they know \nbasically that our markets are on the level.\n  This bill, while in the report language said that we wish to have \nwhat is called ``functional regulation,'' that is, having the correct \nregulator for the type of function, not by the type of institutions, \nand therefore if a bank gets securities regulation it would be \nregulated by the SEC, just as if a securities firm did securities \nregulation it would be regulated by the SEC. It is a fundamental \nprinciple, particularly if this bill becomes law, which, if we change \nCRA, I hope it will.\n  It means very simply that if you underwrite securities, if you sell a \nsecurity, you must abide by the SEC strict disclosure. The banking \nregulators have never been very good at this type of regulation, and \nweren't intended to be.\n  The securities regulators--the SEC--have always been the tough guy \nwho is an adversarial regulator. The banking regulators have always \nbeen a friendly regulator, sort of akin to a big brother making sure \nthe banks didn't get too far into trouble--for two good reasons: One, \nthe banking industry had Federal insurance, and we had to protect that \ninvestment; and, two, the banks were engaged traditionally in not very \nrisky activity.\n  The securities markets have no Federal insurance. They are raw \ncapitalism, and they have had risky activities. Therefore, you really \nneed full disclosure.\n  The amendment which the Senator from Michigan has put forward, which \nI am proud to cosponsor, is a very simple one. It says keep that \nfunctional regulation.\n  Let me explain to my colleagues just in a brief minute, because I \nknow we all want to hurry, what would have happened if this amendment \nhad not been adopted.\n  First, the whole regulation--the whole SEC regimentation of \nregulation--would not have been applied to banks as they entered the \nsecurities industry, and they will enter it massively. Then securities \nfirms, being put at an unfair competitive disadvantage because their \nbanks would not be regulated, would start having their securities \nactivity occur under a bank holding company.\n\n  The entire structure of regulation which has worked so well--and \nevery person on Wall Street I know admits it; it is tough, it is \nstrong, but it keeps our markets on the level--would have unraveled. \nThis bill in effect had a Trojan horse.\n  The amendment being proposed by the Senator from Michigan and myself \ncloses that door. We will have to work out the language in conference, \nbut I for one, if I am lucky enough to be a conferee, or even if I am \nnot, I am going to work very hard to see whatever loopholes are placed \nin there are very narrow and very limited.\n  I know the hour is late but this amendment may be the most important \namendment we are adding to the entire bill. It keeps the structure of \nfunctional regulation there. It has securities-type activities, \nwherever they be done, be regulated by the SEC. It is a system that has \nworked. We should not undo it right now as our capital markets are \nenjoying the tremendous success they have.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question in on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 317) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Texas, as well as \nthe Senator from Maryland, for their work, but particularly the Senator \nfrom New York.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 310, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have a little technical correction that \nhas been cleared, as I understand. I call up amendment No. 310 and ask \nunanimous consent that amendment No. 310 be modified by the text I am \nsending now to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for Mr. Bennett, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 310, as modified.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 310), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Section 23B(b)(2) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. \n     371c-1) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``Subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) shall not apply if the \n     purchase or acquisition of such securities has been approved, \n     before such securities are initially offered for sale to the \n     public, by a majority of the directors of the bank based on a \n     determination that the purchase is a sound investment for the \n     bank irrespective of the fact that an affiliate of the bank \n     is a principal underwriter of the securities.''\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what did this deal with?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it is my understanding that this \namendment has been cleared on both sides.\n  It addresses the CRA issue in what I hope is a noncontroversial way \nin that it calls for reporting of what happens to the CRA loans. Many \nof these loans are being made now with no regulation at all and no \npublic understanding of what is happening. I, for example, asked a \nsimple question as I went through the CRA debate. I said, What is the \nrate of default of CRA loans compared to non-CRA loans? And, \nspecifically, what is the rate of default of those loans that are made \nthrough the advocacy groups that become loan brokers?\n  I was told the rate of failure for CRA loans generally is about six \nor seven times higher than normal loans but there was no information as \nto the rate of default among those loans that were made through the \nadvocacy groups that have become loan brokers. I think we are entitled \nto know that.\n  This is simply a sunshine amendment that will report the facts. It \ndoes not change the regulatory situation in any way, it does not damage \nCRA in any way; it simply says the Congress will know what is happening \nwith respect to CRA loans that are currently being made in the dark.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 310), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further proceedings \nunder the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 318\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. On behalf of Senator Sarbanes and myself, I send managers' \namendments to the desk. I ask they be considered en bloc and adopted en \nbloc, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas (Mr. Gramm), for himself and Mr. \n     Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered 318.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 318) was agreed to.\n  The motion to reconsider the motion to lay on the table was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is my understanding we are now ready for a vote on \nfinal passage. I thank everyone for their assistance and patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I guess I should state I am going to vote against this \nbill on final passage. We have had a very spirited debate. We have had \na number of very close votes on important amendments, and in my view \nthe bill has not been improved sufficiently to warrant an affirmative \nvote, therefore I intend to vote against it. I am not, obviously, going \nto lay out all the reasons at this hour of night because I know we want \nto go to a vote here.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there are two Dorgan amendments that are \npending. We had an agreement to have a voice vote.\n  I ask that occur now.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 313\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 313) was rejected.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 312\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 312) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n\n\n              SENATOR JOSEPH BIDEN CASTS HIS 10,000th VOTE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in recognizing \na historic achievement by one of the Senate's most remarkable Members. \nWith the vote we are about to cast, Senator Joe Biden becomes the \nyoungest Member of this body ever to cast 10,000 votes.\n  It should come as a surprise to none of us that Senator Biden should \nset such a record. He has always been a few steps ahead of the crowd. \nIn 1972, at the age of 29, he mounted his first Senate campaign against \na popular incumbent, Republican Senator J. Caleb Boggs. No one--not \neven his own Democratic party--thought he could do it. But in 1973 he \nwas sworn in as the second-youngest person ever to be popularly elected \nto the Senate.\n  The first issue Senator Biden tackled was campaign finance reform--as \nwe all know, this is a difficult issue for anyone, much less a first-\nyear member. But as we also all know, Joe Biden has never shied away \nfrom a fight. His candor, strength of character and commitment to \nprinciple have led him through many battles over the years.\n  As chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nBiden helped this institution, and this nation, sort through the \ncomplexities of the most controversial issues of our day--from flag \nburning, to abortion and the death penalty,\n  Senator Biden also presided over perhaps the most contentious Supreme \nCourt nominations hearings in history. In the midst of the controversy \nsurrounding nominee Robert Bork, Senator Biden maintained a level of \nintellectual rigor that raised the bar for committee consideration of \nall future nominations.\n  We also recall his leadership and doggedness in crafting what may \nwell be the most difficult and important pieces of legislation in \nrecent years, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This \nincluded the Violence Against Women Act, the very first comprehensive \npiece of legislation to specifically address gender-based crimes.\n  He was also instrumental in creating the position of national ``Drug \nCzar,'' which has been invaluable in our fight against illegal drugs. \nHis commitment to keeping drugs off the streets remains steadfast.\n  The Senate and this nation have also benefitted from Senator Biden's \nleadership in the foreign policy arena. As ranking member on the \nForeign Relations Committee, he is widely regarded as one of the \nSenate's leading foreign policy experts.\n  He was one of the first to predict the fall of communism and \nanticipate the need to redefine our policies to fit a post-cold war \nworld. And, as far back as early 1993, Senator Biden called for active \nAmerican participation to contain the conflict in Bosnia. In his public \nservice and personal life, Joe Biden sets a high standard we can all \nadmire.\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\n  His steel will, dedication and compassion, reinforcing a powerful \nintellect and impressive communication skills, have made Senator Biden \nan exceptional Senator and friend. The number of people he has inspired \nthrough his commitment to his family, his values and his beliefs is \nlegion.\n  Mr. President, it is indeed a pleasure to serve with Joe Biden, and \nto count him as a friend. On behalf of all the Members of this Senate, \nI congratulate Joe on this historic achievement and thank him for his \nnumerous contributions to the United States Senate and to his country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate my good friend \nand colleague, Senator Joe Biden, on casting his 10,000th vote in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  All of us who have listened--and listened--to Senator Biden on the \nSenate floor have come to deeply respect his leadership and commitment \nto causes of concern.\n  He led the historic effort for NATO expansion with courage and \nconviction.\n  He has a deep concern for America's role in the world and is a true \nleader of our foreign policy establishment.\n  Senator Biden has been a champion of victims of crime, particularly \ncrimes against women.\n  Most of all, those of us who know him, have watched his grace and \ncourage through personal suffering and serious illness.\n  I join my colleagues in recognizing Senator Biden's contributions to \nthe Senate and extend my congratulations to him.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Delaware. I note he is only 56. I am \n1 year older and he has already cast 10,000 votes. What an achievement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to pay Senator Biden a tribute. \nHe is an outstanding Senator and an outstanding man.\n  When anyone reflects on their life, they do so by thinking about \nsignificant personal and professional benchmarks and milestones. Today, \none of our colleagues--and my good friend--Joe Biden is marking just \none such accomplishment, his 10,000th career vote in the Senate.\n  Casting your 10,000th vote is a momentous occasion for many reasons. \nBeyond being an indication that a Senator has served in this body for a \nsubstantial period of time, casting 10,000 votes is a testament to an \nindividual's commitment to public service. Furthermore, it is proof \nthat a Senator is doing a good job, for his or her constituents have \nseen fit to keep an official in office long enough to achieve this \naccomplishment. Then again, given the type of person Joe Biden is, it \nshould come as no surprise to us that the people of Delaware have \nrepeatedly sent him to the Senate since 1972. He is a man who is \nmotivated by a desire to help others and is dedicated to serving the \npeople of his state and our nation. Joe Biden clearly entered his life \nin public service for the proper reasons and with the best of motives, \nand he is an individual who represents all that is positive about those \nwho seek elected office.\n  I have had the good fortune of knowing Joe Biden from the beginning \nof his Senate career and it is hard to believe that almost thirty years \ncould have elapsed so quickly. During the course of his tenure, I have \nwatched Joe establish an impressive and respected record of work. He \nhas distinguished himself in the fields of the judiciary and foreign \naffairs, and he is considered a forceful, passionate, and articulate \nadvocate on both these issues. Though he is often sought for analysis \nand insight regarding international developments, making our streets \nsafe, or any number of other issues before the Senate, Joe Biden first \nand foremost works tirelessly to serve the people of Delaware. The \npeople of his state are indeed fortunate to be represented by such a \ncapable individual.\n  As most of you already may know, Joe and I have worked closely \ntogether for years as members of the Judiciary Committee. We have both \nserved as each other's chairmen and ranking members of this very \nimportant committee and I have the highest regard for Joe's intellect, \nleadership, and ability. Ironically, we not only sat next to each other \non the committee for years, but we have been neighbors in the Russell \nBuilding for many years as well, our offices being literally right next \nto one another. You would be hard pressed to find a finer, more \ndedicated, or more friendly group of people than those who work for Joe \nBiden and I hope that he stays my neighbor for as long as he is in the \nSenate.\n  Beyond being a congenial colleague and a good neighbor, Joe Biden is \nmy friend. He is someone whose word can be trusted, who wants to do \nwhat is right, who is devoted to his family, and whose heart is good. \nThese are rare qualities in any individual, but they can be especially \nscarce in this town. That Joe has not changed over the years is \ntestament to the man he is and the son his parents raised. I am proud \nto call Joe Biden my friend as I know each of my colleagues is as well.\n  I do not think I am going out on a limb when I predict that Joe Biden \nis going to be in the United States Senate for a long time to come, and \nthat as long as he is a Member of this body he will continue to make \nvaluable contributions to public policy and the nation. Joe, I thank \nyou for your service, I thank you for all your assistance, and most of \nall I thank you for your many years as a loyal and kind friend.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join in the felicitations of our \ndistinguished colleague from Delaware. He suffered as a young lad a \nhandicap of stuttering. He tried to overcome that by addressing the \nstudent body. We in the Senate can well attest to the fact that he has \novercome it. He has led the way in foreign policy for NATO and in \njudicial matters.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I add my words of praise for the Senator \nfrom Delaware and make a point that he is going to be here a long time. \nIf he matches his current record--he took office in 1973--if he does \nthis, he will be only 82 when he casts approximately his 20,000th vote, \nand he will then be a kid compared to Senator Thurmond, who will be \nthere at the time congratulating him on his 20,000th vote.\n  Joe Biden has been such a good friend to me.\n  When I was in the House, I asked him to introduce the Senate \ncompanion bill to my legislation to protect dolphins.\n  Joe did not hesitate, and he enthusiastically took up the cause--with \nthe strong support of his beautiful daughter Ashley! And he has been a \nsteadfast ally in that important environmental fight. He was the Senate \nsponsor of my Ocean Protection Act. I was the House sponsor of his VAW \nAct.\n  I am now a proud member of the Foreign Relations Committee, where Joe \nBiden shows why he is one of the most respected foreign policy experts \nin the country.\n  Congratulations, I say to my good friend, and many, many more years \nof success and happiness with your good friends and colleagues here and \nyour wonderful family at home in Delaware.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Delaware is \nthe only person in this body who is younger than I am but senior to me \nat the same time. I congratulate him on his 10,000th vote. I jumped \nover the cliff with him on more than a few of those votes. I look \nforward to the day when I might match his record.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I know everybody wants to go home, but let \nme say, if we tried to review Joe Biden's accomplishments, it would \ntake all night. Let me put it this way: I opposed most of them.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Furthermore--this is serious--Joe Biden is a caring person. I work \nwith him on the Foreign Relations Committee. He is great to work with. \nJoe, I am proud of you.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this next vote is a milestone for a friend \nof mine--a distinguished colleague and a leader in this chamber. It \nrepresents the ten-thousandth vote cast by Joe Biden, and I would like \nto take a moment not only to bring it to the attention of our \ncolleagues, but to reflect on a career that has been--and continues to \nbe--a bright legacy of service.\n  To put this vote into perspective, Mr. President, only twenty \nSenators in history have reached this milestone--only twenty Senators \nout of the 1,851 who have had the honor of serving in this \ndistinguished body. Each of us who has the honor of representing our \nstate in the Senate understands what a rare privilege it is to cast a \nvote on this floor. In fact, the first vote we cast ranks among the \nmost memorable moment in our lives--a moment not to be forgotten.\n  I'm sure that when Joe cast his first vote on January 23, 1973--over \ntwenty-five years ago--he could not have foreseen this moment. Through \nthe years, he has achieved many distinguished honors. He has gained \nnational stature, as a candidate for President. He has established \nhimself as a foremost expert on judicial and foreign policy matters. \nAnd though I know that we often differ philosophically, I can say that \neach vote Joe has cast, his focus has been on doing what's best for \nDelaware and our Nation, at large.\n  Joe, on this special occasion, I salute you. Ten thousand votes speak \nvolumes about a life dedicated to public service. On behalf of our \ncolleagues I congratulate you. And on behalf of our friends and \nneighbors in Delaware I thank you.\n  For me, it has been an honor, a pleasure, and a privilege to serve \nthese many years with Senator Biden. He always does what he thinks is \nin the best interests of our country and our people of Delaware. I am \nproud to count him a friend.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending our colleague from \nDelaware on reaching this major milestone in his brilliant Senate \ncareer.\n  For nearly three decades, he has done an outstanding job serving the \npeople of Delaware and the Nation in the Senate. He has been an \neffective leader on a wide range of issues in both domestic policy and \nforeign policy.\n  It has been a special privilege for me to serve with our \ndistinguished colleague on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I \nparticularly commend his leadership over the past quarter century on \nthe many law enforcement challenges facing the nation. It is a \nprivilege to serve with Senator Biden--and I am sure he will compile an \nequally outstanding record on his next 10,000 votes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will respond after everyone votes so I \nget to cast my 10,000th vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, unlike Senator Biden, I don't have a lot to \nsay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all Senators have until the close of \nbusiness next Thursday, a week from today, to insert their statements \nin the Record and that all statements that are submitted appear at one \nplace in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass? The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

BIDEN ON HIS 10,000th VOTE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a very dear \nfriend of mine in the Senate and his historic 10,000th vote. His name \nis Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware, a friend and colleague whose \ndistinguished career has elevated both the quality and stature of the \nSenate. The number 10,000 is an important landmark in a career that has \nmany milestones, but I believe Senator Biden will be best remembered \nfor the significance of his varied votes. I have seen many of those \nnotable votes cast.\n  In every one of those votes he was careful, deliberate, and \nrespectful of his duty to the people of Delaware. Joe and I have served \nin the Senate for roughly the same amount of time. He has been here a \ncouple of years longer than I. We have worked closely together in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, which he chaired and which I now chair. On \noccasion we have agreed to disagree. In fact, I wish he had cast more \nof those 10,000 votes with me. In all seriousness, however, Joe and I \nhave found many areas where we strongly have agreed.\n  Joe has long been a leader on the issue of youth violence, an issue \nwhich has affected countless lives in Delaware, Utah, and the rest of \nthe Nation. In 1974, he was the lead sponsor of the Juvenile Justice \nPrevention Act. In 1992, he sponsored the Juvenile Justice Prevention \nAct Amendments, which provided States with Federal grants for a \ncomplete and comprehensive approach to improve the juvenile justice \nsystem and controlling juvenile crime.\n  He has long advocated a tough stand against illegal drugs. He \nauthored the law creating the Nation's drug czar, and in 1986, he was \nthe guiding force for the enactment of groundbreaking drug legislation. \nHe has probably done as much if not more than anybody in the Senate \nwith regard to the antidrug stances that we all should support and that \nwe all appreciate today.\n\n  With regard to juvenile justice, next week we bring up a juvenile \njustice bill. Senator Biden has been a mainstay in helping to resolve \nconflicts that we have in that bill and hopefully helping it to become \na bipartisan bill that all of us can support. What I admire most about \nJoe is the fact that he is the staunchest defender of his party's \nbeliefs, yet he does not hesitate to cross party lines to forge a \nconsensus position when he believes it is the right thing to do. \nNowhere is that more evident than with the issue of juvenile crime.\n  Joe has a history of standing up for what is right when it comes to \njuvenile crime, and I believe he will continue to do so. We look \nforward to working with him next week.\n  While chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he authored the Violent\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which was signed into law in \n1994. While I differed with much that was contained and dropped from \nthe bill, this legislation contained the Biden-Hatch Violence Against \nWomen Act, the first comprehensive law to address gender-based \noffenses. Senator Biden's leadership on this issue changed how many \nAmericans view the issue of violence against women. He even changed how \nwe refer to domestic abuse in the Senate by continually asking, \n``What's domestic about beating your wife?''\n  Joe is widely regarded as a foreign policy expert. Many remember his \nleadership on NATO expansion in 1998. He stood out as a strong advocate \nfor the inclusion of several Eastern European nations into the \nalliance. NATO is now engaged in its greatest test, and I am convinced \nthat Joe's leadership was integral in strengthening the alliance.\n  In 1997, Senator Biden showed these same leadership skills when he \nled the successful effort in the Senate to ratify the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. Joe Biden has truly had a distinguished career in the \nSenate.\n  All that said and done, I could go on and on about his distinguished \ncareer, but it is his personal qualities that have impressed his \nfriends, his family, and his colleagues, including, of course, myself \nas a friend and as a colleague.\n  Many may not know that Senator Biden overcame two operations for a \nnear-fatal brain aneurysm in 1988 and returned to the Senate in 1989. I \nremember those days and I remember how catastrophic they were for him, \nhis family, and for those of us who prayed for him. He showed great \ncourage and persistence in overcoming that adversity. Nobody was more \nthankful than his wife and three children, to whom he is a loving \nhusband and father. Indeed, he is renowned for putting his family \nfirst, as demonstrated by his daily commute to and from Delaware. The \nfact that he takes a 2-hour train ride to get here every day makes the \naccomplishment of reaching 10,000 votes all the more astounding.\n  So it is with great honor that I ask my colleagues to join me and \nothers in congratulating Senator Joseph R. Biden on his 10,000th vote. \nHis many contributions to this body are appreciated and recognized. I \nam sure that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say we will enjoy \nkeeping a close eye on the many votes yet to come.\n  Just as a gift this evening, this is the last CD that we have done. \nIt is, frankly, Santita Jackson, Jesse Jackson's daughter, singing with \na wonderful young African American from Nashville, who is as good a \nsinger as anybody in the world, named Chris Willis. This CD is entitled \n``Put Your Arms Around the World.'' I think it kind of applies to Joe \nBiden. When he listens to the song written by Peter McCann and me--\nPeter McCann wrote ``It's the Right Time of the Night'' and ``Want to \nMake Love''--called ``Take Good Care of My Heart,'' that particular \nsong, I think, really applies to Senator Biden because, in his own way, \nwith his tremendous interest in foreign policy, tremendous interest in \nthe law, his tremendous interest in overcoming injustice in our society \nnot only here but throughout the world, I think this song will mean \nsomething to him. It certainly does to me. Santita Jackson and Chris \nWillis are two of the rising young stars in America. I would like to \ngive this CD to Senator Biden at this time and say that I look forward \nto serving with him for a long time to come. So hang in there.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in paying this \ntribute to Joe Biden on the occasion of him casting his 10,000th vote \nin the Senate. The casting of that vote is an occasion to pay tribute \nnot for voting but for a real career of service and of great \ndistinction. It has been one of the pleasures of my service in this \nbody to have served with Joe Biden, and one of my pleasures that we \nrepresent adjoining States. Therefore, we interact on a number of \nissues that otherwise would not be the case amongst Members of the \nSenate.\n  He has had an extraordinary career here. He is now in his fifth term. \nHe got elected before he was old enough, actually, under the \nConstitution, before he was old enough under the Constitution to be a \nMember of the Senate. He was elected at the age of 29, and he has just \nhad a terrific career of accomplishment. Those who have worked with him \nderive great pleasure from it. We have marveled at his legislative \nskill.\n  I want to talk about two or three of the things in which he has been \nvery much involved. We have served together on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee all of these years. And he has exercised \nextraordinary leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee at various \npoints during his career. We are making a lot of the fact now in \nAmerica that crime rates are going down all across the country. So \neveryone is sort of looking to see what is the cause of that, or who \nought to get the praise for it. I have to tell you that Joe Biden ought \nto get a lot of the praise for the fact that crime has gone down across \nthis land. He has authored every significant anticrime initiative in \nthe Congress over a period of time that he has been here--the Juvenile \nJustice Prevention Act, the Victims of Crime Act, the Violent Crime \nControl and Law Enforcement Act, and on and on and on.\n  Senator Biden has been a great champion of law enforcement and of \nthose who work in law enforcement. He has been sensitive on the \nimportant civil liberties and civil rights cases, which a democracy \nought to be sensitive to. He has understood how you can balance those \nand put it together. There are thousands and thousands of cops on the \nstreet today giving us safer neighborhoods and more secure cities and \ncommunities all across America because of Joe Biden's initiatives.\n  Senator Biden was the first to include the provisions with respect to \nviolence against women and really raise to a very high level the whole \nissue of gender-based crimes. He has consistently focused our attention \nonto that area.\n  He has dealt in a very effective way with the gun issue, which is not \neasy to deal with in this body, and certainly not an easy issue to deal \nwith effectively. I have to tell you that I think throughout all of \nthis period Senator Biden had a clear perception and focus on how to do \nsomething about the crime issue. He did not demagog it. He did not seek \nto emotionalize it. He worked hard to develop the real programs that \nwould make a difference in our communities all across the country. I am \nextremely grateful to him for that.\n  On the Foreign Relations Committee, he has consistently been an \nadvocate of an international stance by the United States--actually, the \nexpansion of NATO was in large part a consequence of his very effective \nadvocacy and leadership. He has been sensitive to the importance of \nhuman rights and democratic values in American foreign policy. I have \nbeen very privileged to serve with him on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and to see his effective leadership in that arena.\n\n  Finally, let me just say he is a terrific friend. I can't tell you \nhow much I value and treasure his friendship, how much it has meant, \nhow much I enjoy his sense of humor, and even how much I like to listen \nto his speeches--which occasionally go on for a while. But this \ninstitution has been honored by having him as a Member. It is \nextraordinary that at what is really, for the Senate, still a very \nyoung age, he has achieved his 10,000th vote. I wish him many, many, \nmany thousands more. I thank him for his extraordinary service to the \ncountry and for his deep friendship to all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, add my congratulations to the \nSenator for his 10,000th vote. At this point in my Senate career, that \nis really an incredible number. I have known Senator Biden for a long \ntime. I was the State Jaycee President when the U.S. Jaycees recognized \nhim as one of the 10 outstanding young men of this country in Mobil, \nAL. I can't tell you how incredible it was to get to meet him at that \npoint and how even more incredible it was when I got to join this body \nand meet him here after he must have done 9,000 votes. I read about him \nin the newspaper and have gotten to work with him, and I have enjoyed \nthat experience.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if it is appropriate, may I respond \nbriefly?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am truly appreciative of the comments my\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\nfriends have made--my old-new friends, my old-old friends, and my close \nbuddies from across the State line.\n  I began to wonder about casting my 10,000th vote on the occasion of \nthe majority leader indicating there would be no more votes for 4 days \nand the last planes heading west were leaving. I thank my colleagues \nwho put in the Record their comments. I will withhold specific comment \nuntil I read them, because God only knows what they said. But let me \nsay that I find it no particular feat to have cast 10,000 votes. If you \nare around here long enough and still standing, that happens.\n  I hope I have cast some votes that have made this country a little \nbit better. I am confident there is none that I have cast that have \nenhanced the standing of America, or the condition of the American \npeople, that weren't bipartisan. I can't think of any that were done \nthat weren't done in a bipartisan manner in the end.\n  I look at Orrin Hatch. Orrin Hatch came here, and is still one of the \nleading conservative lights on the American political scene, and yet we \nhave worked together for years and years and years. I cannot think that \nwe have ever had a cross word to one another in 25 years. We have had \nvery different views.\n  Paul Sarbanes, who is literally one of the brightest people I have \nserved with--just raw, pure, gray matter, raw horsepower--to have him \nsay the things that he said about me in reference to our personal \nfriendship is meaningful, particularly since my wife, who works as a \nprofessor in Delaware and seldom is in Washington, is sitting in the \ngalleries listening to this, and my No. 2 son, who is now living in \nWashington, heard it as well.\n  I am sure they know better. But my mother probably believes \neverything Paul said, because I met Paul's mother as well.\n  I think, if I can make one, in a sense, political observation, the \nfirst vote I cast in January of 1972 was a vote I was told--I didn't \nremember this--on an Assistant Secretary, I believe, the No. 2 person \nat State. I am not positive of that.\n  I remember the day, although I was obviously very junior, when I was \nsworn in by the Secretary of the Senate, Mr. Valeo, who actually came \nto me in Wilmington to swear me in, because of unusual circumstances. \nAfter he gave me the little certificate that we get when we are sworn \nin, he said, ``You have arrived to the Senate, to the best of my \nknowledge, the least senior than any man in history,'' because \nseniority is based on the previous offices that you have held. It keeps \nnarrowing down to State, size, population, and age ultimately.\n  But when I got here, there were a number of giants in the Senate. We \noften hear it said today that there are no giants left in the Senate. \nIn truth there are. There are women and men who serve in this body \ntoday who are equal to and in some ways surpass the capacity of some of \nthe great people I have had the honor of serving with over the past \nalmost 27 years.\n  So the caliber has not changed. What has changed a little bit--and I \nam referencing this tonight, because of my colleagues who are here on \nthe floor--what has changed since then is the impression that we don't \nlike each other very much, that we don't get along with one another \nvery well, that we are nakedly partisan in all of our undertakings.\n  I wish the public could see that there is still a degree of \ncamaraderie here, a degree of mutual respect that crosses \nthat sometimes ``chasm'' called the ``center aisle,'' what makes this \nbody more unique than any other legislative body at least in modern \nhistory. I will not challenge Senator Byrd about whether it equals or \nsurpasses the Roman Senate, but I am confident that it does surpass any \nother legislative body in modern history.\n\n  I would just conclude by saying the lubricant that allows that to \nhappen is genuine and personal respect that most of us have for one \nanother. I think it is the defining feature of this institution.\n  I remember now meeting Senator Enzi back in 1972--or 1973, I guess it \nwas--when I received that award. But I have not gotten--because we \ndon't serve on committees together--to know him personally as well as I \nknow my two colleagues who remain. Notwithstanding the wonderful words \nthey have both uttered relating to me, the genuine testimony I take \nfrom what they have done is that they are here. It is 9 o'clock at \nnight. There are no votes. The Senator from Maryland has a long drive \nhome, because, he, like me, commutes every day to Baltimore, MD. And he \ndrives. My friend from Utah probably missed a plane to go back to Utah \nthis weekend.\n  I truly, truly appreciate it.\n  Let me yield the floor by saying, Mr. President, that I am asked \nsometimes what is the best, the most significant perk that exists being \na Senator. I always answer that there are two things.\n  Before I became a Senator, as a young man campaigning in the midst of \nthe Vietnam war, and the civil rights crisis, and the assassination of \nmen who I had an incredible regard for in 1968--both Martin Luther King \nand Robert Kennedy--I came here thinking that all that had to happen \nwas that we elected women and men who had a greater degree of \nintellectual capacity, had a better education and were smarter. I got \nhere and I was truly dumbfounded--truly dumbfounded--by how many people \nwho serve in this body who are so incredibly bright, who are so \nsignificantly schooled in the areas in which they speak. I arrived and \nI found out that Jack Javits could tell you as much about modern art as \nhe could about foreign policy. There was Mike Mansfield, who could tell \nyou as much about Chinese history as he could about the politics in \nMontana.\n  Paul Sarbanes can tell you as much about the international monetary \nsystem, about the history of the Balkans, about the banking system, as \nhe can tell you about his hometown baseball team and the local politics \nof Baltimore.\n  Orrin Hatch is a man who used to be a card-carrying union guy from \nPittsburgh, who goes out as a boxer, goes out to his now home State of \nUtah, and gets elected after having a career as an incredible trial \nlawyer.\n  I mean it is amazing--the diversity here.\n  I will not mention the judge's name. But I was having lunch with a \nJustice once in my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The \nissue was about pay raises for judges. This particular Justice said \npublicly--this Justice accidentally said it. He didn't intend to be \nquoted--that he could understand why the public wouldn't want \nCongresspersons and Senators to get a raise but judges were different, \nthey were academically qualified. I know the Senator from Utah knows \nwho I am talking about.\n  To this particular, very competent Justice--I was in his office--I \nsaid, ``May I close your door, Mr. Justice?'' I said, ``Mr. Justice, I \nhave sat in the Judiciary Committee for years. I have had the \nopportunity as either ranking member or chairman for, I think, a 14-\nyear period to look at the background of every single person who has \ncome on the bench.'' At that time it was 10 or 12 years. I said, ``I am \nwilling to make you a bet. I will take the intellectual potential of \nthe Senate''--in the House I didn't know as well--``and match it \nagainst the entire judiciary.'' They are bright, they are competent. If \nI am not mistaken in time, we had, like Senator Sarbanes, seven Rhodes \nscholars in the Senate. We had a half a dozen Marshall scholars--not \nme. I don't qualify on that account. We have men and women in here \nwhose academic distinction exceeds that of 99 percent of the people--\nall the jobs anywhere in America, corporate, labor, business, academia.\n  The greatest perk I have had as a Senator was access to people with \nserious, serious minds and a serious sense of purpose, and who cared \nabout something. If I dropped dead tomorrow, I would be thankful to the \npeople of Delaware, for the individuals they have allowed me to be \nexposed to, to argue with, to fight with, to debate with, to agree with \nMembers. I will be thankful to them for the gift they gave me in having \nthat access. I don't believe there is any other place in the Nation I \ncould have gotten that kind of exposure.\n  The second thing I found that has been the greatest gift in those \n10,000 votes during that period is that this is the ultimate graduate \neducation. If you take this job serious, as all my colleagues do on \nthis floor, you learn one thing: You don't get a driver, you don't get \na house, you don't get a bodyguard,\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\nnor should we, but what you do get is the ability to pick up the phone \nand call anybody in the world and they will take your call. You can \ncall Nobel laureates, you can call experts in any field, and if you \nwant to learn, this is the ultimate seminar if you take it seriously. \nThere is no other place I can think of that a person can do that.\n  Mr. President, I have a lot more to learn. And of those 10,000 votes, \nI am sure there are many that were not as enlightened as I thought they \nwere at the time I cast them. Hopefully, I have learned. Hopefully, I \nwill get a chance to learn more than I know now. If you want to do it, \nand if you take it seriously and if you reach out across that chasm, \nyou reach out across that aisle, believe it or not, there is somebody \non the other side willing to talk to you, willing to exchange ideas \nwith you. If you work hard enough, you actually may do a little bit--\njust a little bit--to change the state of affairs in this great \ncountry. That is all we can do here.\n  I have no illusions about the significance of the Senate in terms of \ndetermining national policy, but within the context and the role the \nSenate plays, we get to play little parts. The only time it works is \nwhen we cross that chasm. That is the only time it works.\n  I thank my colleagues. They are honorable men. They are men of \nachievement. I think the public gets a pretty good buy for their \ninvestment in the men that are sitting here on the floor today and the \nwomen and men who cast all the votes today; they are competent.\n  It has been a pleasure working with them. I hope I get to cast a few \nmore votes. I hope I get to convince Orrin Hatch and Senator Enzi to \ncast more votes my way. The truth of the matter is, as I said, nothing \ngets done unless you reach across that aisle. I appreciate the fact \nthere has always been somebody on this side to talk to me.\n  I thank all my colleagues. For those who made other statements, I \nwill respond in the Record and not take the time of my colleagues. The \nBaltimore-Washington tunnel is probably clear by now. We can both head \nnorth.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4881-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to make brief comments about the \nbill.\n  I congratulate all of the people that have been involved in passing \nthis bill today. It is a significant piece of banking legislation. It \nis a significant piece of legislation for this country. It will make a \ndifference to consumer safety, to banks, to insurance companies, to \nsecurities companies, to all of the financial institutions of any form \nin this country.\n  I want to congratulate the staff people who worked on that bill. They \nwere tireless, they were diligent. They have worked for longer hours \nthan I have seen people work. I want to congratulate my fellow Senators \non the Banking Committee for not only their tireless effort, but the \nway they debated, brought issues and amendments to the floor, and \nworked through the process together. This could have been a much more \nlengthy process than the 3 days that it took.\n  I particularly want to commend the ranking member on the committee. \nIt has been a tremendous education working with him through these days. \nI want to congratulate the chairman, as well. I point out the contrast \nbetween the ranking member and the chairman: One is very quiet and one \nis very vocal. But together they worked through this issue, helped to \nexpedite the votes that we took, helped to expedite the debates, and \nworked together well so we could reach this point.\n  I have to make a few comments about the chairman who is one of the \nmost tireless and focused people that I have seen. I know he was an \neconomics professor and I appreciate the amount of research he did for \nthis, and saw that as an example of the effort he probably put in when \nhe was teaching.\n  I listened to him speak. I think I would have liked to have had him \nas one of my professors. He can take things that are very detailed and \nmake them interesting. If banking can be made entertaining, he does it. \nHe has a unique use of charts and words that help to paint a picture. \nUnlike some economists, he is not doing the ``on the one hand and on \nthe other hand,'' he is very decided in his opinions.\n  I have to mention that in Banking Committee after one of our hearings \nhe was asked how the procedure would go on this bank reform. It was a \nleftover issue from last year, and a number of people were concerned \nand wanted it to progress. So they asked him how it would work.\n  He said: We are going to have a number of hearings on it, and then \nfollowing the hearings we will draft the bill, and then I want Senators \nto have an opportunity to talk to their constituents, to talk to their \nbanks, to talk to all of their insurance agents and to talk to their \nsecurities dealers and companies. Following that, we will have a \nmarkup.\n  He said: On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday we will have hearings, \nthe draft will be available on Friday, and Tuesday we will do a markup. \nWe did have the hearings on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The draft \nwasn't available until Monday so we did not do the markup until \nThursday. That has to be some classic action on a bill.\n  It was not just a matter of taking the bill from last year, it was a \nmatter of simplifying that. He insisted that since we had language in \nthere that was to simplify banking language and to force the banks to \noperate in plain language, it was only fair that we do that too. It \nchanged the bill from a 308-page bill to a 150-page bill.\n  We have had the opportunity to debate that. There are still some \nthings to be worked out. I look forward to the conference committee. \nEven if I am not on it I will observe it, because I am sure it will be \neducational. With the intellect of the chairman and the ranking member, \nit will be a fascinating study and well worth watching. It is one that \neverybody who is hoping the playing field gets leveled and specified \nwill be holding their breath about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4881-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE OCEANS ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the closing of the United States Army School of the \nAmericas, located at Fort Benning, Georgia. I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 873, a bill to close this troubled school once \nand for\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\nall, which was introduced recently by the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin.\n  The School of the Americas (SOA) was created in 1946 to train Latin \nAmerican military officers in combat and counterinsurgency skills with \nthe goal of professionalizing Latin American armies and strengthening \ndemocracies. Originally located in Panama, SOA moved to Fort Benning in \n1984. There has been a great deal of controversy surrounding some of \nSOA's alumni, leading it to be called ``the School for Dictators.'' \nSome of SOA's notorious graduates include Manuel Noriega, Argentinian \ndictator Leopoldo Galtieri, at least 19 Salvadorean officers implicated \nby El Salvador's Truth Commission in the murder of six Jesuit priests, \nand two of the three officers prosecuted in Guatemala for their roles \nin the murder of anthropologist Myrna Mack.\n  In 1991, following an internal investigation, the Pentagon removed \ncertain SOA training manuals from circulation. On September 22, 1996, \nthe Pentagon released the full text of those training manuals and \nacknowledged that some of those manuals provided instruction in \ntechniques that, in the Pentagon's words, were ``clearly objectionable \nand possibly illegal.'' The ``techniques'' in question included such \nawful activities as torture, extortion, false arrest, and execution.\n  Not only are the human costs of this training program unjustifiable, \nbut so are its financial costs. When I first ran for this body in 1992, \nI included the School of the Americas as an item on my 82+ point plan \nfor deficit reduction. With a national debt in excess of $5 trillion, \nwe must carefully scrutinize every program to ensure that federal tax \ndollars are wisely spent. We certainly do not need to spend taxpayer \ndollars on this kind of activity.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1993, I have been contacted by hundreds \nof Wisconsinites who support closing the School of the Americas. Just \nthis week, a number of Wisconsin residents joined scores of individuals \nfrom around the country at a protest here in Washington, D.C., against \nthe continued operation of the school. The group from my home state \nincluded students, human rights activists, and members of several \nreligious communities. I am pleased that so many Wisconsin residents \nare committed to working toward the closing of this school.\n  Numerous organizations, including Public Citizen, the Washington \nOffice on Latin America and Human Rights Watch also support the \nelimination of SOA.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am \ncommitted to promoting human rights throughout the world. In my view, \nour government cannot continue to support the existence of a school \nthat counts so many murderers among its alumni. While it may be \nappropriate for the United States military to train its colleagues from \nother nations, it is inexcusable that this training should take place \nat an institution with a reputation as far beyond salvage as that of \nthe School of the Americas. This legislation gives members of this body \nthe opportunity to separate the legitimate training exercises conducted \nby the United States military from the sordid acts of many individuals \nwho have been trained at SOA. We must lift the cloud of suspicion that \nhas fallen on these programs by closing SOA.\n  I am pleased that S. 873 includes language expressing the sense of \nthe Congress that all foreign military training conducted by the United \nStates should stress respect for human rights, the proper role of the \nmilitary in a democratic society, and accountability and transparency \nin defense and security policy. This is an excellent opportunity for \nthe Congress, which has oversight responsibilities for military \ntraining programs, to reiterate the importance of these basic \nprinciples to the Administration, the American people, and perspective \ncandidates for military training from other countries.\n  The bill also calls on the Department of Defense to vigorously screen \nall candidates for military training programs to ensure that they have \nnot been implicated in human rights abuses, corruption, or drug \ntrafficking.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 873 and close the ``School for \nDictators'' once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4882-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SBP BENEFIT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to join my Senate \ncolleagues in supporting the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) Benefit \nImprovement Act of 1999. This bill corrects a discrepancy between what \nCongress intended at the creation of this Act in 1972, and how it \neventually got implemented.\n  I have always believed that the people most affected by military \nservice are not the service members, it is the family. The spouses that \nraise kids on their own during a deployment. The sons and daughters \nthat change schools in the middle of a school year because a parent got \nassigned to a new base. It's hard to make up for missed soccer games \nand scout meetings. The Senate has already passed legislation to try to \nimprove some of these areas of quality of life, but S.4 was passed \nabsent one item that I feel is very important, especially to our \nelderly military retirees living in Montana.\n  The uniformed services spousal benefit annuity provides 55 percent of \nretirement pay for a surviving military spouse, as long as the spouse \nis under age 62. Once the survivor reaches age 62, the benefit drops as \nlow as 35 percent of retired pay. Let me put it on a more familiar \nlevel. If a Korean War-era Marine had signed up for this plan after his \n20 years of military service, when he passed on, his wife would only \nget 35 percent of his eligible retirement pay, instead of the 55 \npercent she would have received if she was under age 62. No other \nfederal retirement plan has this age-oriented cut. It was also intended \nfor Congress to pay 40 percent of the benefit, and premiums for the \nplan were set up with that target in mind. Unfortunately, the actuaries \nwere too pessimistic, and as a result, premiums now pay for 73 percent \nof the cost, with congress paying for 27 percent. This is a far cry \nfrom the 40 percent we originally intended. Other federal civilian \nsurvivor benefit plans pay up to a 50 percent subsidy with no reduction \nafter age 62.\n  This bill corrects the problem by stepping up the federal share of \nmilitary retirement to 45 percent by FY 2005. Given the sacrifices by \nour service men and women and their families, it's time we provided \nfair survivors benefits and fulfill our original Congressional intent.\n  I'm grateful to Senator Thurmond for introducing this legislation to \ncorrect this discrepancy and for letting me vocalize my support for \nthis bill by including me as a co-sponsor. I'm confident that the Armed \nServices Subcommittee will give this a favorable review, and I look \nforward to supporting it when it comes to the floor. I encourage my \ncolleagues to lend their support to this important provision as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4882-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4882-S4884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FUNDING OF ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the combination of Medicare payment cuts \nand the growth of managed care has become a devastating one-two punch \nagainst many of the nation's most respected academic health centers. A \nfront-page article in today's New York Times documents what is \nhappening. Teaching hospitals across the country are losing money and \nfacing the prospect of cutting back the research, the teaching and \ntraining, and the advanced medical care that have made American \nmedicine the envy of the world. These centers are also major safety-net \ninstitutions that provide extensive care for the uninsured.\n  Every American depends for quality health care on doctors trained in \nthe nation's teaching hospitals. Research conducted at these hospitals \nis the basis for much of the astounding progress that we are making in \nmedical science, and these institutions are indispensable in bringing \nadvances in the laboratory to the bedside of the patient. For the most \nserious and intractable illnesses, teaching hospitals are the \ncaregivers of last resort. They have the newest and most sophisticated \nequipment. The physicians who practice there are on the cutting edge of \nnew treatments, and they see the largest number of such cases.\n  It would be an American tragedy if, as a result of short-sighted \nMedicare payment policies and equally short-sighted pressures for HMO \nprofits, academic health centers are forced to\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\nclose their doors or to curtail the research, training, and advanced \ncare that make them such indispensable components of modern American \nhealth care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article be printed in \nthe Record, and I urge my colleagues to review it carefully. It is \nbecoming increasingly clear that this Congress has an obligation to act \nbefore irreparable damage is done to these essential institutions.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Teaching Hospitals Battling Cutbacks in Medicare Money\n\n                          (By Carey Goldberg)\n\n       Boston, May 5--Normally, the great teaching hospitals of \n     this medical Mecca carry an air of white-coasted, best-in-\n     the-world arrogance, the kind of arrogance that comes of \n     collecting Nobels, of snaring more Federal money for medical \n     research than hospitals anywhere else, of attracting patients \n     from the four corners of the earth.\n       But not lately. Lately, their chief executives carry an air \n     of pleading and alarm. They tend to cross the edges of their \n     palms in an X that symbolizes the crossing of rising costs \n     and dropping payments, especially Medicare payments. And to \n     say they simply cannot go on losing money this way and remain \n     the academic cream of American medicine.\n       Dr. Mitchell T. Rabkin, chief executive emeritus of Beth \n     Israel Hospital, says, ``Everyone's in deep yogurt.''\n       The teaching hospitals here and elsewhere have never been \n     immune from the turbulent change sweeping American health \n     care--from the expansion of managed care to spiraling drug \n     prices to the fierce fights for survival and shotgun \n     marriages between hospitals with empty beds and flabby \n     management.\n       But they are contending that suddenly, in recent weeks, a \n     Federal cutback in Medicare spending has begun putting such a \n     financial squeeze on them that it threatens their ability to \n     fulfill their special missions: to handle the sickest \n     patients, to act as incubators for new cures, to treat poor \n     people and to train budding doctors.\n       The budget hemorrhaging has hit at scattered teaching \n     hospitals across the country, from San Francisco to \n     Philadelphia. New York's clusters of teaching hospitals are \n     among the biggest and hardest hit, the Greater New York \n     Hospital Association says. It predicts that Medicare cuts \n     will cost the state's hospitals $5 billion through 2002 and \n     force the closing of money-losing departments and whole \n     hospitals.\n       Dr. Samuel O. Thier, president of the group that owns \n     Massachusetts General Hospital, says, ``We've got a problem, \n     and you've got to nip it in the bud, or else you're going to \n     kill off some of the premier institutions in the country.''\n       Here in Boston, with its unusual concentration of academic \n     medicine and its teaching hospitals affiliated with the \n     medical schools of Harvard, Tufts and Boston Universities, \n     the cuts are already taking a toll in hundreds of eliminated \n     jobs and pockets of miserable morale.\n       Five of Boston's top eight private employers are teaching \n     hospitals, Mayor Thomas M. Menino notes. And if five-year \n     Medicare cuts totaling an estimated $1.7 billion for \n     Massachusetts hospitals continue, Mayor Menino says, ``We'll \n     have to lay off thousands of people, and that's a big hit on \n     the city of Boston.''\n       Often, analysts say, hospital cutbacks, closings and \n     mergers make good economic sense, and some dislocation and \n     pain are only to be expected, for all the hospitals' tendency \n     to moan about them. Some critics say the hospitals are partly \n     to fault, that for all their glittery research and \n     credentials, they have not always been efficiently managed.\n       ``A lot of teaching hospitals have engaged in what might be \n     called self-sanctification--`We're the greatest hospitals in \n     the world and no one can do it better or for less'--and that \n     may or may not be true,'' said Alan Sager, a health-care \n     finance expert at the Boston University School of Public \n     Health.\n       But the hospital chiefs argue that they have virtually no \n     fat left to cut, and warn that their financial problems may \n     mean that the smartest edge of American medicine will get \n     dumbed down.\n       With that message, they have been lobbying Congress in \n     recent weeks to reconsider the cuts that they say have turned \n     their financial straits from tough to intolerable.\n       ``Five years from now, the American people will wake up and \n     find their clinical research is second rate because the big \n     teaching hospitals are reeling financially,'' said Dr. David \n     G. Nathan, president of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute \n     here.\n       In a half-dozen interviews, around the Boston medical-\n     industrial complex known as the Longwood Medical Center and \n     Academic Area and elsewhere, hospital executives who normally \n     compete and squabble all espoused one central idea: teaching \n     hospitals are special, and that specialness costs money.\n       Take the example of treating heart-disease patients, said \n     Dr. Michael F. Collins, president and chief executive of \n     Caritas Christi Health Care System, a seven-hospital group \n     affiliated with Tufts.\n       In 1988, Dr. Collins said, it was still experimental for \n     doctors to open blocked arteries by passing tiny balloons \n     through them; now, they have a bouquet of expensive new \n     options for those patients, including springlike devices \n     called stents that cost $900 to $1,850 each; tiny rotobladers \n     that can cost up to $1,500 and costly drugs to supplement the \n     reaming that cost nearly $1,400 a patient.\n       ``A lot of our scientists are doing research on which are \n     the best catheters and which are the best stents,'' Dr. \n     Collins said. ``And because they're giving the papers on the \n     drug, they're using the drug the day it's approved to be \n     used. Right now it's costing us about $50,000 a month and \n     we're not getting a nickel for it, because our case rates are \n     fixed.''\n       Hospital chiefs and doctors also argue that a teaching \n     hospital and its affiliated university are a delicate \n     ecosystem whose production of critical research is at risk.\n       ``The grand institutions in Boston that are venerated are \n     characterized by a wildflower approach to invention and the \n     generation of new knowledge,'' said Dr. James Reinertsen, the \n     chief executive of Caregroup, which owns Beth Israel \n     Deaconess Medical Center. ``We don't run our institutions \n     like agribusiness, a massively efficient operation where we \n     direct research and harvest it. It's unplanned to a great \n     extent, and that chaotic fermenting environment is part of \n     what makes the academic health centers what they are.''\n       ``There wouldn't have been a plan to do what Judah Folkman \n     has done over the last 20 years,'' Dr. Reinertsen said of the \n     doctor-scientist at Children's Hospital in Boston who has \n     developed a promising approach to curing cancer.\n       Federal financing for research is plentiful of late, \n     hospital heads acknowledge. But they point out that the \n     Government expects hospitals to subsidize 10 percent of 15 \n     percent of that research, and that they must also provide \n     important support for researchers still too junior to win \n     grants.\n       A similar argument for slack in the system comes in \n     connection with teaching. Teaching hospitals are pressing \n     their faculties to take on more patients to bring in more \n     money, said Dr. Daniel D. Federman, dean for medical \n     education of Harvard Medical School. A doctor under pressure \n     to spend time in a billable way, Dr. Federman said, has less \n     time to spend teaching.\n       The Boston teaching hospitals generally deny that the money \n     squeeze is affecting patients' care, (a denial some patients \n     would question,) or students' quality of medical education (a \n     denial some students would question,) or research--yet.\n       The Boston hospitals' plight may be partly their fault for \n     competing so hard with each other, driving down prices, some \n     analysts say. Though some hospitals have merged in recent \n     years, Boston is still seen as having too many beds, and \n     virtually all hospitals are teaching hospitals here.\n       Whatever the causes, said Dr. Stuart Altman, professor of \n     national health policy at Brandeis University and past \n     chairman for 12 years of the committee that advised the \n     Government on Medicare prices, ``the concern is very real.''\n       ``What's happened to them is that all of the cards have \n     fallen the wrong way at the same time,'' Dr. Altman said. ``I \n     believe their screams of woe are legitimate.''\n       Among the cards that fell wrong, begin with managed care. \n     Massachusetts has an unusually large quotient of patients in \n     managed-care plans. Managed-care companies, themselves \n     strapped, have gotten increasingly tough about how much they \n     will pay.\n       Boston had already gone through a spate of fat-trimming \n     hospital mergers, closings and cost cutting in recent years. \n     Add to the troubles some complaints that affect all \n     hospitals: expenses to prepare their computers for 2000, \n     problems getting insurance companies and the Government to \n     pay up, new efforts to defend against accusations of billing \n     fraud.\n       But the back-breaking straw, hospital chiefs says, came \n     with Medicare cuts, enacted under the 1997 balanced-budget \n     law, that will cut more each year through 2002. The \n     Association of American Medical colleges estimates that by \n     then the losses for teaching hospitals could reach $14.7 \n     billion, and that major teaching hospitals will lose about \n     $150 million each. Nearly 100 teaching hospitals are expected \n     to be running in the red by then, the association said last \n     month.\n       For years, teaching hospitals have been more dependent than \n     any others on Medicare. Unlike some other payers, Medicare \n     has compensated them for their special missions--training, \n     sicker patients, indigent care--by paying them extra.\n       For reasons yet to be determined, Dr. Altman and others say \n     the Medicare cuts seem to be taking an even greater toll on \n     the teaching hospitals than had been expected. Much has \n     changed since the 1996 numbers on which the cuts are based, \n     hospital chiefs say; and the cuts particularly singled out \n     teaching hospitals, whose profit margins used to look fat.\n       Frightening the hospitals still further, President \n     Clinton's next budget proposes even more Medicare cuts.\n       Not everyone sympathizes, though. Complaints from hospitals \n     that financial pinching hurts have become familiar refrains \n     over recent years, gaining them a reputation for crying wolf. \n     Critics say the Boston hospitals are whining for more money \n     when the only real fix is broad health-care reform.\n       Some propose that the rational solution is to analyze which \n     aspects of the teaching hospitals' work society is willing to \n     pay for, and\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\n     then abandon the Byzantine Medicare cross-subsidies and pay \n     for them straight out, perhaps through a new tax.\n       Others question the numbers.\n       Whenever hospitals face cuts, Alan Sager of Boston \n     University said, ``they claim it will be teaching and \n     research and free care of the uninsured that are cut first.''\n       If the hospitals want more money, Mr. Sager argued, they \n     should allow in independent auditors to check their books \n     rather than asking Congress to rely on a ``scream test.''\n       For many doctors at the teaching hospitals, however, the \n     screaming is preventive medicine, meant to save their \n     institutions from becoming ordinary.\n       Medical care is an applied science, said Dr. Allan Ropper, \n     chief of neurology at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, and strong \n     teaching hospitals, with their cadres of doctors willing to \n     spend often-unreimbursed time on teaching and research, are \n     essential to helping move it forward.\n       ``There's no getting away from a patient and their \n     illness,'' Dr. Ropper said, ``but if all you do is fix the \n     watch, nobody ever builds a better watch. It's a very subtle \n     thing, but precisely because it's so subtle, it's very easy \n     to disrupt.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4884-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4884-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS PAYMENTS TO CUBA--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 24\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 1705(e)(6) of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, \n22 U.S.C. 6004(e)(6), as amended by section 102(g) of the Cuban Liberty \nand Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996, Public Law 104-114, \n110 Stat. 785, I transmit herewith a 6-month periodic report on \ntelecommunications payments made to Cuba pursuant to Department of the \nTreasury specific licenses.\n                                                  William J.

In 1996, the year covered by this report, more than 23.2 \nmillion small business tax returns were filed. A record 842,000 new \nsmall employes opened their doors and new incorporations hit a record \nhigh for the third straight year. Corporate profits, employment \ncompensation, and proprietorship earnings all increased significantly. \nIndustries dominated by small firms created an estimated 64 percent of \nthe 2.5 million new jobs.\n  Small businesses represent the individual economic efforts of our \nNation's citizens. They are the foundation of the Nation's economic \ngrowth: virtually all of the new jobs, 53 percent of employment, 51 \npercent of private sector output, and a disproportionate share of \ninnovations come from small firms. Small businesses are avenues of \nopportunity for women and minorities, first employers and trainers of \nthe young, important employers of elderly workers, and those formerly \non public assistance. The freedom of America's small businesses to \nexperiment, create, and expand makes them powerhouses in our economic \nsystem.\n\n\n                   an unprecedented record of success\n\n  Looking back to the 1986 White House Conference on Small Business, \none of the top priorities on the small business agenda was deficit \nreduction. Small business capital formation efforts had been undermined \nby interest rates driven sky-high by the demand for funds to service \nthe growing national debt. Today I'm proud to say we've done what was \nthought nearly impossible then. This year we have converted the deficit \nto a surplus--and the budget deficit is no longer the issue it once \nwas.\n  And my Administration is committed to continuing the dramatic growth \nof the small business sector. We continue to pay close attention to the \nperspectives and recommendations of America's small business owners. \nThe 1995 White House Conference on Small Business sent a list of 60 \nrecommendations to my Administration and the Congress--the result of a \nyear-long series of conferences and a national meeting on the concerns \nof small firms. In their 1995 recommendations, the small business \ndelegates told us they need less onerous regulation, estate tax relief \nfor family-owned businesses, and still more access to capital to start \nand expand their businesses.\n  On each of these fronts, and on many others, impressive steps have \nbeen taken. I have signed 11 new laws that address many of the \ndelegates' concerns. In fact, meaningful action has been taken on fully \n86 percent of the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business \nrecommendations.\n\n\n                         easing the tax burden\n\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act, which I signed in 1997, includes wins for \nsmall businesses and the American economy in the form of landmark tax \nreform legislation. The law will provide an estimated $20 billion in \ntax relief to small business over the next 10 years. It extends for \nthree years the exclusion from taxable income of money spent by an \nemployer on education for an employee. The unified gift and estate tax \ncredit will increase the amount excluded from taxation on a transferred \nestate to $1.3 million for small family-owned businesses.\n  The new law expands the definition of a home office for the purpose \nof deducting expenses to include any home office that is the business' \nsole office and used regularly for essential administrative or \nmanagement activities.\n  And capital gains taxes are reduced from 28 percent to 20 percent. \nThis will help small businesses by encouraging investments in \nbusinesses that reinvest for growth rather than investments in \ncompanies that pay heavy dividends. The law also improves the targeted \ncapital gains provisions relating specifically to small business \nstocks. Moreover, small corporations are exempted under the new law \nfrom alternative minimum tax calculations. This provision saves about 2 \nmillion businesses from complex and unnecessary paperwork.\n\n\n                   capital for small business growth\n\n  One of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) highest priorities \nis to increase small business access to capital and transform the SBA \ninto a 21st century leading-edge financial institution. The SBA's \ncredit programs--including the 7(a) business loan guarantee program, \nthe Section 504 economic development loan program, the microloan \nprogram, the small business investment company program, the disaster \nloan and surety bond programs--provide valuable and varied financial \nassistance to small businesses of all types. The Small Business Lending \nEnhancement Act of 1995 increased the availability of funds for SBA's \nlending programs. In the 7(a) program in fiscal year 1997 alone, with \napproximately 8,000 bank and nonbank lenders approved to participate, \n45,288 loan guarantees valued at $9.5 billion was approved as of \nSeptember 1997.\n  My Administration developed community reinvestment initiatives that \nrevised bank regulatory policies to encourage lending to smaller firms. \nWhen combined with lower interest rates, this led to a sizable increase \nin commercial and industrial lending, particularly to small businesses. \nAnd in the first year of implementation under the Community \nReinvestment Credit Act, new data were collected on small business \nloans by commercial banks. The SBA's Office of Advocacy has been \nstudying and publishing its results on the small business lending \nactivities of the Nation's banks.\n  And the Office of Advocacy launched a nationwide Internet-based \nlisting\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\nservice--the Angel Capital Electronic Network (ACE-Net) to encourage \nequity investment in small firms. ACE-Net provides information to angel \ninvestors on small dynamic businesses seeking $250,000 to $3 million in \nequity financing.\n\n\n                    Reforming the Regulatory Process\n\n  The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), \nfully implemented in 1997, gives small businesses a stronger voice \nwhere it's needed--early in the Federal regulatory development process. \nThe law provides for regulatory compliance assistance from every \nFederal agency and legal remedies where agencies have failed to address \nsmall business concerns in the rulemaking process.\n  The new process is working. Agencies and businesses are working in \npartnership to ensure that small business input is a part of the \nrulemaking process. In the summer of 1997, for example, the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, in conjunction with the \nSBA's Office of Advocacy, convened four regional meetings with small \nfirms to discuss a safety and health program under development.\n  Small firms are also witnessing more agency compliance assistance \nonce regulations are in effect. Agencies are routinely providing \ncompliance guides and lists of telephone numbers and e-mail addresses \nfor small business assistance.\n  And the law provides for a national ombudsman and 10 regional \nregulatory fairness boards to make it simple for small businesses to \nshare their ideas, experiences, and concerns about the regulatory \nenforcement environment. The ombudsman boards are addressing many \nconcerns expressed by the small firms in dealing with regulating \nagencies.\n\n\n                  Expanding Technology and Innovation\n\n  Initiatives like the Small Business Innovation Research Program, the \nSmall Business Technology Transfer Program, and the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology's Manufacturing Extension Partnership and \nAdvanced Technology Program were put in place in the 1980s to channel \nmore Federal funding to small business research and to help small \nbusinesses move ideas from the drawing board to the marketplace. \nClearly, progress has been made; much remains to be done. New Internet-\nbased initiatives like the Access to Capital Electronic Network and the \nU.S. Business Advisor are designed to help many more small businesses \nmade the connections they need to commercialize their innovative \ntechnologies.\n\n\n  Enhancing International Trade and Federal Procurement Opportunities\n\n  During my Administration, our Nation has led the way in opening new \nmarkets, with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to \nU.S.-made products. Measures aimed at helping small firms expand into \nthe global market have included an overhaul of the Government's export \ncontrols and reinvention of export assistance. These changes have \ncleared a path for small businesses to enter the international economy.\n  To make certain that small companies can do business with the \nGovernment, my Administration and the Congrees, my Administration and \nthe Congress have streamlined the Federal Acquisition Reform Act of \n1996. The changes instituted in these reforms are cost-effective for \nthe Government and are intended to enable businesses to compete more \neffectively for Government contracts worth billions of dollars.\n  I am pleased that the SBA has instituted a new electronic gateway to \nprocurement information, the Procurement Marketing and Access Network, \nor Pro-Net. This database on small, minority-owned, and women-owned \nbusinesses will serve as a search engine for contracting officers, a \nmarketing tool for small fims, and a link to procurement opportunities.\n\n\n                            the human factor\n\n  My Administration is moving to anticipate 21st century demands on our \nmost important resource--our people. As a recent report by the SBA's \nOffice of Advocacy points out, small businesses employed more people on \npublic assistance in 1996 than did large businesses. Our welfare to \nWork Partnership has already had positive results--we've moved two \nmillion Americans off welfare two full years ahead of schedule. And we \nare enlisting the help of more and more small business people to expand \nthat record of success.\n\n  We want to educate and train a work force that will meet all our \nfuture global competition. For those in the work force or moving into \nit, I recently signed legislation that consolidated the tangle of \ntraining programs into a single grant program so that people can move \nquickly on their own to better jobs and more secure futures. The \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 encourages employers to provide training \nfor their employees by excluding income spent on such training from \ntaxation. The SBA has also increased training opportunities for \nbusinesses by funding new export assistance centers and women's \nbusiness centers across the country.\n  Women have been starting their own businesses at a dramatic rate in \nrecent years. More than 6 million women-owned proprietorships were in \noperation in 1994, a phenomenal 139 percent increase over the 2.5 \nmillion that existed in 1980. But it is also women who are most \naffected by the lack of adequate child care. The SBA's Office of \nAdvocacy has found that while small firms value the benefits of child \ncare as much as large businesses, small businesses have been less \nlikely to offer this benefit than large firms for a variety of reasons \nrelated to cost. The bottom line is that we've got to raise the quality \nof child care and make it more affordable for families. I have proposed \ntax credits for businesses that provide child care and a larger child \ncare tax credit for working families.\n  I am pleased that so many Americans of all races and nationalities \nare asserting their economic power by starting small businesses. This \nreport documents the growth: the number of businesses owned by \nminorities increased from 1.2 million to almost 2 million in the 5-year \nperiod from 1987 to 1992. The Federal Government has a role in widening \nthe circle of economic opportunity. Programs are in place to ensure \nthat socially and economically disadvantaged businesses have a fair \nchance in the Federal procurement marketplace. The share of Federal \ncontract dollars won by minority-owned firms has remained at 5.5 \npercent for two years running--up from less than 2 percent in 1980. And \nrecently the SBA and the Vice President announced new small business \nlending initiatives directed to the Hispanic and African American small \nbusiness communities to give these Americans better access to the \ncapital they need.\n  We have been working for the past 5 years to bring the spark of \nenterprise to inner city and poor rural areas through community \ndevelopment banks, commercial loans in poor neighborhoods, and the \ncleanup of polluted sites for development. The empowerment zone and \nenterprise community program offers significant tax incentives for \nfirms within the zones, including a 20 percent wage credit and another \n$20,000 in expensing and tax-exempt facility bonds. Under the \nleadership of the Vice President, we want to increase the number of \nempowerment zones to give more businesses incentives to move into these \nareas.\n\n\n                           future challenges\n\n  America's small business community is both the symbol and the \nembodiment of our economic freedom. That is why my Administration has \nmade concerted efforts to expand small business access to capital, \nreform the system of Government regulations to make it more equitable \nfor small companies, and expand small business access to new and \ngrowing markets.\n  This is an important report because it annually reflects our current \nknowledge about the dynamic small business economy. Clearly, much is \nyet to be learned: existing statistics are not yet current enough to \nanswer all the questions about how small, minority-owned, and women-\nowned businesses are faring in obtaining capital, providing benefits, \nand responding to regional growth or downsizing. I continue to \nencourage cooperative Government efforts to gather and analyze data \nthat is useful for Federal policymaking.\n  I am proud that my Administration is on the leading edge in working \nas a partner with the small business community. Our economic future \ndeserves no less. The job of my Administration, and its pledge to small \nbusiness owners, is to listen, to find out what works and to ensure a \nhealthy environment for small business growth.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \ngrant programs for youth substance abuse treatment services; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               Teen Substance Abuse Treatment Act of 1999\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Teen \nSubstance Abuse Treatment Act of 1999. This legislation fills an \nimportant gap in our national strategy for combating substance abuse in \nour communities. Specifically, this bill creates a dedicated funding \ncommitment for treating youth with alcohol and drug problems.\n  We have made important progress in impacting the number of our youth \nusing alcohol and drugs. However, studies reveal that alcohol is still \nthe drug of choice for many Americans--and our youth are no exception. \nStudies reveal that fifty-two percent of senior high school students \nreport using alcohol in the past month and 25% are using drugs on a \nmonthly basis.\n  Each year, 400,000 teens and their families will seek substance abuse \ntreatment but find that it is either unavailable or unaffordable. Some \nteens in need of treatment may have incomes too high to receive \nMedicaid, but too low to afford private insurance or to pay for \ntreatment out of pocket. Those who do have private insurance through a \nmanaged care plan may find that length of treatment is severely \nrestricted. At best, 20% of adolescents with severe alcohol and drug \ntreatment problems who ask for help will receive any form of treatment.\n  Those teens who are fortunate enough to get treatment often find that \navailable services do not adequately address their needs. The physical, \nhormonal, developmental, and emotional changes of the adolescent years \npose challenges to health care providers, many of whom have not been \ntrained to deal specifically with this population. Providing teens with \naccess to research-based, developmentally and age-appropriate treatment \nwhich will address their specific needs can increase their rates of \nrecovery and better prevent relapses.\n  Without intervention teen substance abusers may also engage in other \nrisky behaviors. Teen alcohol and drug abuse may spiral into academic \nfailure and involvement with the juvenile justice system. Juvenile \ncourts report that in over 50 percent of their cases substance abuse is \na contributing factor. In a survey of teens receiving substance abuse \ntreatment, 59% had been arrested at least once and 16% had been \narrested for felonies. In addition, teens who use alcohol are more \nlikely to become sexually active at earlier ages and to engage in \nunsafe sex, increasing the chances of unplanned pregnancies and \nsexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS.\n  We also know that substance abuse is associated with aggressive, \nanti-social, and violent behaviors and that chemical dependency can \nmagnify existing behavioral problems. The facts are alarming: children \nwho abuse alcohol and drugs are at a greater risk for killing \nthemselves or others. Alcohol-related traffic crashes are the leading \ncause of teen death, and alcohol is also involved in homicides and \nsuicides, the second and third leading causes of teen deaths \nrespectively.\n  Alcohol and drug use has a huge price tag both for families and \nsociety at large--and we can't afford to sit idly by while it continues \nto rise. Seven thousand youth in my state of Connecticut alone are in \nneed of treatment. That is why I am introducing the Teen Substance \nAbuse Treatment Act. This legislation will provide grants to give youth \nsubstance abusers access to effective alcohol and drug treatment \nservices that are developmentally and culturally appropriate. \nSpecifically, this bill will address the particular issues of youth \ninvolved with the juvenile justice system and those with mental health \nor other special needs. Finally, this legislation will contribute to \nthe development of treatment models that address the relationship \nbetween substance abuse and aggressive, anti-social, and violent \nbehaviors.\n  While I am disappointed that this bill is not currently included in \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Reauthorization \nlegislation that will be introduced today, I am encouraged that Senator \nFrist has agreed to work with me, Senator Reed, and Senator Bingaman \nprior to a markup of the bill to craft legislation to comprehensively \naddress the substance abuse needs of adolescents.\n  The Teen Substance Abuse Treatment Act of 1999 expresses a commitment \nto ensuring that no child who asks for help with a substance abuse \nproblem will be denied treatment. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 971. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and \nextend the grant program for services for children of substance \nabusers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n     Services for Children of Substance Abusers Reauthorization Act\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Jeffords in \nintroducing the Children of Substance Abusers Reauthorization Act'' \n(COSA). This legislation represents a vital step in expanding and \nimproving early intervention, prevention, and treatment services for \nfamilies confronting substance abuse. In addition, this legislation \naddresses the devastation generated in the wake of parental substance \nabuse--the physical and emotional difficulties faced by children of \nsubstance abusers, abuse and neglect, and adolescent substance abuse \nand violence.\n\n  Children with substance abusing parents face serious health risks, \nincluding congenital birth defects and psychological, emotional, and \ndevelopmental problems. For example, fetal exposure to alcohol puts a \nchild in danger of fetal alcohol syndrome and other congenital birth \ndefects. In addition, each year around 500,000 babies are born \nprenatally exposed to some form of addictive substance including crack, \nalcohol, and tobacco, compromising their long-term ability to thrive \nand to learn.\n  We also know that substance abuse plays a major role in child abuse \nand\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\nneglect--irreparably damaging family bonds and threatening to further \nstrain an already over-burdened child welfare system. In fact, over the \npast 10 years, fueled by parental substance abuse, the number of abused \nand neglected children has more than doubled from 1.4 million in 1986 \nto more than 3 million in 1997, a rise more than eight times greater \nthan the increase in the child population. The disturbing link between \nparental substance abuse and child abuse is irrefutable. It is \nestimated that children whose parents abuse drugs and/or alcohol are \nthree times more likely to be abused and four times more likely to be \nneglected than children whose parents are not substance abusers. In a \n1998 report, the General Accounting Office estimated that two-thirds of \nall children in foster-care had substance abusing mothers and that 80% \nof those mothers had been using drugs or alcohol for at least five \nyears--many of them for ten years or more.\n  Alcohol and drug use exact a huge price tag on both children and \nsociety at large. Estimates are that parental substance abuse costs the \nnation approximately $20 billion a year. Of that amount, the federal \ngovernment pays 44%, states 44%, and local governments 12% of the cost. \nWe also know that the toll that substance abuse takes on families is \nimmeasurable. Parents sacrifice the joys of watching their children \ngrow and thrive and their children lose the opportunity to learn and \ngrow in a safe, supportive home.\n  In Connecticut alone, there are an estimated 12-15,000 children of \nsubstance abusers who are in desperate need of integrated, specialized \nsupport services. To assist those families and the thousands of others \nacross this nation battling substance abuse, this legislation seeks a \nbroad-based commitment from schools, social service agencies, health \nproviders, community centers, and the other entities serving families \nto join together to promote aggressive outreach, prevention and \ntreatment services. Because parental substance abuse impacts so many \naspects of children's lives, this legislation would also provide \ncomprehensive, family-centered services addressing health, mental \nhealth, violence, child abuse and neglect, HIV and family planning \nservices, child care, and transportation. In addition, COSA will \nstrengthen the systems which provide these services by funding the \neducation and training of providers.\n  COSA represents a bipartisan commitment to lessen the terrible toll \nthat substance abuse takes on families. I am grateful for Senator \nJeffords' co-sponsorship and am pleased that Senator Frist and the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee have agreed to include \nCOSA within the larger Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nReauthorization legislation that will be introduced today.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to join my colleague from \nConnecticut in introducing the Children of Substance Abusers \nReauthorization Act (COSA). Senator Dodd is to be saluted for his keen \nability to identify conditions that place families and children at risk \nand for developing innovative solutions and strategies for alleviating \nthose conditions.\n  Substance abuse affects us all. Many of us have a close friend or \nfamily member who is a substance abuser or is in recovery. Even those \nof us not familiar with the personal struggles of substance abuse are \naffected. My office just received a report from General McCaffrey at \nthe National Drug Control Policy Office that states that drugs play a \npart in virtually every major social issue in America today, be it \nhealth care, crime, mental illness, the dissolution of families, or \nchild abuse. There is no question that Americans want to do \n``something'' about substance abuse, but 78 percent of Americans think \nthat the ``War on Drugs'' has failed. So what options for combating \nsubstance abuse and addiction should policy makers explore?\n  My state of Vermont has an innovative strategy it is eager to employ. \nVermont has done its research and learned that among its school-aged \nyouth a significant portion used illicit drugs; 51% used alcohol, 32% \nused marijuana, and 5% used cocaine. Twenty-nine percent of Vermont 9th \ngraders (those are 14-15 year-olds!) used marijuana in the past month. \nAbout 49% of Vermont students in grades 8 through 12, (almost 19,000 \nyouth) were in need of substance abuse treatment or intervention in \n1996. Yet only about 10% of the youth in need of treatment or \nintervention indicated having received the services.\n  Now the really striking results. Youth in need of alcohol, drug \ntreatment, or intervention services were significantly more likely than \nthose not in need of services to report an array of other school- and \nhealth-related problems. Twice as likely to report fighting in the last \nyear; twice as likely to report being threatened or injured with a \nweapon at school in the past year; two to three times as likely to \nreport having ever had sex; six times more likely to report having ever \nhad sex with four or more people; and three to four times as likely to \nreport having been pressured or forced into having sex. The Vermont \nreport underscored clearly the challenges posed to primary care and \nsubstance abuse treatment and intervention providers in Vermont and \nindicated the wide range of services that are needed to identify and \nrespond to the multiple needs of these kids and their parents. So what \noptions for combating substance abuse and addiction should policy \nmakers explore?\n  We know that prevention is most effective when it is directed at \nimpressionable children. Just as adolescents are the most susceptible \nto the allure of illicit drugs, so too is it the most imperative to \ndelay or prevent the first use of illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco. \nCase studies from the national Centers for Substance Abuse Prevention \ndemonstrate that prevention programs work, especially when the \nprevention message is reinforced by parents, teachers, clergy, mentors \nand other role models. The options we policy makers explore must \ninclude a comprehensive strategy that provides the constellation of \nprevention services needed by children of substance abusers and their \nfamilies.\n  Vermont is ready to implement just such a strategy. Working with the \nnational Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), Vermont has \nconfirmed that it's adult based substance abuse treatment models are \nnot age appropriate, they don't work for adolescents, and they need to \nbe redeveloped specifically for youth. Problems with engagement, \nretention in treatment, and relapse have been chronic in our current \nsystem. The CSAT treatment needs assessment determined that almost 40% \nof youth leave treatment after only one session, or leave against \nmedical advice. Vermont has developed and is ready to implement a \nstrategy but it needs assistance.\n  Vermont would like to build on the demonstrated success of the \nwraparound models of youth services. Adolescents will receive expanded \ncase management, a broader array of outpatient options, easy access to \nintensive outpatient care, residential treatment, and encouragement to \nparticipate in collateral family treatment. The focus would be on ease \nof movement between levels of care, case management and integration of \ncommunity based treatment plans.\n  The bill introduced today can provide States like Vermont much needed \nassistance in these areas. COSA will provide grants to nonprofit and \npublic entities to provide a constellation of services needed by \nchildren and affected families to prevent substance abuse and stop the \ndevastation it causes. Those services can include chid care, remedial \neducation, counseling, therapeutic intervention services, job training. \nThe children of substance abusers and their families is a group that \ndesperately needs help. If we start now, we can begin to bring a close \nto the endless cycle of inter-generational drug abuse and this measure \nis the start we need to prevent further substance abuse by the next \ngeneration.\n  Mr. President, I would hope that my colleagues will not let this \nopportunity go unheeded.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 972. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to improve the \nadministration of the Lamprey River in the State of New Hampshire; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             A BILL TO AMEND THE WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS ACT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend \nthe\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\nWild and Scenic Rivers Act. This bill improves the administration of \nthe Lamprey River in the State of New Hampshire by adding a twelve-mile \nsegment to its Wild and Scenic Designation. In so doing, New Hampshire \nresidents and visitors to my state will enjoy the many benefits \nassociated with the Wild and Scenic River program, which is \nadministered by the National Park Service.\n  It has been four years since I proudly sponsored the designation of \nthe Lamprey River in Lee, Durham and Newmarket, New Hampshire into the \nNational Wild and Scenic River Program. I am greatly pleased to welcome \nthe Town of Epping into the partnership, and I am honored to offer this \nbill which will make this possible.\n  Contrary to concerns which are sometimes raised by other rivers' \ntowns, Lee, Durham and Newmarket have told me that the Wild and Scenic \nprogram has stimulated a plethora of meaningful benefits to the Lamprey \nRiver and to the residents of the towns by which it flows. I applaud \nthe extent to which this work has occurred through volunteer efforts \nand through monies solicited from towns, the State of New Hampshire and \nprivate foundations. As a result, groups like the Lamprey River \nAdvisory Committee have been able to leverage a relatively small \nfederal investment into substantial benefits.\n  Within the past month, the Board of Selectmen from the Town of \nEpping, New Hampshire, the Epping Conservation Commission, and the \nLamprey River Advisory Committee have contacted me to request that I \nintroduce this legislation which will increase the designated area from \neleven and a half to twenty-three and a half miles.\n  The Lamprey River is situated in coastal New Hampshire and is the \nlargest of the rivers that discharge into Great Bay, a designated \nNational Estuarine Research Reserve consisting of 4,500 acres of tidal \nwaters and wetlands and 800 acres of upland. Both in physical dynamics \nand biological productivity, the Great Bay estuary contributes \nimmeasurable economic value to the Northeast and clearly constitutes \none of New Hampshire's prime natural areas. The Lamprey's size alone \nmarks its importance to Great Bay. Its good water quality and intact \nriparian habitat throughout the watershed create an important link \nbetween the estuary and inland areas.\n  The Lamprey is considered New Hampshire's most significant river for \nall species of anadromous fish and it contains every type of stream and \nriver fish you could expect to find in New England. Botanical studies \nhave documented 329 species of vascular plants of which 252 are \nrestricted to wetlands and floodplain communities. In addition, \naccording to the State Architectural Historian, the Lamprey is one of \nNew Hampshire's most historic streams.\n  Perhaps what is most important about this bill is that it will help \nto assure that future generations will enjoy recreational opportunities \non this great river. Undeveloped along most of its entire length, it is \na beautiful river to be on and fish. For a quiet retreat into the woods \nthe Lamprey is superb--where one can expect quiet canoe or kayak \npaddling past densely forested banks of hemlocks and hardwoods. In \nupstream reaches, people most often use the river recreationally for \nfishing, canoeing, kayaking, and swimming in the summer. In the winter, \npeople trade in their boats and fishing poles for cross-country skis. \nThis is a truly exceptional river offering a vast variety of activities \nfor anyone who cares for the outdoors and I am pleased to offer this \nlegislation to assure that it will remain in the same condition for \ngenerations to come. I ask unanimous consent that my statement and a \ncopy of the bill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 972\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for school safety, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                 school safety enhancement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to introduce \nlegislation that I have been working on for several months and had not \nplanned to introduce until later this year when the Senate considers \nthe reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nHowever, the tragic event in Littleton has moved everyone's timetable \nforward.\n  When I was Governor of Virginia, education was my top priority. I \nmight note that I know it was a top priority for the Presiding Officer \nwhen he was Governor of Ohio. Since I have been in the Senate I have \nbecome increasingly concerned about school safety. We simply cannot \nhave good schools unless we have safe schools.\n  In 1993 I was able to get legislation enacted to create a commission \non school violence. Regrettably, that commission was never funded, but \nit should have been. Two years ago the Senate approved an amendment I \noffered to allow COPS funding to be used for school safety. Last year \nwe significantly expanded on that program, and I am grateful for the \nSenate's and the President's commitment to that important effort.\n  Over the past year, a year in which we have had too many horrible \ntragedies in our schools, we have all noticed that the most common \nquestions asked following an incident of school violence are: Why \ndidn't we see it coming? What could we have done to spot the warning \nsigns and intervene before it was too late?\n  The legislation I offer today is designed to address one essential \ncomponent of the school violence crisis: Prevention and intervention. \nIn the coming weeks the Senate will consider a variety of proposals to \naddress the issues of preventing school violence, how to manage crises \nwhen they occur, and how to punish those who engage in violence in our \nschools. I look forward to working with our colleagues to develop a \ncomprehensive approach to school violence which incorporates this \nlegislation and acknowledges the need for prevention and intervention \nefforts.\n  Out of respect for the families in Littleton and deference to the \nmajority leader's request that we not take up\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\nlegislation until next week at the earliest, I will not make extended \nremarks at this time and will defer to a later time. For now, I simply \noffer my continued prayers for those in Littleton who are still coping \nwith a tremendous loss to their community.\n  Simply going to school should not be an act of courage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 975. A bill to amend chapter 30 of title 39, United States Code, \nto provide for a uniform notification system under which individuals \nmay elect not to receive mailings relating to skill contests or \nsweepstakes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n          sweepstakes toll-free option protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sweepstakes \nToll-Free Option Protection Act of 1999, the ``STOP Act.'' I hope this \nmeasure will help put a stop to a practice I find extremely \ntroublesome: the flooding of consumers' mailboxes with unwanted and \nmisleading sweepstakes mailings.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations recently held hearings \non deceptive mailings and sweepstakes promotions. I'd like to thank \nSenators Collins and Levin for bringing this important issue to light.\n  Mr. President, during the course of these hearings, it became clear \nto me that strong measures must be taken to curb the use of misleading \nsweepstakes promotions. Too many people are getting swamped with \nsolicitations. And too many people are spending their life savings \ntrying to win prizes. The primary victims are our nation's elderly who \nare led to believe that if they purchase magazine subscriptions or \nother products, they will increase their chances of winning.\n  Well, purchases do not increase the chances of winning. But often \ntimes, what purchases actually do is increase the number of \nsolicitations sweepstakes companies send out to people, encouraging \nthem to buy even more products. With each new purchase, consumers are \nled to believe that they are coming closer and closer to winning a \nprize. The sad truth is they are not getting closer, but the cycle of \ndeception keeps going.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would require sweepstakes \ncompanies to set up a uniform toll-free telephone number that consumers \ncan call to have their names and addresses removed from all sweepstakes \nmailing lists. People will no longer have to contact each and every \nsweepstakes promoter to stop these misleading mailings.\n  My legislation is a sensible approach to helping regular people who \nwant to stop the flood of sweepstakes mailings and protect themselves \nfrom misleading solicitations. Let me tell you the story of Bobby \nBagwell to help illustrate the need for this measure.\n  One day, Pamela Bagwell went to visit her elderly father-in-law, \nBobby. When she arrived at Bobby's home, Pamela found stacks and stacks \nof solicitations from sweepstakes companies. She asked Bobby about them \nand found out that he had made numerous purchases thinking that buying \nproducts would increase his chances of winning a prize. He was so \nconvinced he would win a prize that he even invited his neighbors to \nhis house on the day that the Publishers Clearing House prize patrol \nwas supposed to deliver the grand prize check.\n  Pamela estimates that Bobby spent more than $20,000 in 10 months on \nproducts he thought would help his chance of winning. Now as I \nmentioned before, Bobby is an elderly man.\n  But this is not the worst part of this story. Bobby also has \ndementia. Pamela, who has power of attorney for Bobby, contacted \nPublishers Clearing House at least 6 times in October last year to \ndemand that the company stop sending Bobby solicitations. She even went \nso far as to send the company a doctor's certification that Bobby has \ndementia. And yet, the sweepstakes mailings continued to flood Bobby's \nmailbox. Pamela said that sometimes Bobby was receiving up to twenty \nper day, from many different companies.\n  During the hearings, I asked representatives from the four major \nsweepstakes companies, Publishers Clearing House, Time, American Family \nEnterprises and Reader's Digest, to check their records and remove \nBobby's name and address from their mailing lists. All of the companies \nagreed to do so. However, I find it unacceptable that the only recourse \nsomeone like Pamela has is to hope that a United States Senator makes \nsuch a request for her.\n  Pamela and Bobby Bagwell's situation is not unique. Since the \nhearings, my office has received numerous calls and letters, not just \nfrom North Carolinians, but from people all over the country who tell \nsimilar, disturbing stories about their experiences with sweepstakes \ncompanies. Mr. President, my proposal is a reasonable way to help them.\n  I believe that people should have the right to easily put a stop to \nthese mailings. And sweepstakes promoters should be legally required to \nhonor such a request.\n  Now let me tell you how my legislation would work.\n  First, as I have already mentioned, it requires that sweepstakes \ncompanies set up a uniform toll-free number that individuals or people \nwith power of attorney for such individuals, can call to get their name \nand address removed from all sweepstakes mailing lists. After a person \nplaces that one phone call, they will receive a removal request form to \nfill out and send in to the notification system. After the system \nreceives that form, the person's name will be removed from all \nsweepstakes mailing lists. The form will serve as written evidence that \nthe person made a request to have their name removed.\n  Second, the sweepstakes companies must include a statement in their \nmailings that people have the option of having their names removed from \nsweepstakes mailing lists and that they can initiate this process by \ncalling the specific toll-free number that has been established. The \nstatement must be clear and conspicuous, which is important in order to \neffectively alert people about their right to stop the mailings.\n  Finally, my bill requires that if an individual makes a request to \nhave their name removed from sweepstakes mailings lists, the \nsweepstakes companies must comply with this request. If the companies \ncontinue to send mailings against the wishes of the caller, each \nmailing will subject the company to a $10,000 civil penalty.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I should mention that the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons participated in the sweepstakes hearings \nand testified as to ``the severe effects'' deceptive sweepstakes \nmailings have on AARP members. AARP supports my idea of a toll-free \nuniform notification system.\n  My legislation is a common sense solution to a growing problem, and I \nam confident that it will indeed go a long way toward stopping \nharrassing, deceptive sweepstakes mailings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 975\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title V of the Public Health Service Act to \nfocus the authority of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service \nAdministration on community-based services children and adolescents, to \nenhance flexibility and accountability, to establish programs for youth \ntreatment, and to respond to crises, especially those related to \nchildren and violence; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n               youth drug and mental health services act\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a physician and father of three \nyoung boys, I am alarmed at the current level of drug use in America. \nIn April of 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy reported \nthat 74 million Americans have tried illicit drugs at least once in \ntheir lifetime. Of these, 22 million Americans have tried cocaine, 4.6 \nmillion have tried crack cocaine and 2.4 million have tried heroin. \nLast year, 23 million Americans used an illicit drug, and today there \nare 13 million Americans who are current drug users which means they \nhave used an illicit drug in the last month.\n  The rapid decline of overall drug use in America that began in the \nmid eighties, thanks in part to the efforts of Presidents Reagan and \nBush, has stagnated and leveled off.\n  It is true that cocaine use has decreased from 5.7 million users in \n1985 to its current stagnate level of around 1.5 million in 1997 and \nmarijuana use is also down from 19 million users in 1985 to around 11 \nmillion in 1997. However, before we become too satisfied, we as a \nnation must face the very troubling fact that drug and alcohol use is \ndramatically on the rise among our youth.\n  In 1992, the percentage of 10th graders that admitted to using an \nillicit drug at least once in the last 30 days according to the Office \nof National Drug Control Policy was 11 percent. By 1997 that figure had \nmore than doubled to 23 percent. Most troubling is the dramatic \nincrease in heroin use among our nation's teenage population.\n  Let us not forget about the drug of choice for our youth and \nadolescents, alcohol. Although the legal drinking age is 21 in all \nStates, the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse undertaken by \nSAMHSA reports that more than 50 percent of young adults age eighteen \nto twenty are consuming alcohol and more than 25 percent report having \nfive or more drinks at one time during the past month.\n  There are many factors for this increase in youth substance abuse but \nthe factors that I, as a father, am most concerned with is the overall \ndecline of the disapproval of drug use and the decline of the \nperception of the risk of drug use among our youth.\n  Against this alarming challenge I am pleased to introduce the ``The \nYouth Drug and Mental Health Services Act of 1999.''\n  This important and needed legislation will reauthorize the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to improve \nthis vital agency by providing greater flexibility for States and \naccountability based on performance, while at the same time placing \ncritical focus on youth and adolescent substance abuse and mental \nhealth services. Joining me in sponsoring this effort is Senator \nKennedy who, as ranking member of my Subcommittee on Public Health, has \nbeen instrumental in developing\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\nthis legislation. Joining Senator Kennedy and me as original cosponsors \nare Senators Jeffords, Dodd, DeWine, Mikulski and Collins.\n  SAMHSA, formerly known as the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health \nServices Administration (ADAMHA) was created in 1992 by the Public Law \n102-321, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act. SAMHSA's purpose is to assist \nStates in addressing the importance of reducing the incidence of \nsubstance abuse and mental illness by supporting programs for \nprevention and treatment. SAMHSA provides funds to States for alcohol \nand drug abuse prevention and treatment programs and activities, and \nmental health services through the Substance Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment (SAPT) and the Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block \nGrants.\n  SAMHSA's block grants account for 40 percent and 15 percent \nrespectively of all substance abuse and community mental health \nservices funding in the States. They are a major portion of this \nnation's response to substance abuse and mental health service needs.\n  In introducing the legislation, I have targeted six main goals which \ninclude: promote State flexibility in block grant funding; ensure \naccountability for the expenditure of Federal funds; develop and \nsupport youth and adolescent substance abuse prevention and treatment \ninitiatives; develop and support mental health initiatives that are \ndesigned to prevent and respond to incidents of teen violence; insure \nthe availability of Federal funding for emergencies; and support \nprograms targeted for the homeless to treat mental health and substance \nabuse.\n  In 1981, President Ronald Reagan revolutionized Federal support for \nmental health and substance abuse services by eliminating what were \nmany discretionary programs for which States, local governments, and \nproviders had to compete for funds. Instead he created the Alcohol, \nDrug Abuse and Mental Health Services (ADMS) Block Grant. This Block \nGrant awarded funds to States based on a formula. States were eligible \nto receive the funds as long as the Federal government was assured the \nState would comply with certain requirements. This shift to a block \ngrant gave primary responsibility for providing mental health and \nsubstance abuse services to the States--where it should be to allow our \nStates to respond to local needs.\n  Unfortunately, over the years, the Block Grant program has become \nmore prescriptive. As a result, these additional requirements place \nburdens on States and remove State flexibility, which was the main \npurpose of the Block Grant program. We need more State flexibility and \nmy bill accomplishes this by implementing a number of recommendations \nfrom the States. It repeals a requirement in the substance abuse block \ngrant that requires States to use 35 percent of their funds for alcohol \nrelated activities and 35 percent for drug related activities. The \nrequirement that States maintain a $100,000 revolving fund to support \nrecovery homes is made optional. New waivers are created for several \nother requirements in the substance abuse block grant. Application \nrequirements in the mental health block grant are minimized, and States \nwill be able to obligate their block grant funds over two years instead \nof one giving them more time to plan for and use the funds.\n  If this bill is enacted, the Governors will be able to make a one \ntime infusion of funds into the States substance abuse or mental health \ntreatment system without having to commit themselves to increases in \nfuture years when budgets might not accommodate that funding. As a \nresult of this bill, States will have more flexibility in their use of \nfunds than they have had in the past ten years.\n\n  With more flexibility, comes the need for more accountability. \nTherefore, my bill changes the way States are held accountable for \ntheir use of Federal funds. For example, under the current substance \nabuse block grant, States are required to spend a prescribed amount of \nmoney to address the needs of pregnant addicts and women with children. \nStates are held accountable as to whether they spent the prescribed \namount of funds, not on the true outcomes of whether that population is \nbeing successfully treated which is how they should be held \naccountable. The Federal government should be less concerned with \nwhether the State spent the required amount of funds and more concerned \non whether the State is being successful in reducing the number of \ninfants born addicted or HIV positive.\n  My bill sets a process in place over the next 2 years to develop a \nsystem based on performance measures to monitor States' progress. The \nreason why the bill does not implement such a system now is that the \nState treatment systems are not prepared to make that change. First, \nbecause there is no agreement on what measures to use. Second, the \ncurrent State data systems are not adequate to collect and report on \nperformance data. Very few States currently have data systems that \ncould provide the necessary data.\n  To respond to these concerns, this bill requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to submit a plan to Congress within 2 years \ndetailing the performance measures to be used in such a system that \nhave been agReed to by the States and Federal government. That plan is \nto include the data elements that States will have to collect, the \ndefinitions of the data elements and the legislative language necessary \nto implement the recommended program.\n  The bill also authorizes a grant program for the Secretary to provide \nfinancial support to States for developing the data infrastructure \nnecessary to collect and report on the performance data.\n  As I have previously discussed, the increase in youth drug and \nalcohol abuse is a problem that threatens to undermine our society. To \nincrease the focus of SAMHSA on youth substance abuse, the bill places \na new emphasis on youth in developing treatment programs.\n  Although I believe that none of our children is truly safe when it \ncomes to drugs and alcohol, there are children, because of their \nenvironment or state of mental health, that are more at risk to become \ndrug or alcohol abusers. Children of substance abusers, victims of \nphysical or sexual abuse, high school drop outs, the economically \ndisadvantaged or those with mental health problems or who have \nattempted suicide are all at risk of drug and alcohol abuse. In order \nto develop effective techniques for prevention and treatment for these \nchildren, the bill also reauthorizes a grant program to develop \neffective models for the prevention and treatment of drug and alcohol \nabuse among high risk youth.\n  During discussions regarding the increased incidence of youth \nsubstance abuse several of my colleagues on the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee have approached me to express their \nconcern and desire to develop provisions to address the problem of \nyouth substance abuse: Senator DeWine has expressed an interest in \ndeveloping provisions that would offer early intervention and \nprevention; Senator Dodd has correctly pointed out that there has been \nlittle focus thus far on developing techniques to provide effective \ntreatment for our children; Senator Reed has pointed out that over 60% \nof youth in the juvenile justice system may have substance abuse \ndisorders, compared to 22% in the general population; and Senator \nBingaman has offered his help to address the problems with youth \nsubstance abuse in rural areas, Native American communities and other \nareas that are either underserved or where there is an emerging \nsubstance abuse problem among youth.\n  We will be working over the next few weeks to incorporate the \nelements addressed above into a bipartisan proposal. In the meantime, \nthe bill creates the authority for a new program on youth treatment \nwhich will be strengthened by the bipartisan proposal when the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee takes action on the bill.\n  The issue of children of substance abusers is also addressed in this \nbill. As I have mentioned, children of substance abusers are at high \nrisk of being substance abusers themselves. The Department of Health \nand Human Services reported to Congress last month that 8.3 million, or \n11 percent, of American children live with at least one parent who is \neither an alcoholic or in need of treatment for the abuse of drugs. \nThis report also sadly confirms that between 50 to 80 percent of \nchildren in the child abuse, neglect and\n\n[[Page S4894]]\n\nfoster care systems have parents who need substance abuse treatment. To \naddress this, the bill reauthorizes the Children of Substance Abusers \nAct (COSA) and moves its authority to SAMHSA from the Health Resources \nand Services Administration (HRSA) for better coordination. Funding \nunder COSA, which was authored by Senator Dodd and enacted during the \n102nd Congress, would be used for identification and evaluation of \nfamilies experiencing substance abuse and offer treatment and \nprevention services.\n  Another area I am addressing in this bill is youth violence and \nmental health services. As we have seen by the many tragedies in our \nnation's schools, the issue of youth violence causes us much pause for \nthought. Although I believe we cannot legislate a less violent society, \nthis bill has programs which we hope will begin to address the issue of \nyouth violence and assist communities by helping them meet the mental \nhealth needs of youth to cope with violence related stress.\n  The first step the bill takes is to authorize a provision that will \nassist local communities in developing ways to assist children in \ndealing with violence, building upon the actions last year of Senators \nSpecter and Harkin in the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, \nHHS and Education. This bill will authorize SAMHSA to make grants in \nconsultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education \nto assist local communities. These grants will support activities that \ninclude: financial support to enable the communities to implement \nprograms designed to help violent youth; technical assistance to local \ncommunities; and assistance in the creation of community partnerships \namong the schools, law enforcement and mental health services. In order \nto receive funding for services under this provision an organization \nwould have to ensure that they will carry out six activities which \ninclude: security of the school; educational reform to deal with \nviolence; the review and updating of school policies to deal with \nviolence; alcohol and drug abuse prevention and early intervention; \nmental health prevention and treatment services; and early childhood \ndevelopment and psychosocial services. The funds, however, may only be \nused for prevention, early intervention, and treatment services.\n\n  In order to help youth and adolescents cope with violence and \nemergency crises, the bill establishes grants for developing knowledge \nwith regard to evidence-based practices for treating mental health \ndisorders resulting from violence related stress. In addition, the bill \nwill establish centers of excellence to provide technical assistance to \ncommunities in dealing with the emotional burden of violence if and \nwhen it occurs.\n  By law, SAMHSA discretionary grant awards must be peer reviewed which \nregularly take up to six months to approve which makes SAMHSA unable to \nact quickly in a emergency. To ensure the availability of funding for \nemergencies, the bill establishes an emergency response fund to allow \nthe federal government to address emergency substance abuse or mental \nhealth needs in local communities. For example, this funding could be \navailable to assist communities exposed to violence or terrorism or \ncommunities experiencing a serious substance abuse emergency such as \nincreased drug traffic or inhalant abuse.\n  The final theme of the bill that I would like to highlight is the \nissue of services for the homeless.\n  Individuals who are homeless face major barriers to access and \nutilize mainstream addictive and mental disorder treatment and recovery \nservices, including lack of income verification documentation, \ndifficulties in maintaining schedules, and lack of transportation. \nFurthermore, most providers are not equipped to handle the complex \nsocial and health conditions which the homeless population presents. An \ninsufficient number of mainstream providers offer the long-term, \nresidentially-based aftercare and housing services that are essential \nfor homeless individuals adherence to treatment and residential \nstability. Mainstream providers are not typically linked to the full \nrange of health, housing, and human development services that homeless \nindividuals with addictive and mental disorders require for recovery \nand residential stability.\n  In order to help address the unique challenges of serving the \nhomeless, the bill reauthorizes grants to develop and expand mental \nhealth and substance abuse treatment services for homeless individuals.\n  In addition, it reauthorizes the successful Projects for Assistance \nin Transition from Homelessness program, know as PATH. PATH is a \nformula grant program which provides funds to States to provide mental \nhealth services to homeless individuals including outreach, screening \nand treatment, habilitation and rehabilitation.\n  Mr. President, thus far I have laid out the major legislative changes \nmy colleagues and I are undertaking to improve SAMHSA programs. \nHowever, I would like to talk about the great work that is accomplished \nlocally by discussing recent efforts in my home State of Tennessee.\n  SAMHSA provides over 70 percent of overall funding for the Tennessee \nDepartment of Health's Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services, which \nis headed by Dr. Stephanie Perry.\n  Last year Tennessee received over $25 million from the Substance \nAbuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant to spend on treatment and \nprevention activities. With this funding the Tennessee Bureau of \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Services provides funding to community-based \nprograms that offer a wide range of services throughout the State.\n  In the area of prevention services, the funding allows for the \nIntensive Focus Group program which provides structured, short term \neducational and counseling programs for youth and their families. In \naddition, the State is also able to fund Regional Prevention \nCoordinators who are assigned to each region of the State to assist \ncommunities in the development, implementation and coordination of \nalcohol and drug prevention activities. One additional program, I would \nlike to highlight is the Faith Initiative which is a voluntary \ninvolvement of faith leaders to establish the role of interfaith \ncommunities in substance abuse and violence prevention.\n  In the area of treatment, where Tennessee spends 65 percent of its \ntotal substance abuse dollars, there are several different treatment \nprograms that focus on youth residential and day treatment, family \nintervention and referral services. Other offered services include \nmedical detoxification which is a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week program \nthat provides residential service for alcohol and drug abusers. \nOverall, the block grant funds permit nearly 6,500 Tennesseans to \nreceive the substance abuse treatment they desperately need.\n  I am pleased that Tennessee has focused on serving individuals with \nco-occurring disorders. There are an estimated 25,000 Tennesseans \nidentified as having co-occurring disorders, meaning they require both \nmental health and substance abuse services. The Co-Occurring Disorders \nProject is a partnership between Tennessee's Division of Mental Heath \nServices and Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Services, allowing the patient \nto overcome the difficult circumstances that make their recovery \ncomplex by allowing them to receive both substance abuse treatment and \nmental health treatment in an integrated system of care.\n  Another project that SAMHSA makes possible is the Central Intake \nProcess which Tennessee developed to establish a uniformed system for \nanyone who requires alcohol and/or drug use treatment. Here is how this \nprogram works as demonstrated by the true case of a man named John.\n  John, is a 35 year-old, black male who was referred to Central Intake \nby his probation officer. John's past legal history includes 12 assault \ncharges, 3 contempt of court charges, 15 public drunk charges and one \nDUI. John is a high school graduate, and has 24 months of technical \ntraining in operating heavy equipment. In the 30 days prior to his \nassessment, John had used 2 pints of alcohol a day, smoked crack \ncocaine on 22 days and marijuana on 4 days. John has been abusing \nalcohol for 27 years, marijuana for 21 years and cocaine for 4 years. \nHe also has reported heroin use.\n  He was diagnosed as alcohol, cocaine and marijuana dependent and \nreferred to a residential program with a step-\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\ndown transitional living facility outside his geographic region. Upon \ncompletion of the program, the Central Intake case manager arranged a \nplacement with a halfway house in another part of the State. The case \nmanager for John reports that he has been clean and sober for 10 \nmonths, continues to live in the halfway house, is employed, involved \nin Alcoholics Anonymous and is a member of a church. By establishing \nCentral Intake, Tennessee, thanks to Federal block grant dollars is \nable to evaluate and offer appropriate treatment for individuals like \nJohn to help put their lives back together.\n  With the $4.4 million that the Tennessee Department of Mental Health \nreceived in 1998, Tennessee was able to utilize and enhance an array of \nservices dedicated to mental health. Overall the block grant money was \ndistributed to 16 private not-for-profit community health centers and \nnine community health agencies throughout the State. SAMHSA block grant \nfunds were used for consumer and family support groups. In addition the \nmajor allocation of funding is spent on drop-in/socialization services \nacross the State. In all there are 35 consumer-operated centers which \nprovide a place for consumers to meet and socialize with other \nconsumers of mental health services. In addition funding is used for \nco-occurring disorder projects which train clinicians, establish \nresource centers, and establish a statewide network for dual diagnosis \nadvocacy.\n  To address the youth population, the Tennessee Department of Mental \nHealth uses SAMHSA block grant dollars to fund a program called BASIC. \nBASIC which stands for Better Attitudes and Skills in Children is a \npublic school based early intervention and prevention program that \nidentifies and works with children with serious emotional disturbance \nwith a goal of reducing the incidence of adolescent and adult mental \nhealth problems. This project also focuses on enhancing awareness and \ncapacity for response of school personnel to the mental health needs of \nchildren.\n  SAMHSA funds also pay for the early children intervention project \nwhich targets preschool children with behavior problems that are in a \nday care setting. The purpose of this program is to intervene at the \npoint which behavior problems become obtrusive and problematic for the \nparents, teaching staff and other children in the day care center.\n  Finally, I would like to mention the Respite Services program for \nfamilies of children identified as seriously emotionally disturbed, or \ndually diagnosed as emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded. \nRespite consultants assist in identifying and developing community-\nbased respite resources, and work with families to utilize these \nresources in the most effective manner.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today will ensure that Tennessee \nand other states will continue to receive critically needed Federal \nfunds for community based programs to help individuals with substance \nabuse and mental health disorders. The changes that I have outlined \nwill dramatically increase State flexibility in the use of Federal \nfunds and ensure that each State is able to address its unique needs. \nThe bill also provides a much needed focus on the troubling issue of \nthe recent increase in drug use by our youth and addresses how we can \nbe helpful to local communities in regard to the issue of children and \nviolence. I am pleased to offer this bill today and I look forward to \nworking on theses issues with my colleagues as the bill is considered \nby the Senate.\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, we are introducing a bill \nto bring mental health and substance abuse treatment services into the \nnext century. I commend Senator Frist for his effective leadership on \nthis issue. We have worked closely together on this important \nlegislation to define the types of mental health and substance abuse \ntreatment and services research that deserve to be funded, and to \nimprove the process of accountability for clinical outcomes.\n  The bill also contains a number of provisions to address the alarming \nincrease in violence in our schools and communities and the traumatic \nconsequences of such violence. The legislation emphasizes a number of \nprograms to prevent and reduce the impact of mental disorders and \nsubstance abuse in children and adolescents.\n  The tragic events in Colorado earlier this month are a reminder of \nhow much more we need to help families, to protect children, and to \nmake our schools and communities safer.\n  This legislation provides new support for children who are witnesses \nand survivors of domestic and community violence. Too often, these \nchildren are at great risk for long term psychological problems, \nincluding developmental delays, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety or \ndepression, and even the risk that these traumatized individuals will \ngrow up to become perpetrators of violence themselves.\n  Another major feature of this bill is the attempt to address a number \nof concerns that were not apparent when we established the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration in 1992. We need to do \nmore to help states identify the kinds of assistance that are most \nrelevant to the persons they are currently serving and to do so in the \nmost efficient and effective ways. Our bill accomplishes this by \nstreamlining the services, and helps assure that the right services are \ngoing to those who most need them.\n  We also intend to address the needs of persons with both mental \ndisorders and substance abuse. We must give greater priority to \nprograms that support the mental health and substance abuse treatment \nneeds of patients in primary care clinics.\n  I look forward to working closely with my colleagues to enact this \nlegislation. We know that we can deal more effectively with the serious \nproblems of substance abuse and mental illness, and enable far more of \nour fellow citizens to lead fulfilling and productive lives.\nMr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nfrom Tennessee, Senator Frist, in introducing the ``Youth Drug and \nCommunity-Based Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Act.'' I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this legislation that will reauthorize the \nvery important work conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration (SAMHSA). I want to commend Senator Frist for \nhis valuable leadership in this effort.\n  Substance abuse affects us all. Many of us have a close friend or \nfamily member who is a substance abuser or living in recovery, and \npersons with mental illness continue to needlessly face obstacles to \ntheir successful treatment that can, and should be eliminated.\n  SAMHSA's role is to improve access to quality mental health and \nsubstance abuse services in the nation. It carries out this \nresponsibility to the tremendous advantage of States, local \ngovernments, and communities across the nation. This reauthorization \nbill will improve access and reduce barriers to high quality, effective \nprograms and services for individuals who suffer from, or are at risk \nfor, substance abuse or mental illness, as well as for their families \nand communities. It strengthens SAMHSA's national leadership in \nensuring that knowledge, based on science and state-of-the-art \npractice, is effectively used for the prevention and treatment of \naddictive and mental disorders.\n  SAMHSA fosters Federal-State partnerships by supporting State and \nlocal community mental health and substance abuse programs. SAMHSA's \nbudget of $2.3 billion is distributed through grants to states, local \ncommunities, private organizations, and schools. This reauthorization \nwill increase flexibility for the States and for the Secretary in the \nprovision of these services. This bill will repeal and/or make optional \nseveral existing requirements, and instead allows the States to use the \ngrant funds to better serve their particular mental health and \nsubstance abuse populations. It dramatically reduces the administrative \nburden of federal mandates and allows the States greater flexibility to \ncoordinate programs to develop a seamless system of care.\n  This flexibility necessitates a need for increased accountability. \nThis bill improves the way States are held accountable for their use of \nFederal funds. Under the current system, States are required to spend \ncertain amounts on certain populations and their success is determined \non whether they have spent the required amount of\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\nfunds. Not on whether they are accomplishing program goals. We will \nchange these programs to focus on performance and results as Congress \nhas done with other programs.\n  I would now like to speak about what I see as the most important \nprovisions of this bill. The first is the Title I provisions relating \nto services for children and adolescents. It is critical that we focus \non treatment for youth. The substance abuse treatment system in this \ncountry is focused primarily on adult addicts. A system of care for \nadolescents is not routinely available. And yet the statistics show \nthat adolescents are more frequently using drugs than they did five \nyears ago. This reauthorization facilitates a system of care that \naddresses their needs.\n  The events of Littleton, Colorado have made us all keenly aware of \nthe mental health of children in dealing with violence. The provision \non Children and Violence in this bill pulls together the abilities of \nthe Departments of Health and Human Resources, Education and Justice to \nsupport programs to address children and violence issues at the \ncommunity levels. Mental health professionals, educators, and law \nenforcement officials can collaborate so that at-risk youths with \ndisorders can be diagnosed early and moved into the proper treatment \nsetting.\n  School districts will implement the wide range of early childhood \ndevelopment, early intervention and prevention, and mental health \ntreatment services that appear to have the greatest likelihood of \npreventing violence among children. To ensure the availability of \nfunding for emergencies, the bill establishes an emergency response \nfund to allow the federal government to support communities which have \nexperienced trauma due to teen violence. To help youth and adolescents \ncope with violence and emergency crises, the bill establishes grants \nfor developing knowledge with regard to best practices for treating \npsychiatric disorders resulting from emergency crisis. This is an \napproach that I understand is supported by both the research and \nservice communities. It makes sense to me and I know that such programs \nwill be helpful in every community in America.\n  I must also point out that this bill includes the formula compromise \nincluded in last years's omnibus appropriations bill for the Substance \nAbuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant funds. This is an issue of \nparamount importance to small and rural states, and I am pleased that \nthis legislation ratifies last year's agreement.\n  Mr. President, this is an important bill that will greatly improve \nthe quality of substance abuse and mental health treatment in this \nnation. I look forward to considering this bill in the near future in \ncommittee, and then I hope it will receive the full attention of the \nSenate. I would like to once again thank Senator Frist for putting so \nmuch time and effort into crafting legislation that will benefit so \nmany American families.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) \nReauthorization Act and to commend Senator Frist for his leadership on \nthis issue. I am pleased to join him as a co-sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  This reauthorization will support SAMHSA in achieving its mission to \nimprove the quality and availability of mental health and substance \nabuse prevention, early intervention, and treatment services. The \nSAMHSA Act allows States to develop comprehensive systems to provide \nbetter quality mental health care so that children and adults with \nserious emotional disturbances may remain in the comfort of their home \nand within a familiar environment as they receive treatment. The \nflexibility provided by this piece of legislation will also allow \nStates to build partnerships with schools and neighborhoods so that we \ncan better confront the causes and impact of violence on our schools \nand communities. I am pleased that this legislation will also continue \nto support homeless individuals who need mental health services and \nwill allow States to be innovative in addressing the needs of special \npopulations such as pregnant, addicted women and those with HIV.\n  I am particularly pleased that this legislation incorporates a bill \nintroduced by Senator Jeffords and myself, the ``Children of Substance \nAbusers Act'' (COSA). Children with substance abusing parents face \nserious health risks, including congenital birth defects, \npsychological, emotional and developmental problems, and the increased \nlikelihood of becoming substance abusers themselves. Additionally, they \nare three times more likely to be abused and four times more likely to \nbe neglected than children whose parents are not substance abusers. \nCOSA addresses the devastation generated in the wake of parental \nsubstance abuse by promoting aggressive outreach to families in need \nand providing early intervention, prevention, and treatment services, \nand education and training for health and social services providers on \nrecognizing and serving these families.\n  Although this legislation is an excellent beginning, I am concerned \nabout the omission of two critical issues which have not been \nadequately addressed by federal efforts to date-- the need to provide \ntreatment to teens who are abusing alcohol and drugs and the use of \nrestraints and seclusion on children in mental health facilities.\n  Statistics reveal that in senior high schools across the country, \ntwenty-five percent of students use an illicit drug on a monthly basis, \nand seven percent on a daily basis. In 1997, fifty-two percent of \nsenior high school students reported monthly alcohol use, meaning more \nthan four million teens consumed alcohol in any given month. Yet, only \ntwenty percent of the 648,000 adolescents with severe substance abuse \nproblems receive treatment. The legislation that I have introduced \ntoday, the ``Teen Substance Abuse Treatment Act of 1999'' would fill an \nimportant gap in our national strategy for combating substance abuse in \nour communities by dedicating funding for treating youth with alcohol \nand drug problems. This legislation would authorize grants to develop \ninnovative services aimed at the specific needs of teenagers, including \nservices that coordinate mental health and substance abuse services. In \naddition this legislation would address the interaction between \nsubstance abuse and violent and antisocial behavior.\n  While I am disappointed that this bill is not currently included in \nthe SAMHSA Reauthorization legislation that will be introduced today, I \nam encouraged that Senator Frist has agreed to work with me, Senator \nReed, and Senator Bingaman prior to a markup of the bill to craft \nlegislation to comprehensively address the substance abuse needs of \nadolescents.\n  Secondly, Mr. President, I also today want to briefly mention an \nissue that I hope will eventually be addressed within SAMHSA's \nreauthorization. This issue, the misapplication of restraints and \nseclusion within facilities providing mental health care services, \nsignals a national tragedy that must be addressed. As evidenced last \nyear by the Hartford Courant in a ground breaking investigative series \nthat confirmed 142 deaths that occurred during or shortly after \nrestraints were applied, the federal government must do better to \nprotect individuals with mental illnesses from the punitive and deadly \nmisuse of restraints and seclusion. Additionally, because many of these \ndeaths go unreported, the actual number of restraint-related deaths may \nbe many times higher. More than 26 percent of restraint-related deaths \nwere children--nearly twice the proportion they constitute in mental \nhealth institutions.\n  The alarming number of deaths reported in the series illustrates the \nneed for national, uniform standards for the use of restraints in the \nmental health care field. Low pay for mental health care workers, \nlittle-to-no training, and a lack of accountability and oversight, all \ncontribute to the deplorable conditions found in many of the nation's \nmental health care treatment centers. The initiative that I hope to \ninclude within SAMHSA will establish uniform standards for restraint \nuse, ensure adequate training and appropriate staffing levels, and \nallow protection and advocacy organizations to review deaths that occur \nat mental health care facilities. Legislation concerning the use of \nrestraint and seclusion use is badly needed. As the Hartford Courant \nseries mentioned, the federal government monitors the size of eggs but \ndoes not record the number of deaths caused by\n\n[[Page S4897]]\n\nthe use of restraints and seclusion in mental health care facilities. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Frist toward the inclusion of this \nimportant initiative within SAMHSA's reauthorization.\n  Mr. President, this bill demonstrates our continuing support for \nSAMHSA and for sustaining programs which improve the quality and \navailability of substance abuse and mental health services. I am \npleased that Senator Frist has moved this legislation forward and look \nforward to working with him to include provisions to address the \nsubstance abuse treatment needs of adolescents and to enact standards \nregarding the use of restraint and seclusion. I again offer my support \nand co-sponsorship of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 978. A bill to specify that the legal public holiday known as \nWashington's Birthday be called by that name; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n               george washington bicentennial act of 1999\n\nMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to reestablish the third Monday in February as a national \nholiday called ``Washington's Birthday.''\n  Current law provides that the third Monday in February is a legal \npublic holiday designated as ``Washington's Birthday.'' Nonetheless, \nthere is an inaccurate misconception that this federal holiday is \ncalled ``President's Day.'' Not only does the use of the phrase \n``President's Day'' in reference to the third Monday in February have \nno force in federal law, the misnomer obscures the true meaning of the \nholiday.\n  Simply put, the true meaning of the federal holiday known as \n``Washington's Birthday'' is to celebrate the birthday of the father of \nour country. Washington's role in achieving our Nation's independence, \nin helping to create our Constitution, and as the first President of \nthe United States of America cannot be overestimated.\n  As one of Virginia's delegates to the Second Continental Congress \nassembled in Philadelphia in May 1775, Washington was elected Commander \nin Chief of the Continental Army. As Commander in Chief of the Army, \nWashington helped ensure the independence of our Nation when he, with \nthe help of French allies, forced the surrender of British forces at \nYorktown. After the war, Washington soon realized the problems \nassociated with the Articles of Confederation, and he became a prime \nmover in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention in \nPhiladelphia in 1787. Washington presided over the Constitutional \nConvention and ultimately yielded to the cries that he serve as our \ncountry's first President. After the Constitution was ultimately \nratified, the electoral college twice unanimously elected Washington to \nserve as President of the United States.\n  As the father of our country, President Washington deserves to be \ndistinguished from other Presidents. Federal law recognizes this \ndeserved distinction in that President Washington's birthday is the \nonly President's birthday recognized as a federal holiday. However, \nbecause this holiday is all too often misconceived as ``President's \nDay,'' this legislation is necessary to reestablish that the federal \nholiday is in fact ``Washington's Birthday.''\n  This legislation would achieve this objective by simply requiring all \nentities and officials of the United States Government, as well as \nfederally funded publications, to refer to this day as ``Washington's \nBirthday.'' This bill in no way infringes on the right of any State or \nlocal government to recognize a ``President's Day'' or any other \nholiday. In fact, ``President's Day'' is a State holiday in a number of \nstates.\n  President Buchanan emphasized the importance of Washington's birthday \nwhen he stated, ``when the birthday of Washington shall be forgotten, \nliberty will have perished from the earth.'' I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill to ensure that President Washington receive the \ndistinction he deserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 979. A bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act to provide for further self-governance by Indian tribes, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n               tribal self-governance amendments of 1999\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce amendments to \nthe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 \n(``ISDEA'') to provide for greater tribal self-governance for the \nprograms and services of the Department of Health and Human Services \n(``HHS'').\n  Over the years the poor circumstances and conditions of Native \nAmericans have been compounded by vacillating federal policies and \nfederal domination of matters affecting Indian people.\n  This situation began to change in 1970, when President Nixon \ndelivered his now-famous ``Message to Congress on Indian Affairs'', \nwhich laid the foundation for a more enlightened federal Indian policy. \nThis new policy allowed tribes to forge their own destiny and \nchallenged the federal government to find new, innovative ways to \nadminister Indian programs.\n  Because of the tangible benefits it has brought, this shift away from \nfederal domination and toward Indian self-determination has been \nsupported by every Administration since 1970.\n  Indian self-determination fosters strong tribal governments and \nreservation economies. This policy has encouraged tribes to assume more \nresponsibility for their own affairs, caused a reduction in the federal \nbureaucracy and, most importantly, improved the quality of services to \ntribal members.\n  The most definitive expression of the policy change brought about by \nPresident Nixon was the ISDEA which authorized tribes to negotiate and \nenter into agreements with the U.S. to assume control over and operate \nfederal programs which had been previously administered by federal \nemployees.\n  In the years after enactment of the ISDEA, Congress expanded on the \nframework by enacting tribal ``self-governance'' laws which created a \ndemonstration project that authorized tribes to enter into ``compacts'' \nwith the U.S., so that they may administer an array of services.\n  The principles of the ISDEA are similar to those of block granting to \nthe states. Instead of the federal government micro-managing Indian \ntribes, the federal government is contracting with tribes to perform \nthose functions. Like states, tribes know best which governmental \nprograms best serve their communities and how programs should be \ndelivered. In short, the concept of local administration of federal \ndollars works.\n  By continuing to build tribal capacity and expertise in the \nadministration of programs and services previously administered by \nemployees of the Department of the Interior and the HHS, the Act has \nforged stronger tribal governments and economies and led to a smaller \nfederal presence in Indian affairs.\n  The current self governance ``demonstration project'' in health care \ninvolves approximately 50 tribes. The legislation I introduce today \nbuilds on these successes, makes the self governance program permanent \nand expands an array of eligible functions available for tribal self \ngovernance to include the many programs, services and activities of the \nHHS, such as clinical services, public health nursing, mental health, \nsubstance abuse, community health representatives, and dental health.\n  The bill ensures continued participation by the tribes now \nparticipating in the self governance project, and provides for \nparticipation by an additional 50 tribes or tribal organizations \nannually.\n  This is far from a ``no-strings attached'' approach to federal \nprograms. To participate, tribes must successfully complete legal and \naccounting requirements, as well as demonstrate financial stability and \nfinancial management capability.\n  This legislation also addresses the issue of which functions may be \nperformed by tribes and which may not. This bill differentiates between \nthose services and activities that are federal, and therefore \nineligible for tribal performance through a self-governance compact, \nand those that are not inherently federal, and therefore eligible for \ntribal performance through a self-governance compact.\n  To track the progress made in raising the health status of Indians, \nthe bill requires participating tribes to report health-related data to \nthe Secretary so that an accurate picture of Indian health can be \ndrawn.\n\n[[Page S4898]]\n\n  I am mindful that there are issues we need to explore further, such \nas contract support cost funding, and I fully anticipate that \ninterested parties will have full and fair opportunity to raise their \nconcerns during the legislative process.\n  I am hopeful that after working with the tribes, the Administration \nand other interested parties, and after careful consideration by the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, we will be able to enact this important \nlegislation to raise the health status of Native Americans and continue \nthe unparalleled success of the Indian self-determination \npolicies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Frist, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Rockfeller, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. \n        Murkowski):\n  S. 980. A bill to promote access to health care services in rural \nareas; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              promoting health in rural areas act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Promoting \nHealth in Rural Areas Act of 1999.\n  All Americans deserve access to quality health care. But in rural \nAmerica health care delivery is often difficult, given the great \ndistances and extreme weather conditions that typically prevail. That's \nwhy Senator Daschle and I, along with bipartisan group of Senators, are \nintroducing this important legislation. Its provisions are many, but it \npurpose is singular: to correct the federal government's tendency to \nview all areas--urban and rural--with a one-size-fits all lens.\n  Before I begin explaining what this bill does, I want to recognize \nthe tremendous contributions of some of the cosponsors' staff who have \nworked on the bill.\n  The Minority Leader is known in the Senate not only for this \ntremendous leadership, but for the quality of his staff. Elizabeth \nHargrave is no exception. On loan from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, she has worked tirelessly to see this bill through to \nintroduction. With her expertise and attention to the intricate details \nof health policy, we have come up with a solid, comprehensive bill, \nmuch improved from that which was introduced last year.\n  Tom Walsh on the Senate Aging Committee has also done tremendous \nwork. His knowledge of Medicare law is vast, and his parent demeanor \nhas done wonders toward making negotiations on this bill amicable and \nfruitful. Heidi Cashman with Senator Roberts, Neleen Eisinger with \nSenator Conrad, Diane Major and Stephanie Sword with Senator Thomas, \nSabrina and Bryan with Senator Harkin, The list goes on. The Promoting \nHealth in Rural Areas Act is the product of many long meetings, \nextensive research, and a great deal of cooperation. Would that we \ncould all work so well together.\n  So why is this bill important? As you know, Mr. President, a couple \nof years ago Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act. In it we extended \nthe life of Medicare for several years and passed some important rural \nhealth provisions, including Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine \nand the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program to establish \nCritical Access Hospitals (CAHs).\n  Under the new CAH law, rural hospitals can convert to limited-service \nhospital status and received flexibility with Medicare regulations \ndesigned for full-size, full-service facilities. They are reimbursed by \nMedicare based on actual costs, not fixed or limited payments; in \nexchange, CAHs agree to a limit of 15 hospitals beds and patients stays \nof limited duration. The model for the new program was based largely on \nMontana's Medical Assistance Facility Program. CAHs show well the \nprogress we can make if rural areas are afforded the flexibility to \ndevelop solutions to the problems they know best. They also illustrate \na creative means by which we can use the Medicare program to keep rural \nhospitals open--and rural communities alive.\n  But not all of the Balanced Budget Act was positive for rural areas. \nFar from it. Montana health care facilities, including hospitals, home \nhealth agencies and nursing homes, are suffering.\n  In 1997, even before the BBA cuts, small rural hospitals in Montana \nlost 6.5% treating Medicare patients. And although we do not yet have \ncomplete data on the impact of the BBA changes, anecdotal evidence \ntells me that the situation in rural Montana has gotten even worse. In \nrural areas where many, usually most, patients are of Medicare age, we \ncannot expect these facilities to stay open without paying them enough \nto break even. We must do something to ensure the integrity of our \nrural health care systems.\n  This bill is a good first step. Among other things, the bill provides \nrural communities with assistance in recruiting health care providers; \nexpands the range of services that can be provided with telemedicine; \nincreases payments to hospitals in rural areas; expands access to \nmental health services in rural areas; changes the formula by which \nmanaged care payments are calculated to attract more managed care \nhealth plans to rural areas; and increase rural representation on the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission.\n  As Dennis Farney, a reporter from Kansas once wrote: ``A prairie is \nnot any old piece of flat land in the Midwest. No a prairie is wine-\ncolored grass, dancing in the wind. A prairie is a sun-splashed \nhillside, bright with wild flowers. A prairie is a fleeting cloud \nshadow, the song of the meadowlark. It is the wild land that has never \nfelt the slash of the plow.'' For me, this conjures up images of an \nidyllic rural setting, far removed from the commotion of city life. And \ncertainly that is in the minds of many who live in these sparsely-\npopulated areas--that they are inhabiting a part of the world that is \nin many ways pristine and untouched.\n  Of course there is a price to pay for that. Rural folks should not \nexpect to have all the amenities of city life: opera houses and \nprofessional sports teams are just a couple of things that rural areas \nmust simply do without. Rural Montanans can't expect to have a subway \nsystem--or even a Subway sandwich shop for that matter--because \neconomies of scale dictate as much.\n  And even in the area of health care, rural Americans realize they \ngive up something. Full-service hospitals and dental clinics are the \nstuff of populated areas, and will probably remain so. But although you \nwon't find a full-service acute-care hospital in Choteau, Montana, you \ncan find a CAH. And though you don't find a full-service dental clinic \nin Eureka, you can find a rural health clinic. Rural residents cannot \nexpect to have the most extensive health care facilities or access to \nthe array of specialists typical of urban settings, but they should \nexpect a minimum standard of quality care. This bill is a step in the \nright direction towards raising that standard.\n  Whether it's helping rural areas with highway dollars, preventing \nsmall post offices from moving to towns' outskirts, or keeping \nhospitals open, I think most of us agree that saving rural areas is \nsomething that ought to be done. Regardless of how hard we try, \nhowever, we cannot do so without ensuring the integrity of these \ncommunities' health care systems. I urge my colleagues to join the \nMinority Leader and I in doing just that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill intended to \nimprove health care for Americans living in rural areas. The Promoting \nHealth in Rural Areas Act of 1999 would improve the viability of rural \nhospitals and clinics, help rural communities attract and retain health \ncare providers and health plans, and make optimal use of the \nextraordinary medical and telecommunications technology available \ntoday.\n  One-fifth of Americans live in rural areas. They experience the same \nhealth care access problems that Americans in cities and suburbs face--\nplus some problems that are uniquely rural. Issues of geography and \ntransportation, which rural Americans face all the time, can make it \ndifficult to visit the doctor or get to a hospital. These problems are \nmade worse by the short supply of health care professionals in rural \nareas.\n  Rural communities are striving to improve access through telehealth \nand the recruitment of health care professionals. At the same time, \nthey must also struggle to maintain what they have, to ensure that \nproviders who leave their area are replaced, and to keep their \nhospitals' doors open. This\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\nbill contains several provisions that will help them do this--by \nimproving Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements to rural providers, \nstrengthening recruitment programs, and encouraging the development of \ntelehealth. These are important steps to improve access, increase \nchoice, and improve the quality of care provided in more isolated parts \nof the country.\n  One problem rural areas face is reimbursement systems that favor \nurban areas, or that do not take the special needs of rural providers \ninto account. For example, Medicare payments to hospitals are based on \nformulas that are biased toward urban areas. The Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission, and its predecessor, the Prospective Payment \nAdvisory Commission, have been pointing out these inequities for years. \nThis bill would correct the formulas and pay hospitals more fairly.\n  Another reimbursement problem in rural states is payment for health \nplans in Medicare+Choice. The bill includes a provision to guarantee \nthat plans in rural counties get the increased reimbursement promised \nin the Balanced Budget Act. This provision is important to ensure that \nbeneficiaries in rural areas have some of the health plan choices \navailable to urban seniors.\n  Rural communities also face difficulty recruiting and retaining \nhealth care providers. Despite great increases in the number of \nproviders trained in this country over the past 30 years, rural \ncommunities have not shared equitably in the benefits of this \nexpansion. As a result, about 22 million rural Americans live in areas \nconsidered Health Professional Shortage Areas because they do not have \nenough doctors to serve their community.\n  Our bill addresses obstacles in current law to the recruitment and \ntraining of providers in rural areas. One obstacle is the current \nrequirement that communities actually lose a physician before they \nqualify for recruitment assistance to replace that provider. This bill \nwould let communities get assistance for up to 12 months in advance \nwhen they know a retirement or resignation is pending. Another \nprovision in the bill ensures that new Medicare reimbursement rules for \nmedical residents, enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act, do not \ndiscriminate against areas that train residents in rural health clinics \nor other settings outside a hospital.\n  Telehealth is another promising tool to bring medical expertise to \nrural communities. Through telehealth technology, rural patients can \nsignificantly shorten their travel time to see specialists, and they \ncan have access to doctors they would otherwise never encounter. The \nbenefits of telehealth extend to rural health professionals as well, \nproviding them with technical expertise and interaction with peers that \ncan make practicing in a rural area more attractive.\n  Our bill addresses some of the barriers that have limited the \ndevelopment of telehealth. It would expand Medicare reimbursement for \ntelehealth to all rural areas, and to all services Medicare currently \ncovers. The bill also would make telehealth more convenient, by \nallowing any health care practitioner to present a patient to a \nspecialist on the other side of the video connection. The bill also \nincludes a grant program to help communities establish telehealth \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, rural America deserves appropriate access to health \ncare--access to hospitals, access to providers, and access to quality \nservices. Providing this care in rural communities raises unique \nchallenges, but we can--and must--overcome those challenges. The bill I \nintroduce today, along with my colleague Senator Baucus and other \nmembers of the Rural Health Caucus, takes important steps toward that \ngoal.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator \nBaucus, Senator Daschle, and other Senators to introduce the Promoting \nHealth in Rural Areas Act of 1999 (PHIRA). This legislation will \nimprove access, increase choice and improve the quality of health care \nin rural America.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 \nproduced real savings for the Medicare program and helped to extend \nsolvency of the program. However, since passing the BBA, we have heard \nconcerns from many rural health care providers that they are facing \nserious financial pressures due in large part to reductions that were \nenacted as part of the BBA.\n  During the BBA debate, I was very concerned that across-the-board \ncuts in Medicare would have a disproportionate impact on rural health \ncare. Rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicare and in my state of North \nDakota, Medicare accounts for 70 percent of hospital revenue. This \nmeans that Medicare reimbursement reductions have a bigger direct \nimpact on rural hospitals than on other hospitals. It also means that \nrural hospitals have fewer other sources of revenues where they can \nincrease margins to make up for losses in Medicare revenue.\n  To help protect access to health care in rural areas, I and a \ncoalition of other Senators, worked hard to fight for provisions in the \nBBA to protect our rural areas. We made positive steps toward ensuring \nthat health care in rural areas is affordable and accessible.\n  Our victories included, for the first time, requiring Medicare \nreimbursement for telehealth. Also included was the creation of the \nCritical Access Hospital program. The BBA also helped to reform managed \ncare reimbursement to make it more equitable to rural areas and added \nGraduate Medical Education language to protect rural residency \nprograms.\n  Despite our efforts, BBA reductions are having an unfair and \ndisproportionate impact on rural health care systems--these cuts have \ncaused real pain for providers and threaten to reduce access to health \ncare for seniors, particularly in rural areas.\n  To help address these concerns, we have worked hard to develop \nlegislation that will ensure our rural areas have access to quality \ncare. The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 will improve \nMedicaid and Medicare reimbursement to rural providers, strengthen \nhealth professional recruitment programs, and encourage the development \nof telehealth.\n  One problem that rural areas face is reimbursement systems that favor \nurban areas, or that do not take the special needs of rural providers \ninto account. Medicare payments to hospitals are currently based on \nformulas that are biased toward urban areas. The first element of PHIRA \nwould correct these formulas and pay hospitals more fairly. In the BBA, \nMedicaid funding for Community Health Clinics (CHCs) and Rural Health \nClinics (RHCs) was changed, leaving no guarantee that states will \nadequately fund these facilities. This bill would create a new payment \nsystem for CHCs and RHCs that will help ensure continued support for \nthese essential facilities. The bill would also guarantee that \nMedicare+Choice plans in rural counties get the increased reimbursement \npromised in the BBA. This provision is important to ensure that \nbeneficiaries in rural areas have at least some of the health plan \nchoices that are available to urban seniors.\n\n  The second element of our bill includes provisions to attract and \nbring more health care providers into our communities. Rural \ncommunities face difficulties in recruiting and retaining health care \nproviders. In my state, over 85% of counties are designated as either a \npartial or full health shortage profession area (HPSA). Nationwide, 22 \nmillion rural Americans live in HPSAs. We must do more to attract \nqualified health care providers into our rural areas. Currently, \ncommunities must actually lose a physician before they qualify for \nrecruitment assistance to replace that provider. This bill would let \ncommunities get assistance for up to 12 months in advance when they \nknow someone is going to retire. In addition, this bill will take \npositive steps to ensure that our future health care providers choose \nto serve in HPSAs. Currently, students in our National Health Service \nCorps program, a program helps students pay for their medical education \nor re-pay their medical student loans in return for serving in HPSAs, \nare facing undue hardship due to the fact that they are being taxed on \nscholarships they receive to participate in the NHSC. This bill will \nreward students for their commitment to working in HPSAs by exempting \nthem from being taxed on their NHSC scholarships.\n  The third element of PHIRA will go even further to ensure that the \nmost important medical services are available in our communities by \nexpanding access to telehealth services. The\n\n[[Page S4900]]\n\npromise of telehealth is becoming increasingly apparent. Throughout the \ncountry, providers are experimenting with a variety of telehealth \napproaches in an effort to improve access to quality medical and other \nhealth-related services. Those programs are demonstrating that \ntelecommunications technology can alleviate the constraints of time and \ndistance, as well as the cost and inconvenience of transporting \npatients to medical providers. Many approaches show promising results \nin reducing health care costs and bringing adequate care to all \nAmericans. For the first time, technological advances and the \ndevelopment of a national information infrastructure give telehealth \nthe potential to overcome barriers to health care services for rural \nAmericans and afford them the access that most Americans take for \ngranted. But it is clear that our nation must do more to integrate \ntelehealth into our overall health care delivery infrastructure.\n  This bill would expand Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine to all \nrural areas, and to all Medicare services. Medicare reimbursement \npolicy is an essential component of helping to integrate telehealth \ninto the health care infrastructure and is particularly important in \nrural areas, where many hospitals do as much as 80% of their business \nwith Medicare patients. Because the Secretary defined reimbursable \nservices so narrowly in the BBA, this legislation clarifies that all \nservices that are covered under Medicare Part B will be covered if they \nare instead delivered vial telehealth. In particular, it clarifies that \nthe technology called ``store and forward'', which is a cost-effective \nmethod of transferring information, is included in this reimbursement \npolicy.\n  This bill will also help communities build home-grown telehealth \nnetworks. It will help to build telehealth infrastructure and foster \nrural economic development, and it incorporates many of the most \nimportant lessons learned from other grant projects and studies on \ntelehealth from across the Federal government. Because so many rural \nand underserved communities lack the ability to attract and support a \nwide variety of health care professionals and services, it is important \nto find a way to bring the most important medical services into those \ncommunities. Telehealth provides an important part of the answer. It \nhelps bring services to remote areas in a quick, cost-effective manner, \nand can enable patients to avoid traveling long distances in order to \nreceive health care treatment.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that the Promoting Health in Rural \nAreas Act will take important steps toward ensuring those in our rural \nand underserved communities have access to quality, affordable health \ncare. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to join several of my \ncolleagues in introducing the ``Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act,'' \na bill designed to increase access to quality health care services in \nrural areas. I am pleased to have worked with my colleagues--Senators \nBaucus, Roberts, Grassley, Harkin, Daschle, Conrad and Collins--in \ncrafting this bill for rural America.\n  Rural health care has been a top priority for me throughout my \nservice in the House and Senate. As co-chairman of the Senate Rural \nHealth Care Caucus, I am pleased that rural health care is an issue \nthat we have always addressed in a bipartisan way in the Senate.\n  Rural health care is at a crossroads. Many communities are left \nshort-handed through no fault of their own. The lack of physicians, \nnurses and other health professionals make it difficult for rural \nindividuals to receive the most basic primary care. Further, inadequate \nand, more importantly, unequal reimbursement by federal agencies \nmultiplies these unique challenges and leaves rural individuals and \nfamilies without access to vital medical care.\n  The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 offers clear and \nsensible solutions to these problems. It increases reimbursement rates \nfor rural hospitals and clinics, it offers communities additional \nassistance in recruiting physicians, it promotes the use of \ntelemedicine services, it expands coverage of mental health services in \nrural areas and it ensures adequate representation of rural health care \non a national Medicare advisory board. It is a long-term solution \ntailored to the needs of rural areas.\n  The bill incorporates many of the best ideas and recommendations that \nemerged from the Wyoming Health Care Policy Forum I hosted in Casper on \nAugust 26-27, 1998. Wyoming's health care providers, health care \nrecipients, elected representatives and concerned citizens assembled to \nevaluate and assess the direction of Wyoming's health care delivery \nsystem and to chart a blueprint for its future.\n  This bill increases payments to Sole Community Hospitals, Rural \nHealth Clinics and private health plans contracting with Medicare by \nexempting them from a proposed prospective payment system for \noutpatient hospital services. Facilities would be reimbursed on actual \ncosts, providing a higher reimbursement rate. It would also update the \ncost reporting year, or ``rebase,'' the data Medicare uses to calculate \ncosts and reimbursements.\n  Most hospitals in Wyoming are designated as Sole Community Hospitals \nbecause of isolation, weather, travel conditions and the absence of \nother health care facilities. They are crucial for health care delivery \nin Wyoming.\n  Further, the bill would expand the eligibility for hospitals to \nbecome Critical Access Hospitals. Critical Access Hospitals are a newly \ndesignated class of hospitals in rural areas that have been given \ngreater flexibility and relief from federal regulations so they can \norganize their staff and facilities to meet the immediate emergency \ncare needs of their small communities. They can tailor or reconfigure \ntheir services without losing their Medicare certification.\n  Rural communities through the United States are federally designated \nhealth professional shortage areas (HPSA). Wyoming has 22 of them. This \nmeans there is less than one primary care physician for every 3500 \npersons living in those areas. The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act \nhelps solve this dilemma by offering effective solutions to recruit and \nretain health care providers.\n  It revises Medicare's Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs by \nraising the cap on the number of residents that will be allowed to \nparticipate in family practice residency programs. In addition, it \nprovides added recruiting assistance to communities in HPSAs. Current \nlaw places rural communities at risk because it requires that a \ncommunity first lose a physician before it qualifies for recruitment \nassistance. This bill recognizes pending physician resignations and \nretirements so communities have access to assistance before they lose \ntheir provider.\n  Further, it enhances the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) by \ngiving tax relief to those receiving scholarships and loans under the \nprogram. The NHSC is an important component in the rural health care \ndelivery system and additional tax relief would encourage recipients to \nremain in rural areas.\n  Telehealth technologies play a key role in bridging the barriers of \ntime and distance that prevent access to medical care. We must ensure \nthat the technology is practical, affordable, accessible and maintains \nprivacy. The bill expands the types of telemedicine services that will \nbe reimbursed under Medicare, which will be very useful in establishing \na well-coordinated network of physicians, mid-level practitioners, \nhospitals and clinics. It also encourages solutions to telemedicine \nquestions that have been raised about practicing interstate medicine by \nauthorizing a Joint Working Group on Telehealth that would identify, \nmonitor and coordinate federal telehealth projects and issue an annual \nreport to Congress.\n  Mental health care is a priority in this bill. Individuals in rural \nareas often have limited access to mental health services. As a result, \nrural states license additional categories of mental health \nprofessionals than are recognized by Medicare. This bill ensures more \nof the services will be covered by Medicare.\n  Two years ago, Congress established the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission to make important policy recommendations on Part A and Part \nB of the Medicare program. Unfortunately, of the current 15-member \nboard, only\n\n[[Page S4901]]\n\none health care professional is from a rural area. Our bill requires \nthat the Commission include at least two representatives from Rural \nAreas. This will help ensure that the board members fully understand \nthe implications of their policy decisions.\n  In conclusion, the Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act provides the \nanswers many rural communities are looking for to ensure quality health \ncare for their residents. I look forward to discussing and actively \ndebating rural health this Congress. It is possible that Medicare \nreform legislation will be debated this year and the Senate Rural \nHealth Care Caucus will work to attach many of these provisions to such \nlegislation. We understand the impact recent Medicare changes are \nhaving on our nation's fragile rural health system.\n  We need to act now. This bill is a great start.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Daschle, Baucus, Thomas, Conrad, Roberts, \nGrassley, Collins, and Frist in introducing a critical piece of \nlegislation for America's rural communities, the ``Promoting Health in \nRural Areas Act of 1999''. As co-chairs of the Senate Rural Health \nCaucus, Senator Thomas and I convened this bipartisan group last fall \nto craft a comprehensive rural health bill, building on the hard work \nof Senators Daschle and Baucus from the 105th Congress. I am very proud \nthat today we are able to come together across party lines to introduce \na bill that will improve the ability of rural Americans to access good \nquality health care.\n  Today, the health care system in rural Iowa is on the verge of being \nadmitted to an intensive care unit. Iowans living in small towns and \nrural areas are facing too many barriers to quality health care. But \nseniors living in New Hampton, Iowa, pay the same Medicare taxes as \nthose who live in New York City--they should get the same quality \nhealth care.\n  This bill aims to improve access, increase choice, and improve the \nquality of care provided in rural towns in Iowa and around the nation. \nCurrent formulas for Medicaid and Medicare payments to hospitals are \nbiased towards urban areas. This bill raises payments for rural \nhospitals by making it easier for them to qualify for special \ndesignations. The bill also strengthens health professional recruitment \nprograms, helps expand access to mental health services in rural areas, \nrequires that rural areas be represented on the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission and expand the range of Medicare-reimbursed \nservices that can be provided via telemedicine.\n  Health care providers in rural areas like Iowa practice a \nconservative, cost-effective approach to health care. They should be \nrewarded for their resourcefulness, not penalized with unfair \nreimbursement rates. But Medicare payments to hospitals are currently \nbased on formulas that give urban areas an advantage. This bill \ncorrects these formulas so that hospitals can be paid more fairly. It \nalso includes provisions specifically targeted to small, rural \nhospitals and the unique problems they face.\n  In addition, the bill guarantees that Medicare+Choice plans in rural \ncounties get the increased reimbursement promised in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997. This provision will help ensure that seniors in \nrural areas have some of the same health plan choices available to \nurban seniors. These changes will help to address some of the inequity \nthat exists for Medicare managed care.\n  And I will soon introduce legislation that will take the next \ncritical step: fixing the inequity in Medicare fee-for-service. The \nvast majority of seniors living in rural areas will continue to receive \ntheir care through Medicare fee-for-service, yet the reimbursement rate \nfor rural providers is woefully inadequate. My bill will address the \nimbalance between rural and urban fee-for-service rates, and I hope to \nintroduce it in the next several weeks.\n  Mr. President, the health care system in this country is undergoing \ndramatic changes and our rural health care infrastructure is struggling \nto keep pace with the new landscape. The bill we are introducing today \nis the product of a bipartisan commitment to make sure that rural \nAmericans have access to the same high quality health care that all \nAmericans have come to expect. I am proud to be a part of this effort.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999.\n  Health care today is at a crossroads. Rural communities face \nsignificant challenges in their efforts to recruit and retain health \ncare providers. Hospitals and other health care facilities are facing \nincreasing pressure from Medicare reductions. In 1997, Congress passed \nsignificant changes to the Medicare program in an effort to preserve \nthe program for future generations. A new Congressional Budget Report \nsays we are exceeding our expectations. In fact, since the beginning of \nthe fiscal year in October, Medicare spending was $2.6 billion less \nthan the amount spent in the similar period last year.\n  While this is good news for the fiscal integrity of the Medicare \nprogram, I am concerned about the unintended effects these reductions \nare having on the beneficiaries who depend on Medicare for health care \nservices. It doesn't do much good to ``save'' the program if providers \ncan no longer afford to deliver the services and beneficiaries are no \nlonger able to access these services.\n  A new review by Ernst & Young reports that total hospital Medicare \nmargins are expected to decline from 4.3 percent in fiscal year 1997 to \nonly 0.1 percent in this fiscal year and remain below three percent \nthrough 2002.\n  Even more shocking is that total hospital margins for small, rural \nhospitals are expected to fall from 4.3 percent in fiscal year 1998 to \nnegative 5.6 percent by fiscal year 2002, an amazing decline of 233 \npercent. Kansas hospitals are expected to lose over $530 million. I \nsimply don't think our rural health system can survive any more \nreductions.\n  The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 will help to improve \naccess, increase choice, and improve the quality of care provided in \nrural America.\n  Health care providers in rural areas generally serve a large number \nof Medicare patients. However, Medicare reimbursement to rural \nproviders is not adequate to cover the costs of these services. This \nmeasure takes steps to ensure fair Medicare and Medicaid payments to \nrural providers by targeting those hospitals with special designations \nin rural areas. Provisions are included to increase payments and \nimprove the Sole Community Hospital, Medicare Dependent Hospital, and \nCritical Access Hospital programs. In addition, these special \nfacilities are exempt from a new outpatient reimbursement system that \nis being developed by the Health Care Financing Administration.\n  The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 also strengthens \nhealth professional recruitment programs and gives communities a chance \nto begin recruitment efforts before a crisis hits. Under current law, a \ncommunity must effectively lose a physician before they qualify for \nrecruitment assistance as a shortage area.\n  This measure also takes steps to encourage the use of telehealth, a \ncritical piece of the rural health infrastructure. Under current law, \nHCFA limits reimbursement to four groups of services. This bill will \nexpand reimbursement to include any services currently covered by \nMedicare in a rural area. In addition, the bill authorizes a new grant/\nloan program for telemedicine activities in rural areas.\n  Compromise is a way of life for rural Americans. Rural residents have \nfewer choices of physicians or hospitals. Rural providers must settle \nfor fewer medical colleagues to rely on for consultation and support.\n  However, rural communities can no longer compromise. The regulatory \nburden is too much. Payments are too low. There simply isn't any more \n``fat'' in the system.\n  Mr. President, I fear this is only the tip of the iceberg. As payment \nchanges continue to be implemented and HCFA continues to issue new \nregulations and paperwork burdens, rural communities are going to \nsuffer the most. In fact, many may not survive. We are already losing \nhome health agencies at an alarming rate. Are hospitals the next to go?\n  I am committed to efforts to preserve access to health care services \nfor all Kansans. We can do this if we simply focus on practical reforms \nthat take\n\n[[Page S4902]]\n\ninto account the realities of practicing medicine in rural states like \nKansas. We can guarantee access to quality health care services if we \nmake changes now. We can't afford to wait. I urge my colleagues to join \nme today in supporting this legislation and look forward to working \ntogether to enact common sense solutions--before it's too late.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 981. A bill to provide training to professionals who work with \nchildren affected by violence, to provide for violence prevention, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n     VIOLENCE PREVENTION TRAINING FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS ACT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \n``Violence Prevention Training for Early Childhood Educators Act,'' \nlegislation designed to teach violence prevention to children at the \nearliest ages.\n  all of us have been shaken by the tragedy at Littleton, Colorado. \nAmericans are left searching for answers to many questions. How could \nthese teenagers have committed such brutality? What happened to the \ninnocence and joy of youth? How can society help prevent such violent, \ndeadly behavior from happening again?\n  One of the most effective solutions is to begin violence prevention \nat an early age. My proposal was not thrown together as a quick-fix to \nthe Littleton tragedy. It is a carefully thought-out program aimed at \ntrue prevention. It is designed to help early childhood educators-- the \npeople who work directly with young children in preschools, child care \ncenters, and elementary schools--learn the skills necessary to prevent \nviolent behavior in young children. This legislation supports programs \nthat prepare these professionals so that early childhood teachers, \nchild care providers, and counselors are able to teach children how to \nresolve conflicts without violence. In addition, these professionals \nare in the perfect position to reach out and extend these lessons to \nparents and help whole families adopt these powerful skills.\n  Research has demonstrated that aggressive behavior nearly childhood \nis the single best predictor of aggression in later years. Children \nobserve and imitate aggressive behavior over the course of many years. \nThey certainly have plenty of exposure to violence, both in the streets \nand at home. For example, a Boston ho0spital found that 1 out of every \n10 children seen in their primary care clinic had witnessed a shooting \nor stabbing before the age of 6. I am disheartened to report that in my \nhome state of Connecticut, 1 in 10 teens have been physically abused. \nAlarmingly, more than a third of teenage boys report that they have \nguns or could get one in less than a day. Aggression may become very \nwell-learned by the time a child reaches adolescence. Therefore, we \nmust provide children with strategies for altering the negative \ninfluences of exposure to violence. Early childhood offers a critical \nperiod for overcoming the risk of violent behavior and later juvenile \ndelinquency. And the proper training of professional who work with \nyoung children offers an effective route to reaching these kids.\n  This is not to suggest that early childhood professionals would \nreplace parents as a source of teaching prosocial and acceptable \nbehavior. Instead, these teachers should be encouraged to work with the \nwhole family to address conflict without violence and aggression.\n  In 1992, as part of the Higher Education Act reauthorization, \nCongress enacted similar legislation to provide grants for programs \nthat train professionals in early childhood education and violence \ncounseling. These grants funded some remarkable programs. In my home \nstate, a program at Eastern Connecticut State University trained \nstudents--half of whom were minority, low-income indivdiuals--to be \nteachers in their own communities, and trained child care providers in \nviolence prevention with young children.\n  Unfortunately, just as these efforts were getting off the ground and \nstarting to show promising results, the funding for the program was \nrescinded as part of the major 1994 rescission bill. Looking back, \nafter the horrible events in Littleton, Colorado, Springfield, Oregon, \nand too many other communities, I think we can clearly see that was a \nmistake, Hindsight is always clearer--but let's not make the same \nmistake going forward. As we now work towards the reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I hope that my proposal for \na similar grant program for early violence prevention training is \nincluded in these discussions.\n  Preventing future acts of violence is an issue that rises above \npartisan politics. I think we can all agree that steps need to be taken \nto reduce the development of violent behavior in children. Please join \nme in this effort to begin creating a safer society for everyone, \nespecially our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n\n  S. 982. A bill entitled ``Clean Money, Clean Elections Act''; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                    CLEAN MONEY, CLEAN ELECTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr President, I am here today to introduce the ``Clean \nMoney, Clean Elections'' campaign finance reform legislation. It is in \nsome ways the ``gold standard'' of true campaign finance reform, \nagainst which any more modest legislation ought to be assessed. The \nconceptual approach it embodies--replacing special interest money in \nour current system with clean money--is being adopted by state \nlegislatures and in referenda across the country.\n  Some of my colleagues might respond to this announcement by saying \nthat there are other issues that have arisen in this session that are \nmore important than a debate over whether we will comprehensively \nreform our campaign finance laws. Some might argue that the American \npeople appear to care more about other issues. I would argue, though, \nthat public concern about one issue does not necessarily have to come \nat the expense of another. And while it is clear that Americans care \nvery deeply about a variety of issues--Kosovo, taxes, education, and \nSocial Security reform first among them--it is also clear that they \ncare very much about the nature of our political system. When asked, 60 \npercent of Americans say they think that reforming the way campaigns \nare financed should be a high priority on our National agenda. There is \nno question in my mind that these people are right--reforming the way \ncampaigns are financed should be, must be, a high priority on our \nagenda.\n  Many people believe our political system is corrupted by special \ninterest money. I agree with them. It is not a matter of individual \ncorruption. I think it is probably extremely rare that a particular \ncontribution causes a member to cast a particular vote. But the special \ninterest money is always there, and I believe that we do suffer under \nwhat I have repeatedly called a systemic corruption. Unfortunately, \nthis is no longer a shocking announcement, even if it is a shocking \nfact. Money does shape what is considered do-able and realistic here in \nWashington. It does buy access. We have both the appearance and the \nreality of systemic corruption. And we must act.\n  In the House, a bipartisan effort is currently underway to force \nconsideration of the Shays-Meehan bill, and the number of signers is \nslowly building. Yesterday, moderate House Republicans met with Speaker \nHastert to ask for an early vote on the bill. Today, Representative \nTierney is introducing the ``Clean Money'' companion bill with 38 \noriginal co-sponsors. The House is acting on campaign finance reform, \nas should we on the Senate side. Here in the Senate, we must push \nforward this spring on tough, comprehensive reform.\n  I wonder if anyone would bother to argue that the way we are moving \ntoward a balanced federal budget is unaffected by the connection of big \nspecial-interest money to politics? The cuts we are imposing most \ndeeply affect those who are least well off. That is well-documented. \nThe tax breaks we offer benefit not only the most affluent as a group, \nbut numerous very narrow wealthy special interests. Does anyone wonder \nwhy Congress retains massive subsidies and tax expenditures for oil and \npharmaceutical companies? What about tobacco? Are they curious why \nCongress permits a health care system dominated by insurance companies? \nOr\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\na version of ``free trade'' which disregards the need for fair labor \nand environmental standards, for democracy and human rights, and for \nlifting the standard of living of American workers, as well as workers \nin the countries we trade with? How is it that Congress ever considers \nmajor legislation that directly promotes the concentration of ownership \nand power in the telecommunications industry, in the agriculture and \nfood business, and in banking and securities? For the American people, \nhow this happens, I think, is no mystery.\n  I think most citizens believe there is a connection between big \nspecial interest money and outcomes in American politics. People \nrealize what is ``on the table'' or what is considered realistic here \nin Washington often has much to do with the flow of money to parties \nand to candidates. We must act to change this.\n  We must act to change this because the American people have lost \nfaith in the system. People are turning away from the political \nprocess. They are surrendering what belongs most exclusively to them, \ntheir right to be heard on the issues that affect them, simply because \nthey don't believe their voices will carry over the sound of all that \ncash. The degree of distrust, dissatisfaction, and outright hostility \nexpressed by the American people when asked about the political process \noverwhelms me. According to recent polls, cynicism abounds:\n  92 percent of all Americans believe special-interest contributions \nbuy votes of members of Congress.\n  88 percent believe that those who make large campaign contributions \nget special favors from politicians.\n  67 percent think that their own representative in Congress would \nlisten to the views of outsiders who made large political contributions \nbefore they would listen to their own constituents' views.\n\n  And nearly half of all registered voters believe lobbyists and \nspecial interests control the government in Washington.\n  We must act on campaign finance reform. We must act to restore \nAmericans' trust in our political process. We must act to renew their \nhope in the capacity of our political system to respond to our \nsociety's most basic problems and challenges. We must act to provide a \nchannel for the anger that many Americans feel about the current \nsystem, and acknowledge the grassroots reform movement that's been \nbuilding for years. These are our duties, and we must act to move the \nreform debate forward.\n  As Members of Congress, most pressing for us should be the question \nof why so many people no longer trust the political process, especially \nhere in Congress, and what we can do to restore that trust. Polls and \nstudies continue to show a profound distrust of Congress, and of our \nprocess. Many Americans see the system as inherently corrupt, and they \ndespair of making any real changes because they figure special \ninterests have the system permanently rigged.\n  I do not need to rehash the many serious problems with our campaign \nfinancing system. The bottom line is indisputable: the system does not \nhave--and has not had for many years--the confidence of the American \npeople. People have lost faith in Congress as an institution, in the \nlaws we pass, and in the democratic process itself, because of the \nmoney chase and its accompanying systemic corruption. Too often in our \nsystem, money determines political viability, it determines the issue \nagenda, and it determines to whom legislators are accountable: cash \nconstituencies, not real constituencies. Most troubling, money often \ndetermines election outcomes, and the public knows it.\n  Too many Americans believe that a small but wealthy and powerful \nelite controls the levers of government through a political process \nwhich rewards big donors--a system in which you have to pay to play. \nWhy do you think corporate welfare has barely been nicked, but welfare \nfor the poor and needy in this country has been gutted? The not-so-\ninvisible hand of corporate PACs and well-heeled lobbyists, and huge \ncorporate soft money contributions can be seen most openly here.\n  Too many Americans see our failures . . .\n  to alleviate the harsh, grinding poverty that characterizes the lives \nof too many of our inner-city residents,\n  to reduce the widening gulf between rich and poor,\n  to combat homelessness, drug addiction, decaying infrastructure, \nrising health care costs, and an unequal system of education.\n  And they want to know why we can't, or won't, act to address these \nproblems head-on. Americans understand that without real reform, \nattempts to restructure our health care system, create jobs and rebuild \nour cities, protect our environment, make our tax system fairer and \nmore progressive, fashion an energy policy that relies more on \nconservation and renewable sources, and solve other pressing problems \nwill remain frustrated by the pressures of special interests and big-\nmoney politics.\n  In thinking about reform legislation, I start with the premise that \npolitical democracy has several basic requirements:\n  First, free and fair elections. It is hard to say with a straight \nface that we have them now. That's why people stay home on election \nday, why they don't participate in the process. Incumbents outspend \nchallengers 8 or 10-1, millionaires spend their personal fortunes to \nbuy access to the airwaves, and special interests buy access to \nCongress itself, all of which warps and distorts the democratic \nprocess.\n  Second, the consent of the people. The people of this country, not \nspecial interest big money, should be the source of all political \npower. Government must remain the domain of the general citizenry, not \na narrow elite.\n  Third, political equality. Everyone must have equal opportunity to \nparticipate in the process of government. This means that the values \nand preferences of all citizens, not just those who can get our \nattention by waving large campaign contributions in front of us, must \nbe considered in the political debate. One person, one vote--no more \nand no less--the most fundamental of democratic principles.\n  Each of these principles is undermined by our current system, funded \nlargely through huge private contributions. Contributions that come \nwith their own price tag attached--greater access and special \nconsideration when push comes to shove. It's time for real reform.\n  Over the years, I have introduced and re-introduced campaign finance \nreform legislation, pushed amendments, organized my colleagues, given \nspeeches, observed a self-imposed fundraising code stricter than \ncurrent law, fought filibusters, and otherwise tried in every way I \ncould to get tough, sweeping reform enacted into law. All to no avail. \nTo my great regret, campaign finance reform so far has been \nsuccessfully blocked in Congress by those who oppose it, staunch \ndefenders all of the status quo.\n\n  Which is why I stand here today, re-introducing the ``Clean Money, \nClean Elections'' legislation that we introduced during the last \nCongress. We have tightened and strengthed some of the nuts and bolts \nof the legislation, but it is much the same bill that it was when we \nfirst introduced it: simple and sweeping, fundamental campaign finance \nreform.\n  If the 1994 elections are remembered as the year the Republicans \nswept into power in Congress, then the 1998 elections should go down as \nthe year that special-interest money smothered Washington. Money has \nalways played a role in American politics and campaign spending is not \na new problem, but it has exploded during the 1990s. In the 1993-94 \nelection cycle, the national political parties raised $18.8 million in \nsoft money contributions. By the 1997-98 election cycle that figure was \nup to $193.2 million in soft money. That's nearly a five-fold increase \nin just under five years. There can be no doubt that big money has \nbecome the primary currency of democracy in Washington.\n  In the 1995-96 election cycle, corporations, groups, and individuals \nrepresenting business interests outspent labor by 12-1. Individuals and \nPACs representing the natural resource industries (such as gas and oil \ncompanies) outspent environmental interests by an estimated 27-1 in \ncontributions to congressional candidates. Political contributions \nrepresenting finance, insurance, and real estate interests were in \nexcess of $130 million for the last election cycle. In the 1996 \nelection\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\ncycle, less than one-quarter of one percent of the American people made \ncontributions of more than $200 in a Federal election. Yet an \nastounding eighty percent of all political money came from this tiny \ngroup. Of all the economically-interested money given to Congressional \ncandidates, almost none represented the millions of Americans who are \npoor, or parents of public school children, or victimized by toxic \ndumping or agri-chemical contamination, or who are small bank \ndepositors and borrowers, or people dependent on public housing, \ntransportation, libraries, and hospitals. It is clear who is \nrepresented under the current system and who is shut out.\n  The bill I am introducing today strikes directly at the heart of the \ncrisis in the current system of campaign finance: the only way for \ncandidates of ordinary means to run for office and win is to raise vast \nsums of money from special interests, who in turn expect access and \ninfluence on public policy. Real campaign finance reform needs to \nrestore a level playing field, open up federal candidacies to all \ncitizens, end the perpetual money chase for Members of Congress, and \nlimit the influence of special interest groups. This legislation does \nall of these things by offering:\n  The strictest curbs on special-interest money and influence. The \n``Clean Money, Clean Elections'' legislation bans completely the use of \n``soft money'' to influence elections, discourages electioneering \nefforts masquerading as non-electoral ``issue ads,'' provides \nadditional funding to clean money candidates targeted by independent \nexpenditures, and most importantly, allows candidates to reject private \ncontributions if they agree to participate in the clean money system of \nfinancing.\n  The greatest reduction in the cost of campaigns. Because it \neliminates the need for fundraising expenses and provides a substantial \namount of free and discounted TV and/or radio time for Federal \ncandidates, this legislation allows candidates to spend far less than \never before on their campaigns.\n  The most competitive and fair election financing. By providing \nlimited but equal funding for qualified candidates, and additional \nfunding for clean money candidates if they are outspent by non-\nparticipating opponents, this legislation allows qualified individuals \nto run for office on a financially level playing field, regardless of \ntheir economic status or access to larger contributors. Right now, the \nsystem is wired for incumbents because they are connected to the \nconnected. The big players, the heavy hitters, tend to be attracted to \nincumbents, because that is where the power lies. This bill would allow \nall citizens to compete equally in the Federal election process.\n  And an end to the money chase, shorter elections, and stronger \nenforcement. ``Clean Money, Clean Elections'' campaign finance reform \nfrees candidates and elected officials from the burden of continuous \nfundraising and thus allows public officials to spend their time on \ntheir real duties. In effect, it also shortens the length of campaigns, \nwhen the public is bombarded with broadcast ads and mass mailings, by \nlimiting the period of time during which candidates receive their \nfunding. Moreover it strengthens the enforcement and disclosure \nrequirements in Federal election campaigns.\n  What I am proposing are fundamental changes, necessary changes if we \nhope to ever regain the public's confidence in the political process. \nThis legislation is both simple to understand and sweeping in scope. As \na voluntary system this bill is constitutional, and it effectively \nprovides a level playing field for all candidates who are able to \ndemonstrate a substantial base of popular support. ``Clean Money, Clean \nElections'' strengthens American democracy by returning political power \nto the ballot box and by blocking special interests' ability to skew \nthe system through large campaign contributions.\n  Most importantly, this legislation attacks the root cause of a system \nfounded on private special interest money, curing the disease rather \nthan treating the symptoms. The issue is no longer one of tightening \nalready existing campaign financing laws, no longer a question of \nwhat's legal and what's illegal. The real problem is that most of \nwhat's wrong with the current system is perfectly legal. Big money \nspecial interests know how to get around the letter of the law as it is \nnow written. This current system of funding congressional campaigns is \ninherently anti-democratic and unfair. It creates untenable conflicts \nof interests and screens out many good candidates. By favoring the deep \npockets of special interest groups, it tilts the playing field in a way \nthat sidelines the vast majority of Americans. This legislation takes \nspecial interest out of the election process and replaces it with the \npublic interest, returning our political process to the hallowed \nprinciple of one person, one vote.\n  I am not naive about the prospects for campaign finance reform during \nthis Congress, and realize that the sweeping reform bill that I am \nintroducing today is a ``vision bill.'' But that's okay, for as Yogi \nBerra is reported to have said, ``If you don't know where you're going, \nyou may end up someplace else.'' This is where I want to go, and where \nI believe the vast majority of Americans would also like to go. In one \nrecent survey, 48% percent of respondents thought they would be more \nlikely to see Elvis than real campaign finance reform. And while this \nis obviously a somewhat toungue-in-cheek response for many people, I \nthink it also reflects a deeply cynical electorate. For once let's not \nlive down to their worst expectations, and let's pass tough, \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform during this Congress.\n  I ask consent that a summary of the bill and a section-by-section \nanalysis be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Short Summary of ``Clean Money, Clean Elections'' Campaign Finance \n                           Reform Act of 1999\n\n\n                       ``clean money'' financing\n\n       Candidates voluntarily forgot private contributions and \n     accept strict spending limits in exchange for publicly \n     financed election funds, as well as other benefits such as \n     free or reduced rate prime access broadcast time.\n       Amount of ``clean money'' candidates receive in general \n     election based on state's Voting Age Population (VAP).\n       If the voting age population is less than 4 million: \n     $320,000 + VAP(.24)=clean money funding amount\n       If the voting age population is greater than 4 million: \n     $320,000 + VAP(.20)=clean money funding amount\n       Candidates receive 67% of general election funding for \n     contested primary election.\n       Additional clean money financing provided to match non-\n     participating opponents' expenditures in excess of spending \n     limits, as well as independent expenditures made against \n     clean money candidate or in favor of non-participating \n     opposition candidate.\n\n\n                             soft money ban\n\n       Prohibits national parties from soliciting or receiving \n     contributions or spending funds not subject to the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act (FECA).\n       Certain necessary state level activities are excluded from \n     these prohibitions, and the establishment of ``state party \n     grassroots funds'' is allowed for certain generic campaign \n     activity.\n\n\n             independent expenditures and express advocacy\n\n       Creates new, tighter definition of independent expenditures \n     to ensure proper distance from candidates.\n       Toughens reporting requirements for independent \n     expenditures.\n       Creates new definition for express advocacy using three \n     independent standards, any one of which meets definition \n     (provides ``fall back'' standard should any part of \n     definition be declared unconstitutional).\n       Exempts voting records and voting guides from definition of \n     express advocacy.\n\n\n                        reporting and disclosure\n\n       Limits a party's coordinated expenditures to 10 percent of \n     the amount of clean money the candidate is eligible to \n     receive for the general election.\n       Tightens the definition of party coordination, and requires \n     a party to limit its coordinated and independent \n     expenditures.\n       Doubles the penalties for ``knowing and wilful'' violations \n     of federal election law.\n       Requires Senate candidates to file disclosure reports and \n     disclosures electronically and directly with the Federal \n     Election Commission (FEC), which must then be made available \n     on the Internet within 24 hours.\n       Requires that campaign advertisements contain sufficient \n     information to clearly identify the candidate on whose behalf \n     the advertisements are placed.\n       Establishes new reporting requirements for issue \n     advertisements.\n                                  ____\n\n\n The Clean Money, Clean Elections Campaign Finance Reform Act--Section-\n                               by-Section\n\n       Section 1.

Section 101 states \n     the purposes of the legislation.\n\n[[Page S4905]]\n\n       Section 102. Eligibility requirements and benefits of \n     ``clean money'' financing of Senate election campaigns. \n     Section 102 of the bill would create a new Title V in the \n     1971 Federal Election Campaign Act (2 U.S.C. 431). It defines \n     ``clean money,'' establishes the requirements for a major \n     party or other candidate to qualify and receive clean money; \n     establishes the dates and methods for receiving clean money; \n     places restrictions, including spending limits, on clean \n     money candidates; establishes the amounts of clean money to \n     be provided to candidates for primary and general elections; \n     and allows for providing additional clean money to match \n     expenditures by and on behalf of an opponent which exceed a \n     trigger-amount above the voluntary spending limit adopted by \n     the clean money candidate.\n       The section defines clean money as the funds provided to a \n     qualifying clean money candidate. Clean money will be \n     provided from a Senate Election Fund established in the \n     Treasury and composed of unspent seed money contributions, \n     qualifying contributions, penalties, and amounts appropriated \n     for clean money financing of Senate election campaigns.\n       The clean money candidate qualifying period begins 270 days \n     prior to the date of the primary election. To qualify for \n     clean money financing for a primary or a general election, a \n     candidate must be certified as qualified by 30 days prior to \n     the date of that election. Prior to the candidate receiving \n     clean money from the Senate Election Fund, a candidate \n     wishing to qualify as a clean money candidate may spend only \n     ``seed money.'' Seed money contributions are private \n     contributions of not more than $100 in the aggregate by a \n     person. It is the only private money a clean money candidate \n     may receive as a contribution and spend. A candidate's seed \n     money contributions are limited to a total of $50,000 plus an \n     additional $5,000 for every congressional district in the \n     state over one. Seed money can be spent on campaign related \n     costs such as to open an office, to fund a grassroots \n     campaign or hold community meetings, but cannot be spent for \n     a television or radio broadcast or for personal use. At the \n     time that a clean money candidate receives clean money, all \n     unspent seed money shall be remitted to the Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC) to be deposited in the Senate Election Fund.\n       To qualify for clean money financing, a major party \n     candidate must gather a number of qualifying contributions \n     equal to one-quarter of 1 percent of the state's voting age \n     population, or 1,000 qualifying contributions, whichever is \n     greater. A qualifying contribution is $5, made by an \n     individual registered to vote in the candidate's state, and \n     is made during the qualifying period. Qualifying \n     contributions are made to the Senate Election Fund by check, \n     money order, or cash. They shall be accompanied by the \n     contributor's name and address and a signed statement that \n     the purpose of the contribution is to allow the named \n     candidate to qualify as a clean money candidate.\n       A major party candidate is the candidate of a party whose \n     candidate for Senator, President, or Governor in the \n     preceding 5 years received, as a candidate of that party, 25 \n     percent or more of the total popular vote in that state for \n     all candidates for that office.\n       Clean money candidates qualify for clean money for both the \n     primary and the general election. A qualifying candidate will \n     receive clean money for the primary election upon being \n     certified by the FEC, and once the ``primary election \n     period'' has begun. A candidate will be certified within 5 \n     days of filing for certification if the candidate has \n     gathered the threshold number of contributions, has not spent \n     private money other than seed money, and is eligible to be on \n     the primary ballot. The primary election period is from 90 \n     days prior to the primary election date until the primary \n     election date. The qualifying period begins 180 days before \n     the beginning of the primary election period. A candidate \n     must be certified as a clean money candidate 30 days prior to \n     the primary election in order to receive clean money \n     financing for the primary election.\n       A clean money candidate who wins the party primary and is \n     eligible to be placed on the ballot for the general election \n     will receive clean money financing for the general election. \n     A candidate not of a major party who does not qualify as a \n     clean money candidate in time to receive clean money \n     financing for the primary election period may still qualify \n     for clean money financing for the general election by \n     gathering the threshold number of qualifying contributions by \n     30 days prior to the general election and qualifying to be on \n     the ballot.\n       The amount of clean money a qualified candidate receives \n     for the primary and general election is also the spending \n     limit for clean money candidates for each respective \n     election. The clean money amount for the general election for \n     a qualified clean money candidate is established according to \n     a formula based on a state's voting age population. The \n     section establishes a clean money ceiling for the general \n     election of $4.4 million, and a floor of $760,000. The clean \n     money amount for a contested major party primary is 67 \n     percent of the clean money amount for the general election. \n     In the case of an uncontested primary or general election, \n     the clean money amount is 25 percent of the amount provided \n     in the case of a contested election.\n       To qualify for clean money financing, a candidate who is \n     not a major party candidate must collect 150 percent of the \n     number of qualifying contributions that a major party \n     candidate in the same election is required to collect. A \n     candidate who is not a major party candidate must otherwise \n     qualify for clean money financing according to the same \n     requirements, restrictions and deadlines as does a major \n     party candidate. A candidate who is not a major party \n     candidate who qualifies as a clean money candidate in the \n     primary election period will receive 25 percent of \n     the regular clean money amount for a major party candidate \n     in the primary. A candidate who is not a major party \n     candidate who qualifies as a clean money candidate will \n     receive the same clean money amount in the general \n     election as will a major party candidate.\n       Additional clean money financing, above the regular clean \n     money amount, will be provided to a clean money candidate to \n     match aggregate expenditures by a private money candidate and \n     independent expenditures against the clean money candidate or \n     on behalf of an opponent of the clean money candidate, which \n     are, separately or combined, in excess of 125 percent of the \n     clean money spending limit. The total amount of matching \n     clean money financing received by a candidate shall not \n     exceed 200 percent of the regular clean money spending limit.\n       The section establishes penalties for the misuse of clean \n     money and for expenditure by a clean money candidate of money \n     other than clean money.\n       Section 103. Reporting requirements for expenditures of \n     private money candidates. Section 103 requires private money \n     candidates facing clean money opponents to report within 48 \n     hours expenditures which in aggregate exceed the amount of \n     clean money provided to a clean money candidate. A report of \n     additional expenditures, in aggregate increments of $1,000, \n     will also be required.\n       Section 104. Transition rule for current election cycle. \n     Section 104 allows a candidate who received private \n     contributions or made private expenditures prior to enactment \n     of the Act not to be disqualified as a clean money candidate.\n\n TITLE II--INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES; COORDINATED EXPENDITURES, pp. 33-\n                                  50.\n\n       Section 201. Reporting requirements for independent \n     expenditures. Section 201 amends Section 304(c) of the 1971 \n     FECA (2 U.S.C. 434(c)) to require reporting of independent \n     expenditures made or obligated to be made by a person in \n     support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for office. \n     Prior to 20 days before the date of the election, each such \n     independent expenditure which exceeds in aggregate $1,000 by \n     a person shall be reported within 48 hours. After 20 days \n     prior to the date of the election, each such independent \n     expenditure made or obligated to be made which exceeds in \n     aggregate $500 shall be reported within 24 hours.\n       Section 202. Definition of independent expenditure. Section \n     202 amends section 301 of the 1971 FECA (2 U.S.C. 431) to \n     create a new definition of independent expenditure. An \n     independent expenditure would be an expenditure made by a \n     person other than a candidate or candidate's authorized \n     committee that is made for a communication that contains \n     express advocacy; and is made without the participation or \n     cooperation of, and without coordination with, a candidate.\n       The section defines express advocacy as a communication \n     that is made through a broadcast medium, newspaper, magazine, \n     billboard, direct mail, or other general public communication \n     or political advertising and that advocates the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate, including a \n     communication that contains a phrase such as ``vote for'', \n     ``re-elect'', ``support'', ``cast your ballot for'', ``(name \n     of candidate) for Congress'', ``(name of candidate) in \n     (year)'', ``vote against'', ``defeat'', ``reject''; or \n     contains campaign slogans or individual words that in context \n     can have no reasonable meaning other than to recommend the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate;\n\n     OR\n\n       A communication that refers to a clearly identified \n     candidate in a paid advertisement that is broadcast through \n     radio or television; involves aggregate disbursements of \n     $5,000 or more; and is made within the last 60 days before \n     the date of the general election.\n       The section provides a fall back definition of express \n     advocacy should a portion of the above definition not be in \n     effect. The fall-back definition would be in addition to any \n     portion of the above still in effect. The fall-back \n     definition establishes that express advocacy would be a \n     communication that clearly identifies a candidate, and taken \n     as a whole, with limited reference to external events, \n     expresses unmistakable support for or opposition to the \n     candidate; or is made for the clear purpose of advocating the \n     election or defeat of the candidate, as shown by a statement \n     or action by the person making the communication, the \n     targeting or placement of the communication, and the use by \n     the person making the communication of polling, demographic \n     or other similar data relating to the candidate's campaign \n     for election.\n       Each standard is severable from the others and any one \n     standard is sufficient to meet the definition of express \n     advocacy. Voting records and voting guides are exempted from \n     the definition of express advocacy.\n       Section 203. Limits on expenditures by political party \n     committees. The section amends section 315(d)(3) of the 1971 \n     FECA (2 U.S.C.\n\n[[Page S4906]]\n\n     441a(d)(3)) to limit a party's coordinated expenditures in a \n     race involving a clean money candidate. In the case of any \n     Senate election in which 1 or more candidates are clean money \n     candidates, the amount that any party may spend in connection \n     with that race or in coordination with a candidate is limited \n     to 10 percent of the amount of clean money a clean money \n     candidate is eligible to receive for the general election.\n       Section 204. Party independent expenditures and coordinated \n     expenditures. The section, modeled after H.R. 417, the Shays-\n     Meehan bill, strictly tightens the definition of party \n     coordination in numerous ways. The section also requires a \n     party which makes a coordinated expenditure in connection \n     with a general election campaign for Federal office in excess \n     of $5,000 to file a certification that the party will not \n     make any independent expenditures in connection with that \n     campaign. The section further tightens the definition of \n     coordinated expenditure by persons other than a party. It \n     establishes that coordinated expenditures shall be considered \n     to be contributions made to a candidate (with an exception \n     that allows the limited party coordinated expenditures on \n     behalf of a clean money candidate as provided in Section \n     203).\n\n                TITLE III--VOTER INFORMATION, pp. 50-60.\n\n       Section 301. Free broadcast time. The section provides \n     clean money candidates with 30 minutes of free broadcast time \n     during the primary election period and 60 minutes of free \n     broadcast time during the general election period. The \n     broadcasts shall be between 30 seconds and 5 minutes in \n     length, aired during prime time for television or drive time \n     for radio. Any one station shall not be required to provide a \n     clean money candidate with more than 15 minutes of free time \n     during an election period.\n       Section 302. Broadcast rates and preemption. A clean money \n     candidate in a contested election shall be charged 50 percent \n     of the lowest charge described in section 315(b) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 315(b)) for purchased \n     broadcast time during the 30 days preceding the primary and \n     60 days preceding the general election.\n       Section 303. Campaign advertisements; issue advertisements. \n     The section requires that campaign advertisements contain \n     sufficient information clearly identifying the candidate on \n     whose behalf the advertisements are placed.

The Act and the amendments \n     made by the Act would take effect on January 1, 2000.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my friends, Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts and Senator Wellstone of Minnesota, and commend them on \nthe introduction of their campaign finance reform proposal, the Clean \nMoney bill. I am very pleased that they are once again introducing this \nfar reaching and visionary piece of legislation. I think it is \nimportant as we deal in this Senate with the more limited bill that I \nhave proposed with the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, that the \nAmerican people understand that we do not believe that the job will be \ncompleted if that bill becomes law.\n  Of course, I also want to thank Senators Kerry and Wellstone for \ntheir strong support of the McCain-Feingold bill. I also want to make \nit very clear that these two pieces of legislation are completely \nconsistent and complimentary. The Clean Money bill introduced today \ncontains the central components of the McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan \nbills--a soft money ban, provisions to deal with phony issue ads, and \nimproved enforcement and disclosure. But it adds a comprehensive system \nof financing Senate campaigns, based on initiatives that have been \nendorsed by the voters in Maine, Massachusetts, and Arizona for their \nstate elections, to provide public funding to qualified candidates for \nstate officeholders.\n  Mr. President, when I first ran for the Wisconsin State Senate many \nyears ago, my race would literally not have been possible were it not \nfor Wisconsin's system of partial public financing. Under the state \nsystem in effect at that time, I had to raise approximately $17,500 \nfrom friends and family, and the state election fund provided a grant \nof the same amount. So once I raised my share, my fundraising work was \ndone, and I could spend my time going door to door campaigning. I won \nthat first race by only a few votes, and I'm convinced that my retail \ncampaigning was the difference. So I believe it is fair to say that I \nwouldn't be\n\n[[Page S4907]]\n\nin the United States Senate today if Wisconsin didn't have that system \nof public financing, that allowed a person of limited means to run for \noffice, and win.\n  Today, all over the country, citizens are coming to realize that the \nmoney chase that is required to run for office is depriving them of \ngood candidates and representatives. Not everyone who would be a \nhardworking and effective public servant comes from a wealthy \nbackground or from a community of friends or business associates who \ncan finance a campaign. And so the Clean Money movement is taking hold \nin state after state. Overwhelming majorities in polls taken on this \nissue support a Clean Money system, where candidates raise a large \nnumber of very small contributions to qualify for a limited public \ngrant to run an adequate, but not an extravagant, campaign. These \npolls, and the successful ballot initiatives in Maine, Massachusetts, \nand Arizona show that the public is not only ready, but eager, for a \nnew way of financing our elections.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, a majority in the United States Senate is \nnot yet ready for such a clean break with the current system. But I \nbelieve that over time we in the Senate will catch up with public \nsentiment, and this is the way we will have to go. I am convinced that \nClean Money is the future of campaign financing in this country, at \nboth the state and federal level. And so I am very pleased that \nSenators Kerry and Wellstone have decided to reintroduce their bill and \nI thank them for their leadership.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 983. A bill to require the Secretary of Transportation to issue \nregulations to provide for improvements in the conspicuity of rail cars \nof rail carriers; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                      railroad car visibility act\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Railroad \nCar Visibility Act, which would require all railroad cars--including \nthose on passenger an commuter trains--to have some form of reflective \nmarker.\n  This legislation provides a simply way to improve rail car visibility \nat rail crossings and sidings, sites where many accidents have occurred \nin recent years. When crossings and sidings are in rural areas or near \nsmall towns--as is often the case in South Dakota--they usually are \nunlit or very poorly lit, increasing the potential for disaster. While \nlocomotives are required to use lighting such as ditch lights to \nincrease visibility, rail cars are often unmarked, which means they are \ndifficult for automobile drivers to see. This legislation attempts to \nremedy this problem by requiring that all rail cars display some form \nof visible marker, such as reflectors of reflective tape.\n  Last year, the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a memorandum \non reflective markings and their effectiveness for increasing \nvisibility. DOT tested several different types of reflectors, including \ndifferent colors and patterns, The memorandum concludes that ``bright \ncolor patterns distributed to give an indication of the size or shape \nof the rail car make the most effective marking systems.'' Fitting rail \ncars with reflective materials would be relatively inexpensive but, by \nincreasing visibility, would reduce the number of accidents, \nunnecessary injuries and deaths at rail crossings and sidings. As one \nrailroad executive has said, ``It's sort of a tragedy that something \nthat makes so much common sense has to be legislated. Everyone should \ndo it. The railroad industry is its own worst enemy sometimes.\n  This legislation has the support of both South Dakota's legislature \nand Governor Janklow. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand work with me to secure its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the bill printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 983\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4907-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4907-S4914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n           THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL GAMING AGREEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce The Intergovernmental \nGaming Agreement Act of 1999 to address an area of contention between \ntribes and states that centers on the ability of tribes to operate \ngaming activities on their lands.\n  In 1988, virtually no one contemplated that Indian gaming would \nbecome the billion dollar industry that exists today, providing some \ntribes with much needed capital for development and employment \nopportunities where none previously existed.\n  Because of gaming, some tribes have been very successful, fortunate \nmostly because of their geographical location. These tribes employ \nthousands of people, both Indian and non-Indian, and have greatly \nreduced the welfare rolls in their local area.\n  It is extremely important for us to keep these facts, and the goals \nof the gaming statute in mind and to remember that where gaming exists, \nit provides a great opportunity for tribes to develop other business \nand development projects. However, it must also be recognized that not \nall tribes will find the keys to a brighter economic future in gaming.\n  In the 1987 Cabazon case, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that tribes \ncould operate casino style gaming without the consent or regulation of \nthe state, in cases where the state otherwise allowed such gambling.\n  In 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, otherwise \nknown as ``IGRA'', as a compromise between states and tribes. IGRA was \nan attempt to allow tribes to continue to develop the gaming operations \nallowed under federal case law, but gave states for the first time the \nright to have some say in how those operations would be regulated.\n  It was not Congress' intention in enacting IGRA to provide States \nwith veto authority over a tribe's plans to develop gaming operations.\n  Unfortunately, a few States have attempted to do just this, and at \nleast two states have effectively prevented tribes from opening gaming \noperations by simply refusing to negotiate with them.\n  A group of tribes and states has been attempting to negotiate their \ndifferences and have been doing so for some 18 months, to no avail. As \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs knows well after numerous hearings, \neach side has presented demands in such a way that the other is simply \nunwilling to consider.\n  I firmly believe The Intergovernmental Gaming Agreement Act of 1999 \nwill go a long way in solving this problem by encouraging full and fair \nnegotiations and by allowing each side recourse to federal court at the \ncritical stage in the mediation stage of the proposed process.\n  The Intergovernmental Gaming Agreement Act of 1999 requires tribes to \nnegotiate with states for purposes of concluding a class III gaming \nagreement. Only when states refuse to negotiate outright or reach an \nimpasse during negotiations by failing to come to agreement within six \nmonths of the tribe's request for negotiation, can a tribe access the \nalternative procedures outlined in this bill.\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\n  Once the tribe applies for procedures with the Secretary of the \nInterior, the Secretary first must attempt to reconcile state-tribal \ndifferences by referring the parties to mediation. Even when a tribe \nhas applied to begin the procedure for developing a class III compact, \nthe state has full and unfettered access to the procedure at every \nstage.\n  This legislation allows the state to intervene in the process at the \npoint of their choosing and, when all is said and done, the states have \nthe right to challenge the outcome in federal district court.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord and urge my colleagues to support these reasonable and necessary \namendments.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 985\n\n       Be it enacted in the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey the \nGriffith Project to the Southern Nevada Water Authority; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             griffith project prepayment and conveyance act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Griffith \nProject Prepayment and Conveyance Act. This act directs the Secretary \nof Interior to convey the Robert B. Griffith Water Project, located in \nClark County, Nevada, to the Southern Nevada Water Authority. To \nunderstand the intent of this bill, it is necessary to briefly discuss \nthe history of the water delivery system which supports the Las Vegas \nValley.\n  The Robert B. Griffith Water Project, also known as the Southern \nNevada Water Project, was conceived as a federal reclamation project in \nClark County, Nevada, in the 1960's.\n  Authorized by Congress in 1965, the enabling legislation directed the \nSecretary of Interior to construct, operate, and maintain the project \nfor the purpose of delivering water to Clark County for both municipal \nand industrial use. The Congressional authorization also allowed the \nSecretary of enter into a contract with the State of Nevada, through \nduly authorized agencies, for the delivery of water and the repayment \nof reimbursable construction costs.\n  The federal portion of the Southern Nevada Water Project was \ncompleted in two stages over a period of 15 years at a cost of just \nunder $200 million dollars, including capitalized interest. In 1982, \nwith federal construction substantially completed, Congress officially \nchanged the name of the project from the Southern Nevada Water Project \nto the Robert B. Griffith Water Project.\n  Coincidental with the federal construction of the water project, the \nState of Nevada, acting through the Colorado River Commission, \nconstructed the Alfred Merritt Smith Water Treatment Plant. This \nfacility is integrated into the Griffith Project, and together the \nfacilities are referred to as the Southern Nevada Water System. \nPrincipal users of the water supplied by the system include the Las \nVegas Valley Water District, the cities of Boulder, Henderson, and \nNorth Las Vegas, and Nellis Air Force Base.\n  In 1991, in the fact of dramatic growth in Clark County and the Las \nVegas Valley, the State of Nevada, in cooperation with seven other \npublic agencies, created the Southern Nevada Water Authority. The \npurpose of the Authority included acquisition of additional water \nsupplies and the operation, maintenance, and expansion of the Southern \nNevada Water System.\n  Beginning in 1995, the Colorado River Commission and the Southern \nNevada Water Authority each began constructing additional facilities to \nexpand the operational capacity of the Southern Nevada Water Authority \neach began constructing additional facilities to expand the operational \ncapacity of the Southern Nevada Water System. By agreement in 1996, the \nState of Nevada and the Colorado River Commission assigned all of their \ninterests, responsibilities, and liabilities in the System to the \nSouthern Nevada Water Authority.\n  The Authority has now embarked on a multi-phrase expansion of the \nSouthern Nevada Water System. When completed, this expansion is \nexpected to have a capital cost exceeding $2 billion. The entire cost \nof the expansion is being financed through the Authority and its \nmembers.\n  One can see that the scope of the System is now much greater than \nthat originally foreseen by Congress in 1965. When the first phrase of \nthe original Southern Nevada Water Project was completed in 1971, fully \n85% of the costs had been incurred by the federal government. At the \nend of 1998, the percentage of outstanding indebtedness financed by the \nfederal government had fallen to 14% as compared to 86% for the \nSouthern Nevada Water Authority. When the project expansion now being \nundertaken by the Authority is ultimately completed sometime around \n2017, only 6% of the overall costs will have been financed by the \nfederal government.\n  Because certain portions of the overall system are still in the name \nof the United States, it is becoming increasingly burdensome for the \nSouthern Nevada Water Authority to manage the operation and management \nof the system. If for example, a pump station in the Griffith Project \nportion of the system requires repair or maintenance, Authority \nemployees must notify the Bureau of Reclamation that a repair is \nneeded, describe the exact nature of the work to be performed, obtain \npermission for a crew to perform the work and schedule the work to be \ndone at such a time as when a Bureau of Reclamation employee can be \npresent to ``oversee'' the repair or maintenance. When the work is \ncompleted, the Bureau of Reclamation sends the Authority an invoice for \nthe time spent by its personnel.\n  The time has come for the title to the Griffith Project components of \nthe Southern Nevada Water System to be transferred to local ownership. \nAs proposed, this conveyance will occur under financial terms and \nconditions that are similar to other title transfer laws which have \nbeen enacted for other projects and which are governed by guidance from \nthe Department of the Interior and the Office of Management and Budget. \nIn particular, the conveyance will require a payment to the United \nStates by the Authority equal to the net present value of the remaining \nrepayment obligation.\n  I thank my fellow Senator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan, for his support on \nthis issue and look forward to working with the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to ensure timely consideration of this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objecion, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about probably the \nmost important thing we do as a society--educating our children. This \nweek is National Teacher Appreciation Week, and it gives us a good \nopportunity to recognize the crucial role teachers play in our \nchildren's lives. After parents and families, America's teachers play \nthe most important role in helping our children realize their \npotential. No teacher can replace the role of loving and attentive \nfamilies, but once our children leave their homes and enter America's \nschools, it is the responsibility of federal, state and local elected \nofficials to provide every possible opportunity for a child to realize \nhis or her full potential.\n  The way to do that, Mr. President, is to see that every child learns \nfrom a qualified educator in a safe school environment.\n  As the Senate begins to consider education legislation, we should \ntake time to listen to the lessons learned by America's best classroom \nteachers--teachers like Ohio's Teacher of the Year, Ellen Binkley Hill. \nOhio is fortunate to have teachers like Ellen, and the thirty two other \nfinalists for Ohio's Teacher of the Year.\n  Ellen teaches second grade at New Vienna Elementary School in Clinton \nCounty, Ohio. Over the past year I have had the pleasure of talking \nwith Ellen on two occasions--and I want to take a moment to read how \nEllen describes the role of a teacher, because I think her words \ncapture what it means to be a great educator.\n  I quote: ``Teachers must be living examples of the transforming power \nof education. We must lead extraordinary lives filled with insight, \nrich with experiences, and tempered with compassion. It is every \nteacher's responsibility to serve each child, empowering all children \nto reach their potential, and then to reach higher.'' End of quote.\n  Mr. President, as a father, I want my children to learn from teachers \nlike Ellen Binkley Hill. As a Senator, I would like to see all of the \nnation's children being taught by teachers like Ellen Binkley Hill.\n\n  A qualified, highly trained teacher is the most important education \nresource in any classroom. Across America today, in classrooms around \nthe country, tomorrow's business leaders, tomorrow's inventors, \ntomorrow's doctors, tomorrow's Presidents, and even tomorrow's teachers \nare building their foundation of learning, their foundation of \nexperiences that will shape their lives forever. They are being led \nthrough this process by our neighbors, friends and family members who \nmake up America's 2.7 million-member teaching force.\n  Mr. President, in the spirit of this important week, I am introducing \nfour bills that I believe will help our teachers realize their highest \npotential in our classrooms, and ensure that our children have the best \npossible educator at the front of their classroom.\n  The first bill is the Teacher Mentoring Act. America's teaching force \nis aging, a situation that offers both benefits and challenges. The \naverage school teacher is 43 years old, an increase of 3 years over the \naverage age in 1987. Nearly a quarter of our teachers are over 50 years \nold and nearing retirement.\n  These seasoned veterans are the backbone of many schools across the \ncountry. Many are also leaders in their schools and their communities, \ntaking on the added challenges of educating the most difficult students \nand mentoring their younger peers. As these experienced educators near \nthe end of their careers, we must ensure that the practical hands-on \nknowledge they have accumulated is passed on to those teachers \nfollowing in their footsteps.\n  Mr. President, new teachers entering today's challenging classrooms \nneed the close support of these veteran teachers, particularly during \ntheir first few years on the job. Unfortunately, more than 25 percent \nof new teachers leave the job in their first three years and I believe \nmentoring programs are one way we can help stabilize the ranks of our \nnew teachers.\n  The Teacher Mentoring Act, which is the companion to a bill written \nby my friend Congressman Rick Lazio [LA (as LAdder)-ZEE-OH] of New \nYork, would establish a $10 million competitive grant program. \nThis program would encourage states to implement training programs, or \nsupport existing programs that utilize our experienced classroom \nveterans as mentors to new teachers. Ohio is currently operating a \nmentoring program that assigns each new teacher to a mentor. These \nmentors provide classroom teaching advice, as well as an experienced \nshoulder to lean on when they first enter their new school.\n\n  The second bill I am introducing today is the Alternative \nCertification and Licensure of Teachers Act. This bill would improve \nthe supply of well-qualified elementary and secondary school teachers \nby encouraging and assisting States to develop and implement programs \nfor alternative routes to teacher certification or licensure \nrequirements. After all, the most important and effective education \nresource in any classroom is a highly trained and dedicated teacher.\n  There are many talented professionals who have demonstrated a high \nlevel of subject area competence outside the education profession who \nwish to pursue careers in eduction, but have not fulfilled the \nrequirements to be certified or licensed as teachers. Alternative \ncertification can provide an opportunity for these people to become \nteachers--so they can share their knowledge and experiences with \nchildren in the classroom.\n  The legislation would provide $15 million to the States for either \nnew or pre-existing alternative certification programs or fund pre-\nexisting programs. Last year's Higher Education Act endorsed \nalternative certification as a means to enlarge the pool of quality \nteachers--but I believe we need to go further. We need to continue to \nopen alternative certification routes to attract teachers who would \notherwise not enter the classroom.\n  The third bill I am introducing today is the Teacher Quality Act.\n  We have learned from various studies that the most effective teacher \ntraining programs have some things in common. Both teachers and \nteaching program evaluators agree that the most effective teacher \ntraining programs are intensive; are of reasonable length, and provide \nan avenue for teachers to update their skills. The Teacher Quality Act \nwould help improve the quality of teachers in elementary and secondary \nschools--and provide teachers the opportunity to learn new technologies \nand increase subject matter knowledge.\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\nMy bill would establish a competitive grant program that will give \nschool districts the opportunity to establish teacher training \nfacilities.\n\n  The idea for this legislation is based on the model established by \nthe Mayerson Academy in Cincinnati, Ohio. This Academy was established \nin 1992 as a partnership between the Cincinnati business community and \nits schools. Their mission: to provide the highest quality training and \nprofessional development opportunities to the men and women responsible \nfor educating the children of Cincinnati.\n  The program is a great success. This school year the Academy will \nprovide 160,000 hours of training to teachers. The Mayerson Academy is \nseparate from the school system in order to ensure independent \nevaluation of its results and a consistent base of support. This status \nalso allows it to benefit from the perspectives and experience of the \nbusiness leadership.\n  Finally, I am introducing the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse \nImprovement Act.\n  Collecting and effective disseminating the best teacher training \npractices is an important responsibility of the federal government. The \nEisenhower National Clearinghouse, or ENC, is the nation's repository \nof K-12 instructional materials specifically related to math and \nscience education. This information is made available in a user-\nfriendly format for educators. The Ohio State University is currently \nhome to the Clearinghouse.\n  Since 1992, ENC has distributed over 3.67 million CD-ROM's and print \npublications. Products are distributed to schools, colleges of \neducation, and various education groups and professional organizations \nacross the country. ENC has received over 40 million hits on their web \nsite since its creation in 1994. In addition, ENC has established over \n100 Access Centers across the country to expand direct service to more \nteachers.\n  While this program has proven its value, there is room for \nimprovement. The bill I am introducing today would expand ENC's \njurisdiction to include Language Arts and Social Studies, with a \nparticular emphasis in all curriculum areas on effective use \nof educational technology.\n\n  With thousands of teacher training programs available, it is becoming \nincreasingly difficult for educators to find out which programs have \nbeen proven effective and which have not. My legislation would require \nENC to gather a sampling of the best evaluations on the materials they \ncollect and provide easy access to these evaluations. ENC will not be \npermitted to conduct evaluations directly, but would be required to \ncreate a ranking for materials and programs based on the reviews they \ncollect and make these reviews easily accessible to teachers who \nutilize their service.\n  All four of these bills would help improve the quality of education. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues on these and other \nimportant education measures. Before I close, let me mention one other \nkey issue affecting the education of our kids--school violence.\n  The threat of violence--and the reality of drug abuse--in our schools \nare all too real. We must ensure that America's families and teachers \nare empowered with the information, training and resources to help our \nchildren overcome these obstacles. This year, as a member of the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee I will be working with \nthe other members of the committee to reauthorize the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, which includes the Safe and Drug Free Schools \nAct. The recent tragic events in Colorado are a painful reminder that \nwe need to do everything we can to improve our violence and drug abuse \nprevention efforts and these reauthorizations, as well as the upcoming \ndebate on the juvenile justice reform legislation, provide us with \nexcellent opportunities for this Congress to make a positive difference \nin the name of school safety.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the \nfinalists for Ohio's Teacher of the Year be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the names were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                   OHIO TEACHER OF THE YEAR--FINALISTS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Teacher                     School           School district\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrenda Baker Gehm.............

A bill to prevent the receipt, transfer, transportation, or \npossession of a firearm or ammunition by certain violent juvenile \noffenders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 youth violence prevention act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Youth \nViolence Prevention Act of 1999.'' This legislation will prevent \njuveniles from illegally accessing weapons and punish those who would \nassist them in doing so, prohibit juveniles who commit acts of gun \nviolence from purchasing guns in the future, and punish juveniles who \nillegally carry or use handguns in schools.\n  Before I get into the particulars of the legislation, I would like to \ntake a moment to discuss the broader issues surrounding the question of \nyouth violence.\n  Recent events have shaken the collective conscience of our nation. \nThe recent killings at Columbine High School in Colorado have brought \nhome to every American the degree to which we are failing are children.\n  The most basic and profound responsibility that our culture--any \nculture--\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\nhas is raising its children. We are failing in that responsibility, and \nthe extent of our failure is being measured in deaths and injuries of \nkids in schoolyards and on the streets of our neighborhoods and \ncommunities.\n  Over the past few years, we have been jolted time and again by the \nhorrifying images of school shootings. Every day, in towns and cities \nacross this country, kids are killing kids, and kids are killing \nadults, in a spiraling pattern of youth violence driven by the drug \ntrade, gang activity, and other factors.\n  Primary responsibility lies with families. As a country, we are not \nparenting our children. We are not adequately involving ourselves in \nour children's lives, the friends they hang out with, what they do with \ntheir time, the problems they are struggling with. This is our job, our \nparamount responsibility, and we are failing. We must get our \npriorities straight, and that means putting our kids first.\n  Parents need help. They need help because our homes and our families, \nand our children's minds, are being flooded with a tide of violence \nthat pervades our society. Movies depict graphic violence, and children \nare taught to kill and maim by interactive  video games. The Internet, \nwhich holds such tremendous potential in so many ways, is tragically \nused by some to communicate unimaginable hatred, images and \ndescriptions of violence, and ``how-to'' manuals on everything from \nbomb construction to drugs. Our culture is dominated by media, and our \nchildren, more so than any generation before them, are vulnerable to \nthe images of violence and hate that, unfortunately, are dominant \nthemes in so much of what they see and hear.\n\n  I have recently joined with some of my colleagues to call upon the \nPresident to convene an emergency summit of the leaders of the \nentertainment and interactive media industry to develop an action plan \nfor controlling children's access to media violence. I am pleased that \nthe President has heeded this call and will convene such a summit next \nweek.\n  I have also joined others in introducing legislation calling upon the \nSurgeon General to conduct a comprehensive study of media violence, in \nall its forms, and to issue a report on its effects, with \nrecommendations on how we can turn around this tragic tide of youth \nviolence.\n  These are important steps targeting various aspects of the complex \nproblem of youth violence. However, we must press the fight on every \nfront. One reality of the horrific gun violence that is so prevalent \namong our youth is the illegal use of guns. The legislation I am \nintroducing today is specifically targeted at the illegal means by \nwhich kids are acquiring guns and is designed to ensure that violence \nyouth offenders are punished, and that they will not acquire guns in \nthe future.\n  First, the bill extends the provisions of the Gun Control Act that \nprohibit certain purchases to include juveniles. Currently, under \nfederal law, a juvenile may commit multiple violent felonies, using a \ngun, and when he or she turns 18 years old, that same individual may \nwalk into a gun store and legally purchase a weapon. This is absurd. \nThis legislation would prevent them from doing so. Where a juvenile has \ncommitted an offense that would constitute a violent felony if he or \nshe were an adult, that juvenile will be sentenced as an adult and will \nbe ineligible to be paroled simply because they turn 18.\n  Second, this legislation provides that whoever illegally purchases a \nweapon for another individual, knowing that the recipient intends to \ncommit a violent felony, may be imprisoned up to 15 years. Further, \nwhoever illegally purchases or transfers a weapon to a juvenile, \nknowing that the recipient intends to commit a violent felony, may be \nimprisoned up to 20 years.\n\n  Under this legislation, if a juvenile illegally possesses a handgun \nand violates the Gun Free School Zone law with the intent to carry, \npossess, discharge, or otherwise use the handgun or ammunition in the \ncommission of a violent felony, they may be imprisoned for up to 20 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, let me make very clear that this legislation in no way \ninfringes on the Second Amendment rights to bear arms. I do not believe \nwe should further restrict the rights of law-abiding Americans to own a \ngun. Rather, we should focus on halting the spread of violent crime and \npunishing violent criminals who abuse their Second Amendment rights. I \nbelieve it is imperative to better safeguard children from the \ndangerous effects of violent crime in America, as well as educate them \non the potential danger of weapons.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not a panacea. As I have stated, \nthe malady of youth violence that is eating at the soul of this nation \nis a complex disease. It will require a multi-faceted cure. As I have \noutlined, I am pushing for a comprehensive approach. What we must have, \nif there is any hope, is the unqualified commitment of all Americans to \nraise our children, to put them first. I urge all Americans to get \ninvolved in their kids' lives. Ask questions, listen to their fears and \nconcerns, their hopes and their dreams.\n  Childhood is a time of innocence, a time to teach discipline and \nvalues. Our children are our most precious gifts, they are full of \ninnocence and hope. We must work together to preserve the sanctity of \nchildhood.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Youth \nViolence Prevention Act of 1999 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 991\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Violence Prevention \n     Act of 1999.''\n\n     SEC. 2.

\non the Judiciary\n\n                               S. Res. 98\n\n       Whereas young people will be the stewards of our \n     communities, the United States, and the world in critical \n     times, and the present and future well-being of our society \n     requires an involved, caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas concerns about the character training of children \n     have taken on a new sense of urgency as violence by and \n     against youth threatens the physical and psychological well-\n     being of people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character, and that character \n     counts in personal relationships, in school, and in the \n     workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play a very important role in supporting \n     family efforts by fostering and promoting good character;\n       Whereas the Senate encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the valuable role \n     our youth play in the present and future of the United States \n     and to recognize that character is an important part of that \n     future;\n       Whereas in July 1992, the Aspen Declaration was written by \n     an eminent group of educators, youth leaders, and ethics \n     scholars for the purpose of articulating a coherent framework \n     for character education appropriate to a diverse and \n     pluralistic society;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states, ``Effective character \n     education is based on core ethical values which form the \n     foundation of democratic society.'';\n       Whereas the core ethical values identified by the Aspen \n     Declaration constitute the 6 core elements of character;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character are \n     trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, \n     and citizenship;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character transcend \n     cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states, ``The character and \n     conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of \n     society; therefore, every adult has the responsibility to \n     teach and model the core ethical values and every social \n     institution has the responsibility to promote the development \n     of good character.'';\n       Whereas the Senate encourages individuals and \n     organizations, especially those who have an interest in the \n     education and training of our youth, to adopt the 6 core \n     elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society as a whole; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages communities, especially \n     schools and youth organizations, to integrate the 6 core \n     elements of character into programs serving students and \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week beginning October 17, 1999, and the \n     week beginning October 15, 2000, as ``National Character \n     Counts Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to--\n       (A) embrace the 6 core elements of character identified by \n     the Aspen Declaration, which are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; and\n       (B) observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to submit for the \nsixth consecutive year a resolution on behalf of myself and 53 other \nSenators. My principal cosponsor is Senator Dodd. In years past, when \nSenator Nunn was here, this resolution, which I am introducing, was \nknown as the Domenici-Nunn resolution regarding National Character \nCounts Week. Senator Dodd is taking the place of Senator Nunn; and 52 \nother Senators besides the two of us have joined in this. If any others \nwish to join, we will be pleased to have you. This resolution says the \nweek of October 17 through 24 of this year, and October 15 through 22 \nof next year, will be known across the country as National Character \nCounts Week.\n  In 1992, a distinguished group of American educators, youth leaders, \nethicists, religious people of all faiths, labor union leaders, and \nbusiness executives met in Aspen, CO. They developed a way to instill \ncharacter values in our schoolchildren. The conference marked the birth \nof what is beginning to be known across America as ``The Six Pillars of \nCharacter'' concept. The values comprising the Six Pillars are everyday \nconcepts that Americans across this land wish their children would have \nand hope America will keep. They are simply: trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. They transcend \npolitical and social barriers and are central to the ideals on which \nthis Nation was built. As a matter of fact, I think they are central \nand basic to any nation that survives for any long period of history. \nAs Plato once said, ``A country without character is a country that's \ndoomed. And the only way a country can have character,'' he said, ``is \nif the individual citizens in the country have character.''\n  I could speak for all of my allotted time on the 200,000 New Mexico \nschoolchildren in public, private and parochial schools learning about \ngood character. About 90 percent of the grade school children, and a \nsignificant portion of the others, are now participating in character \neducation programs that simply and profoundly bring them into contact \nwith each of these Pillars of Character one month at a time.\n  So if you walk the halls of some grade school in Albuquerque, you \nmight see a sign outside that says, ``This Is Responsibility Month.'' \nAnd all the young people will be discussing the concept of \nresponsibility in their classrooms, and they will put up posters \nsaying, ``Responsibility Counts.'' At the end of that month they may \nhave an assembly at which responsibility will be discussed by all the \nkids, and awards will be given to those who have been most responsible.\n  The next month it might be ``respect.'' The month after that it might \nbe ``caring.''\n  This is working wherever it is being tried. A good example can be \nseen in the changes that occurred at Garfield Middle School in \nAlbuquerque. The 570 students at Garfield first received their first \nlessons on the Six Pillars in October 1994. During the first 20 days of \nthat school year, there were 91 recorded incidents of physical \nviolence. One year later, during the same period, there were 26 such \nincidents. This remarkable difference is evidence that students do \nrespond to Character Counts.\n  In New Mexico, the Character Counts movement has spread from the \nclassroom to the boardroom. Recently, a group of business professionals \nresolved to explore ways to implement the Six Pillars in all their \nbusiness relationships in an effort to spread these values throughout \nthe community. Through this effort, parents have an opportunity to \nparticipate in Character Counts along side their kids, thereby \nreinforcing lessons learned in school. Promoting the Six Pillars at \nwork also improves productivity and morale on the job, and it pays \nincalculable dividends in job and customer satisfaction.\n  Every year I like to highlight a particularly exceptional example of \ncharacter displayed in my State of New Mexico. For over a dozen years, \nBob Martin, an Albuquerque helicopter pilot, dreamed of being the first \nperson to circumnavigate the globe in a balloon. He made many personal, \nprofessional, and financial sacrifices to plan the endeavor. Bob worked \ntirelessly to involve as many New Mexicans he could in his adventure, \nand from scientists to schoolchildren, the entire State shared his \nenthusiasm for the project. Finally, after years of preparation, Bob \nand his fellow crew members of Team RE/MAX were scheduled for lift-off \nthis past January. However, it soon became apparent that weather \nconditions and equipment problems would force one of the three-member \nflight crew to stay behind. As founder of the mission, Bob felt it was \nhis duty to stay behind despite his years of preparation and commitment \nto the project. His heartbreaking decision was an unparalleled \nexemplification of each of the Six Pillars: Trustworthiness, Respect, \nResponsibility, Fairness, Citizenship, and Caring.\n  Eventually, the launch was canceled because of worsening weather \nconditions, and two other balloon pilots, Bertrand Piccard of France \nand Brian Jones, of England, became the first team to successfully \ncomplete the trip. Although many of the hundreds of schoolchildren \nacross New Mexico following Bob Martin's quest were disappointed he \ndidn't have the chance to lift-off, they were given a outstanding \ndemonstration of character in action through the deeds of Bob Martin.\n  The lead institution in America that sponsors it is a nonprofit \ninstitution called the Josephson Institute. It is a small foundation \nthat promotes ethics. In that regard, they are the promoters of the Six \nPillars of Character. Wherever I go, whenever I go to New Mexico, I \npick a school and we talk about their Character Counts program.\n  It is phenomenal, the way teachers love to be part of this. Some of \nthem said to me, 3 and 4 years ago: Why did it take so long to empower \nme to talk about responsibility to the children I teach in the fourth \nor third or fifth grade? I was absolutely astounded to\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\nfind the hunger among good teachers to share with their children what \nit meant to be fair, to be respectful, to have citizenship.\n  I will ask consent that an editorial in the Albuquerque Journal, our \nlargest newspaper, entitled, ``Students Learn Real Lesson in \nCitizenship'' be printed in the Record. It says that as part of the Six \nPillars in this school, one of the good teachers took the entire \nclassroom to a swearing-in ceremony where 71 New Mexicans became \nAmerican citizens, and the little children got to watch them swear \ntheir oath, and meet them, and then they went back to their class and \ndiscussed it. They were thrilled to talk about people from other \ncountries who love America and want to become citizens. If the program \ndid not promote that, it would never have happened. And it is happening \nin all different ways across our land.\n\n  Senator Dodd is working hard at this, as well as his fellow Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. The State of Tennessee, under the \nleadership of Senator Frist, is moving ahead dramatically. I ask all \nSenators to read what I have placed in the Record and to consider \njoining.\n  I am going to bring together with my friend, Senator Dodd, and \nothers, a number of Governors from both parties--perhaps as many as \n15--with a number of Senators from both parties. We are going to \nquickly decide how we can promote the six pillars of character across \ntheir States and across our land.\n  Much is said about the children and the problem that happened in the \nshooting in my neighboring State of Colorado. We all know some things \nhave to change. None of us have an absolute solution to this problem. \nBut essentially, I submit, if we could have character education built \non these six pillars in all of our grade schools and junior high \nschools, month by month, year by year, as they mature--and nobody \nobjects. Those who are practicing the Jewish religion think these \npillars are great. If as a Christian--a Baptist or Protestant or Roman \nCatholic--you hear about these six pillars, you say, ``Amen.'' We \ncannot teach religion. But what is wrong with responsibility and \nrespect and caring and trustworthiness? Trustworthiness just means we \ndo not lie. Isn't that nice to tell young people that our character is \ndefined by whether we tell the truth? Our country ultimately suffers \nwhen we do not tell the truth. That is the kind of thing that is being \npromoted.\n  I note the presence of Senator Dodd. Senator, I have already \nmentioned that not only are you my principal cosponsor, but we are \ngoing to call this national conference soon. You and I will ask \nGovernors and Senators to attend. I ask now the Journal editorial, \nwhich I alluded to, be printed in the Record.\n  There being not objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, April 28, 1999]\n\n               Students Learn Real Lesson in Citizenship\n\n       Citizenship.--As one of six desired ``Character Counts'' \n     attributes, it's a word posted in the hallways of virtually \n     every Albuquerque public school, sometimes featured as ``word \n     of the month'' on reader board signs outside.\n       Students at Cleveland Middle School, however, have come to \n     know the full meaning of that word. Offered a valuable \n     opportunity, they learned about the naturalization process in \n     history classes, took the American citizenship test and, to \n     top it off, witnessed the naturalization of 71 of America's \n     newest citizens in a ceremony Cleveland students helped \n     organize as hosts.\n       ``We decided that if we're going to teach children about \n     citizenship, we should make it as real as possible,'' \n     humanities teacher Susan Leonard said. Cleveland no doubt \n     succeeded, because this is as real as it gets. Students \n     watched 71 people from 22 countries take the oath of American \n     citizenship--by choice.\n       Most Americans take their citizenship for granted, just as \n     many take for granted the rights Americans enjoy--the right \n     to a fair trial, to practice one's own religion, to speak \n     one's mind. By taking these rights for granted, too often \n     Americans also opt out of the responsibilities that are the \n     flip side of those rights--one's duty to vote, to serve on a \n     jury, to defend our nation and Constitution; in short, to be \n     a good citizen.\n       Learning about the naturalization process provided a \n     valuable lesson in America's continuing history as a nation \n     of immigrants.\n       Eighth-grader Tom Adams said his favorite part of the \n     Cleveland project was meeting the citizens-to-be. ``They're \n     from all different countries,'' he said, ``and I get to meet \n     them. And I think that's kind of cool.''\n       Seventy-one believers in the American system are now Adams' \n     fellow Americans. Kind of cool, indeed.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me commend my colleague from New Mexico. \nI have enjoyed a lot of relationships in this Chamber over the years on \nnumerous issues, but none as much as I have with my colleague from New \nMexico on Character Counts. I am pleased to be joining my colleague in \nsubmitting this Senate Resolution designating the weeks of October 17, \n1999 and October 15, 2000 as National Character Counts Week.\n  Character Counts is a program that I encourage for every one of our \ncolleagues. There are programs now in all 50 States. Some States have \nmore than others. There are 10,000 children in my home State of \nConnecticut who have been the beneficiary of our Character Counts \neffort, the six pillars of good character.\n  We have had a lot of attention paid over the last couple of weeks to \nthe tragedy in Littleton, CO. Americans are left searching for answers \nto many questions. How could these teenagers have committed such \nbrutality? How can society help prevent such violent, deadly behavior \nfrom happening again? There are a variety of suggestions people are \nmaking--the tendency is to revert to form. You have one group that says \nthe answer is gun control, another group says it is the video games and \nthe Internet, and another group says it is the schools or the parents. \nYou could probably find some merit in all of those areas.\n  I believe that one answer is to encourage schools to build character \nin their students. I am not going to stand here and claim that this is \nthe solution. But it is certainly part of the solution.\n  This is an issue that goes beyond the prevention of violence. \nTheodore Roosevelt once said, ``To educate a person's mind and not his \ncharacter is to educate a menace.'' In some ways, there is a lot of \nvalidity in that statement. Possessing a good mind without good \ncharacter can create more problems than one can imagine.\n  Education is a central part of children's lives, and schools are the \nkey to reaching the majority of America's children. Today's children \nhave so many obstacles to overcome, including violence and drug use. As \na society, we must find ways to help these children become responsible \ncitizens, to distinguish between right and wrong. To do this, we must \nbuild on traditional education by nurturing student character.\n  Schools can teach and reinforce the importance of qualities like \ntrustworthiness, responsibility, caring for others, and citizenship. By \ncombining character education with solid instruction in reading, math, \nand science, our schools can produce young people who are not only \nstrong in intellect, but also strong in character.\n  This is not to suggest that parents do not play a key role as well. \nParents should be deeply involved in their children's character \ndevelopment. They should help plan school character development \nprograms, and reinforce the programs' lessons in the home.\n  What we have done in our schools, and in the schools of New Mexico \nand other states, is take one of these six pillars a month, and weave \nit into the seamless fabric of the day, from the math class to the \nhistory class to the band and athletic field to the extracurricular \nactivity. They will take the character of respect: What is respect? \nWhat is lack of respect among teachers, students, and administrators? \nIt is incredible to see the difference this has made in these young \npeople, the administrators, and the faculty of these schools. It has \nbeen a tremendous success.\n  This is a remarkable program. It goes back a number of years, when we \nput a small amount of money into the program to be used by the States \nand localities to promote the idea of character education.\n  I have never known a dollar that has been better spent or has done \nmore good. Talk about seed money and making a difference. We all know \nthat these children should be getting this kind of education at home. \nThat is where it should happen. But, tragically, today for a variety of \nreasons, children are entering school without these basic lessons that \na generation ago were learned at the knees of their parents.\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate come to the floor each year and \njoin me in supporting character education in our schools. For the past \nsix years, I have been working to support character education. In 1994, \nthe amendment Senator Domenici and I offered to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education bill was adopted by the full Senate. The amendment \nprovided funding for schools to start character education curriculums.\n  Since then, I have had the opportunity to visit schools in my home \nstate of Connecticut and I have seen these funds at work. Teachers, \nparents and the students themselves are enthusiastic about these \nprograms and have reported better attendance, higher academic \nperformance, and improved behavior among students. My colleagues can \nconfirm that these positive results are evident throughout the Nation.\n  Again, I compliment my colleague and friend from New Mexico for his \nleadership on character education. I invite my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle to join us in supporting National Character Counts \nWeek and recognizing character education as a critical part of creating \nmore responsible children and a safer society in which to live.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise, as I \nhave in years past, in support of what has become an annual resolution \nto designate the third week of October--this year--the week of October \n17th--as National Character Counts Week.\n  The importance of character to the future of our nation cannot be \noveremphasized. As the noted educator, George S. Benson, once observed, \n``Great ideals and principles do not live from generation to generation \nbecause they are right, nor even because they have been carefully \nlegislated. Ideals and principles continue from generation to \ngeneration only when they are built into the hearts of children as they \ngrow up.''\n  There was a time when great ideals and principles were ``built into \nthe hearts of children'' as a matter of course--in every school house, \nand classroom, all across our great land; a time when we believed that \nto educate a man in mind and not in morals, as Teddy Roosevelt put it, \nwas to educate a menace of society.\n  Sadly, this is no longer the case.\n  Not only do many schools no longer teach children the difference \nbetween good and evil, right and wrong, they convey the philosophy that \nthere is no difference; that it is all a matter of choice, and that \nchoice--not truth--or justice--or responsibility, is the ultimate \nobject of democracy.\n  That is the greatest threat to democracy any nation can face--but \nespecially ours. For America is a nation founded on principle, forged \nby courage, and strengthened by every succeeding generation that has \nbeen unwilling to let those principles or that courage be diminished.\n  Yet, in many ways, moral leadership is more important now than it has \never been before. The 21st century will hold many challenges that will \nrequire the most of us. And the greatest of those challenges will be \nmoral not economic: cloning, genetics, bioengineering; human rights vs. \neconomic prosperity? right to life or right to die?\n  They are challenges that will require principle, demand character.\n  Who will be the leaders of tomorrow, and will they be up to the task? \nIn many ways, the answer is up to us.\n  Which is why I have worked to promote character development in \nelementary and secondary education, and urged our Nation's colleges and \nuniversities to affirm character development as a primary goal of \nhigher education.\n  It is also why I am also proud to support the Character Counts \nmovement, and why I have done so every year since I've been in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  In 1995, in the very first quarter of my first term, I became a \nmember of the bipartisan Character Counts Working Group--a coalition of \nSenators organized to affirm and support the millions of Americans who \nstill believe that character counts, that it should be not just touted \nbut taught, in homes and churches, certainly, but also in schools \nacross America.\n  It is why I have annually co-sponsored this Senate resolution to \ndesignate the third week of October as National Character Counts Week. \nAnd it is why I am proud to say that, in Tennessee, Character Counts! \nis flourishing.\n  Mr. President, Character Counts! teaches children respect, \nresponsibility, trust, caring and citizenship. It teaches them the \nvalue of virtue, the importance of character. It renews not only the \npromises of our past, but our faith in the future.\n  In Knoxville, Tennessee alone, 38 schools so far have received \nCharacter Counts! training. One of them, Norwood Elementary, asked \nstudents to write essays about the importance of character.\n  Another, Farragut Primary School, held an assembly for parents and \nkids that highlighted ways to be good citizens.\n  In Johnson City, a little boy and his friends at Cherokee Elementary \nSchool built a ramp at the home of a boy with a disability so he could \nget in and out safely in his wheelchair.\n  In Hamblin County, I met a fourth grader--a little girl named Heidi \nShackleford--who was the first student to make her school's Character \nCounts! ``Wall of Fame.''\n  What did she do to earn such an honor? She found a $100 bill in her \nschool, but rather than stick it in her pocket, she turned it in to her \nteacher because she learned--through Character Counts education--why it \nis important to do the right thing.\n  In Sullivan County--where the Character Counts! program began in \nTennessee--students at the Indian Springs Elementary School make \nmonthly visits to a grandmother they adopted at a Kingsport nursing \nhome.\n  They have also experienced 25 percent reduction in juvenile crime \nsince the Character Counts! program began--an improvement they \nattribute directly to the impact the program has had on the region.\n  These are just a few examples of how Tennessee children are learning \nthe value of virtue, the importance of character, and how their \ncommunities have benefitted as a result.\n  It has been my honor to support all of these efforts--to help \nTennessee communities kick-off new programs, and to encourage and \nsupport those already in place.\n  But it is not enough to promote this program in Tennessee, or New \nMexico, or in any one of the other states that have taken up the \nchallenge.\n  We must promote the development of character in every state, in every \nschool, in every city in America. For if education is the most \nimportant gift we can give to the future, then character education is \ndoubly so.\n  The job of instilling character in the hearts of America's children \nhas always been an important one. But as the tragic violence in \nLittleton and other cities recently have shown us, it has never been \nmore important than it is today.\n  We are justifiably proud of the liberty we enjoy as Americans. But as \nthe wise British statesman, Edmund Burke, once observed, What is \nliberty without virtue? It is the greatest of all possible evils, for \nit is folly, vice and madness without tuition or restraint.\n  We must take every opportunity to teach our children the difference \nbetween right and wrong, to sort out with them, what to value, and what \nto reject from among the vast array of choices made possible by our \nfreedom.\n  We must all, young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, \nwork together to sow the seeds of character into the hearts of every \nyoung American so that together we can give our children and our \ncountry one of the greatest gifts any democratic nation can bestow--the \nassurance that character does count.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4918-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4918-S4928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SANTORUM (AND BUNNING) AMENDMENT NO. 307\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Bunning) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill (S. 900) to enhance competition in the financial services \nindustry by providing a prudential framework for the affiliation of \nbanks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial \nservice providers, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       (e) Use of Fund Reserves To Pay FICO Obligations.--Section \n     7(b)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. \n     1817(b)(2)) is amended by inserting after subparagraph (C) \n     the following:\n       ``(D) Use of deposit insurance funds to pay certain \n     financing corporation obligations.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Beginning on January 1, 2000, the Board \n     of Directors shall use the funds of the Bank Insurance Fund \n     and the Savings Association Insurance Fund in excess of 1.35 \n     percent of estimated insured deposits or such level \n     established by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section \n     7(b)(2)(A)(iv)(II) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1817(b)(2)(A)(iv)(II) to pay the bond interest \n     obligations of the Financing Corporation.\n       ``(ii) Limitation.--If the funds available under clause (i) \n     are insufficient to meet the Financing Corporation's annual \n     interest obligations, the Board of Directors shall use such \n     amounts available under clause (i) and shall impose a special \n     assessment, consistent with 12 U.S.C. 1441(f)(2) and Section \n     2703(c)(2)(A) of the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996, on \n     insured depository institutions in such amount and for such \n     period as is necessary to generate funds sufficient to permit \n     the Financing Corporation to meet all interest obligations \n     due.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        GRAMM AMENDMENT NO. 308\n\n  Mr. GRAMM proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 900, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 98, strike lines 5 through 9, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 304.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 40th \nbirthday of Little Caesars Enterprises, an extraordinary company \nheadquartered in my home state of Michigan and my hometown of Detroit.\n  It is not possible to talk about Little Caesars without recognizing \nthe efforts of the founders of the company, Mike and Marian Ilitch. \nMike and Marian are not only fine examples of entrepreneurship. They \nexemplify the American Dream itself. These two first-generation \nAmericans, both of Macedonian descent, opened their first Little \nCaesars restaurant in Garden City, Michigan on May 8, 1959. After only \nthree years, they sold their first Little Caesars franchise. The \ncompany became an international enterprise in 1969, with the opening of \nits first restaurant in Canada. By 1987, Little Caesars restaurants \ncould be found in all 50 states. Today, Little Caesars' markets include \nthe U.S., Canada, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, South Korea, Honduras, \nDominican Republic, Turkey, the Philippines, Ecuador, Aruba and Egypt.\n  The Ilitch family and the employees of Little Caesars have \ndemonstrated a deep commitment to the City of Detroit. Several years \nago, many people characterized the decision to move Little Caesars' \nheadquarters to downtown Detroit was ``an act of faith.'' Today, other \ncompanies are following in Little Caesars footsteps and the City of \nDetroit's business climate is truly on the rebound. Throughout the \nyears, Little Caesars has sponsored youth sports, especially hockey, \nand given generously to charitable causes. One of the most notable \ncharitable endeavors supported by Little Caesars is the Little Caesars \nLove Kitchen Foundation, a mobile pizza restaurant which has fed more \nthan 1.2 million people since it was created in 1985. The Love Kitchen \nFoundation has been recognized by Presidents Clinton, Bush and Reagan \nfor its service to those in need.\n  Many people credit the success of Little Caesars to its ``buy one, \nget one free'' concept.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nPennsylvania's top two youth volunteers for the 1999 Prudential Spirit \nof Community Awards program, a nationwide program that honors young \npeople for outstanding acts of volunteerism. Jessica Miley, a junior at \nMcDowell High School in Erie and Dustin Good, a seventh-grade student \nat Pottstown Intermediate School were named State Honorees, an honor \nconferred on only one high school student and one middle-level student \nin each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n  Jessica is being honored for her extraordinary efforts to save the \nlives of at-risk youth. Certified by the Erie County Department of \nHealth as a Prevention Educator to teach students in local high schools \nand middle schools about preventing HIV and AIDS, she designs her own \nprograms around topics such as abstinence, sexual risks, peer pressure, \nself-esteem and the dangers of drugs and alcohol. Jessica spends 12 to \n15 hours a week on her efforts during the school year and 40 hours a \nweek during the summer.\n  Dustin is being recognized for his role in ``Project Reach-Out,'' a \ngroup comprised of students who want to make a difference in their \ncommunity. As part of this effort, Dustin spent many hours promoting \nthe group's activities to his student body, recruiting volunteers, \nattending planning meetings and working on special events. Among these \nevents was a prom for residents of a local nursing home, as well as an \n``adoption'' of a needy family in the community. Through fundraising \nefforts, the group provided the family with food, clothes and toys.\n  It is vital that we, as individual communities, encourage and support \nthe kind of selfless contributions that these young people have \ndemonstrated. People of all ages need to think more about how, as \nindividual citizens, we can work together at the local level to ensure \nthe health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young \nvolunteers like Jessica and Dustin are inspiring examples to all of us \nand are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.\n  The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program was created in 1995 \nby The Prudential Insurance Company of America, in partnership with the \nNational Association of Secondary School Principals, to impress upon \nall youth volunteers that their contributions are critical and to \ninspire other young people to follow their example. In only four years, \nthe program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort \nbased solely on community service, with more than 50,000 youth \nparticipating.\n  I commend Jessica Miley and Dustin Good for the leadership they have \ndemonstrated in seeking to make their communities better places to \nlive. I would also like to salute the following eight young people in \nPennsylvania who were named Distinguished Finalists in the program; \nEric Ford, Havertown; Drew Harris, Dresher;\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\nTiffanie Hawkins, Newtown; Anne Heller, New Holland; Kari Knight, \nSugarloaf; Tabitha Kulish, Lancaster; Jennifer Michelstein, Kingston; \nand Lisa Podgurski, Washington.\n  These youth have exhibited a level of commitment and accomplishment \nthat is truly extraordinary, and they deserve our sincere admiration \nand respect. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncommending these fine young people who have demonstrated that young \nAmericans can, and do, play important roles in their communities and \nthat America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise \nfor the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4930-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              BOB WOOD--THINKER AND DOER FOR URBAN AMERICA\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of America's greatest leaders \nfor our cities and metropolitan areas over the past half century has \nbeen Robert C. Wood.\n  All of us who know Bob Wood have enormous respect for his ability, \nhis leadership, and his brilliant service to the country. He was an \noutstanding Under Secretary and Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment for President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960's, and he \npioneered the development of many of the nation's most important \nprograms to enhance the vitality of our cities and improve the quality \nof life in metropolitan areas across the country.\n  In Massachusetts, we have special respect and affection for Bob Wood \nbecause of all that he has done for our state, especially for his \nservice as a past chairman of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation \nAuthority and as a past Superintendent of the Boston Public Schools, \nand also for his brilliant academic leadership both at M.I.T. and the \nUniversity of Massachusetts.\n  In an excellent column by Martin F. Nolan in yesterday's Boston \nGlobe, Bob Wood reflected on his remarkable career of service to \nMassachusetts and the nation. I believe the column will be of interest \nto all of us in Congress who know and admire Bob, and I ask that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                  [From the Boston Globe, May 5, 1999]\n\n                A Thinker and a Doer on America's Cities\n\n                          (By Martin F. Nolan)\n\n       When he first put his ideas into practice, America was \n     asking, ``Can cities be saved?'' That question today would \n     sound preposterous during reflections on a 50-year career in \n     public service from an eyrie high above Boston Harbor, where \n     piers once rotted and urban dreams died.\n       ``Cities were written off too soon,'' says Bob Wood. \n     ``Their commonality with suburbs is increasing, and people \n     are realizing that a strategy against sprawl is not a direct \n     assault on local governments.''\n       Battling sprawl is nothing new for Wood. When President \n     Lyndon Johnson created task forces on housing and urban \n     policy in 1964, ``Charlie Haar and I flew down every Saturday \n     morning at 7:30. He headed the president's task force on \n     environment, and I was chairman of the task force on urban \n     problems, so we became very good friends during those \n     weekends. He became assistant secretary of metropolitan \n     development and I became the first undersecretary of housing \n     and urban development.'' Wood later became HUD secretary.\n       In the Great Society's efforts to save American cities, \n     Cambridge played a major role. Haar taught at Harvard Law \n     School, and Wood was the first chairman of the political \n     science department at MIT.\n       ``Sprawl was recognized in the '60s legislation,'' he \n     recalls. ``The idea of metropolitan development was to go \n     hand in hand with urban renewal and what we were doing with \n     the Model Cities program. It was explicit, but given Vietnam \n     and the budget, we couldn't fund it and do well. We only did \n     pieces of it.''\n       ``Vietnam took so much energy, time, money, and political \n     capital,'' Wood remembers. Next week, when Lady Bird Johnson \n     will be hostess at a Texas reunion of LBJ's Cabinet, Wood \n     will not be eager to greet former Defense Secretary Robert S. \n     McNamara ``and the rest of `the best and the brightest.' '' \n     Wood sees similarities between Vietnam then and Yugoslavia \n     today: ``It's underclared, slowly escalating, with an \n     assumption of falling dominoes.''\n       Wood does not praise President Clinton or Vice President \n     Gore for tackling sprawl, crediting economic forces with \n     highlighting the problem: ``The Clinton administration had no \n     real interest in tough decisions on urban issues or any \n     other. Clinton took his polls from Dick Morris. But the \n     country grew faster than predicted, and the cost of suburban \n     development in housing, schools, and land became increasingly \n     high. In the `80s, the recession had killed building \n     development. In the '90s, with prosperity, people are \n     building mansions in the suburbs. Overwhelmingly, political \n     power is in the suburbs.''\n       In 1958, long before he moved from Lincoln to the Boston \n     waterfront, Wood popularized ``Suburbia'' with a book by that \n     title in which he wrote that ``transportation is the central \n     reality of the metropolitan community.'' After his tensure at \n     HUD he got a chance to put his ideas into action locally.\n       ``When I can back from working for LBJ and got declared a \n     war criminal by students at MIT, Governor Frank Sargent \n     thought it would be a good idea for me to be chairman of the \n     MBTA. It seemed a natural,'' he says.\n       One of his proudest achievements is ``the basic \n     transformation of Somerville. Because of the Red Line \n     extension, we got Davis Square as we know it. That's why \n     Tufts is blossoming and why Somerville is where grad students \n     from Harvard and elsewhere settle. That's what transit can \n     do. It happened in Quincy, too.''\n       Wood has also been Boston school superintendent and \n     president of the University of Massachusetts. A graduate of \n     Princeton with degrees from Harvard, he was also director of \n     Joint Center for Urban Studies at Harvard and MIT.\n       In 1949, this veteran of the 76th Army Infantry Division in \n     World War II became associate director of Florida's \n     Legislative Reference Bureau. He got to know and like \n     politicians, which is why Robert Coldwell Wood, at 75, is \n     unsurpassed as a thinker and a doer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4930-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4930-S4931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE LITTLETON TRAGEDY\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, all Americans are struggling with \nthe meaning of the brutal murders in Littleton, CO, and the question of \nwhat we should do about school violence generally. As we tackle these \nissues, we need to take advantage of the best thinking and writing \nabout them.\n  The Columbus Dispatch had a very good editorial on April 22, which \npoints out in a very clear way what the specific challenges are--and \nmost especially the need for adults to provide understanding and \ndiscipline to young people. The best way to stop violence is to promote \nthe alternative--an effective culture of life and respect.\n  I ask that this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n              [From the Columbus Dispatch, Apr. 22, 1999]\n\n         School Killings Adults Must See Themselves as Solution\n\n       A gunman looked under a desk in the library and said \n     ``Peek-a-boo,'' then fired.--. . . Anyone who cried or moaned \n     was shot again. One girl begged for her life, but a gunshot \n     ended her cries. . . . The shooter turned his attention to a \n     black student, saying, ``I hate niggers.''--AP report out of \n     Littleton, Colo.\n       Black trench coats. Hitler's birthday. Gothic Web sites. \n     Guns and homemade bombs. Hatred.\n       Can any sense be made of the pieces emerging from the \n     bloody halls of Columbine High School? Can the overwhelming \n     why be answered?\n       The issues seem so broad and numerous that a bewildered \n     nation expresses its inability to comprehend it, one of the \n     deadliest school massacres in U.S. history.\n       Counselors propound; experts proclaim. The news media \n     shifts focus from gun control to dress codes, violent movies \n     to police in schools, materialism to racism.\n       Before a coherent thought forms, the lens shifts again.\n       Police who searched Harris' home said they found bomb-\n     making material. Students said the group was fascinated with \n     World War II and the Nazis and noted that Tuesday was Adolf \n     Hitler's birthday.\n       But the real question is not why. Deep down, though we may \n     not articulate it very well, we really do know why.\n       We may not know the exact circumstances that led juniors \n     Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to gun down their classmates, \n     but we do know that the past three years have produced a \n     series of school killings: Two dead in Pearl, Miss., three in \n     West Paducah, Ky., five in Jonesboro, Ark., two in \n     Springfield, Ore. And from this, we know that it will happen \n     again. We know why.\n       We have produced a generation of children given too much \n     freedom, too little direction; too much money, too little \n     love.\n       The segment of society least capable of handling \n     empowerment has been empowered within the rule of law but \n     beyond common sense.\n       A litigious population demands that schools maintain \n     discipline and instill values but sues teachers and \n     administrators who dare tread upon a student's rights, be it \n     searching a locker or insisting on proper attire.\n       Teenagers demand and are granted their own ``space,'' \n     Bedrooms become inviolable domains where the wild frontier of \n     the Net can be browsed at will and every type of perversion \n     checked out. If the child's character is far enough cracked, \n     bombs can be made or guns can be stashed.\n       The so-called Trench Coat Mafia had boasted of its gun \n     collection. Its members wore black everyday. They even wore \n     black trench coats in class. When did parents and school \n     officials descend to such levels of indifference? And \n     ``nobody thought'' these kids were capable of killing in cold \n     blood.\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\n       ``They were laughing after they shot. It was like they were \n     having the time of their life.''\n       The question is not why but, ``What do we do?''\n       Like recovering alcoholics, we first have to admit that \n     we--all of us--have a problem. Not just our neighbors, not \n     just Paducah and now Littleton, not just big cities or rural \n     towns.\n       The good folks who have to live in crime-ridden \n     neighborhoods used to rally around the cry, ``Take back our \n     streets!'' Now, it's time to take back our children. Even the \n     most dysfunctional families have aunts, uncles and cousins \n     who can help.\n       Churches, mosques, synagogues, libraries and numerous \n     civic- and social-service networks offer havens that too few \n     people see as important enough to spend their time and money \n     on. Much easier to give the kids some money and drop them and \n     their cell phones off at the mall.\n       ``Finally I started figuring out these guys shot to kill \n     for no reason. . . .  When he looked at me, the guy's eyes \n     were just dead.''\n       We are killing our children by insisting that they don't \n     have to be children if they don't want to. We talk values to \n     them but fail, on the whole, to live those values. We lead by \n     example, often unaware that our example is pathetically \n     shallow and certainly poor competition for the pervasive \n     voice of the youth culture where simply buying khakis holds \n     the promise of sex.\n       Littleton is an affluent suburb. This is an affluent \n     nation. We have time and money to spend on our children. \n     Individually, we must ask how our money and time is being \n     spent. Collectively, we must decide to spend it more wisely \n     and to share it with the larger neighborhood, the grand \n     nation of the United States of America and its most valuable \n     asset, the youngsters who will someday be the neighborhood.\n       Most of all, we must teach our children that freedom and \n     independence are earned and that the rites of passage amount \n     to more than clipping on a pager.\n       Neglect and indifference are forms of child abuse. Before \n     we are shocked again by the next school shooting, we should \n     devote more than a moment of thought to how much we overlook \n     deviance and alienation; how so many of us are so little \n     involved in providing direction.\n       Parents and all adults must provide understanding and \n     compassion, discipline and clarity in a world of neglect, \n     obfuscation and self-absorption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4931-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FATHER HENNESSEY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute and say \ngoodbye to a long time friend, Father Ron Hennessey, whose recent \npassing is a great loss not only to his colleagues, his family, and his \nfriends but to everyone who knew him. I'm saying goodbye to Father Ron, \nbut we will never say goodbye to his heart, his spirit, or his soul.\n  Father Ron was a native of Iowa and graduated from St. Patrick's High \nSchool in Ryan, Iowa. After graduating, he was drafted into the U.S. \nArmy and served as a mechanic and later a Motor Sergeant in Korea. \nWhile in Korea, he was awarded three Bronze Stars for valor during his \nmilitary service. Under the Eisenhower Christmas Program, he returned \nto the United States and was released from active service on December \n9, 1953. He entered Maryknoll Junior Seminary in Pennsylvania and five \nyears later graduated from Maryknoll College in Illinois in June of \n1958. Father Hennessey was ordained at Maryknoll Seminary in New York \non June 13, 1964.\n  Father Ron devoted his life to international peace and justice, Mr. \nPresident, dedicating almost 35 years of his life as a Maryknoll priest \nin Central America. Much of this time was spent in Guatemala and El \nSalvador. Soon after being ordained, he was assigned to the Diocese of \nQuetzaltenango, Guatemala. Several years later, he became the Pastor in \nSan Mateo Ixtatan, Guatemala. It is during this time that Father \nHennessey became very involved in the human rights struggle of the \nlocal Mayan Indians. He placed himself in great danger by smuggling \nletters out of Guatemala detailing the atrocities committed against the \nMayan Indians in his rural parish. Those atrocities, Father Ron wrote, \nwere being committed by the Guatemalan military under the orders of \nPresident Rios Montt. I remember one letter in particular in which \nFather Ron listed 20 instances in his parish alone in which military \nforces committed gross acts of violence.\n  Sadly, the United States Government at the time, supported this \noppressive regime. In fact, our own State Department downplayed the \nhuman rights violations being committed in Guatemala, and in my view \nmaking us complicit in those heinous crimes.\n  By shining the spotlight on these atrocities, Father Ron's life was \nin constant danger. But that did not stop him. He stayed in Guatemala \nuntil 1986 despite having three opportunities to leave.\n  From Guatemala he went to El Salvador to re-establish a Maryknoll \npresence there after a five year absence. There he served in a parish \non the outskirts of San Salvador that had had no priest since the \nChurch was bombed in 1980.\n  In 1989, when the Salvadoran military murdered six Jesuit priests, \ntheir housekeeper and her daughter, Father Hennessey and his fellow \nMaryknollers chose to remain in the country even as scores of North \nAmerican missionaries and aid workers decided to leave because the \nsituation had become too dangerous for those who stood up for human \nrights and the rule of law. But Father Hennessey continued his work, \nstanding side by side with his parishioners.\n  Father Hennessey once again took up residence again in Guatemala in \n1992 until earlier this year when he was assigned to the Maryknoll \nmission in Los Angeles.\n  And so, Mr. President, Father Hennessey will be greatly missed by all \nof us. And while he may have physically departed, his spirit will never \ndesert us.\n  Which is the second reason I rise today, Mr. President--to affirm an \nancient native American saying: To live in the hearts of those you \nlove, is not to die.\n  Father Ron, your spirit does live on through who knew you, whose \nlives you touched, and through them the countless thousands whose lives \nwere enriched because of you. You will be remembered by us, each in a \ndifferent way.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I can think of no better way to remember my \nfriend Father Ron than with the words of Archbishop Oscar Romero: I \nhave no ambition of power, and so with complete freedom I tell the \npowerful what is good and what is bad, and I tell any political group \nwhat is good and what is bad. That is my duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4931-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4931-S4932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ARSON AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this is Arson Awareness Week in our \nnation. As Chairman of the Congressional Fire Service Caucus. I want to \nremind all Americans of the blight of arson that kills over 700 \ninnocent victims each year and destroys millions of dollars of \nproperty. Additionally, firefighters who have been summoned to \nextinguish the blaze die needlessly.\n  Arson has many faces. The misguided youth that sets fires for \nexcitement; criminals that use fire in an attempt to cover another \ncrime; persons using fire as a weapon to intimidate; the property owner \nattempting to solve financial problems by defrauding an insurance \ncompany; or the terrorist who uses fire to attack our democracy.\n  No matter what the motive, arson in our society cannot be tolerated. \nEvery level of our law enforcement community fights the war against \narson. Local and state fire marshals are often assisted by the Bureau \nof Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in conducting investigations to bring \nthe arsonist to justice.\n  The United States Fire Administration in FEMA and the Center for Fire \nResearch at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the \nCommerce Department are important federal partners in furthering \nresearch to learn how arson fires are started and how set fires can be \ndetected. Our National Fire Academy provides training in arson \ninvestigation for many state and local law enforcement personnel.\n  But we should not assume that government alone can solve the arson \nproblem. Private enterprise, especially the insurance industry has \ntaken a much higher profile in attacking the arson problem by \ninvestigating claims and cooperating with law enforcement personnel. \nThis trend must continue to take the profit out of arson. The insurance \nindustry has also contributed to teaching the public about arson by \nsponsoring education programs such as Arson Awareness Week. The Fire \nAdministration helps supports Arson Awareness Week by working with the \nInternational Association of Arson Investigators. This is the 50th \nAnniversary of the IAAI. Over seven thousand\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\nmembers worldwide working together to control arson are making a \ndifference.\n  I send my congratulations to the IAAI during Arson Awareness Week. I \nam particularly proud of the Delaware Chapter of the IAAI. Some of best \nthat Delaware has to offer from the fire service, law enforcement, the \ninsurance industry and the private sector work hard to protect and \neducate us about arson. As we go about our busy week, let us not forget \nthat we must all work to snuff out the arsonist match.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4932-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO A LEGENDARY PUBLIC OFFICIAL\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

Calabrese of Cliffside Park, New Jersey as he is honored for \na lifetime of distinguished service to the citizens of his community, \ncounty, and state by the Temple Israel Community Center, celebrating \nits 75th anniversary.\n  Gerry began his career in public service by enlisting in the Navy and \nserving his country during World War II. After returning to the United \nStates, Gerry turned his focus to education and entered St. John's \nUniversity where he was chosen as an All-American for basketball. Upon \ngraduation, he continued playing basketball in the National Basketball \nAssociation for the Syracuse Nationals.\n  Gerry retired from his sports career and was quick to enter into \npublic service as he was elected to the Cliffside Park Borough Council \nin 1955. In 1959, Gerry was elected to his first term as the mayor of \nCliffside Park, a post he has retained for the past forty years. During \nhis tenure, Gerry has been always ready and willing to meet with his \nconstituents and listen to their concerns. He has raised the bar in \nconstituent services, as he has always been ready and willing to help \nthose in need. Continuing in this vein, Gerry served on the Bergen \nCounty Board of Freeholders from 1975 to 1985, as Bergen County \nDemocratic Chairman from 1991 to 1998, the New Jersey Delegation to the \nNational Democratic Convention in 1988 and 1992, on the New Jersey \nBoard of Public Utilities from 1960 to 1987, and on the 1992 New Jersey \nCongressional Re-Districting Committee.\n  Gerry Calabrese is respected by all in and around his community and \nhis activities extend beyond his public service career. He is a life \nmember of the PBA Local 96, N.J. State Association of Chiefs of Police, \nCliffside Park Little League, Polish American Democratic Club. \nHackensack Unico and Cliffside Park B'nai B'rith named him ``Man of the \nYear.''\n  Mayor Calabrese is a legendary public servant in New Jersey and is \nmost deserving of this distinguished honor.

On May 6, 1999, these students will attend the Drug Resistance \nEducation (D.A.R.E.) Program's graduation ceremony.\n  These students, under the guidance of Officer John Crane and their \nteacher Ms. Sylvia Eckberg, completed the D.A.R.E. program's 17 week \ncourse. At a time when our students are bombarded daily with \ntemptations and harmful messages, it is refreshing to know that there \nare many students willing to serve as role models for others by leading \ndrug free lives.\n  Unfortunately, there are many young people in our country addicted to \nillegal drugs. Programs such as the Safe and Drug Free School program \nand D.A.R.E. help to encourage students to stay off drugs. However, \nthis is not enough. In order to win the battle over illegal drug use, \nit will take courageous students, such as this fifth grade class, to \nmake the commitment to live drug free lives despite pressure from other \nindividuals.\n  Therefore, I am proud to recognize the students of Ms. Eckberg's \nclass at Christ the King Catholic School for their commitment to living \ndrug free and serving as role models for young people in Kansas and \nthroughout the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4932-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO PLAINFIELD, CT ON ITS 300TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, nestled in what is known as the \n``Quiet Corner'' of northeastern Connecticut along the banks of the \nQuinebaug River lies the town of Plainfield. This year marks \nPlainfield's 300th anniversary and as its residents celebrate their \nhistory, it is important to reflect upon the invaluable contributions \nof those, past and present, who have made Plainfield a unique \nConnecticut town.\n  The first citizens of Plainfield were, much like the original \ncolonists of New England, ingenious and resourceful. Settling in a land \nthat was full of unknowns, these men and women were intent on providing \na better life for themselves and future generations. The Plainfield of \ntoday is a testament to their strength and perseverence.\n  In May of 1699, some thirty families petitioned Governor Jonathan \nWinthrop to incorporate the disputed Quinebaug Plantation, which \nincluded land on both sides of the Quinebaug River, into the town of \nPlainfield. Eventually, in 1703, colonists living on the western banks \nof the river separated to settle what is now the town of Canterbury.\n  The construction of roads during the 1700's from Providence to \nNorwich which ran through Plainfield made the town an important trading \npost of surplus crops. Antiquated by today's standards, the simple \nroads that connected Plainfield with other New England towns earned it \nthe reputation as a vital crossroads throughout the region.\n  With Plainfield Junction serving as a stop on the Norwich to \nWorcester railroad, Plainfield's residents were exposed to travelers \nfrom abroad and bore witness to the impending technological boom of the \nnext century. By the end of the 18th century, the town could credit its \nfirst village center and meetinghouse, shops, and taverns to the \nincreased number of families choosing to make Plainfield their home.\n  The advent of the textile industry during the 19th century brought \nabout significant changes for this town, forever changing the face of \nPlainfield and redefining the lives of its residents. With activity \ncentered on the Moosup River, the cotton and woolen mills transformed \nPlainfield from a predominantly farming society to an industrial hub.\n  The introduction of industry into the community altered and enhanced \nthe ethnic character of Plainfield. French-Canadians seeking temporary \nrefuge and employment in Plainfield's mills ultimately made the \nbustling town their home, successfully contributing to the town's \ngrowth as shopkeepers and professionals. French-Canadians helped to \ndefine Plainfield's identity and their heritage is still very much \nalive in its townspeople today.\n  Despite its many transformations over the last 300 years, Plainfield \nhas always remained a town that is distinctly New England in its \ncharacter. Many of the mills are now gone, yet, much of Plainfield's \nhistorical landscape still survives. In 1994, Plainfield, together with \n24 other northeastern Connecticut towns, was designated as the \nQuinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor. This \nis an exceptional achievement that recognizes Plainfield's success in \nencouraging new economic development while preserving its rich history.\n  As we move toward the new millennium, the residents of Plainfield \nreturn to their past not only for the lessons that it holds but also to \ncelebrate the people and events that have made them who they are today. \nMuch is made of our history as a country, yet many of us overlook the \nimportant examples set by those in our own backyards. We all should \nseek within our own communities to embrace the past and recognize the \nsignificance of local heritage in shaping the modern character of our \nown families and towns. On behalf of myself, and the entire State of \nConnecticut, I offer Plainfield a very hearty happy birthday and my \nbest wishes for another successful 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4932-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4932-S4933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING FORMER SENATOR R. VANCE HARTKE\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit for the \nRecord a\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\nstatement in honor of one of our former colleagues, Senator R. Vance \nHartke, (D-Indiana), who served in this body from 1959 to 1976. The \nstatement is written by a good friend of mine, former Congressman Bob \nMrazek, who worked for Senator Hartke from 1969 to 1971. Congressman \nMrazek was thoughtful enough to submit this in honor of the Senator's \n80th birthday, which takes place later this month. We wish him the \nbest.\n  I ask that the statement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows.\n\n               Tribute to Former Senator R. Vance Hartke\n\n                          (By Hon. Bob Mrazek)\n\n       It was my privilege to serve on the staff of former U.S. \n     Senator R. Vance Hartke (D-Indiana), from 1969 to 1971. These \n     were tumultuous times for the United States in the bitter \n     aftermath of the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy \n     and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As the Vietnam War continued \n     to cause deep divisions in the nation's social and political \n     fabric, I was proud to witness Senator Hartke's courageous \n     opposition to that war, which he began at great personal cost \n     in 1965.\n       Throughout his 18 years of service as a U.S. Senator, Vance \n     Hartke demonstrated absolute fearlessness and political \n     courage in taking principled stands on the most important \n     issues facing the nation, often at the risk of prematurely \n     ending his career. His prodigious legislative achievements \n     undoubtedly distinguish Vance Hartke as one of the greatest \n     Senators of the 20th century.\n       From his contributions to creating the Head Start program \n     and Medicare to the Guaranteed Student Loan Program and the \n     International Executive Service Corps, Senator Hartke was a \n     leader who made America and the world a better, more humane \n     place.\n       I am honored to call this legendary legislator my friend. \n     In what I believe is a long overdue tribute, I would like to \n     present the highlights of a career that continues to have a \n     positive impact on our country and the entire world.\n       Senator Hartke is credited by the definitive book on the \n     Great Society, Guns or Butter, with being one of six Senators \n     who passed Medicare, the crown jewel of the Great Society. He \n     is often called the ``Father of Medicare.'' The \n     Jeffersonville Evening News wrote that he was, ``instrumental \n     in gaining passage of more legislation to benefit the elderly \n     than any other senator.''\n       Vance Hartke created his own Peace Corps, the International \n     Executive Service Corps still going strong after 30 years, \n     with activities all over the world. The U.S. ``business peace \n     corps'' has been emulated in 23 developed countries in the \n     world, with 35,000 business leaders participating, with each \n     replicated version also having outreach to every developing \n     country in the world.\n       His successful passage of the Kidney Dialysis Amendment \n     saved 500,000 lives and continues to save lives today, \n     earning him the following observation by Richard Margolis: \n     ``We can measure our greatness in compassion, too.'' Perhaps \n     this quote best represents Hartke's legacy.\n       During his 18 years in the U.S. Senate, Hartke spearheaded \n     the passage of every major educational bill, among them, the \n     Guaranteed Student Loan Act and the Adult Education Act, \n     which are still going strong today. He has a perfect voting \n     record as rated by the National Education Association.\n       As a matter of personal conscience, he broke with President \n     Lyndon Johnson in 1965 to oppose the war in Vietnam at a time \n     when fewer than 300 Americans had been killed.\n       Senator Hartke was a Civil Rights champion--even in the \n     face of death threats to his family in Indiana from the Ku \n     Klux Klan.\n       Ralph Nader said of Hartke, ``He was the most consistently \n     effective advocate of the consumer in the Senate.''\n       Ed Lewis, the well-known Indiana lawyer who died in 1996, \n     called him ``a visionary, an environmentalist before people \n     knew how to spell the word.'' The national environmental \n     community honored him with a ``Special Tribute'' at the 1997 \n     Clinton-Gore Environmental Inaugural Ball.\n       Senator Hartke was a candidate for President of the United \n     States in 1972.\n       In summation, this prodigious record of achievement \n     represents not only a tremendous contribution to the people \n     he represented for 18 years in Indiana, but to every citizen \n     of this nation who has benefitted from the legacy he created \n     for us.\n\n                               S. Res. 68\n\n       Whereas millions of women and girls living under Taliban \n     rule in Afghanistan are denied their basic human rights;\n       Whereas according to the Department of State and \n     international human rights organizations, the Taliban \n     continues to commit widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses, in gross violation of internationally accepted \n     norms;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     Country Report on Human Rights Practices (hereafter ``1998 \n     State Department Human Rights Report''), violence against \n     women in Afghanistan occurs frequently, including beatings, \n     rapes, forced marriages, disappearances, kidnapings, and \n     killings;\n       Whereas women and girls under Taliban rule are generally \n     barred from working, going to school, leaving their homes \n     without an immediate male family member as chaperone, and \n     visiting doctors, hospitals or clinics;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, gender restrictions by the Taliban continue to \n     interfere with the delivery of humanitarian assistance to \n     women and girls in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, under Taliban rule women are forced to don a head-to-\n     toe garment known as a burqa, which has only a mesh screen \n     for vision, and many women found in public not wearing a \n     burqa, or wearing a burqa that does not properly cover the \n     ankles, are beaten by Taliban militiamen;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, some poor women under Taliban rule cannot afford the \n     cost of a burqa and thus are forced to remain at home or risk \n     beatings if they go outside the home without one;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, the lack of a burqa has resulted in the inability of \n     some women under Taliban rule to get necessary medical care \n     because they cannot leave home;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, women under Taliban rule reportedly have been beaten \n     if their shoe heels click when they walk;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, under Taliban rule women in homes must not be visible \n     from the street, and houses with female occupants must have \n     their windows painted over;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, under Taliban rule women are not allowed to drive, \n     and taxi drivers reportedly have been beaten if they take \n     unescorted women as passengers;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, women under Taliban rule are forbidden to enter \n     mosques or other places of worship; and\n       Whereas women and girls of all ages under Taliban rule have \n     suffered needlessly and even died from curable illness \n     because they have been turned away from health care \n     facilities because of their gender: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should instruct the United States \n     Representative to the United Nations to use all appropriate \n     means to prevent any Taliban-led government in Afghanistan \n     from obtaining the seat in the United Nations General \n     Assembly reserved for Afghanistan so long as gross violations \n     of internationally recognized human rights against women and \n     girls persist; and\n       (2) the United States should refuse to recognize any \n     government in Afghanistan which is not taking actions to \n     achieve the following goals in Afghanistan:\n       (A) The effective participation of women in all civil, \n     economic, and social life.\n       (B) The right of women to work.\n       (C) The right of women and girls to an education without \n     discrimination and the reopening of schools to women and \n     girls at all levels of education.\n       (D) The freedom of movement of women and girls.\n       (E) Equal access of women and girls to health facilities.\n       (F) Equal access of women and girls to humanitarian aid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/06/senate-section/article/S4933-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ORDER FOR STAR PRINT\n\n  Mr. ENZI.
