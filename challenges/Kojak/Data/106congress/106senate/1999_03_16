Mr. President, with regard to the missile defense bill, it \nseems to me good progress is being made. And the fact that we did not \nhave to have a vote on a motion to proceed or on cloture on a motion to \nproceed was a very positive development.\n  I hope the Cochran amendment can be adopted and perhaps other action \ntaken today, but if we could actually get to final passage of this bill \ntonight, that would be very positive, because we do have two other \nissues we would like to be able to consider in some form this week. One \nof them is the matter of Kosovo, how the Senate wishes to express \nitself on that issue and how ground troops would be introduced, if at \nall. And then also we have the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill pending. Next week, the entirety of the week will have to be spent \non the budget resolution in order to complete action on that before the \nEaster recess. So the sooner we can finish the missile defense bill, \nthe better it will be in addressing these other issues in a timely \nfashion.\n\n  Mr. President, I know that Senators Hagel and Reid and Edwards are in \nthe Chamber and wish to speak on the resolution commemorating this \nCongressional Medal of Honor given to Senator Kerrey, but I would like \nto take just 5 minutes or so to talk about the missile defense bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2695-7", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2695-S2696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support and am a proud sponsor of \nS. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. If enacted, it would \nmake the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as is \ntechnologically possible, an effective national missile defense system \ncapable of defending the territory of the United States against limited \nballistic missile attack, whether accidental, unauthorized, or \ndeliberate.\n  As I go around the country and I talk about this issue, people are \nsurprised, stunned, to hear that we do not have this missile defense \ncapability right now. They think that if there happened to be a rogue \nmissile launched, accidentally or even intended, we would be able to \njust knock that out, no problem. When they find out we do not have\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\nthat technology in place now, they are greatly alarmed.\n  So I commend the principal sponsors of this bipartisan legislation, \nSenator Cochran of Mississippi and Senator Inouye of Hawaii, for their \ndiligent efforts to ensure that all 50 States--indeed, all Americans--\nenjoy protection against missile attack.\n  My colleagues are aware that similar legislation has been brought \nbefore the Senate before--twice last year--and twice we failed, just \none vote short of cutting off a filibuster. I am glad it appears we may \nnot have a filibuster this time, that we can deal with the substance of \nthis bill and we can vote on amendments and hopefully get to final \npassage, because it is clear there is bipartisan support and the \nrealization that we need to move forward.\n  I know there are those who are concerned that it could be \nmisinterpreted what we are trying to do here and what are the \nramifications with regard to the ABM Treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty. My answer to that is that we should make it clear what our \nintentions are. This is a defensive mechanism; this is to go forward \nand develop the technology, and when we have that technology, then we \nshould move to deploy it. But we would have time to explain to one and \nall--whether it is Russia, members of the Russian Duma or the \nfederation in Russia, their leadership, or members of the Israeli \nKnesset--what our intentions are.\n  To make sure that is done, I have been discussing with the President \nand with Senator Daschle, and with others on both sides of the aisle, \nthe idea that we should set up a working group, patterned after the \nexample of the arms control observer group that served us quite well \nduring the 1980s and early 1990s when we were dealing with the SALT \ntreaties and we were trying to get disarmament agreements worked out in \nEurope and with the Soviet Union.\n  We had Senators and Members of Congress who met with representatives \nof the then Soviet Government. We went to the Soviet Union. We had them \ncome here. We had meetings in Geneva. And I believe that Members of the \nSenate who were involved will tell you it was very helpful. I discussed \nit with Senator Moynihan just yesterday at lunch, and he said clearly \nwhen he went to Geneva and met with the Russians and explained what our \nintentions were, and they talked about their concerns about cruise \nmissiles in Europe, that everybody had a better understanding.\n  So what I have advocated is that we set up a group which would be \nentitled something like this, although I am not wedded to a title, but \nthe national security and missile defense working group, and that \nSenator Cochran would chair that group. I understand Senator Daschle \nhas some Senators in mind on his side of the aisle--it would be equally \ndivided--who would be involved in this effort. It would be a follow-on \nto what we are trying to do with the National Missile Defense Act. I \nhope that before this day is out we can set up this group and it will \nrepresent a broad cross section of the Senate so that everybody will \nunderstand what is intended.\n  There are real dangers here. ``The threat is real, serious, and \ngrowing.'' That is not my quote. That is a quote of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, an analyst who works in this critical area.\n\n  Let me recite what has happened since March of last year: Pakistan \nlaunched a medium-range missile that it acquired from North Korea; \nChina and North Korea continue to provide Pakistan with technical and \nother assistance on missiles and nuclear weapons; Iran launched a \nmedium-range missile. The original design also came from North Korea. \nIt was improved by technology that it has been receiving from Russia \nand China. Up to this day, Russian companies are still exchanging \ntechnology and information with Iran. They are developing greater \ncapability. That is extremely dangerous.\n  While Congress has expressed its concern about this, the \nadministration has even taken actions against certain companies in \nRussia. It continues to this very moment. We know that Iran is \ninterested in developing and acquiring a long-range missile that could \nreach--yes--the United States as well as European capitals and that \nTehran is benefiting from this extensive assistance from Russia and \nfrom China.\n  North Korea is a very nervous situation. That country launched a \nlong-range missile last August that demonstrated both intent and \ncapability to deliver payloads over extremely long distances. Having \nbeen advised of this development, the CIA now concludes that the North \nKoreans ``would be able to use the three-stage configuration as a \nballistic missile. . .to deliver small payloads to ICBM ranges.'' With \nminor modifications, this missile, the CIA notes, could probably reach \nnot only Hawaii and Alaska but also the rest of the United States.\n  The People's Republic of China, PRC, likewise continues to engage in \na massive buildup of its missile forces both at the theater level--that \nis aimed against our friend, Taiwan, their neighbor--and the strategic \nlevel--aimed at, perhaps, even the United States.\n  Today the PRC has more than a dozen missiles aimed at American \ncities. Yet, we are told on occasion there is not a missile aimed at \nthe United States today. That is not true. The Chinese are in the \nprocess of developing multiple warheads for those and their next-\ngeneration mobile missiles, which are much more difficult to locate.\n  Sadly, there is a serious problem here, and it is one that is \ngrowing. Just recently, of course, is the situation brought to the \npublic's attention regarding China's nuclear espionage and how we are \ndealing with that. There are those wanting to know, How did this \nhappen? Who did it? Who is to blame? All of that is interesting and we \nshould determine that, but here is the real question: Is it still going \non? Have we stopped it?\n  I think Congress should take a serious look at this situation. We \nneed to deal with some laws to make it possible for us to stop this \nsort of espionage. Do they need additional money? We would need to have \nthe appropriate briefing from the Energy Department and the CIA to \njudge whether or not additional money should be needed.\n  This post-cold-war era is a unique time, but it is also a dangerous \ntime. It is a time when historically, reviewing what we have done in \nthe past, we drop our guard when there appears to be times of calm and \npeace, but I think that is when we are at our greatest danger. Our \ninability to defend against incoming accidental or rogue-launched \nmissiles is our Achilles' heel. It is where we are in the greatest \ndanger. Would we not act? Should we not begin the process now? The \ntruth of the matter is we should have already done it. If we don't, \nthere will come a time soon--perhaps early in the millennium--when we \nwill, in fact, be threatened and in serious danger.\n  This National Missile Defense Act will get us started. It will be the \nkind of progress we need. We will still have to make the decisions \nabout the appropriations and when we actually go forward with \ndeployment. I sense there has been movement in the Senate on this \nissue. I know there has been movement in the administration on this \nissue. Now is the time to act. I hope the Senate will do it in an \nexpeditious and bipartisan manner. I believe we will look back on this \nbill and this vote as one of the most significant votes that we take in \nthe year 1999.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2696-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS.

Res. 61) commending the Honorable J. \n     Robert Kerrey, United States Senator from Nebraska, on the \n     30th anniversary of the events giving rise to his receiving \n     the Medal of Honor.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding there is 1 hour reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is 1 hour \nequally divided under the control of the Senator from Nebraska and the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the order we intend to follow to speak on \nthis resolution will be myself first, followed by the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel, Senator Moynihan will speak next, followed by \nSenator Reid from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, this resolution is supported by all Senators, other \nthan Senator Kerrey.\n  I will talk for just a moment about how I got to know Senator Kerrey \nand what I have learned about him. Senator Kerrey and I first met about \n2 years ago when I was looking for a new job, the job that I presently \nhave as U.S. Senator from North Carolina. At the time, Senator Kerrey \nwas the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. I came \nhere to Washington to meet with Senator Kerrey and was grilled by him \non why I was seeking this office, what my motivations were, and why I \nthought I should be able to represent the people of North Carolina in \nthis esteemed body.\n  Over the course of brief time through campaigning and spending lots \nof time together, we have gotten to know each other very well. He is \nthe definition of a leader, in my mind. Here is a man who is \nindependent, clear thinking, always willing to speak his mind \nregardless of the politics, willing to speak against his own political \nparty if he believes that his position is right and just, who cares a \ngreat deal and empathizes for the plight of others.\n  He has done an extraordinary job during the time I have seen him work \nhere in the Senate during the brief time that I have been here. He is \nthe kind of Senator who many of us young Senators would like to \nemulate.\n  I want to talk for just a minute about the events that give rise to \nthis resolution. Thirty years ago this past Sunday, Senator Kerrey, \nwhen he was a Navy SEAL, commanded a unit of Navy SEALs that were \ninvolved in an attack on the Vietcong. His unit scaled a 350-foot shear \ncliff in order to position themselves for the attack.\n  During the course of the attack on the Vietcong, a grenade exploded \nat the feet of Senator Kerrey. He was severely injured by the grenade, \nbut in spite of these severe injuries, which eventually led to the loss \nof a part of his leg, he continued to direct the attack in a clear-\nthinking way that eventually led to victory by this Navy SEAL team.\n  The work he did on that day was extraordinarily courageous and showed \nthe leadership that we have come to know over the last 30 years since \nthat event occurred. He went from that event to winning the Medal of \nHonor for the events that occurred on that day, and from that place to \na veterans hospital in Philadelphia for a long, long period of \nrecuperation.\n  I will first read the last sentence of that citation that he received \nat the time he received his Medal of Honor, which I think encapsulates \nwhat Senator Kerrey did 30 years ago this past Sunday.\n       Kerrey's courageous and inspiring leadership, valued \n     fighting spirit, and tenacious devotion to duty in the face \n     of almost overwhelming opposition sustain and enhance the \n     finest traditions of the United States Naval service.\n\n  The courage and leadership that Senator Kerrey showed on that day, as \nI mentioned earlier, led to his receipt of the Medal of Honor. From \nthere, he went to a veterans hospital in Philadelphia for a long, long \nperiod of recuperation and, as he has told many of his friends and \ncolleagues, it was a very difficult time for him. He went from there to \nbecoming a successful businessman, and he eventually became Governor of \nNebraska. That led to the time he has spent here in the U.S. Senate.\n  As I mentioned, Senator Kerrey is a man who most of us look up to; he \nis clear thinking and independent minded. The thing that always \ninspires me about him is his willingness to speak up even when speaking \nup is not always in his best political interest or in the best \npolitical interest of his party. He, as I mentioned, is the definition \nof a leader.\n  I want to mention one quote that I think is critically important in \nunderstanding the kind of leadership that Senator Kerrey has brought to \nthis body during the time he has been here. It is a quote that he gave \nrecently to a Nebraska newspaper:\n\n       It's odd to say, but this all became a real gift in many \n     ways.\n\n  Speaking now of the events that occurred 30 years ago this past \nSunday and the injuries he received as a result:\n\n       It's odd to say, but this all became a real gift in many \n     ways. The world got bigger to me. I didn't realize there was \n     so much pain in the world. Up until then, I presumed that if \n     I didn't feel it, then it wasn't happening. But it's going on \n     out there every day. In hospitals. In lots of homes.\n       I learned that the most valuable, priceless thing you can \n     give anyone is kindness. At the right moment, it can be life-\n     changing.\n\n  That is a perfect description of Senator Bob Kerrey. It is the reason \nthat he is the extraordinary man and the extraordinary leader and the \nextraordinary Senator that he has been in this body, and he is the \nreason that I support, with great enthusiasm, this resolution honoring \nhim.\n  At this time, I yield for the junior Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from North \nCarolina for helping organize this recognition of our friend and \ncolleague, my senior Senator from the State of Nebraska, Bob Kerrey.\n  In 1979, on the cover of a Newsweek magazine, with a glorious picture \nof Teddy Roosevelt riding to the charge, the headline blared out, \n``Where Have Our Heroes Gone?''\n  Mr. President, that was in 1979, at a time when many Americans were \nquestioning the very foundation and base of our Government and our \nsociety. They were reaching out for inspiration and courage and asking \nthe Newsweek 1979 question, ``Where have our heroes gone?''\n  There are heroes all around us. One in our midst is the man whom we \nrecognize this morning, Bob Kerrey. Bob Kerrey is a hero for many \nreasons. Anyone who has been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, \nour Nation's highest award for valor and bravery, is a hero. But the \nmark of a hero is what happens after that recognition. What has Bob \nKerrey done with his life since that time 30 years ago when he, in a \nselfless, valorous way, led his men and put his men, his duty, his \ncountry and his mission above himself? What has happened to this man \nsince?\n  Well, as he tells the story, in a rather self-effacing way--that is \nhow we Nebraskans are, humble, self-effacing--the only flaw I can find \nin Kerrey is that he was not Army. But other than that defect, he has \nconducted himself rather well.\n  The mark of a hero is what one has taken in life--the good, the bad, \nand all that is in between, and how they have applied that to make the \nworld better, and what they have done to improve the lives of others. \nThat begins with some belief--belief in oneself, belief in one's \ncountry, belief in others, belief that in fact God has given us all \nstrengths, resources and weaknesses. As Bob Kerrey has often said, \nthere were so many who surrounded him after those days in Vietnam--in \nthe hospital, in rehabilitation--who helped him put his life back \ntogether. That is what inspired him. He rose inspired as well. He rose \nand reinspired, and reinspired, and reinspired. They lead and they \nnever stop and they never stop. That is the story, to me, that is most \nmagnificent about Bob Kerrey.\n\n  It is appropriate that we recognize one of our own on the floor of \nthe Senate today. I am particularly proud because I come from the State \nwhere Bob Kerrey was grounded with foundations, with values, with \nstandards, with expectations; and so I know how he has inspired our \nState. Our colleagues know how he has inspired this body and the people \naround him, and they know of the lives of the people that he has \ntouched.\n  For all of those reasons, and more, Mr. President, I am proud to take \na moment to share in recognizing the goodness and, yes, the heroism of \nour friend and our colleague, Bob Kerrey. To you, good friend, I salute \nyou.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am honored, sir, to follow the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska and his remarks. And might I begin \nwith a phrase from the old Navy--by which I mean the old, old Navy--\nwhen a fellow was mustering out, he would say, ``I'm going to put that \noar on my shoulder.'' And the reference was that you were going to put \nthat oar on your shoulder and march inland until you reached a town \nwhere someone said, ``Hey, fella, what's that thing you've got on your \nshoulder?'' And then you could settle down in comfort after years at \nsea. Nebraska would surely qualify for such a site. This extraordinary \nman, who left Nebraska, joined the Navy, brought such honor and \ndistinction to himself, and now to the Senate is remarkable indeed.\n  You've heard of his work. Just a word about the man. Hemingway said \nthat courage was grace under pressure. Bob Kerrey has shown that grace \nfrom that very moment 30 years ago on that bluff. Michael Barone in the \nAlmanac of American Politics recounts that when asked about the medals \nhe had won, Senator Kerrey answered, ``One Purple Heart, one Bronze \nStar--one whatever.'' Well, the ``whatever'' is, of course, the \nCongressional Medal of Honor. There have been--all told--five U.S. \nSenators to have won that medal. It was created during the Civil War. \nFour of the senators received the medal for service in the Civil War. \nAnd now, 134 years later, a fifth.\n\n  Bob Kerrey does do such honor to this body, as he has done to his \ncountry, with grace under pressure. Perhaps nothing more distinguished \nhim than the long and difficult time in the Philadelphia Naval Hospital \nwitnessed by many, including the marine Lewis Puller, Jr.--son of the \nmost decorated marine in history. He wrote of Senator Kerrey, ``His \nstoicism, though unnerving, was a source of amazement to all.'' It \ncontinues such. It continues with an evenness that can be eerie at the \nsame moment it is inspiring. Robert Novak has recently written that \nwhat sets Senator Kerrey apart is how ``unashamedly he preaches love of \nand service to country.'' And so, sir, from another generation and in a \nfar distant conflict, this lieutenant junior grade salutes him and \nwould have the Senate know--those who don't--that when a Medal of Honor \nwinner appears anywhere on ship, the answer is, ``Attention all \nhands.'' He is to be so saluted on all occasions and honored throughout \nhis life, and for the extraordinary legacy he will one day leave.\n  I salute you, sir.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nNevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the junior Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend from Nevada for \nyielding. I will be very brief.\n  Mr. President, I happened to be serving in the Republic of Vietnam at \nthe time that this particular act of heroism was made. I am more than a \nlittle familiar with the criteria for the particular award that was \ngiven. Almost any major award for gallantry is subject to some degree \nof subjectivity. This is the one that is clearly proven beyond any \nreasonable doubt to have been awarded meritoriously under any and all \ncircumstances.\n  I join all of my colleagues who are here, including those veterans \nwho served in Vietnam with our distinguished Senator, and I thank my \ncolleague for yielding. This is one that makes all of us proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Groucho Marx used to say that he wouldn't \nbelong to any club that would have him as a member. I get that feeling \nabout the very small club consisting of those who have been awarded the \nMedal of Honor.\n\n  Nobody asks to join, the price of admission is too high. Nobody \napplies, the rules don't permit applications.\n  You get in this select club by doing something that no one would do, \nor should I say rarely does, and most of the time you pass the test by \nnot surviving it.\n  I dare say that if Bob Kerrey had been offered membership in this \nclub as a volunteer, he would have declined. But membership isn't \nvoluntary.\n  Once you have performed those acts of outstanding courage, of valor, \nof heroism--above and beyond the call of duty--once you have come \nthrough the valley of the shadow of death and into the light--once you \nhave, in the unique circumstances of military combat, saved lives and \ntaken lives and in most instances, given your own life, to qualify for \nthe medal--you are a marked man.\n  Bob Kerrey bears that mark. That mark shows through his grace, and \nhis intelligence and concentration and wit--aspects with which, I dare \nsay, many in our body are handsomely endowed.\n  That mark shines above his hard work, love of country, and respect \nfor his fellow members--qualities which most here share in ample \nquantity.\n  That mark transcends every other skill or point of character which \nmakes us all unique human beings. The mark Bob Kerrey bears is his \nhaving given one of his limbs for our country.\n\n  The mark Bob Kerrey wears is his unique courage, his honor, his \nvalor. He shows it in his daily life, in his political decisions, and \nin his dealings with the world.\n  Bob Kerrey, when dealing with entitlements, education, Iraq, and farm \nissues, has shown unparalleled courage. But, to me he is simply my \nfriend.\n  Thirty years ago, on an island in Southeast Asia, ten thousand miles \nfrom the Senate Chamber, Navy Lt. Bob Kerrey did something above and \nbeyond the call of duty. If he did nothing else with the rest of his \nlife, we would, as Americans, honor him for what he did on that island \nfar away.\n  I suspect, however, when the time comes--as for all of us it must--to \nsummarize this man's contributions to his friends, his Nation, and the \nworld--the Congressional Medal of Honor will be cited, not as an award \nwhich shaped the man, but rather as just one example in a life and \nlitany of courage which has known no bounds and which serves as a \nPlatonic example for the rest of us to pursue, but never to achieve.\n  Thank you, Senator Bob Kerrey, for sharing with the people of \nNebraska, this Nation, and each of us who serve with you--your \nexemplary life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, ``It was my duty.'' So did my friend and \ncolleague Bob Kerrey recently respond to a question by CBS' Bob \nSchieffer, who had asked my friend why he did it--why he led his elite \nSEAL team up a 350-foot sheer cliff and then down into the waiting \nenemy's camp, suffering life-threatening injuries in the process but \neffectively commanding his team throughout their successful mission.\n  For then-Lieutenant Kerrey, his duty was his honor, and his country's \ncause was his highest calling. That a young man from the plains of \nNebraska showed ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of \nhis life above and beyond the call of duty'' in Vietnam, as his Medal \nof Honor citation recalls, reminds us that exceptional heroism can \nspring from the humblest of roots.\n  It was his duty, Bob says. Near the very beginning of the assault on \nthe Viet Cong camp, a grenade exploded at his feet, injuring him \nterribly and threatening the success of the mission. In similar \ncircumstances, many men, incapacitated and bleeding, might have given \nup. Not Bob. His sense of duty did not allow it.\n  His sense of duty compelled him to fight on, despite the trauma of \nsustaining multiple injuries, including one that would take his leg, \nand despite the chaos of battle, which has undone other good men who \nhave found themselves in less dire circumstances.\n  Bob's courageous leadership won that battle on a Vietnamese island in \nNha Trang Bay thirty years ago. ``I don't remember doing anything \nespecially heroic,'' says the plain-spoken Nebraskan. Although I do not \nknow the men Bob commanded on that fateful day, I do know that their \ntestimonial to his selfless heroism ensured that history recorded my \nfriend's sacrifice.\n  That record, in the form of Bob's Medal of Honor citation, has surely \ninspired countless Americans in uniform\n\n[[Page S2699]]\n\nover the past thirty years. As my colleagues know, it is with reverence \nand awe that uniformed service members and veterans speak of America's \nMedal of Honor recipients. They are, indeed, the heroes' heroes.\n  I myself am privileged to have served in the United States Navy, as \ndid my father and grandfather before me. They would tell you, as I do \ntoday, how honored we all should be to know a man like Bob Kerrey, a \nman whose fighting spirit earned him the nation's highest award for \nexceptional military service above and beyond the call of duty.\n  I am deeply honored to serve in the Senate with Bob. Ironically, he \nwould be the first to tell you that he felt little calling for public \nservice when he came home from Vietnam. For he came home not only with \na broken body, but with an understandable resentment about the war, and \ntoward those politicians in Washington who conducted it.\n  Bob's faith in our Nation and the values she embodies was reaffirmed \nby his military service. ``It's a great country that will fight for \nother people's freedom,'' he says. But his faith in his Government was \nshaken, as was that of many Americans, after the divisive experience of \nVietnam.\n  What restored Bob's faith in his Government? By his reckoning, it was \nthe Philadelphia Naval Hospital where he spent months in surgery and \ntherapy. As Bob has said, the fact that our Government would build and \nfund a hospital for people like him--anonymous people who had never \ncontributed to a politician's campaign--and provide the medical care \nthey needed, simply because they were wounded Americans, was \ninspirational. So were the medical staff and volunteers who helped heal \nhis wounds.\n  Faith renewed, Bob went on to become Governor of Nebraska and a U.S. \nSenator. His independent leadership on some of the toughest issues we \nface today, including Social Security, education, and tax reform, \ndemonstrates that this man, who gave so much for his country in \nmilitary service, makes an important contribution to America's \ngovernance in peacetime.\n  In the words of Bob's Medal of Honor citation:\n\n       Lt. (j.g.) Kerrey's courageous and inspiring leadership, \n     valiant fighting spirit, and tenacious devotion to duty in \n     the face of almost overwhelming opposition sustain and \n     enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n  That leadership and sense of duty continues to motivate his public \nservice today.\n  Bob's contribution to America's governance may grow. Although he will \nsit out next year's Presidential race, he may be a contender in the \nfuture. In the meantime, I am honored and privileged to work with him \nin the Senate.\n  Thank you for your valued service, Bob.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for his eloquence, as well as the Senator from Nevada, whom I \nalso heard. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for making the \neffort to allow us this opportunity on the floor this morning.\n  Mr. President, last week, when Joe DiMaggio died, I heard many people \nsay it is a shame how few heroes there are left among us. To anyone who \nbelieves that, I say: Meet my friend, Bob Kerrey. To me and to many \nothers, he is a genuine American hero.\n  As others have noted, on a moonless black night, 30 years ago this \npast Sunday, Lieutenant Kerrey, then a 25-year-old Navy SEAL commander, \nled his squad in a surprise attack on North Vietnamese Army guerillas \non the island of Hon Tre.\n  During the fierce firefight that broke out, an enemy grenade exploded \non the ground beside him. The blast shattered his right leg below the \nknee, badly wounded his right hand, and pierced much of his body with \nshrapnel.\n  Despite his massive injuries, Lieutenant Kerrey continued to direct \nhis squad until the last man was safely evacuated. Days later, doctors \nwere forced to amputate his injured leg just below the knee. Lieutenant \nKerrey had been in Vietnam only 3 months.\n  For his sacrifice, he was awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, \nand the highest award our nation bestows for bravery, the Congressional \nMedal of Honor. But it is not only what others pinned over his heart \nthat makes Bob Kerrey a hero. It is what is in his heart.\n  Joseph Robert Kerrey returned from Vietnam angry and disillusioned. \nWhat he endured in Vietnam, and what he saw later at the Philadelphia \nNaval Hospital, where he spent nine months learning how to walk again, \nshook his faith--both in the war, and in the Government that had sent \nhim there. It forced him to re-examine everything he had ever believed \nabout his country. But slowly, out of his pain and anger and doubt, he \nbegan to acquire a new faith in this Nation.\n  Years ago, when he was Governor of Nebraska, he described that faith \nto a reporter. He said, ``There are . . . people who like to say, `You \nknow all these subsidy programs we've got? They make people lazy.' And \nI like to jump right in their face and say, that is an absolute lie.'' \nGovernment help ``didn't make me lazy. It made me grateful.''\n  Another time, he put it more simply. While government ``almost killed \nme'' in a war, he said, government also ``saved my life.''\n  It was the United States Government, he said, that fitted him with a \nprosthesis and taught him to walk again. It was the Government that \npaid for the countless operations he needed. Later, in 1973, it was the \nGovernment that helped him open his first restaurant with his brother-\nin-law. Two years later, when that restaurant was destroyed in a \ntornado, it was the Government--the people of the United States--that \nloaned them the money to rebuild.\n  As Governor and, for the last 11 years, as a Member of the Senate, \nBob Kerrey has fought to make sure Government works for all Americans. \nHe has fought to make health care more affordable and accessible.\n  He has fought to give entrepreneurs the chance to turn their good \nideas into profitable businesses. He has fought to make sure this \nnation keeps its promises to veterans.\n  He has also fought tirelessly to preserve family farms and rural \ncommunities.\n  For several years now, I've had the good fortune to serve with \nSenator Kerrey on the Agriculture Committee. I know how deeply \ncommitted he is to restoring the agricultural economy.\n  In 1994, he played a key role in preserving the Federal crop \ninsurance program, and today, with the Presiding Officer he is one of \nthe leaders in the effort to strengthen it again, so we reduce our \nover-reliance on disaster programs and make the system fairer and more \npredictable for producers.\n  Senator Kerrey is continually looking for new ways to create new \nopportunities for American farmers. He is a strong supporter of \nethanol, and of increased agricultural research. He is committed to \npreserving the integrity of the U.S. food supply, so that we continue \nto have the safest, most abundant, most economical food supply in the \nworld.\n  Like Senator Kerrey, I come from a state that is made up mostly of \nsmall towns and rural communities, so I am personally grateful to him \nfor his efforts to help agricultural producers. I am also grateful for \nhis insistence that rural America be treated fairly on a whole array of \ncritical issues, from expanding the information superhighway, to \nimproving our health care system, and strengthening the schools \nAmerica's children attend, especially in rural areas.\n  But Senator Kerrey's greatest contribution to this Senate, and to \nthis Nation, may be that he is not afraid to challenge conventional \nwisdom. In 1994, almost single-handedly, he created and chaired the \nBipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. Conventional \nwisdom said, don't get involved with entitlements. You can't make \nanyone happy; you can only make enemies.\n  But Bob Kerrey's personal experience told him that preserving Social \nSecurity and Medicare was worth taking a risks--risking some political \ncapital. He has repeatedly opposed efforts to amend our Constitution to \nmake flag-burning a crime. It is politically risky, even for a wounded \nwar hero, to take such a position. But Senator Kerrey has taken that \nrisk, time and time again, because--in his words:\n\n       America is a beacon of hope for the people of this world \n     who yearn for freedom from the\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\n     despotism of ``repressive government.'' This hope is diluted \n     when we advise others that we are frightened by flag burning.\n\n  He is, at heart, a genuine patriot.\n  He was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, one of 7 children. His father was a \nbuilder, his mother was a housewife. As a child, he suffered from such \nsevere asthma that one of his teachers later said, when he breathed, he \nsometimes sounded like a fireplace bellows. Despite his asthma, he was \non his high school basketball, football, golf and swim teams. Is anyone \nsurprised?\n\n  After high school, he went to the University of Nebraska, where he \nfinished his 5-year pharmacy program in 4 years. His asthma likely \nwould have given him a legitimate way to avoid military service, but he \nwasn't looking for a way out.\n  Shortly after he graduated, he enlisted in the Navy as an officer \ncandidate. The Navy was then just starting its elite SEALs program, the \nNavy's version of the Green Berets. Of the 5,000 men who applied for \nunderwater demolition training with the SEALs, only 197 were selected, \nand only about 60 made it through the brutal training. His plan was to \ndo his duty with the SEALs and return to Nebraska to work as a \npharmacist. He made the SEALs, with asthma. Is anyone surprised?\n  But then that all changed on that black night 30 years ago. When he \nfinally got the chance to practice pharmacy after he had been put back \ntogether at the naval hospital, he discovered he could no longer stand \nfor as long as the job required. Changing courses, he and his brother-\nin-law started a restaurant. Eventually they would own several \nrestaurants and health clubs and employ more than 900 people. Is anyone \nsurprised?\n  In the beginning, they did everything themselves, from tending bar to \nflipping burgers to washing dishes. Is anyone surprised?\n  He entered politics in 1982, beating an incumbent Republican Governor \nin a heavily Republican State. At the time, Nebraska was in the middle \nof a terrible budget and farm crisis. Over the next 4 years, he \nreplaced the 3-percent deficit he inherited with a 7-percent surplus. \nKnowing Bob Kerrey, is anyone surprised?\n  He never received lower than a 55-percent approval rating for the \nentire time he was Governor. In 1985, when he stunned Nebraskans by \nannouncing that he would not seek a second term, he was at a 70-percent \napproval rating.\n  After the Governor's office, he went briefly to Santa Barbara, CA, \nwhere he taught a college class on the Vietnam War with Walter Capps. \nIn 1988, Nebraskans elected him to the U.S. Senate. In 1992, he ran for \nour party's Presidential nomination. He is a fierce defender of \nNebraska's interests and a national leader as well.\n  This Senate is enriched by the contributions of many heroes from \ndifferent wars, Mr. President:\n  Max Cleland, who lost an arm and both of his legs in Vietnam, holds a \nSilver Star. Chuck Hagel holds two Purple Hearts. Fritz Hollings holds \na Bronze Star. Danny Inouye lost an arm in Italy in World War II. He \nwas awarded a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star, and the Distinguished \nService Cross. John Kerry holds the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, three \nPurple Hearts, the National Defense Service Medal, and two Presidential \nUnit Citations. John McCain spent 5\\1/2\\ years in hell as a POW. He \nholds a Silver Star, a Bronze Star, a Legion of Merit honor, a Purple \nHeart, and the Distinguished Flying Cross. Bill Roth holds a Bronze \nStar. Ted Stevens was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and two \nAir Medals in World War II. Many other Senators served with distinction \nas well in times of peace as well as in times of war.\n  One Senator among us holds the Congressional Medal of Honor. To him, \nthis Nation is indebted for all that he did to achieve it.\n  I am reminded of a story Senator Kerrey has told many times about a \nconversation he had with his mother 30 years ago. Doctors at the \nPhiladelphia Naval Hospital had just amputated his leg. When he awoke \nfrom surgery, his mother was standing at his bedside. ``How much is \nleft?'' he asked her.\n  His mother said, ``There's a lot left.'' As Senator Kerrey says, \n``She wasn't talking about body parts. She was talking about here.'' \nShe was talking about what is in his heart.\n  For 30 years, Bob Kerrey has drawn on the courage and compassion of \nwhat is here--first to rebuild his own life, then to try to make a \nbetter life for people in Nebraska, and then for people all across this \ncountry. He is to me a genuine American hero, and he is my friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I can't pass up the opportunity to \nembarrass Bob Kerrey. I know, as we all do, that he did not ask for \nthis and that it is always uncomfortable to come to your own wake, but \nhe deserves it. I want to participate in it and do what I can to not \nonly add to his embarrassment a little, but to let him know how well \nregarded he is on both sides of the aisle and among those who may \ndisagree with him on all of the great issues that the minority leader \njust listed.\n  I served in the military at a time when the only shots I ever heard \nfired were in basic training. After I got out of basic training, I \nended up in classroom and spent my time trying to teach surveying to a \ngroup of draftees who didn't understand what the word meant. The only \nreason I was doing that is because my particular military specialty, \nfor which I was being trained, was being phased out in the way the \nmilitary always does. They train you for an obsolete skill and then \nmake you an instructor to teach that skill to other people who do not \nneed it.\n\n  I have absolutely no basis for identifying with the group, the very \nsmall group of people who have heard shots fired in anger, who have \nfaced the difficulty and the challenge of combat. I can only read about \nit. I can only hear about it. I cannot identify with it in any personal \nway.\n  So why am I taking the time to stand here and talk about the \ncontribution of Bob Kerrey when everyone who has had those kinds of \nexperiences has talked about it? I am standing because of an experience \nI had 2 years ago--3 years ago now--with the former majority leader, \nBob Dole. I was on the campaign trail with Senator Dole, and we were \nout making the usual kinds of stops. I was told our next stop was in \nBattle Creek, MI. Battle Creek, MI, to me means breakfast cereal. I had \nno idea why Senator Dole wanted to go to Battle Creek, MI.\n  We went into a building in Battle Creek, a Federal building. It was \nunder renovation, but the lobby had not been renovated. I felt as if I \nhad walked into a movie set. It was the 1940s all over again. This \nbuilding, being renovated into a Federal office building, had been a \nFederal hospital. It was the hospital where Bob Dole spent, on and off, \n3 years of his life. They had found the place--that is, the floor--\nwhere Bob Dole's bed had been when he was taken there in a condition \nwhere he could do nothing for himself. He couldn't brush his teeth \nhimself. He certainly couldn't go to the bathroom for himself. He was \njust taken there and placed in a bed and left there, as they began to \nwork on him.\n  We walked around the floor. As I say, it was being renovated. \nFinally, Senator Dole identified the place on that floor where his bed \nhad been. He stood there and said, ``Yep, that's the view out of the \nwindow; that's where the bathroom was, where I would be wheeled,'' so \non, so forth. ``Okay, let's go.''\n  It was the working press that said, ``Wait a minute, Senator. Don't \nleave. Tell us how you feel.''\n  Probably for the first time in public, Bob Dole told us what it was \nlike in a military hospital without any prospects, without any \nimmediate hope, completely paralyzed by his condition. The thing that \nstruck me the most and the thing that brings me to my feet today was \nhis description of some of the other things that happened in that war.\n  He said, catching me completely by surprise, ``Over there was where \nPhil Hart had his bed.''\n  And he said, ``Over there''--or maybe it was down the hall--``was \nDanny Inouye.'' He said, ``Phil wasn't hurt as badly as the rest of us, \nso he could get out from time to time. The Hart family owned a hotel \ndown the street, and he would go down to the hotel and get some decent \nfood for us and smuggle it in so that we didn't have the hospital food \nall the time.''\n  He said, ``Danny Inouye was the best bridge player in the whole \nhospital.''\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\nSubsequent to that, I talked to Senator Inouye on the subway and said, \n``I understand you were the best bridge player in the hospital in \nBattle Creek.'' He said, ``Oh, no, I wasn't very good; it's just that \nDole was terrible.''\n  Then Bob Dole said, ``As I got a little better, they began to move my \nbed around the hospital, because I could tell jokes and I would cheer \nsome of the others up.''\n  Why do I bring this up? Of course, we all know Bob Dole. We have \nnamed a building after Phil Hart. I don't know what we will name after \nDanny Inouye, but he is still here. I bring this up with respect to Bob \nKerrey because we honor these men not solely for what they did in the \nmilitary, not solely for what they did to rebuild their bodies, but for \nthe example they set to rebuild their lives. To me, that is more heroic \nthan the instant in battle when your instincts take over and you do \nwhat your duty tells you you have to do. I say that without ever having \nbeen there. So I could well be wrong.\n  But how much heroism is involved in pulling yourself together when \nyou are lying in a bed unable to brush your own teeth and say, ``I'm \ngoing to rebuild my body, I'm going to rebuild my life, I'm going to go \nto law school or found a restaurant,'' or do whatever it is that has to \nbe done to such an extent that you are qualified in the eyes of the \nvoters in the State in which you live to represent them in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  We are surrounded by heroes, not just because of what they did while \nunder enemy fire, but what they did in the years following when they \ngave our children and our contemporaries the example of never giving \nup, of never allowing what happened to them to destroy them. Bob Dole \nwas such a hero; Phil Hart was such a hero; Danny Inouye, John McCain, \nMax Cleland, and Bob Kerrey.\n  I will never join the select group of people who receive military \nhonors or military medals, but I am proud to be part of the select \ngroup that knows and works with these heroes, these men who have \ndemonstrated to us that what you do over a lifetime is many times more \nimportant than what you do in an instant, and Bob Kerrey stands at the \nfirst rank of that select group, and I salute him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, prior to making comments about the senior \nSenator from Nebraska, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator so much for yielding.\n  I say to the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Edwards, and the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, for arranging this, thank you. I \nthink it has been a very high moment in my career in the U.S. Senate. I \nsay to Senator Kerrey, I wish you never had been hurt in war, and I \njust want to thank you for coming back from that trauma, because it has \nchanged the lives of so many people.\n  To those who do not know Bob Kerrey as well as his colleagues know \nhim, I say this is a man of no wasted words. This is not a man of small \ntalk. This is a man with big vision, big ideas, and little time to \nwaste. One, I think, can make the leap that that experience, that brush \nwith death, has made him understand, as many do not understand, that \nlife is fleeting and life goes fast.\n  Although his rehabilitation must have seemed like an eternity, what \nhe got out of that clearly was the love and support of many people, and \nit made him realize that he wanted to have a chance to give that kind \nof support to others.\n  I consider working with Bob Kerrey an honor. It is always \ninteresting. It is always exciting. It is always an experience you can \nnever figure out until it actually happens, because he is not someone \nwho is driven by the ordinary; it is the extraordinary.\n  I add my words of praise for my friend Bob Kerrey. I also add words \nof praise for the people who rehabilitated you in your tough times. \nBecause of their work, we have you here.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, before the Senator from Rhode Island \nproceeds, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Eight minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n10 minutes so that Senators who are present will be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, today is one of those rare moments on the floor of the \nSenate that we can, with respect and reverence and, indeed, humility, \nsalute a true American hero, Senator Bob Kerrey.\n  Senator Kerrey is a man of great courage. That is obvious from his \naccomplishments, not just as a SEAL in Vietnam, but as a public figure \nfor many, many years. He is also a patriot, someone who loves this \ncountry deeply and sincerely and fervently. It is this patriotism which \ncaused him to join the U.S. Navy, although I suspect if you asked him \nback then, he would have made some type of joke about his joining the \nNavy and joining the SEALS. But in his heart, it was because of his \nprofound love for his country and his dedication to his future.\n  Then I suspect also that in the course of his training, he began to \nrealize that he had been given the most profound privilege any American \ncan be given, and that is the opportunity to lead American fighting \nmen. That privilege also implies a sacred trust, a commitment to do all \nyou can to lead your troops with both courage and sound judgment.\n  He was leading his SEALs that night 30 years ago. He had brought them \nto a dangerous place, and he was bound and determined, at the risk of \nhis own life, to bring them all back. He fought with great valor. He \nnever lost faith. He always insisted that what he would do would be in \nthe best interests of his men.\n  For him, the world then was very simple: his mission, his men, and \nthen, and only then, himself. He was and is a hero. Bob Kerrey saw war \nin all its brutality, in all its confusion, in all its senselessness, \nbut he never surrendered his heart and his spirit to that brutality. He \nnever let it harden his heart or cloud his judgment.\n\n  He came back from a war committed to continue to serve his Nation. He \nremains an idealist, and more importantly an idealist without \nillusions. And again in his acerbic way he would deny all this. But it \nis true.\n  He still believes deeply in his country. He still understands that it \nis necessary to lead. He still understands and keeps faith with those \nhe led and those, sadly, he left behind. He is somebody of whom we are \nall tremendously proud. And there is something else about Bob Kerrey \nwhich might explain how he could lead men successfully on virtually \nimpossible missions, because he has that kind of talent to walk into a \nroom when everyone else is depressed, feeling oppressed, feeling \nwithout hope, and the combination of his energy and his confidence and \nthat glint in his eye convince people they should follow him, even if \nthe task appears impossible.\n  Fortunately for us, he has brought these great skills to the U.S. \nSenate. He continues to serve his country. He continues to take the \ntough missions--not the milk runs but the hard missions. We all \nappreciate his courage and his valor.\n  We all have many personal anecdotes. Let me just share one. I admired \nBob Kerrey long before I ever got to the U.S. Senate. I met him several \ntimes before, but the first time I was really sort of speechless was on \nInauguration Day in 1996, where I showed up outside there in the \ncorridor a few feet away from here, ready to meet with my new \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate, and for the first time in my life, \nwithin a step away, I actually saw someone wearing the Medal of Honor. \nI looked at Senator Kerrey as a star-struck teenager would look at a \ngreat hero. And, in fact, that was one of the most rewarding and \nimpressive moments of that very impressive day.\n  But I will recall one other final anecdote. Bob and I were together \nin Nantucket a few years ago. We got up early one morning to go \nrunning. Now, I must confess, I thought I might have an advantage \nrunning against Senator Kerrey. After all, I am younger. But at about \nthe 3-mile mark, when he turned around and said, ``got to go'' and sped \naway, I felt a little chagrined. My youth and my other talents could \nnot keep up with this gentleman.\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\n  He honors us with his presence. He has honored us with his service. \nWe treasure him. We respect him. And today we are giving him his due.\n  Senator Kerrey, thank you for your service to this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, who controls time? How much time is \nremaining?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. We yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Daschle, Hagel and \nEdwards, for placing this resolution before us today; and I would like \nto speak just for a few moments about both the event and the person \nthat it commemorates.\n  This is an important anniversary in the life of one of our colleagues \nand one of our great friends, my personal friend, the senior Senator \nfrom the State of Nebraska. I first came to know Bob Kerrey during the \nvery time that we commemorate today. He and I were in the Navy \ntogether. We were in Vietnam together.\n  In fact, though we did not know each other, we knew of each other \nbecause it is inevitable that two young lieutenants with the same name, \nsomewhat in the same vicinity, will hear of each other. And irony of \nironies, I actually was on a couple of missions in the very area, Nha \nTrang Bay, just about 2 months or so prior to the event which led to \nBob winning the Medal of Honor.\n  Bob and I also knew of each other afterwards when he came back and he \nwas in the hospital and I had shortly thereafter returned. Our mail \ncrossed, and we have had about 30 years of our mail crossing. On one \noccasion I think my newsletter from Massachusetts went to Nebraska, and \npeople didn't know what that was all about. And on other occasions we \nhave joked about the fact that he probably received a couple of real \n``Dear John'' letters while he was in the hospital and quickly \ndiscerned they were not meant for him but for me. And I often had these \nimages of what he might have been reading of my mail. But at any rate, \nthat began sort of a strange odyssey for both of us long before our \npaths crossed in the U.S. Senate.\n  I still get letters about the wheat prices in Omaha and he still gets \nletters about the cod fishing in Massachusetts, and we somehow manage \nto work these things out. But, Mr. President, it is no light matter to \nsuggest that I have always had an enormous special respect for Bob \nKerrey. I am honored, as I think all of my colleagues are, to serve \nwith him here in the U.S. Senate.\n  It was 30 years ago this past Sunday that a 25-year-old lieutenant \njunior grade Bob Kerrey was, as we know, severely injured in Vietnam, \nsustaining those critical injuries that cost him his right leg. And \nover the years we have heard others describe, with great eloquence and \ngreat poignancy, the fighting on that island in Nha Trang Bay and the \ncourageous way in which Bob fought on after a grenade had exploded at \nhis feet, that he kept fighting even though he was nearly unconscious \nat the time, kept on the radio directing his men, leading--leading--in \nthe way that we have come to know and expect Bob Kerrey to lead, \nleading those SEALs under his command to suppress the enemy's fire and \nto try to safely get out of a bad situation.\n  I think, though, that what we really celebrate here today--and I \nthink for those of us who have served in Vietnam, it is not so much the \nfighting there as the things that people faced when they returned. In \nthat regard, I think Bob Kerrey has also traveled a very special \njourney. And it is a journey that teaches us a great deal, as it taught \nhim a great deal. It is a journey of personal recovery and of personal \ndiscovery.\n  In many ways, he struggled to put things back into perspective. It is \nnot easy to lose people; it is certainly not easy to lose a piece of \nyourself, and come back to a country that has deep questions itself \nabout why it was that it put you through that kind of turmoil. And Bob \nmanaged to sort all of that out, finding a special sense of humor, a \nkind of impish reverence, I think we might call it at times, that he \nshares with all of us to help keep a perspective in our lives.\n  He also forged a new patriotism out of that experience. Clearly, he \nwent as a patriot because he chose to go. But he came back and \nstruggled even with the definition of ``patriotism'' and of his concern \nand love for his country. He had to ``refind'' that, if you will, in \nthose difficult times.\n  I think it is fair to say that he has come back more tested, more \ncapable, and more understanding of what it means to care about the \ncountry and to give something to the country and to ask other people to \njoin you in doing that. So he has the ability here to ask all of us in \nthe Senate or our fellow citizens in the country to join with us in \nacts of giving in ways that others cannot.\n  I also say that it is not just for that that we celebrate his \npresence here, but he has been a steady friend and ally in the effort \nof a number of us here in the U.S. Senate to keep faith with the \nlingering questions over those who may have been left behind in the \ncourse of the war, and also to try to really make peace with Vietnam \nitself, and to help bring the Senate to a point where we were able to \nlead the country in normalizing relations and, indeed, putting the war \nbehind us.\n\n  It is a great pleasure for me to say how proud I am to serve with Bob \nKerrey, not just because of the qualities that were celebrated in the \nNation's highest award for valor, not just for the qualities that \npeople talk about for his military service, but, more importantly, for \nhis humanity and for his sense of purpose, for his idealism and for his \nunderstanding of the real priorities in life. I am delighted to be here \ntoday to share in this special celebration of who our colleague is and \nwhat he brings us.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. We yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina \nfor this resolution honoring our fellow colleague, Senator Bob Kerrey \nof Nebraska. I want to add my voice to those who have spoken in salute \nto this individual and the contribution he has made.\n  The Vietnam war was like nothing else in my life politically--I am \nsure virtually everyone my age in this Chamber would say the same \nthing--the way it preoccupied the attention of this country, the way it \ndominated our political and personal lives, and the debate that went on \nfor so many years. There were some who stayed and some who went and \nsome who protested; there were some who served. Everyone was touched by \nthat war in some way or another.\n  I was particularly struck by the story of our colleague, Senator Bob \nKerrey, and the contribution that he made as a member of the U.S. Navy \nand of course the injury which he sustained in his heroic effort on \nbehalf of our country. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a graduate of \nWest Point, talked about his humbling experience of joining Bob Kerrey \nfor a race. He is a jogger--a runner, if you will. I have joined him \nfor a race from time to time. You can tell by my physique I am not a \nrunner. However, it is always a humbling experience as Bob Kerrey comes \nmotoring past you with a big smile and you realize that this man just \ncan't be stopped. And I am glad he can't be stopped because he has made \nnot only a great contribution to his State and his country but he \ncontinues to do so.\n  A few years back, Senator Bob Kerrey got the notion that he wanted to \nrun for President of the United States. There were some Members of the \nHouse of Representatives who stood by him and endorsed his candidacy--\nthe few, the proud, the Members of Congress--who believed that Bob \nKerrey would have been an excellent President of the United States. I \nbelieve that today.\n  I have come to know this man even better as a Member of the U.S. \nSenate while serving with him. I know that he has courage. He showed it \nnot only in battle, but he shows it every day on the floor of the \nSenate. I cannot imagine\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\nwhat he has endured in his life. I only stand in awe and respect for \nwhat he brings to this institution because of that contribution. Very \nfew people in the history of the United States have been awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor. It is my great honor personally to count \none of those recipients as a personal friend and colleague.\n  I thank Senator Edwards and I salute my friend, Bob Kerrey. I am \nhappy to stand as a cosponsor of this resolution.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will conclude the remarks, and if Senator Kerrey has remarks to \nmake, of course we would love to hear them.\n  I have listened this morning to the remarks from all of these \ndistinguished Senators on this wonderful day honoring this \nextraordinary man. This is a man who loves others more than he loves \nhimself, a man who loves his country more than he loves himself.\n  I have to say, Senator Kerrey, I think your mother had it right when \nyou were lying on that hospital bed in Philadelphia after your \noperation that removed part of your leg when she said, ``There's an \nawful lot left.'' There is an awful lot left, and we Americans are the \nbeneficiaries of what is left.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I want to thank Senator Edwards, Senator Hagel, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Boxer, Senator Durbin, and all the others who have \nspoken. I appreciate very much and am very moved by these words and \nmore moved by the friendships in this body.\n  Thirty years ago is a long time. I am reminded of a slogan at the \nbeginning of any exercise to remember what happened, especially in \ncombat 30 years ago, and I will give you the watered-down version of \nthat slogan. The only difference between a fairy tale and a war story \nis, the fairy tale always begins, ``Once upon a time,'' and the war \nstory always starts off, ``No kidding, this is true; I was there.''\n  We don't necessarily have perfect memories when it comes to bringing \nback that moment and I, for one, have always been very uncomfortable--\nand Bob Bennett earlier said he wanted to make me uncomfortable by \nsaying some nice things about me. I have been uncomfortable for almost \n30 years to be introduced as a hero, and it made me somewhat \nuncomfortable in part because I did do something that was simply my \nduty; I didn't feel that evening that I had done anything necessarily \nout of the ordinary.\n  Indeed, John McCain's father upgraded my award from a Navy Cross to a \nMedal of Honor. Otherwise, this event might not be happening at all. \nThere are many men, Senator Inouye will tell you, who received nothing, \nwhose actions weren't seen or were seen by somebody who didn't like \nthem, or were seen by somebody who liked them but couldn't write very \nwell, or something else happened to their award along the way. So I am \naware that there are many people who have done heroic things that were \nnot so recognized.\n  As a consequence of being introduced all the time and being given \nmany opportunities to think what it means to be a hero--and I again \nappreciate very much all this recognition--my heroes are those who \nsustained an effort. In my case, it was the effort of a single night. \nWho knows; in the daytime, I may have performed differently. I may \nhave, under different circumstances, done things differently.\n  The heroes who are impressive to me are those who sustained the \nefforts, whose bravery, whose courage, is called upon every single day. \nI think of my mother; I think of my father. I think of millions of men \nand women who, as mothers and fathers, sustained the bravery and the \ncourage needed to be a good parent. I think of all those volunteers who \ncame out not just to my hospital--I watched Bob Dole on television in \n1988 in Russell, KS, break down at the start of his Presidential \ncampaign as he remembered what it was like to come home to Russell, KS, \nand be welcomed into the arms of people who took up a collection so he \ncould travel to see his father.\n\n  The heroes in my life are the people in Lincoln, NE, who welcomed me \nhome and who gave me far more than I thought I had a right to deserve. \nOne of the people in my life who has been very important--I have never \nmet him, but I read his work; indeed, he was killed shortly before I \nwent to Vietnam. Although he was a great opponent of the war, he came \nback in an airplane, along with other men who had been killed in that \nwar--is a man by the name of Thomas Merton. Merton wrote,\n\n       Human nature has a way of making very specious arguments to \n     suit its own cowardice and its lack of generosity.\n\n  I find myself falling victim to that understandable human part of \nmyself. I do sometimes exhibit cowardice. I do sometimes exhibit a lack \nof generosity. All of us, I suspect, have those moments.\n  It is the ever-present need to sustain the bravery to do the right \nthing that impresses me the most. Those whose brave acts are done, \nknowing there will be no recognition, knowing there will be no moment \nwhen they will be recognized and stand before their colleagues, \ntrembling and wondering what to say in response--it is those brave acts \nthat are done anonymously that are most important of all.\n  I have received a gift in many ways as a consequence not just of the \naward and considering what heroes are but also as a consequence of my \ninjury. I don't know if Senator Inouye feels the same way.\n  I remember a night almost 30 years ago to the day, in 1969, when a \nnurse came into my room very late at night. It was a difficult night \nfor me. And among other things, she said to me that I was lucky to be \nalive and that I would get through this, I would survive it, I would \nget through this valley of pain that I was in at the moment. Well, I \nremember not believing that. I believed that I was not necessarily \nlucky to be alive at all at that particular moment of my suffering.\n\n  Today I recognize that she was absolutely right, that I was lucky to \nexperience suffering and know that you do not have to feel pain for \npain to exist, that it is out there as I speak, as we hear these words. \nThat suffering is universal is a lesson I was given in 1969, and \nperhaps of all the lessons I was given, it was the most important of \nall.\n  I was also given a gift in discovering that the world is much bigger. \nIt is not just us white men from Lincoln, NE, who grew up in a middle \nclass home and had a great deal of abundance as a result of two rather \nextraordinary and loving people. It is a world composed of many colors, \nmany creeds. It is a world composed of over 6 billion people, not just \nthe 270 million who live in the United States of America.\n  I have been taught and had the chance to learn that you do not really \nheal until you have the willingness, courage and bravery to forgive \npeople who you believe have done you wrong. I would not be back in \npublic service, I do not think, were it not for Walter Capps, who \ninvited me to come to Santa Barbara to teach a class on Vietnam, where \nin studying the history of that war I was able to forgive a man I \nhated--Richard Nixon. I doubt that former President Nixon felt any \nrelief in that moment when I forgave him, understanding as I did then \nhow easy it is to make mistakes when you are given power. But I was the \none who was healed. I was the one who was liberated. I was the one who \nwas able then to live a different life as a consequence of my having \nthe courage in that moment to forgive.\n  I have discovered, through my own healing, that the most powerful \nthing that we can give, the most valuable thing we can give another \nhuman being costs us nothing. It is merely kindness. It is merely \nlaying a hand on someone and saying to them, as that nurse said to me, \nthat it will be all right; you are not alone here tonight; you are not \nalone with this suffering that you are feeling.\n  I also learned through service in the Senate. Oddly enough, at a time \nwhen people think that the only reason that we are given to vote a \ncertain way is because there are financial contributions hanging in the \nbalance, I have learned in this Senate that a nation can be heroic. I \ndiscovered on the Appropriations Committee, of all things, that that \nhospital in Philadelphia was not there by accident. It was there \nbecause a law passed this Congress--a law that was signed by Richard \nNixon--authorizing that hospital to be operated, authorizing those \nnurses, those doctors\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\nand all the rest of those wonderful people to be there to save my life. \nA law made that possible. I made no financial contributions in 1969. \nThere wasn't a politician in America who I liked. Yet, this great \nNation allowed its Congress to pass a law that gave me a chance to put \nmy life back together.\n  In 1990 and 1991, as a Senator, I went back to Southeast Asia, with \nthe Bush administration, trying to find a way to bring peace to \nCambodia. We succeeded in 1992. But in going back, especially to \nVietnam in 1991, and especially in the South, I discovered again \nsomething rather remarkable about the people of this great country--\nthat though I still believed the war was a tragic mistake and that we \nmade lots of errors along the way, the people of South Vietnam \nrepeatedly said to me, ``We know you came here to fight and put your \nlife on the line for strangers, and that you were willing to die for us \nwill not be forgotten.''\n  I sat, along with my colleagues, and listened to Kim Dae-jung of \nSouth Korea say the very same thing in even more personal ways. Our \nNation can be heroic by recognizing that we might write laws that give \nall of us a chance at the American dream, and by recognizing that as a \ngreat nation there will come a time when we must risk it all, not for \nthe freedom of people that we know but for the freedom of strangers.\n  I did, as John Kerry said earlier, come back to the United States of \nAmerica an angry and bitter person. I did not have my patriotism \nintact. I had gone to the war patriotic because it was a duty, and I \nstand here today before you honored by your words, moved by your \nsentiment, and to tell you that I love the United States of America \nbecause it not only has given me more than I have given it, but time \nand time again it has stood for the right thing, not just at home but \nabroad.\n  I appreciate just the chance to be able to come to this floor and \noffer my views on what our laws ought to be. I appreciate very much \nmore than I can say to all of you--Senator Edwards, Senator Daschle, \nSenator Hagel, and the others who have spoken--your sentiment, your \nwords and, most of all, your friendship.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the courage and bravery and love of \ncountry that my friend, Bob Kerrey, demonstrated 30 years ago in \nVietnam is obviously still alive. For that, I salute you, sir. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join in this tribute to \nour friend and colleague, Senator Bob Kerrey.\n  The Nation's highest award for bravery in combat is the Congressional \nMedal of Honor. Since its creation in 1861, 3,400 Medals of Honor have \nbeen awarded to America's bravest Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, \nand Coast Guardsmen for heroic action in battles from the Civil War to \nSomalia. Our colleague Bob Kerrey is one of these brave American \nheroes.\n  Senator Kerrey was awarded the Medal of Honor for risking his life \nabove and beyond the call of duty during the Vietnam War. The \nleadership and courage demonstrated by this young, 25-year-old SEAL \nteam leader during intense and ferocious combat are nothing short of \nextraordinary. These events occurred thirty years ago this month, but \nthe same courage and leadership can be seen everyday in his work in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  I welcome the opportunity to commend Senator Bob Kerrey on this \nauspicious anniversary, and I commend him as well for his outstanding \nservice to the Senate and to the people of Nebraska and the nation. \nHe's a hero for our time and for all times, and I'm proud to serve with \nhim in the Senate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor and \nto thank a true American hero. A man who risked his life to defend this \nnation and continues to serve this nation. I am proud to say that J. \nRobert Kerrey is a friend and colleague.\n  Mr. President, thirty years ago this Sunday, on March 14, 1969, Bob \nKerrey led a team of Navy SEALs onto an island in the Bay of Nha Trang. \nIn the course of battle, an enemy grenade exploded at his feet. He \nwound up losing his right leg below the knee, but Bob directed fire \ninto the enemy camp, resulting in its capture. His extraordinary valor \ncost him part of his leg, but it earned him the respect of every \nAmerican.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Daschle, Edwards, and \nHagel on this resolution honoring the only Medal of Honor winner in the \ncurrent Congress. The Medal of Honor is the highest military award for \nvalor that can be conferred on a member of the American armed forces. \nIt is awarded to a soldier, sailor, airman, or marine who ``. . . in \naction involving actual conflict with the enemy, distinguish[es] \nhimself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his \nlife, above and beyond the call of duty.''\n  It is that spirit we honor today, which has time and again moved \nordinary Americans to rise to every threat to our nation and stand \nagainst great odds. It is the spirit that sustained the Revolution at \nValley Forge, that carried the day at Gettysburg and Belleau Wood, and \nthat made the difference at the Battle of the Bulge and Iwo Jima. This \nis the spirit that crashed ashore at Inchon, sustained our resolve at \nKhe Sanh and swept through the deserts along the Persian Gulf.\n  And Bob Kerrey has showed courage in public life. Whether it's Social \nSecurity, Medicare, the budget or protection of the First Amendment, \nBob Kerrey is not afraid to take the unpopular position. Above all, I \nadmire his willingness to act and speak according to his conscience.\n  Bob Kerrey has earned our utmost gratitude and our lasting \nadmiration.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to see the time the \nSenate is taking this morning to pay tribute to Senator Bob Kerrey, and \nto recognize his contribution during our war in Vietnam, and the \nrecognition that he received as a Medal of Honor winner as a result of \nhis sacrifice and his heroic actions during that conflict. I am \ncertainly not, in any way, sad that we didn't spend the time that we \nhad earlier set aside for the Missile Defense Act. I am very glad the \nSenate acted as it did to make this very important statement about his \nservice and his contribution during that period in our country's \nhistory. He has certainly earned the respect not only of the Senate for \nhis service but of the American people as well. I am glad to join with \nthose who pay tribute to him this morning.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am honored today to join my colleagues in \nsaluting one of our own, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, for the \ncourage and heroism that he displayed as a U.S. Navy SEAL 30 years ago, \nand for the courage and determination that he continues to inspire \ntoday.\n  The United States Senate is no stranger to heroes. Through the \ncenturies, this Chamber has embraced the souls of some of the greatest \nheroes of our nation. It still does. We are privileged to work among \nheroes every day, individuals like Bob Kerrey, Strom Thurmond, Danny \nInouye, John McCain, and Max Cleland.\n  I hope we never take the courage of these individuals for granted, or \nlose sight of the great legacy of their predecessors. Certainly, among \nthe history of heroism in the Senate, Bob Kerrey's story is one of \ninspiration. Horribly injured by a grenade, he nevertheless carried on \nan attack against the Viet Cong and led his men to victory. His bravery \nwon for him the highest honor that the United States government can \nbestow upon an individual for valor: the Congressional Medal of Honor. \nBut his act of courage also took a great toll. It cost him his leg, \nchallenged his spirit, and threatened to taint his life with \nbitterness.\n  Bob Kerrey overcame those crises. He turned adversity to success. He \nrecovered from the grievous wounds to his body and soul. He became a \nsuccessful businessman, went on to become governor of the state of \nNebraska, and in 1988 was elected to the United States Senate.\n  As I said before, Mr. President, the United States Senate is no \nstranger to heroes. But the Congressional Medal of Honor is something \nspecial. Only six Senators in our history have been awarded that honor. \nAll of them, with the exception of Bob Kerrey, fought in the Civil War.\n  As I listen today to the account of Bob Kerrey's heroism, hear of the\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\nbravery that he displayed at the youthful age of 25, I am reminded of \nanother account of bravery, this one told by the poet William E. Henley \nwho, as a young man, lost his leg as a result of tuberculosis of the \nbone. He wrote these words from his hospital bed.\n\n     Out of the night that covers me,\n     Black as the Pit from pole to pole,\n     I thank whatever gods may be\n     For my unconquerable soul.\n\n     In the fell clutch of circumstance\n     I have not winced nor cried aloud.\n     Under the bludgeonings of chance\n     My head is bloody, but unbowed.\n\n     Beyond this place of wrath and tears\n     Looms but the Horror of the shade,\n     And yet the menace of the years\n     Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.\n\n     It matters not how strait the gate,\n     How charged with punishments the scroll,\n     I am the master of my fate:\n     I am the captain of my soul.\n\n  The year was 1875. The poem was ``Invictus.'' The words belong to \nWilliam Henley, but the spirit behind them belongs just as surely to \nSenator Bob Kerrey. I salute him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in honoring \nsomeone who has already done more to serve his country than most people \ncould accomplish in several lifetimes, Bob Kerrey.\n  Many of my colleagues today have described the circumstances thirty \nyears ago when a twenty-five year old Lieutenant Kerrey led an elite \nNavy Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) team to successfully apprehend a group of \nNorth Vietnamese soldiers. I stand in awe as they have recounted the \nway in which Lt. Kerrey continued to direct the team despite his \nserious injury. For his extraordinary valor, Lt. Kerrey was rightfully \nbestowed the nation's highest award for military service, the Medal of \nHonor in 1970, by President Richard Nixon.\n  These actions alone are worthy of reflection by this body thirty \nyears after the event. However, this was only one episode in a lifetime \nof extraordinary service to his country by Senator Bob Kerrey. Luckily \nfor our nation, he did not allow the unfortunate events of that day \nthirty years ago to stop him from reaching the lofty goals that he had \nalways set for himself. After a trying rehabilitation in Philadelphia, \nKerrey returned to Nebraska and began his life anew, becoming a \nsuccessful businessman and eventually winning a race for the state's \nGovernorship. In 1988, he won election to the Senate after mounting a \nspirited campaign.\n  During his time in the Senate, Bob Kerrey has continued to exhibit \nexemplary bravery and dedication. He has taken on some of the most \nimportant and difficult issues this body faces: Social Security reform, \nIRS reform and repeated farm crises. Senator Kerrey focused on the \nissue of Social Security early in his career, and his many efforts have \ngreatly enhanced the prospects for reform of this important and far \nreaching program. Senator Kerrey is a champion of American agriculture, \nworking tirelessly to support and protect family farmers facing \neconomic hardship. He has also dedicated himself to improving health \ncare services in the United States.\n  Mr. President, we honor Senator Bob Kerrey today because thirty years \nago he exhibited extraordinary heroism under the most difficult of \ncircumstances. Senator Kerrey's duty and sacrifice on that day and his \nimportant contributions since continue to earn him the respect of the \npeople of Nebraska and the United States. I am delighted to join my \nSenate colleagues in honoring Senator Bob Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, the resolution \nis agreed to and the preamble is agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 61) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows\n\n                               S. Res. 61\n\n       Whereas Honorable J. Robert ``Bob'' Kerrey has served the \n     United States with distinction and honor for all of his adult \n     life;\n       Whereas 30 years ago this past Sunday, on March 14, 1969, \n     Bob Kerrey lead a successful sea-air-land (SEAL) team mission \n     in Vietnam during which he was wounded;\n       Whereas he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions \n     and leadership during that mission;\n       Whereas according to his Medal of Honor citation, ``Lt. \n     (j.g.) Kerrey's courageous and inspiring leadership, valiant \n     fighting spirit, and tenacious devotion to duty in the face \n     of almost overwhelming opposition sustain and enhance the \n     finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service'';\n       Whereas during his 10 years of service in the United States \n     Senate, Bob Kerrey has demonstrated the same qualities of \n     leadership and spirit and has devoted his considerable \n     talents to working on social security, Internal Revenue \n     Service, and entitlement reform, improving health care \n     services, guiding the intelligence community and supporting \n     the agricultural community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate commends the \n     Honorable J. Robert Kerrey for the service that he rendered \n     to the United States, and expresses its appreciation and \n     respect for his commitment to and example of bipartisanship \n     and collegial interaction in the legislative process.\n       Sec. 2.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 257, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 257) to state the policy of the United States \n     regarding the deployment of a missile defense system capable \n     of defending the territory of the United States against \n     limited ballistic missile attack.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Cochran Amendment No. 69, to clarify that the deployment \n     funding is subject to the annual authorization and \n     appropriation process.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 69\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 1 hour of debate on the \npending Cochran amendment No. 69, to be divided equally between the \nchairman and ranking member, or their designees.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, yesterday, we began debate of the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999. We have reached a point where we \nwill soon be voting on an amendment that seeks to more clearly define \nthe context for this legislation and the purpose we see that it will \nserve. This legislation is a statement of a new policy for our \nGovernment with respect to the need to develop and deploy a national \nmissile defense system as soon as technology permits.\n  It is very clear from recent developments that we identified \nyesterday that we are confronted with a very real threat to our \nnational security interests from ballistic missile technology, the \nproliferation of this technology, and the capacity of other countries \nto use it to deliver weapons of mass destruction against the territory \nof the United States.\n  Americans today are completely vulnerable to a ballistic missile \nattack. We need to see that that is changed. We need to see that the \ntechnology that we have available to us is used to develop and deploy a \ndefense against ballistic missile attack to protect American security \ninterests and American citizens.\n  During the discussion yesterday, there was some suggestion that \nadministration officials and military officials in our country were \nopposed to this legislation. I must say that I heard some of these \nofficials testify at hearings, and I disagree with that conclusion. I \nthink there is ample evidence in the record of our Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee hearings, and in other statements that \nofficials have made, both civilian and military officials, to the media \nabout their views on this subject, that we can draw a completely \ndifferent conclusion from the conclusion that was expressed yesterday \nby some of those who participated in this debate.\n  Let me give you one example. The other day, on March 3, I was in a \nmeeting of our Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We were having a \nhearing reviewing the request for funds for the Department of Defense \nfor the next fiscal year. The Deputy Secretary of Defense, Dr. Hamre, \nwas a witness, and we started a discussion about whether or not the \nadministration interpreted this legislation that is pending now in the \nSenate to mean that the Department of Defense should disregard measures \nrelating to the operational effectiveness of developmental testing in \ndetermining whether the national missile defense system is \ntechnologically ready\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\nto provide an effective defense against limited ballistic missile \nattack.\n  I asked Dr. Hamre, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, what his \ninterpretation of that legislation was, and if he read the language in \na way that suggested we would be deploying an operationally ineffective \nsystem or would require the administration to do so. Here is what the \nDeputy Secretary of Defense said. I am quoting.\n\n       No, sir . . . I read the language that it says that you \n     would still expect us to be good program managers. You would \n     still expect us to do testing, disciplined rigorous testing. \n     Not slowing things up just to test for test's sake but to do \n     disciplined testing and know that it really would be \n     effective and that it really would work.\n\n  So it is clear from that response to my question that in the mind of \nthe Deputy Secretary of Defense this bill does not require deployment \nof a missile defense system that is operationally ineffective. On the \ncontrary, he understands clearly, as do the cosponsors of this \nlegislation, that we would put in place a policy and a practice that is \ncommon and ordinary in the acquisition process in our Department of \nDefense.\n  Finally, to those who suggest that a deployment decision should wait \nyet another evaluation of the threat, which was one of the four \nadditional criteria outlined yesterday by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan, I think a quote attributed to General Lyles, who is the \nDirector of the Ballistic Missile Organization, might be helpful. He \nwas asked again at a January press conference whether another \nevaluation of the threat would be necessary when the administration \ngave the go-ahead for production of the national missile defense \nsystem. This is what he said. I quote:\n       The key decision will be on the technological readiness. My \n     statement about looking at the threat, that's something we do \n     for all programs all the time. So yes, we will again look at \n     the threat. But as the Secretary stated, we are affirming \n     today that the threat is real and growing, so that's not an \n     issue. But we will always look at the threat to see has it \n     changed, is it coming from a different source, etc.? That's \n     part of anything we do for any program.\n\n  So there is really no question in the minds of the military managers \nand the civilian leadership at the Department of Defense about the \nthreat. In General Lyles' view, or in the view of Dr. Hamre, and as \nstated, as Senators know, by the Secretary of Defense, our former \ncolleague, former Senator Cohen, it is routine and a matter of course \nthat there will be a continued evaluation and a monitoring of the \nthreat. But the question as to whether the threat of ballistic missile \nattack exists now against the United States has been more clearly \ndemonstrated by the actions of North Korea than any other thing anybody \ncan say. The evidence is hard and clear and obvious. There is a \ncapability now in North Korea to launch a missile--multiple stage--with \na solid fuel, third stage, with a capacity to reach the territory of \nthe United States.\n  As Secretary Cohen said when he came to talk to Senators not too long \nago, ``We have checked the threat box.'' ``We have checked the threat \nbox.'' The threat is clear. It is present. The threat exists.\n  That is why the administration's policy of waiting to see whether a \nthreat develops to then decide whether we deploy a system that we have \ndeveloped is an outdated policy and needs to be replaced with a current \npolicy that matches the facts and the realities of our situation.\n  That is why this legislation is needed, and that is why this \namendment is important, because it restates that the policy will be \nsubject to the annual review of the authorization committees, of the \nappropriations committees, as every defense acquisition system is under \ncurrent practices. That is what this pending amendment suggests--that \nwe will see the jurisdictional responsibilities for authorizing a \ndeployment, and funding the deployment will be constrained by budget \nconsiderations, by the realities of the threat as it then exists on the \nregular annual processes that this Congress follows each year.\n  The administration will have an opportunity to sign those bills, or \nveto them. So we are not changing the policies, or practices, or rules, \nor the laws that govern the appropriations and the authorization \nprocesses of Congress. That is what this amendment clearly suggests.\n  I am hopeful that with this further information that is available to \nthe Senate as we proceed to wind up debate on this amendment Senators \nwill ask whatever questions they have, and we will be glad to try to \nrespond to them.\n  We appreciate having the cosponsorship for this amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, who is the senior \nmember of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Warner, who \nis the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Senator Lieberman, \nwho is also active in the review and assistance on this issue.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I commend and congratulate my colleague \nfrom Mississippi for his leadership in this area.\n  Most respectfully and candidly, I must say that I have been a bit \nsurprised and saddened by the attacks made upon this measure. This \nbill, in my mind, is a wake-up call. It is telling all of us that there \nis a threat. Anyone who studies North Korea, anyone who looks at the \nSoviet Union, anyone who has taken time to study the situation in Iraq \nand Iran, would have to conclude that there is a threat. This measure \ndoes not deploy any ballistic missile defense system. It just tells us \nit is about time we begin looking to the possibility of deploying a \nsystem.\n  As the author of this measure has pointed out very clearly, we would \nhave to go through the regular process of authorization. This Senate \nand this Congress will have an opportunity to have a full-scale debate, \nto debate whether we have the funds, whether the threat is real, \nwhether there is a necessity for this system. Then it will have to go \nthrough the appropriations process. At each level, the President of the \nUnited States will have an opportunity of either concurring or vetoing \nour efforts. We are not in any way short-circuiting the process that \nhas been laid down by our Founding Fathers. We are following the \nprocess. But we are, in essence, telling our Nation: Wake up. There is \na threat, and it is about time we look at it seriously.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor, not only of the amendment but of the \nbill itself. It is about time somebody took the leadership to do what \nSenator Cochran has been doing. So I hope my colleagues will reconsider \ntheir opposition, look at it very objectively, and I am certain they \nwill concur with us.\n  For those who have been criticizing that this is going to be a very \nexpensive bill, there is not a single dollar in this measure--not a \nsingle dollar. That will have to be determined at a later time if the \nCongress so decides.\n  I hope my colleagues on my side will join us when the final vote is \ntaken to support this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know that under the order we are going \nto recess at 12:30, and then the order provides for 1 hour of debate on \nthis amendment and then a vote at 2:15.\n  I am going to recommend--I do not know what the pleasure of the \nleadership will be--that we go ahead and have that vote and yield back \nthe time on the amendment. That is going to be my recommendation to our \nleader on this side of the aisle. I don't know that we left anything \nout in our debate yesterday. We had time from 3 o'clock until 6:30 \nyesterday evening when we debated this issue and all of the issues that \nwere involved. But I am happy to abide by whatever decision the \nleadership makes on that. I am just suggesting, for my part I will be \nhappy to yield back our time on the amendment so we can vote at 2:15 \nwhen we resume our session after lunch.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time for this \nintroduction be allocated against the time on this amendment but appear \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to add my support to S. 257, The \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999.\n  Any questions on whether or not the United States faces a missile \nthreat were answered by the Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, George Tenet, and the Director of the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, General Hughes, in testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee. In his opening statement Director Tenet described the threat \nof a new North Korean missile in the following terms:\n\n       With a third stage like the one demonstrated last August on \n     the Taepo Dong-1, this missile would be able to deliver large \n     payloads to the rest of the U.S.\n\n  General Hughes stated:\n\n       The number of Chinese strategic missiles capable of hitting \n     the United States will increase significantly during the next \n     two decades.\n\n  This testimony coupled with the findings of the Rumsfeld Commission \nmake an overwhelming case for a National Missile Defense System. We \nmust not be dissuaded by the impact of the National Missile Defense \nSystem on the ABM Treaty. The evidence of the missile threat to the \nUnited States is too overwhelming.\n  The bill before us is only a first step toward the deployment of a \nNational Missile Defense System. It provides deployment flexibility to \nthe Department of Defense. It states that it is the policy of the \nUnited States to deploy as soon as technologically possible an \neffective National Missile Defense system. It does not mandate a \nspecific time nor a specific type of a system.\n  Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to Senator Cochran \nfor introducing this legislation and for his passionate and articulate \nexpression of support for a National Missile Defense System. Our \ncitizens owe him a debt of gratitude for his persistence in pursuit of \na missile defense program to protect them and the Nation.\n  Mr. President, there has been enough discussion on this issue, it is \ntime for the Nation and this Congress to act. I urge the Senate to \nexpress its support for the security of our Nation by overwhelmingly \napproving S. 257, The National Missile Defense Act of 1999.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support, \nalong with the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, for the \nNational Missile Defense Act. It is, in my opinion, long overdue and \nwill correct a serious deficiency in our defense policy, one that \nleaves us utterly defenseless against a threat that is real today and \npromises to get worse tomorrow.\n  Last week, Thursday, in the Wall Street Journal, this headline \ngreeted us:\n\n       China Buys . . .\n       Stolen information about the U.S.'s most advanced miniature \n     W-88 nuclear warhead from Los Alamos helped the Chinese close \n     a generation gap in the development of its nuclear force.\n\n  This, of course, is a very abbreviated account of what the New York \nTimes expanded on in great detail and great length. I think it \ndescribes for us not only a serious breach in our national security but \na quantum leap in the ability of the Chinese Government to not only \nthreaten the security of their neighbors in Asia but ultimately and \neventually to threaten the security of American cities; thus, the \nimportance of a National Missile Defense Act.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton administration is in its sunset, but the \neffects of its failed, flawed China policy are clearly on the horizon. \nWe are faced today with a very disturbing situation. At the same time \nthat the administration is fostering what it calls ``constructive \nengagement'' with the People's Republic of China, the Government of \nChina is increasingly posing a threat to the United States and its \ninterests. This policy is nothing if not contradictory and \ninconsistent. It is no less than a threat to American security.\n  China has made significant advances in its nuclear weapons program in \nrecent years. By achieving the miniaturization of its bombs, the \nChinese military can now attach multiple nuclear warheads to a single \nmissile and hit several targets. China's technical advance means it can \nnow deploy a modern nuclear force and pose an even greater threat to \nTaiwan, Japan and South Korea, not to mention the United States. The \nsad fact is that this technical advance was made possible by sensitive \nW-88 design information stolen from Los Alamos National Laboratory, a \nfacility that we have discovered has very lax security.\n  The details that I am going to recount in the next few minutes are \nthose that have all been published and have been available to the \npublic in news accounts in recent days.\n  The W-88 is the smallest and most advanced warhead of the U.S. \narsenal. It is typically attached to the Trident II submarine-launched \nballistic missile. With smaller warheads, the Chinese military will be \nable to deploy intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple \nwarheads.\n  In the last 2 days, I have attended two briefings with the Secretary \nof Energy. To me, the accounts that we heard were chilling and \nalarming. The secret information on the W-88 was\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\nprobably stolen in the mid-1980s. This active espionage went undetected \nuntil April of 1995, when nuclear weapons experts at Los Alamos \nstudying Chinese underground tests detected similarities to the W-88. \nThe CIA found corroborating information 2 months later. The FBI and the \nDepartment of Energy's intelligence group, under Notra Trulock, \ninvestigated the matter and were able to narrow its list of suspects to \nfive, including Wen Ho Lee, an employee of the Los Alamos National \nLaboratory with access to sensitive and classified information. Lee has \nsince been dismissed but not arrested. The other four suspects remain \nemployed.\n\n  DOE briefed CIA officials and then Deputy National Security Adviser \nSandy Berger on the espionage in early 1996. The FBI subsequently \nopened a limited investigation in mid-1996 and recommended improved \nsecurity at DOE labs in April of 1997. But DOE, under Federico Pena, \nshelved Trulock's counterintelligence program and ignored FBI \nrecommendations, and although some of these accounts in the press have \nbeen contested and all of the facts are not yet out, according to press \naccounts, they ignored FBI recommendations to reinstate background \nchecks. Instead, Chinese officials continued to visit DOE facilities \nwithout proper clearances. Meanwhile, Trulock, aware of other possible \nspy operations at DOE facilities, sought to inform Secretary Pena. It \nwas 4 months before he could get an appointment.\n  Finally, in July of 1997, DOE briefed National Security Adviser Sandy \nBerger on the situation and the possibility of current espionage \nefforts, and Berger kept President Clinton informed.\n  What was the administration's response? It was back in the 1980s when \nwe believe most of the theft on the W-88 took place. When it became \nevident in the mid-1990s, what was the administration's response? \nUnfortunately, the administration swept the matter under the red carpet \nthey were preparing to roll out for President Jiang Zemin of China.\n  The National Counterintelligence Policy Board made recommendations \nfor strengthening lab security in September of 1997. It was 5 months \nbefore President Clinton signed a Presidential decision directive in \nFebruary 1998. The recommendations occurred in September as to the \nchanges that should be made as to the strengthening of security \nrequirements at our Laboratories. It was 5 months later when President \nClinton finally signed a PDD February of 1998 mandating a more vigorous \ncounterintelligence effort at DOE. It took 9 more months to implement \nthose changes that were first recommended back in September of 1997, \nPDD in February of 1998, and then 9 more months before implementation \noccurs.\n  In addition, it is alleged that Acting Energy Secretary Elizabeth \nMoler ordered Trulock to withhold information from Congress.\n  That is an allegation, and it is an allegation that is a serious \nallegation. And it is one that needs to be investigated by this \nCongress.\n  She reportedly ordered him not to brief the House Intelligence \nCommittee on the espionage matter, and not to deliver written testimony \nto the House National Security Committee. It was only when Trulock \ntestified before Congressman Cox' committee investigating this whole \nmatter that Trulock was then able to fully inform Congress. If what \nTrulock claims is true--that he was hindered, that obstacles were \nplaced before him and he was ordered not to testify, not to provide \nthat vital information to Congress--then I think we have not just a \nsecurity breach that resulted in stolen secrets, but it involves, in \neffect, a refusal to give vital information to Congress so that the \nadministration's China policy could move forward without criticism--\nsignificant criticism--from Congress.\n\n  Only in the last several weeks was a lie detector test administered \nto Wen Ho Lee, the main suspect in this espionage. He has now been \ndismissed. Only now will periodic polygraph examinations be required of \ncertain employees.\n  The administration's response to this situation seems puzzling at \nbest. But then--if you put it in context of what is going on with our \nrelations with China--it at least raises troubling questions. The \nadministration was fostering its policy of constructive engagement, \nengaging China by in part selling nuclear technology, supercomputers, \nand satellites to China.\n  To bring up this vital issue of national security spying, espionage \nstealing of secrets--to have brought that up would have disturbed the \nflow of high-tech trade to China. And so it simply never was brought \nup.\n  At the same time that the Clinton administration knew about Chinese \nefforts to steal nuclear weapons technology, it certified that China \nwas no longer assisting other countries in their nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  It is amazing that when the administration knew that espionage was \noccurring at our Laboratories, that secrets were being stolen, it went \nahead and certified that China was no longer assisting other countries \nin their nuclear weapons program.\n  That certification lifted a 12-year ban on the sale of American \nnuclear technology to China.\n  Why would we want to assist China in nuclear technology at the very \ntime we are discovering their intensive efforts to infiltrate our \nLaboratories?\n  At the same time that the Clinton administration knew about Chinese \nefforts to steal militarily sensitive technology, it loosened export \ncontrol laws on supercomputers and satellites.\n  Once again, it becomes not just a spy case. It becomes a situation in \nwhich the administration was pursuing a policy that to have disclosed \nwhat was happening in the security realm would have interfered with the \npursuit of that policy goal by the administration. So it loosened \nexport control laws on supercomputers and satellites at the very time \nthe investigation was going on at Los Alamos.\n  At the same time that the Clinton administration knew about Chinese \nefforts to steal nuclear weapons technology, President Clinton was \nseeking reelection, receiving donations from Chinese sources, and \nallowing White House access to military intelligence officials.\n  At the same time that the Clinton administration knew about Chinese \nefforts to steal nuclear weapons technology, administration officials \nwere preparing for a visit by President Jiang Zemin.\n  At the same time that Congress was investigating illegal campaign \ncontributions with Chinese sources, the Clinton administration withheld \nvital information regarding security breaches at our National \nLaboratories from Congress and the American people.\n  How many briefs there were is yet in dispute. Who was providing the \ninformation and who was not, if anyone, is yet in dispute.\n  But it is troubling that there is evidence of an effort on the part \nof administration officials to preclude those who should have known, \nthose who had oversight responsibilities, those who had appropriations \nresponsibilities, from knowing the full extent of the security breaches \nat our National Laboratories.\n\n  President Clinton's China policy, I believe, has been a failure. And \nI believe that these most recent revelations fit into the broader \ncontext of the failure of this administration's policy toward the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n  ``Constructive engagement'' has proven constructive, but it has been \nconstructive only for the Chinese military.\n  The implications of this policy extend beyond the United States. In \nEast Asia, our allies, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan will \nface a new and greater threat because of China's nuclear capabilities. \nIt is ironic that the Chinese Government warns us not to develop a \ntheater missile defense system while it aims more missiles at Taiwan \nand develops multiple nuclear warheads. The Chinese nuclear \nadvancements will certainly inflame anxieties in India, which may lead \nto further proliferation in both India and Pakistan.\n  So President Clinton has left us with a ``strategic partner,'' as he \nterms it, pointing 13 of its 19 long-range missiles at us--a strategic \npartner building new long-range missiles, the DF-31 and DF-41; a \nstrategic partner well on its way to developing multiple warhead \nmissiles. These are the bitter fruits of a policy borne out of warped \nmotives.\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\n  There were some in the administration who would like to dismiss this \nespionage case as a failure of the Reagan administration. I agree. \nThere should have been greater security measures taken at that time. \nBut this administration cannot blame its failure to uphold American \nsecurity interests on past administrations. National security is a \nbipartisan issue. But it cannot blame its failure to adequately notify \nCongress on past administrations. This administration is responsible \nfor a comprehensive policy failure in regard to China. The American \npeople will be suffering the consequences long after the President has \nleft office.\n  Mr. President, it is a fact that, while there are many facts yet in \ndispute, and while there are many questions that have gone unanswered, \nand it is my sincere desire that the appropriate committees of the U.S. \nSenate will begin immediate hearings and fulfillment of oversight \nresponsibilities--while there are facts in dispute, and while there are \nquestions to be answered, there are some facts that are indisputable.\n  It is an indisputable fact that the Chinese Government stole nuclear \nsecrets allowing it to build smaller and more efficient warheads.\n  We can argue and we can debate as to whether it was a 2-year loss of \ntechnology or a decade, whether it was a generation, or whether it was \nless than that, but it is not disputable that China stole nuclear \nsecrets allowing it to build a smaller and more efficient nuclear \ncapability.\n  It is indisputable that the Chinese Government continues to \naggressively seek to obtain technology from U.S. companies allowing it \nto better target their ICBMs. That is indisputable. Whether legitimate \nmeans, whether legal means, or whether serreptitious means, it is \nindisputable that China today continues on an aggressive pattern of \nseeking to obtain technology from the U.S. companies.\n  It is an indisputable fact that the Chinese Government is engaging in \nan expensive modernization of their weapons system.\n  While there may be much debate, that is a fact. That is beyond \ndispute. China today is expending vast amounts of its budget in order \nto modernize their weapons systems.\n  Mr. President, while there is much in dispute, it is a fact beyond \ndispute that the Chinese Government continues to be a major nuclear \nproliferator in the world, giving North Korea the missile capability \neven to hit American cities.\n  It is a fact beyond dispute that the Chinese Government continues to \nmenace our allies in Asia with military threats. And it is a fact that \nthe Chinese Government has again brutally clamped down on democracy \nadvocates within China and seeks to extinguish free expression, whether \nreligious or political.\n  In the face of all these facts, the administration is still \ndetermined to give an irresponsible actor in the world arena a major \nrole by offering to China World Trade Organization accession. It is my \nsincere desire, it is my sincere hope, that the administration will not \nseek to bring China into the WTO, will not bend the rules, will not \nallow China to enter as a developing nation as they desire, and that we \nwill, in dealing with the largest, most populous nation on the globe, \ntake our rightful place and we will regain our voice where, when it \ncomes to the World Trade Organization, we will require that Congress \napprove China's membership in the WTO before they are allowed to enter.\n  These facts, all incontrovertible and indisputable, reveal what I \nthink is already obvious. The administration must reexamine its China \npolicy and restore American security as its main priority. It must take \nresponsibility for defending the American people, and it must commit to \na national missile defense system. I applaud the efforts of the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, for his leadership \nand his perseverance and his determination to bring this bill forward \nand to ensure its enactment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas. I think there are far more questions than answers on the \nissues he raised. I think the issues of national security dealing with \nChina are serious. The alleged spying, as I understand it, occurred in \nthe mid-1980s; the transfer of missile technology and agreements for \nthat transfer occurred at the beginning of the 1980s. The Senator \nraises very important security questions and we need answers to those \nquestions. I am sure in the coming days we will learn more about many \nof these issues as we discuss them with the appropriate people who have \nbeen a part of this matter for, now, a decade or a decade and a half.\n  But I came to the floor and have waited here to speak about the \nnational missile defense proposal. That is what is on the floor at the \nmoment, national missile defense. Mr. President, 24 years ago our \ncountry built an antiballistic missile system in my home State. It is \nthe only ABM, or antiballistic missile, system anywhere in the free \nworld. That ABM--or what we would now call national missile defense--\nsystem, that ABM program, cost over $20 billion in today's dollars.\n  On October 1, 1975, the antiballistic missile system was declared \noperational. On October 2, 1 day later, Congress voted to mothball it. \nWe spent a great deal of money. I encourage those who are interested in \nseeing what that money purchased to get on an airplane and fly over \nthat sparsely populated northeastern portion of North Dakota. You will \nsee a concrete monument to the ABM system. It was abandoned a day after \nit was declared operational.\n  Did that system make us safer? Did taking the taxpayers' dollars and \nbuilding that ABM system improve national security in this country? The \njudgment was it was not worth the money after all. Yet here we are, \nnearly a quarter of a century later, debating a bill that would require \nthe deployment of a national missile defense system, another ballistic \nmissile defense system, as soon as technologically feasible.\n  It was technologically feasible 24 years ago. It was a different \ntechnology. The technology then was, if you see a Russian missile--or a \nSoviet missile then--coming in to attack this country, you send up some \nantiballistic missile defenses, and they have nuclear warheads, and you \nblow off a nuclear warhead somewhere up there in the heavens and it \nobliterates the incoming missiles. That was the technology then. It was \ntechnologically possible then.\n  Now the new technology is, we are not going to send a nuclear missile \nup to wipe out some incoming nuclear missile--or a missile with a \nnuclear warhead, I should say. What we will do is, we will hit a \nspeeding bullet with another speeding bullet. If someone puts a missile \nup with a nuclear warhead, we send a missile up with our charge and we \nhit it--a bullet hitting a bullet. Of course, all the tests now \ndemonstrate that is very hard to do. There have been far more test \nfailures than successes in this technology. But here we are saying, let \nus deploy a National Missile Defense System as soon as technologically \nfeasible.\n  It is technologically feasible for my 11-year-old son to drive my \ncar. I wouldn't suggest that someone who meets him on the road would \nconsider it very safe or appropriate for Brendon to be driving my \nautomobile, but it is technologically feasible.\n  So what does that mean, technologically feasible? What does it mean \nwith respect to missile defense? Will it make us safer? Here is what we \ndo know. A national missile defense system cannot protect us from a \nlow-flying cruise missile launched by a Third World despot who can much \nmore easily access a cruise missile than an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile and put it on a barge somewhere off a coast and lob in a \nnuclear-tipped cruise missile. Will we, when we deploy this system, \ndefend against that? No, not at all. That is not what this system is \nfor. It is to defend against an ICBM. And not just any ICBM--not a \nRussian ICBM, for example, because any kind of robust launch of more \nthan a handful of missiles cannot be defended with this new technology, \nthe kind of technological catcher's mitt that we send up to catch an \nincoming missile.\n  It is only a missile from a rogue nation. If a rogue nation acquires \nan intercontinental ballistic missile--unlikely perhaps, but let's \nassume a rogue nation acquires an intercontinental ballistic missile \nand uses that\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\nwith a nuclear warhead attached to its top to threaten this country. \nWhat are the likely threats? Among the threats, the least likely would \nbe a rogue nation using an intercontinental ballistic missile. More \nlikely would be their access to a cruise missile, to purchase a cruise \nmissile someplace. Of course this system will not defend against that. \nMore likely than that is, perhaps, a rental truck filled with a nuclear \nexplosive or perhaps a suitcase nuclear bomb planted in the trunk of an \nold Yugo car parked at a New York dock--a far more likely threat by a \nrogue nation than access to an intercontinental ballistic missile. Will \nthis protect us against those threats? No.\n  National missile defense shields us against one threat only--the \naccidental launch of a ballistic missile from an existing nuclear power \nor the future possibility of an attack by a rogue nation. But it is not \njust any accidental launch. It would be an accidental launch of just \none or two or a few missiles, because any launch beyond that, of \ncourse, would be a launch that would prevail over a limited national \nmissile defense system.\n  If we deploy a national missile defense system before it is ready--\nnot just technologically possible, but tested and ready --then what are \nwe getting for our money? What does the taxpayer get for the \nrequirement to deploy a new weapons program, albeit defensive, before \nit is ready to be deployed? Detecting, tracking, discriminating, and \nhitting a trashcan-sized target traveling 20 times the speed of sound, \nlanding in 20 or 30 minutes anywhere in the world after it is \nlaunched--intercepting that with another bullet that we send up into \nthe skies? To put it mildly, that is problematic. Our efforts to date, \nunder highly controlled test environments, come nowhere close to \nmeeting the requirements a ballistic missile system would need to \nsatisfy and justify deployment.\n  If we deploy without regard to all of the other issues and all of the \nother considerations, all of the efforts we have made to reduce weapons \nof mass destruction that pose such a danger to the world, will we make \nthis a safer world? Or a world that is more dangerous? If we deploy \nthis system before we have renegotiated with Russia the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty, we are sure to jeopardize the enormous gains we have \nalready made in arms reduction efforts.\n  I would like to show a picture just for a moment. I also ask \nunanimous consent to show a piece of an airplane on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a piece of a backfire bomber. I \nsuppose that some years ago, you would have thought the only way a \nMember of the U.S. Senate could hold a piece of a Soviet bomber or a \nRussian bomber in his hands would be if it were shot down somewhere in \nhostile action.\n  This is a wing strut from a bomber that used to carry nuclear weapons \nthat threatened this country. This bomber, as you can see, no longer \nflies. This wing strut is a result of a cut from the wing of that \nbomber that rendered that bomber useless. How did that happen? How does \nit happen that we are able to cut the wings off Russian bombers, and we \nare able to destroy Russian missile silos?\n  Last year I held in my hand on the floor a metal flange from a \nmissile silo in the Ukraine that used to sit on the prairies there in \nthe Ukraine with a nuclear warhead aimed at the United States of \nAmerica, and that piece of metal now doesn't come from a missile silo. \nI held it in my hand. The missile silo is gone. The missile is gone. \nThe warhead is gone. Where a missile once sat aimed at the United \nStates, there now is planted a field of sunflowers, sunflowers rather \nthan missiles.\n  How did it happen that in the Ukraine an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile site was dug up, the missile gone, the warhead gone, and there \nare now sunflowers? How does it happen that a Soviet bomber has its \nwings sawed off? I tell you how it happens --Nunn-Lugar. Senators Dick \nLugar and Sam Nunn offered a program here in the U.S. Senate trailing \nthe arms control agreements we have had with the old Soviet Union and \nnow Russia. It says the United States will help pay for the destruction \nof your weapons.\n  Doesn't it make good sense for us to destroy Russian bombers, not \nwith our bullets but with saws? Doesn't it make good sense for us to \ndestroy Russian missiles in their silo through the use of American \ntaxpayer funds, not with people who have to go in the field and fight \nand risk their lives, but through a treaty of arms control in which we \nhelp pay the cost of the destruction of nuclear weapons and delivery \nsystems controlled by Russia and the old Soviet Union?\n  Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia, the Ukraine and \nothers have destroyed over 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles, \n400.\n  In the last several weeks, I saw a nuclear weapon. I was in a weapons \nstorage facility on a tour, and I won't describe it in great detail, \nprobably because I couldn't. A nuclear weapon is not very big. A \nnuclear bomb is not large at all. You can have a nuclear bomb dozens of \ntimes the power of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. It is no \nbigger than that desk.\n  The Soviet Union, Russia and the Ukraine, now named, have destroyed \nover 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles with MIRV warheads, over \n400 of them gone. Our arms control agreement has rendered them gone. \nThey are gone. We helped pay for it. We cut the wings off the planes. \nWe pulled the missiles out of the ground. We saw those missiles \ndestroyed. We have cut the wings off 37 Soviet bombers. Eighty \nsubmarine missile launch tubes are now gone; 95 nuclear warhead test \ntunnels are now sealed. That is major progress. If the Russians ratify \nSTART II, which I think they are likely to do, we will see further \ndramatic reductions in the number of bombers and missiles and warheads \non both sides.\n  That will happen not because we are fighting but because we are \ncooperating, not because there are tensions but because there is an \narms control regime we are following and because we are helping them \ndestroy their weapons at the same time we are reducing our weapons. We \nwant to deactivate over 5,000 warheads, destroy 200 missile silos, \n40,000 chemical weapons. Look at the success. Eliminate 500 metric tons \nof highly enriched uranium. Would we or should we do anything to \njeopardize this progress? What might jeopardize it?\n\n  We have a treaty with the Russians, and the treaty is an ABM Treaty. \nThe proposal by some is to say ignore the treaty; it doesn't matter. \nThese treaties are not very important. These treaties START I, START \nII, ABM, hopefully a START III, these treaties allow us to make this \nprogress and reduce the nuclear threat and reduce the threat of nuclear \nwar.\n  Thirty-two thousand nuclear weapons remain in the United States and \nRussian arsenals today. Some of those are theater weapons; thousands \nand thousands of nuclear weapons, of course. That is half the number of \na decade ago, but does that give us great confidence? No. We need to \nreduce them much, much further.\n  How can we do that? I know how we won't do that. All of that progress \nin the reduction of nuclear weapons could come to an abrupt halt if we \ndeploy a national missile defense system without any regard to the \nconcerns raised about whether this legislation would violate the ABM \nTreaty that we have made with the Russians in order to slow the nuclear \narms race. Instead of working cooperatively with other nuclear powers, \nif we act unilaterally we surely risk a return to a costly and \ndangerous arms race with Russia and China as well.\n  A former colleague, Dale Bumpers, said something interesting about \nthis. He said:\n\n       We can ignore Russia's concerns now, but in the years to \n     come, she will slowly recover and resume a great power role \n     in the world. By rash actions such as abrogation of the ABM \n     Treaty, we are far more likely to rekindle the cold war with \n     a hostile nation than to produce a constructive relationship \n     with a cooperative Russia.\n\n  Senator Bumpers, then, was wisely cautioning us that the calculations \nthat go into our strategic defense decisions today will have enormous \nconsequences and costly consequences for the world that we pass on to \nour children. Each day we move closer to eliminating the nuclear threat \nleft over from the cold war, thanks to arms reductions mandated in \nSTART I and START II and thanks to the Nunn-Lugar threat reduction that \nhas been so successful.\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\n  As I indicated, that investment has been a critically important \ninvestment in reducing the nuclear threat. I show my colleagues a chart \nthat talks about the imbalance between money that some propose we spend \non a national missile defense program versus money we spend on arms \nreduction. This chart shows what we are prepared to spend on a national \nmissile defense system, a limited one, one that won't protect us \nagainst much of the threat, but compare it even at that to what is \nplanned to be spent on arms reduction. I hope this is not a picture of \nour priorities. I wish it were reversed.\n  This legislation that we are considering says just do it, in the \npopular jargon of today. Deploy the system as soon as the military can \nget it up there. Cost doesn't matter. Arms control doesn't matter. \nNothing much matters. Deploy it as soon as is possible. We are nervous.\n  Mr. President, let me say that I support the strongest possible \ndefense against any threat to our country, but if you rationally think \nthrough the range of threats to our country, you must start with the \nunderstanding that the largest possible threat to our country comes \nfrom thousands of nuclear warheads that now exist, thousands of nuclear \nwarheads already in stockpiles with delivery vehicles, bombers and \nICBMs and others. We must continue the work of reducing them, and we \nhave done that very successfully. Anything we do here to jeopardize \nthat would be a profound mistake.\n  In addition to that, what are the other threats? A rogue nation \ngetting an ICBM? Yes, that is a small threat way over here on the edge. \nHow about a rogue nation getting a rental truck, as I said, with a \nnuclear device planted in the back somewhere? Probably more likely. Or \na deadly vile of the most deadly biological agent? More likely. A \nsuitcase nuclear bomb? More likely.\n  Should we worry about all of these? Should we prepare for all of \nthese? Of course. We would be foolhardy as a nation to underestimate \nthe threat of terrorism and underestimate the intentions of rogue \nnations. We would be fools to do that. But it would be shortsighted for \nus to decide, because we are concerned about all of that, we are \nwilling to push all of our chips to the middle of the table and say we \nwill risk the very substantial achievements we have made in arms \ncontrol reductions.\n  The elimination of Russian bombers by cutting off their wings, the \ndestruction of Russian missiles, the dismantling of Russian warheads, \nmaking Ukraine nuclear free--did anyone think they would hear that? We \nrisk all of that if we move in a manner in the Senate that says, ``You \ndon't matter; all that matters is our short-term nervousness about one \nsmall slice of one of the threats that exist.'' That is not a balanced \napproach.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by saying I think one of the more talented \nSenators in this country is the Senator from Mississippi, Senator \nCochran. I enjoy working with him. I think he is bright and productive, \nand he is one of the people that makes me proud to be a Senator. The \nsame is true of my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin. The fact is, \nthey have pretty big disagreements about some of these issues, but this \nis a very big issue.\n\n  This idea about how this country responds to nuclear threats and what \nkind of nuclear threat should persuade us to respond in certain ways \nwill have profound implications for all of us and for our children and \nour grandchildren.\n  I have a young son age 11 and a daughter age 9 who are in school \ntoday, at least I hope they are in school today. They are the most \nwonderful children any father would ever hope to have. I hope when my \nservice is done in the U.S. Senate, whatever I might contribute to \npublic policy, that they might say I helped in a way to reduce the \nnuclear threat, I helped in a significant way to have this world move \naway from the kind of nuclear threat that has existed now for many, \nmany decades.\n  It is hard for people to believe because it does not get much press \nand it is not very sexy, but every day we are spending American \ntaxpayer dollars to destroy missiles that used to be aimed at American \ncities. What a remarkable thing to have happen. What a remarkable \nsuccess.\n  I think it was Mark Twain who said once that bad news travels halfway \naround the world before good news gets its shoes on. That certainly has \nto be true with respect to this nuclear issue, the nuclear threat. How \nmuch attention does this get, the day-to-day success we have in \nreducing nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles? Let us not jeopardize \nthat. Let us move forward together in a thoughtful way, understanding, \nyes, we should prepare for some kind of missile defense. Let's do it \nthoughtfully, let's do it when it is technologically possible, but \nlet's make sure we do it when it is cost effective, technologically \npossible, will not interrupt and will not pose danger to our arms \ncontrol agreements. Let us condition it on all of those issues together \nand, as a country, then do the right thing.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, for allowing \nme to have some time in this debate. I hope in the coming hours we will \nbe able to address this just a bit further.\n  Let me conclude--I know the Senator from Tennessee is waiting--let me \nconclude with one final statement. The majority leader said this \nmorning that we should be clear in our intentions toward the ABM \nTreaty. I do not know what that means. I encourage him to tell me what \nthat means. I agree with it, we should be clear, and I hope we are \nclear with respect to our intentions about the ABM Treaty to say that \ntreaty matters, that treaty means something, and to the extent we seek \nchanges in that treaty, we will, with the Russians, negotiate those \nchanges, but we will not take an attitude that this treaty does not \nmatter to this country. Let us hope that is what the majority leader \nmeant when he said, let's be clear about our intentions toward the ABM \nTreaty. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the chair.\n  My friend from North Dakota points out that there are, indeed, other \nthreats to this Nation besides those that pose a threat that this bill \nis designed to prevent. There are, indeed, other threats. He points out \nthat our missile defense system may not stop all of the threats that \nare out there, and he, of course, is correct with regard to that, also.\n  I do not believe that is sufficient grounds for opposing a missile \ndefense system for this country. We have become aware, much more than \nwe would like, recently of the new threats, the new world that we live \nin, the new threats that are posed not only from old sources but from \nmany, many new sources, some of which we may not be fully aware of and \nwhat their capabilities might be, which apparently have missed the \nestimates of our own intelligence community, in many instances.\n\n  I agree with my friend concerning the Nunn-Lugar program. I have also \nvisited Russia and have seen that program in operation and the many \ngood things that it is doing and its related programs. We have a \nnuclear cities program over there where we are trying to turn some of \ntheir nuclear cities and help them turn their enterprises in other \ndirections.\n  We have assisted with regard to their scientists hopefully so that \nthey will not leave the country and go to places and spread technology \nin places that would be detrimental to us.\n  We have, indeed, destroyed some of the nuclear stockpile, but I think \nit is important to note that we are essentially still dipping in the \nocean as far as that is concerned. We are just getting started in that \nregard. They have many, many more tons of nuclear materials and many, \nmany missiles that we have not touched yet, even if we are aware of \ntheir existence.\n  We should not in any case believe that we have begun to seriously eat \ninto the Soviet Union's nuclear capabilities. We are trying to do that. \nThose programs must be maintained. It is going to take a period of time \nbefore we can make any progress in that regard.\n  We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in Russia in order to \nmaintain these programs. Our taxpayers have made a decision that it is \nworthwhile that we go over there and try to make friends with the \nRussians and try to help them make this transition. We have put our \ncash on the barrel head to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. \nThat money is sorely needed in Russia right now, and hopefully it will \nbe put to good use.\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\n  At the same time that we are doing this, our intelligence community \nand our Government still have serious concerns about proliferation \nactivities of the Russians. When you consider the threats around the \nworld and the so-called rogue nations and the outlaw nations and the \ndangers they present, oftentimes if you trace back to where they are \ngetting their capabilities, you will go back to Russia, you will go \nback to China. It is a serious, serious problem.\n  If what we are saying today is that if the United States protects \nitself with a missile defense program, not only is Russia going to \ncontinue to proliferate but it is going to refuse the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars that we propose to put in there, then so be it. I \nthink we still have to go forward in the best interests of our country.\n  Make no mistake; we do not want to abrogate understandings lightly. \nEveryone knows the circumstances have totally changed. Our deal with \nthe U.S.S.R. no longer exists. We have shown our friendship. The Soviet \nUnion for years and years said, ``We have to counter the United States \nof America, because they have all these hostile intentions and they \nhave these aggressive tendencies.''\n  We have shown that not to be the case. We have reached out a hand of \nfriendship, but we cannot, in turn, be threatened with closing us out, \nespecially when they are still too often spreading nuclear technology \nand capability and missile capability around the world at a time when \nwe are considering whether or not we want to have a missile defense \nsystem to protect ourselves against whomever might be hostile to us in \nthe future.\n  Clearly, that is not Russia today. But it is a dangerous world out \nthere in many, many more respects than when the old Soviet Union posed \nits threat.\n  Many of my colleagues have already recited the growing missile and \nweapons of mass destruction threats which America faces from many \nhostile and potentially hostile countries, and I will not take the time \nto recite them again. Most of these threats in fact were well known \nwhen we voted on missile defense last September. What is new since the \nlast time we debated missile defense is the news that China has \nobtained the design for our most modern nuclear weapon, the W-88 \nwarhead. This technology permits the development of massively \ndestructive nuclear warheads at a fraction of the size previously \npossible.\n  Acquiring this technology will allow the Chinese to fit multiple \nwarheads into a single missile for the first time and to deploy more \nnuclear weapons on submarines. Of course, this revelation must be \ncoupled with the knowledge that because of lax export controls, the \nChinese have also been able to obtain American technology to improve \nthe guidance of their missiles and to develop the capability to deliver \nmultiple warheads from one missile.\n  As we saw in the hearings of the Governmental Affairs Committee in \nour International Security Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Cochran, \nlast year, cooperation with American satellite manufacturers has \nactually helped Beijing learn how to build better missiles and deploy \nmultiple payloads from a single rocket. This enhances China's \ncapability to develop this latter technology for use on ballistic \nmissiles. As a result, they will be able to launch multiple warheads \nfrom a single missile, a capability called MIRV'ing.\n  So now the Chinese have more reliable missiles, each of which may \nsoon become capable of delivering multiple warheads with one shot. And \nnow they have stolen the final ingredient to make this work--our own \nmost sophisticated miniature warhead design.\n  But that is not all the U.S. technology they have. American \nsupercomputers may allow China to maintain the W-88 without nuclear \ntesting. The administration has loosened export restrictions on this \ntechnology. The Chinese are also reported to have stolen U.S. laser \ntechnology and, in conjunction with advanced computers, may have helped \nthem simulate nuclear explosions in the laboratory.\n  Now the United States has a huge program underway to develop the \nmeans to ensure the viability of its weapons without conducting test \nexplosions. Were the Chinese to develop similar capabilities, then they \ncould maintain this W-88 and other modern warheads without testing. \nThis would enable Beijing to conduct nuclear weapons work without \ntelltale underground explosions and help the Chinese missile force \nthreaten the United States for decades to come.\n  So what does this actually mean in terms of U.S. national security? \nUntil now, China's nuclear arsenal has been quite small, built around a \ncomparatively tiny force of land-based and mostly liquid-fueled \nintercontinental ballistic missiles. However, thanks to the \nacquisition, both legal and illegal, of new technologies, Beijing now \nstands on the verge of both a qualitative and a quantitative \nbreakthrough.\n  There are at least four new missile programs currently underway \ndesigned to provide the People's Liberation Army with dramatically \nimproved capabilities by the first years of the next century. Moreover, \nthe Chinese now have a class of submarine capable of launching \nballistic missiles. These developments are highly relevant to our \ndebates over U.S. missile defense.\n\n  Moreover, Mr. President, these developments threaten not only the \nUnited States but pose a more imminent threat to our allies in Asia. \nThey are at least as worried as we are about missile and weapons of \nmass destruction advances by China and North Korea. After all, \ncountries such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are much more likely \ntargets for these weapons than we are--at least for now.\n  If ongoing Chinese missile deployments and nuclear proliferation are \nnot addressed, and if we do not provide access to effective missile \ndefenses to U.S. allies in Asia, then such vulnerable countries may \nhave little choice but to try to develop their own means of nuclear \ndefense or deterrence. This would intensify rather than diminish the \nproliferation problem in Asia and is yet another reason it is \nimperative that we develop the interrelated technologies and control \nsystems for theater-level and national-level missile defenses.\n  We should not forget that China has a well established propensity to \nexport its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology. It has \nbeen reported in the press, for example, that China provided a fully \ntested nuclear weapons design and highly enriched uranium to Pakistan. \nChina has also provided ballistic missile technology to Pakistan and \nother countries. In 1988, China provided a turnkey medium-range missile \nsystem to Saudi Arabia. That is an entire weapons system ready to use \nright out of the box. China has also a record of providing nuclear, \nchemical, and biological missile technology to Iran.\n  Furthermore, the Rumsfeld Commission reported that a number of \ncountries hostile to the United States, including Iran, Libya, Iraq, \nand North Korea, are capable of manufacturing weapons of mass \ndestruction and ballistic missiles and that previous United States \nintelligence assessments had greatly underestimated the danger that \nsuch developments pose to the United States. Should China decide to \nexport the W-88 or a complete weapon to such nations, as has been done \nwith so many other dangerous technologies, the consequences for \nregional and global stability would be grave indeed.\n  All this, Mr. President, makes it more important than ever that the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999 be passed. Faced with new and \ngrowing nuclear and ballistic missile threats, in part through our own \ncarelessness, America needs the protection that such a missile defense \nsystem would offer. And Americans need the confidence of knowing that a \nsystem will be deployed rather than waiting on some future \nadministrative decision on whether to deploy.\n  It is time for Congress to act. The technology to develop and deliver \nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is widely available and \nis spreading rapidly. If we do not prepare today, when the day arrives \nthat America is paralyzed by our own vulnerability to ballistic missile \nattack or when an attack actually occurs, we will be reduced to telling \nthe American people and history merely that we had hoped this would not \nhappen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 257, the National Missile Defense \nAct of 1999. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, proponents of S. 257, the bill we are \ndebating now, suggest that this bill is vital to our country's defense. \nThe very distinguished Senator from Tennessee just got up and made his \ncase, and as an illustration he pointed to the technology that the \nChinese Government, apparently through espionage, has acquired.\n  I want to make it clear for the record, I am not confirming anything \nat this point. But assume that what was said is accurate--and I am not \ndisputing it either. One of the two things the Senator pointed out, as \nthings we should be worried about, is that they may have acquired the \ncapability of MIRVing missiles. For the public, that means they can put \nmore than one nuclear bomb on the nose of a missile, an \nintercontinental ballistic missile. And they may have gained the \ncapacity to independently target those warheads.\n  Put another way, we know what the Russians can do. The Russians have \nSS-18s and other intercontinental missiles, each with any of 3, 7, 10--\ndepending on the missile--nuclear bombs with a combined capacity that \nexceeds Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They could launch a missile, and within \n30 minutes they could have one of those warheads, one of those nuclear \nweapons, landing in Wilmington, DE, a small town, in relative terms, in \nmy State, taking out all of the Delaware Valley and its 10 million \npeople, and the same missile could send one warhead to Washington, DC, \none to Roanoke, VA, et cetera--all with one missile. That is a very, \nvery, very awesome capacity. We are worried that the Chinese may have \nacquired some of that technology.\n\n  It is also suggested that the Chinese may have acquired the capacity \nto target with more accuracy. An accurate missile can breach the \noverpressure limit of certain missile silos--the pounds per square inch \nthey could sustain from a blast and still be able to launch--so it \nbecame important during the time of the arms buildup between the Soviet \nUnion and the United States what the hard kill capacity was. That is, \ncould you fire a missile that would not only kill all the people in all \nthe Delaware Valley, but, assuming there were silos that had Minuteman \nrockets in those silos with nuclear weapons, could also knock out that \nmissile itself? That is what they called the hard kill. Accuracy became \na big deal because you could take out the other guy's missiles, and not \njust his cities.\n  We had the capacity to drop these missiles 12,000 or 13,000 miles \naway within 30 minutes on pinpointed areas the size of a soccer field \nin the Soviet Union then, in Russia now. We are worried the Chinese may \nhave acquired that capacity. I think my friend from Tennessee is \nabsolutely correct to be worried about that; so am I.\n  What are we doing here today? We are debating what I believe to be a \npolitical document, not a substantive piece of legislation that adds \nanything to the concept of what our strategic doctrine should be. We \nare saying that Taepo Dong missiles in the next 1 to 5 years--the \nKoreans may be able to get up to five of them--may be able to hit the \nUnited States, assuming the regime in North Korea lasts that long or \noutlives the research that would be required to get this done. We are \ntalking about building a thin nuclear defense system to counter that \nimmediate threat and future threats from Iran, Iraq, and other rogue \nstates, and we are talking about it in almost total disregard of what \nimpact it will have upon the ABM Treaty.\n  People say, ``What is the ABM Treaty?'' The ABM Treaty, as Senator \nDorgan discussed, is the basis upon which we have gone from somewhere \non the order of 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear warheads--and the capacity \nthat my friend from Tennessee is worried about the Chinese acquiring--\ndown to 12,000 total, roughly, or 13,000 maybe, roughly evenly divided \nbetween the United States and Russia.\n  Guess what? George Bush came along and said the single most \ndestabilizing thing of all--in what I call ``nuclear theology''--are \nthese ``MIRVed'' missiles, those missiles with up to 10 nuclear bombs \non their tip, able to be targeted independently, once they separate, \nable to go in ten different directions with significant accuracy.\n  Why are they destabilizing? They are destabilizing because of the \nnuclear scenarios about who strikes first and whether you can strike \nback. Anybody who faces an enemy that has this capacity has to target \nthose missiles, because they are the single most dangerous thing out \nthere. That means that in a crisis, if a missile were accidentally \nlaunched, or we thought one was launched, what we would have to do is \ngo and strike those missiles first.\n  What would the Russians now have to do? They would have to launch on \nwarning. Knowing that their MIRVed missiles were logical targets, they \nwould adopt the use-it-or-lose-it philosophy. It is the only rational \ndecision a nuclear planner could make.\n  So George Bush figured out these are incredibly destabilizing \nweapons. They are vulnerable to a first attack by sophisticated \nmissiles and they are awesome--awesome, as the kids say--in their \ndestructive capacity. So what do you do? As long as they are around, it \nmeans they must be on a hair trigger. No country who possesses them can \nwait for them to be struck before they fire them. Everybody can \nunderstand that. The gallery is nodding; they all get it. They figured \nit out. When it is explained in simple terms, everybody understands it. \nThat is called crisis instability.\n  What did we do? George Bush came along and said these are bad things \nto have hanging around, so we negotiated this treaty called the START \nII treaty where, in an incredible bit of negotiation on the part of the \nRepublican administration, they convinced the Russians they should do \naway with these MIRVed missiles--do away with them. That means we would \nachieve crisis stability; it adds up to stability.\n\n  What is left on both sides are single-warhead missiles that don't \nhave to be launched on warning, because they are less tempting targets \nin a first strike; therefore, you pull back from the hair trigger. So \nif, God forbid, there is a mistake, it doesn't mean Armageddon is \nguaranteed. That is a sound policy.\n  There is only one little trick. Russia has a quasidemocracy--my term, \n``quasi'' democracy. They have learned the perils and joys of living \nwith a parliament, a congress, a legislative body, called the Duma. The \nDuma has not ratified this agreement yet.\n  Why hasn't the Duma ratified the agreement? The Duma has not ratified \nthe agreement for a lot of reasons. Some Nationalists think it is a bad \nidea; some old apparatchik Communists think it is a terrible idea; some \nof the democrats there don't quite know what to do as the next step. \nHere is what happens: Unfortunately for the Russians, the bulk of their \nnuclear arsenal is in these MIRVed, silo-based weapons, these \nintercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads. The bulk of \nours are on submarines (which are less vulnerable to a first strike), \nin single-warhead missiles called Minuteman missiles, or on B-1 bombers \nand B-52 bombers.\n  The Russians, if they go forward with the deal to destroy their silo-\nbased MIRVed missiles, at the end of the day will have less destructive \ncapacity in their arsenal than we will. Now, they don't have to keep it \nas less, because they are allowed to build single-warhead missiles so \nwe would each end up with the same number of warheads. But guess what? \nThey are bankrupt. They don't have any money. They hardly have the \nmoney they need to destroy the missiles they have agreed to destroy. \nThat is why we have the Nunn-Lugar program, spending millions of \ndollars a year to send American technicians over to Russia to help \ndismantle, destroy, break up, and crush strategic weapons.\n  Think about that. If I had stood on the floor 20 years ago and said \nthat, my colleagues would have had a little white jacket ready for me. \nThey would have hauled me off to the nearest insane asylum, I having \nlost my credibility completely by suggesting that the Russians would \never let Americans come over and destroy their nuclear weapons.\n  The reason they made that agreement is that they realized it is in \ntheir long-term interests, and they had no money to do it. If they \ndon't have money to do that, they also don't have money to build these \nnew weapons that only have one bomb on the end. It costs a lot of money \nto do that. So if they can't do that and they keep the agreement called \nSTART II, they end up at the end of the day with fewer nuclear bombs \nthan we have--something we\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\nwould never do. We would never allow us not to have parity with the \nRussians.\n  That is their dilemma right now. That is why the administration is \narguing about a thing called START III. At Helsinki, President Clinton \nsaid not only should we do START II, we could jump and do START III and \ntake the total number of nuclear warheads each of us has to between \n2,000 and 2,500, from 6,000 to 6,500 which is in the first stage of the \nreduction.\n  Obviously, the Russians are very interested in being able to go right \nto START III. They don't want to spend a whole lot of time where we \nhave more bombs than they have, and they don't have the money to build \nmany new missiles. Although they are allowed to build more missiles, \nthey don't have the money to do it.\n  What are we debating? We are here debating as if it were a serious \npart of our nuclear strategy whether or not we will deploy some time in \nthe future a system that has not yet been developed, that if it is \ndeveloped may be able to take out what might end up being up to five \nweapons that might be able to get to the continental United States, \nfrom a government that might be in place 5 years from now.\n  So, what to worry about, right? No problem, it is not going to stop \nthe Russian missiles, so they are not going to get worried about this. \nLet's put this in reverse. Let's assume we were about to ratify a START \nII that was going to put us at having fewer nuclear bombs than the \nRussians, and we heard that the Russian Government was about to erect a \nnuclear shield--they called it a ``thin'' shield--to intercept missiles \nthat were going to come from Iran. Now, I am sure not a single Member \non this floor would say the following:\n\n       You know, what those Russians are really doing is erecting \n     something that is going to stop our missiles from being able \n     to strike. What have they done to us? They have convinced our \n     administration to destroy missiles that we have that can \n     penetrate their territory now; they convinced them to do \n     that. We are going to end up with fewer missiles than them, \n     and they are going ahead at the same time and building this \n     nuclear shield. And you actually have some people in the Duma \n     saying, ``The ABM Treaty doesn't mean anything to me.''\n\n  What do you think would happen with my right-wing friends, my left-\nwing friends, my middle friends, all my friends? There would be a mild \nfrenzy. I can hear the Republican Party now; they would be talking \nabout the selling out of America, and they would have good reason to \nthink about that. We would have Democrats joining, and I can hear Pat \nBuchanan now--he could make a whole campaign out of that.\n  Well, what do you think is going on in Russia right now with the \nNationalists and the old Communists? Are they listening to our debate \nabout the ABM Treaty, which some people say doesn't apply anymore? That \nis not what the sponsor of the amendment is saying, to the best of my \nknowledge, but others are. And we say to them that they should not \nworry. Why worry? We are only building this tiny, thin shield. Our \nshield isn't designed to affect them.\n  Yet, to the best of my knowledge, the sponsor of this bill would not \neven accept an amendment that would say, by the way, if whatever we \ncome up with would violate the ABM Treaty, we will negotiate a change \nwith the Russians first. It seems like a simple proposition, doesn't \nit?\n  Now, where does this leave us? I think I can say, without fear of \ncontradiction, that at best, it leaves us with essentially a \ncongressional resolution of no meaning, of no consequence, changing \nnothing that the administration has said about seeking the ability to \nhave a thin missile defense system, for it doesn't appropriate money; \nit says this is subject--which is obvious--to the yearly appropriations \nbill. It doesn't make any guarantees; it doesn't say anything of \nconsequence. In one sense, it is a meaningless resolution.\n  But in another sense, because we have debated it so vigorously, it is \ninvested with a meaning beyond its substance. What I worry about now is \nthat it will be taken as viewing our national strategy on nuclear \nweapons as no longer envisioning as the centerpiece of that strategy \nthe ABM Treaty--the very treaty that allows us to keep reducing the \nnumber of strategic weapons on each side.\n  Let me make one more point. You may say, ``Well, Biden, what does the \nABM Treaty have to do with the START agreement and reducing these \nnuclear weapons?'' Well, there are two kinds of truisms in this nuclear \ntheology. One is, if you are incapable of building a missile shield, \nand you think the other side might build one, then there is only one \nthing you can do: build more missiles to overwhelm the defense system. \nThat is axiomatic, it is cheaper, it is consistent with old-line \npolicy, and it is doable. At a minimum, you would say, don't destroy \nthe number of weapons you have.\n  Look at it this way. If you think the other team is about to put up \nthis missile shield--thin, thick or medium--and you now have 6,500 \nweapons that can reach their territory, you know, as a matter of \ncourse, that if you reduce that number to 2,500 or 2,000, you have a \ntwo-thirds fewer opportunities to penetrate that shield. So why would \nyou do that? Why would you do that?\n  I realize my friend from Louisiana is about to offer an amendment \nthat I hope will at least be read as having the impact of saying, hey, \nlook, arms reduction is still important to us--translated to mean the \nABM Treaty still makes a difference. But let's understand that, at \nbest, this bill is hortatory. At worst, it is a real, real bad idea \nbecause, to the extent that the threat is real--and there is a \npotential threat from Korea--to the extent that it is real, it pales, \npales, pales in comparison to the threat that remains in Russia--a \ncountry that is, at its best, to be characterized now as struggling to \nkeep its head above water; at worst, it is losing the battle of \ndemocratization.\n\n  Mr. President, the threat of a missile attack on the United States is \nreal and disturbing, but the true test is not how angry we get, but how \nrationally we deal with the threats to our national interests. A \nrational development and deployment of a limited nuclear missile \ndefense does not require us to ignore our ABM Treaty obligations. Only \nfear and politics drive missile defense adherents to take such a risk \nin the bill before us.\n  My generation understands both that fear and the dream of a ballistic \nmissile defense. Anyone who has ducked under his desk in grade school \nin an air raid drill knows the collective sense of vulnerability and \nfutility caused by the thought of a nuclear holocaust.\n  We have spent well over $100 billion in our effort to ease that sense \nof helplessness through civil defense or missile defense. But the role \nof this Senate, over two centuries, has been to resist those savage \nfears and passionate dreams that would otherwise take us down a \ndangerous path. America needs a balanced strategy to meet the rogue \nstate missile threat, while also preserving the ABM Treaty, continuing \nthe START process, and using nonproliferation assistance to combat \nloose nukes in Russia and, at the same time, advancing entry into force \nof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. That is what I believe to be a \nsound and balanced strategy, and that is what I hope Senator Kerry and \nSenator Levin and I will propose in a thing called the ``National \nSecurity Policy Act of 1999.''\n  I respectfully suggest that it is a far cry from the ``bumper \nsticker'' bill that is currently before us. If reason can overcome \nfear, perhaps reason can also overcome politics. If the Republicans \nhave the courage and foresight to pursue their goal of a limited \nnational missile defense, while preserving arms control and strategic \nstability, I urge them to get to the business of talking about that.\n  But right now, what is left uncertain is not whether or not we should \nhave a limited nuclear defense--we should and could if it is capable of \nbeing done--but it can and must be done only in the context of the ABM \nTreaty, START II and START III, as well as the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. That constitutes a national strategic policy.\n  Mr. President, I have departed from my text in order to convey the \ndepth of my concern over this bill. Allow me now to restate those \nconcerns in a more precise manner.\n  When I said that this was nothing more than an exercise in political \ntheater, I may have sounded like the Police Commissioner in the film \n``Casablanca.'' I am ``shocked . . . shocked'' to discover politics in \nthe U.S. Senate. But we ought to make one thing clear:\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\n the issue at stake is not--is not--whether to deploy a national \nmissile defense.\n  Recent Administration actions make clear that it will deploy a \nmissile defense system if that should be in the national interest. The \nreal issue here is whether we will be pragmatic or ideological about \nit.\n  The pragmatic solution considers the cost of a missile defense; this \nideological bill ignores it.\n  Serious technical challenges remain in developing a national missile \ndefense system. But that is not for a lack of trying. In fact, we have \ncommitted significant resources to the effort. Deputy Secretary of \nDefense John Hamre testified last October that the National Missile \nDefense program ``is as close as we can get in the Department of \nDefense to a Manhattan Project.''\n  The Clinton administration has submitted plans to spend approximately \n$30 billion in additional funds between 1999 and 2005 for missile \ndefense development and deployment. Of that, roughly $11 billion is \nearmarked for deployment of a ``thin'' National Missile Defense with 20 \ninterceptors. The Defense Department estimated last summer that an \nexpanded 100-interceptor system at a single site would cost upwards of \n$15 billion to deploy.\n  That $11-15 billion may very well provide us with a deployed system \nthat is effective against rudimentary countermeasures. It is not at all \nclear, however, that it will buy a system that is capable against truly \nadvanced countermeasures, such as are claimed for Russia's new SS-27 \nmissile or even other current Russian or Chinese missiles.\n  Now, before my colleagues remind me that our missile defense system \nis not aimed at Russia, I would refer them to the Rumsfeld Report. That \nreport warns that technology transfer is the key way that potential \nantagonists might acquire missile capabilities against the United \nStates.\n  The danger is that we will spend billions of dollars deploying a \nmissile defense system that may work against SCUD-like technology, but \nwill not work even five or ten years down the road, against the \npotential threat from rogue states who have bought or developed more \nsophisticated missile technology.\n  It may be the case that we will have to spend those $11-15 billion \ndollars on missile defense deployment. It seems to me, however, that a \nmuch smaller sum might suffice to remove much of the threat that \nconcerns us here.\n  If we could move from START to START Two and START Three, a portion \nof that $11-15 billion could be spent on dismantling Russian nuclear \nweapons and securing its large quantity of fissile material. This would \nmake a real, immediate, and lasting contribution to our security.\n  Another portion of those funds could be used to curb North Korea's \nefforts to develop intercontinental missiles or weapons of mass \ndestruction. It is clear that we need to inject new life into the 1994 \nAgreed Framework if we are to curtail North Korea's nuclear program. It \nis also clear that we need to take proactive steps to halt North \nKorea's long-range missile capability.\n  To be taken seriously, any U.S. initiative toward North Korea must \ncombine carrots and sticks. We must bolster our deterrent posture to \ndemonstrate to the North Koreans the penalties they face if they \nthreaten United States security. Improving our theater defenses, \nincreasing our capability for pre-emptive strikes if we should face \nimminent attack, interdicting North Korean missile shipments abroad, \nand increasing our security cooperation with other regional actors are \nall possible sticks we can wield.\n  At the same time, our policy should also provide adequate incentives \nto persuade the North Korean elite that their best choice for survival \nis the path of civil international behavior. These incentives could \ninclude our joining Japan and South Korea in funding two light-water \nreactors in exchange for our possession of the spent fuel in North \nKorea's Yongbyon nuclear reactor, sanctions relief in return for a \nverifiable end to North Korea's missile programs, and security \nassurances that we have no intention of forcing a change in North \nKorea's political system.\n  While these initiatives would cost money, together they could be \nfunded for far less than the $11-15 billion we plan to spend for \nmissile defense deployment. Thus, an article in Sunday's Washington \nPost noted that North Korea has already offered to cease exporting its \nmissile technology in return for only one billion dollars.\n  We rejected that proposal, and I think we can get that deal for a \nlower price. But we should remember our experience in negotiating \naccess to that suspect underground site in North Korea. In this time of \nfamine, North Korea would settle for food aid instead of cash. And a \nbillion dollars spent on food aid goes to American farmers, rather than \nto North Korean weapons.\n  I don't know how much it would cost to truly end North Korea's \nmissile and nuclear programs, but we might consider putting our money \nwhere our mouth is. While an embryonic missile defense program might \nincrease our sense of security, halting the North Korean's missile and \nnuclear programs would provide real benefit to our national security.\n  The pragmatic solution considers whether the first ``technologically \npossible'' national missile defense will be reliable and effective, \nespecially in light of warnings by the head of the Ballistic Missile \nDefense Office that national missile defense is a ``high risk'' \nprogram. This ideological bill commits us to spend at least 5 million \ndollars per day to build and deploy that first system, even if it has \nonly a mediocre test record.\n  Most importantly, the pragmatic solution considers ballistic missile \ndefense in the context of the U.S.-Russian strategic relationship.\n  Perhaps we will need to deploy a national missile defense. But this \nideological bill would foolishly sacrifice arms control, non-\nproliferation and strategic stability with Russia in order to field an \nimperfect missile defense.\n  And the fact is, we don't have to make that sacrifice in order to \naddress the ballistic missile threat. But we do have to reject \nsimplistic answers to complex issues.\n  The basic problem with this bill is not that it advocates a national \nmissile defense, but that it is so narrowly ideological about it. What \na shame, that we spend our time debating right-wing litmus tests. A \nbill that looked more broadly at challenges to our national security \nwould be much more worthy of our attention.\n  To underscore that point, I intend to introduce in the coming days \nthe ``National Security Policy Act of 1999.'' Working with me on that \nbill are Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, who is Vice Chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee; and Senator Levin of Michigan, who is Ranking \nMember on the Armed Services Committee.\n  We earnestly hope that our bill will provoke a much more serious \ndebate than is possible on the one-sentence bill before us. We invite \nour Republican colleagues to join with us in forging a comprehensive, \ntruly bipartisan consensus on critical national security issues.\n  One such issue is the future of deterrence. Is deterrence so weak \nthat we must deploy a national missile defense to combat third-rate \npowers like North Korea, Iran and Iraq? If so, then I believe we must \nreinforce deterrence.\n  Deterrence is--and will remain--the bedrock of U.S. nuclear strategy. \nRogue states must never be allowed to forget that utter annihilation \nwill be their fate if they should attack the United States with weapons \nof mass destruction. We should emphasize that basic fact.\n  What about the risk of ICBM's in the hands of a leader too crazy to \nbe deterred? If that should happen, we should make it clear that the \nUnited States will destroy--pre-emptively--any ICBM's that such a \nleader may target at us. I intend that our bill will do that, building \non our basic deterrence policy.\n  What is it about nuclear deterrence that makes it so hard for some \npeople to support that strategy? Nuclear deterrence between the United \nStates and the Soviets, and now between the United States and Russia, \nis based upon what is sometimes called ``Mutually Assured Destruction'' \nor a ``balance of terror.'' Each country maintains the capability to \ndestroy the other, even if the other side strikes first.\n  Both the right wing and the left wing of American politics rebel \nagainst this.\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\nThey abhor leaving our very fates to U.S. and Russian political leaders \nand military personnel. They also hear the warning of some religious \nand ethical leaders that no nuclear war can ever be a ``just war'' in \nmoral terms.\n  But the ``balance of terror'' remains in place, fully half a century \nafter the Soviet Union joined the United States as a nuclear power. And \nthose of us in the center of the political spectrum continue to support \nit.\n  Why is that? To put it simply: ``because it works.''\n  Yet one of the implicit purposes of this bill is to substitute our \npolicy of deterrence with one of defense. Instead of deterring an \nattack on our territory we would defend against such an attack with \nmissile defenses.\n  Some people believe we must make this transition from deterrence to \ndefense--in this case using a National Missile Defense--because the \nleaders of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq cannot be deterred by the same \nmeans we have used to deter Russia and China. I disagree. These \ncountries' leaders take tactical risks, but none has been willing to \nrisk complete annihilation.\n  Let's consider the record of deterrence against extremist leaders.\n  In the 1950's, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin was deterred from \na conventional invasion of Western Europe. But why? Why did the Soviets \nnot crush the Berlin Airlift? Because Stalin--that great butcher of \nsouls--feared a nuclear war.\n  Why did the Soviet Union pull back from confrontation in Berlin in \n1961 and Cuba in 1962? Because Nikita Khrushchev--that foolish risk-\ntaker who was later deposed by his nervous cohorts--still feared \nnuclear war.\n  Why has China not invaded Taiwan? Because every Chinese Communist \nleader--from the consummate butcher Mao to the would-be capitalist \ndictators of today--has feared nuclear war.\n  More recently, Saddam Hussein was deterred from using chemical or \nbiological weapons during the Gulf War, despite his threats to do so, \nby the United State's promise that such an attack would meet with a \ndevastating U.S. response.\n  The record demonstrates that extremist states are deterred when we \ncredibly threaten to retaliate, and when our threatened retaliation \nimperils their vital interests.\n  That is what has deterred the Iraqis, the Soviets, and the Chinese \nfrom using weapons of mass destruction against U.S. interests in the \npast. That is what has brought the Serbs to the bargaining table, both \nin the Bosnian and Kosovo crises. That is what has deterred the Syrians \nfrom directly attacking Israel.\n  Yet our concern today is over the North Korean threat. At some point \nin the near future, the North Koreans may achieve a limited ability to \nstrike U.S. territory. We must ask ourselves whether the logic of \ndeterrence--a logic that has worked in so many other instances--will \nwork against the North Koreans. Again, lets consider the record.\n  For years, North Korea has had the ability to rain short-range \nmissiles on all of South Korea and to kill untold thousands within \nrange of North Korean artillery. Yet the South Korean and U.S. \nmilitaries have kept the peace by threatening punishing retaliation \nshould the North Koreans attack. We have kept the peace by threatening \nto destroy the very heart of the North Korean regime--its military--\nwhich is crucial to its control over its population.\n  Our military will continue to have that retaliatory capability in the \nNorth Korean theater of operations--whether we have a national missile \ndefense or not. We maintain approximately 37,000 troops on the ground \nin Korea, including the 8th Army and 7th Air Force, to say nothing of \nthe 47,000 American troops in Japan or the portions of the 7th Fleet \ndeployed in the region.\n  Moreover, the North Koreans must know that our early warning radars \ncould pinpoint the source of any missile attack on the United States \nand that such an attack would bring a devastating response.\n  Maintaining U.S. retaliatory forces, and demonstrating our \nwillingness to use them when necessary, are the keys that have kept the \npeace. There is every prospect that the credible threat of retaliation \nwill continue to deter extremist states in the future.\n  So let us all think carefully--and rationally--before letting our \nfears of destruction move us away from a policy that has avoided \ndestruction so well and for so long.\n  Traditional deterrence may unnerve us because it depends upon \nrational leaders and weapons control systems. But the alternative--\nmissile defense--depends in turn upon the perfection of complex systems \nand their human components.\n  Think of the great computer-assisted systems of our time: the \nInternal Revenue Service, the air traffic control system, credit \nbureaus, or the National Weather Service.\n  Then ask yourselves whether missile defense will really make you \nsafe--especially if the price of it is the end of the START process \nand, therefore, continued Russian reliance upon MIRVed ICBM's.\n  Whatever missiles a rogue state might build, however, the one missile \nthreat to our very existence is still from Russia. A rogue state might \ndeploy a few tens of nuclear warheads; Russia has thousands. And what \nis especially appalling is this bill's cavalier treatment of the U.S.-\nRussia relationship.\n  As we debate S. 257, I have to ask myself: Why is the other side so \ndetermined to pass this bill, rather than a more serious piece of \nlegislation? The sad truth is that the real goal of many ballistic \nmissile defense adherents is to do away with the ABM Treaty.\n  Why would they want to do that? Because they know that the ``thin'' \nmissile defense proposed in this bill is at best a strictly limited \ndefense. It may work against a handful of incoming missiles, but not \nagainst an attack of any serious magnitude.\n  To achieve a defense against a serious ballistic missile attack with \nnuclear weapons, we would probably need multiple radar sites--perhaps \nusing ship-borne radars--and surely more interceptor sites. (The \nHeritage Foundation proposes putting the interceptors on ships, as \nwell.)\n  To stop a serious missile attack using chemical or biological \nwarheads, we might well need a boost-phase intercept system, either \nship-borne or space-based. That is because the chemical or biological \nagents could be carried in scores of bomblets dispersed shortly after \nboost-phase shut-off. The national missile defense systems currently \nunder development would be nearly useless against such bomblets.\n  So missile defense is rather like Lay's Potato Chips: it's hard to \neat just one. For the real ballistic missile defense adherents, even \n``Star Wars'' is therefore not dead. But the ABM Treaty bars both ship-\nborne and space-based ABM systems.\n  Still, the dream persists: if only this bill were passed, if only the \nABM Treaty were killed, then ``Brilliant Pebbles'' or some other system \ncould be pulled out of the drawer, dusted off, and contracted out to \nevery congressional district to keep the money coming.\n  Many missile defense adherents are quite open about their \ndetermination to kill the ABM Treaty, and frustrated because Congress \nlacks the Constitutional authority to do that. Some fall back on \nstrained legal theories to argue that the break-up of the Soviet Union \nleft the ABM Treaty null and void--while hoping that nobody will apply \nthat reasoning to other U.S.-Soviet treaties.\n  At other times, missile defense adherents press to deploy a ballistic \nmissile defense regardless of whether this requires violation or \nabrogation of the ABM Treaty. That is what this bill would do.\n  If we enact S. 257 and make it U.S. policy to deploy an ABM system \nwithout addressing Russian concerns and U.S. treaty obligations, then \nRussia will almost certainly use its thousands of ICBM warheads to \nmaintain its nuclear deterrence posture.\n\n  That would end strategic arms control. It would also sacrifice our \nlong-standing goal--ever since the Reagan Administration--of removing \nthe greatest threat to strategic stability: land-based, MIRVed ICBM's.\n  MIRVed ICBM's--with Multiple, Independently-targeted Re-entry \nVehicles--are the cheapest way for Russia to overwhelm a missile \ndefense. But they also put nuclear Armageddon just\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\na hair-trigger away, because a missile with 3, or 7, or 10 warheads is \na truly tempting target for a first strike by the other side.\n  In a crisis, a Russia that relies upon MIRVed ICBM's may feel it has \nto ``use them or lose them.'' That's why President Bush signed START \nTwo to ban those missiles.\n  Today, maintaining the START momentum is a real national security \nchallenge. The Russian Duma has balked at ratifying START Two, largely \nbecause Russia cannot afford to replace its MIRVed ICBM's with enough \nnew, single-warhead missiles to maintain the force levels permitted by \nthe treaty.\n  But major force reductions under START Three, to reduce nuclear \nforces to a level that Russia can hope to maintain, could get the \nRussian Duma to permit Russia to give up MIRVed ICBMs.\n  Serious legislation would call for lower START Three levels than \nthose proposed at the Helsinki summit in 1997. The bill before us, by \ncontrast, would put the final nail in the coffin of START Two.\n  That is because Russia truly doubts that it can do without MIRVed \nICBM's if the United States deploys a national missile defense. Now, \nU.S. officials are explaining to Russian leaders how a limited missile \ndefense could defend America without threatening Russia or the basic \ngoals of the ABM Treaty.\n  The Administration thinks there is a reasonable chance of bringing \nRussia around. But that will take time. Our bill will endorse that \nprocess of education and negotiation.\n  Passage of S. 257, by contrast, risks torpedoing those important \nU.S.-Russian talks. This bill will very likely be seen by Russia as a \nslap in the face. And it's hard to blame them, when the litmus-testers \nset up a vote just a few days before Russia's Prime Minister is due \nhere for talks with Vice President Gore.\n  If my colleagues want a limited national missile defense without \nsacrificing the ABM Treaty, we can get that. If, however, their real \naim is to kill the ABM Treaty and strategic arms control, then they are \nmaking a tragic mistake.\n  S. 257, which ignores our treaty obligations, could force us to \nabrogate the ABM Treaty. Enactment of this bill would thus practically \nguarantee that the START process would collapse, leaving us facing \nMIRVed Russian ICBM's for decades to come.\n  One of the fascinating questions in the missile defense debate is why \nmissile defense adherents are so willing to sacrifice the START \nprocess. The answers tell us a lot about isolationist ideology and the \npolitics of paranoia.\n  Isolationists in the Senate--mostly Republicans--have a long history \nof opposing international obligations. Henry Cabot Lodge opposed the \nLeague of Nations after World War I. Republicans opposed Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt's preparations for World War II, and some continued to \naccuse him of ``getting us into'' that war for another 20 years, as \nthough America would have been better off accepting a Nazi Europe. And \nsome Republicans opposed the United Nations in the post-World War II \nworld.\n  Conservative Republicans have opposed arms control treaties as well, \nfrom the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 to the SALT Treaty of 1972, \nthe Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974, the START Treaties of 1991 and \n1993, and the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. Today they oppose \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and call for an end to the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty of 1972.\n  Imagine their frustration, then, with the tendency of Republican \nPresidents to negotiate and sign arms control treaties. Dwight \nEisenhower's pursuit of a test-ban treaty was the first betrayal, even \nthough it was John F. Kennedy who finally signed the Limited Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  Richard Nixon was truly a turncoat, to many Republicans. Aside from \nrecognizing Communist China, Nixon signed both the ABM Treaty and the \nSALT Treaty with the Soviet Union. The Soviets promptly used a loophole \nin SALT to deploy the MIRVed SS-19 ICBM, which the Senate had thought \nwould be illegal under the treaty. Republican anger was hardly lessened \nwhen it came to light that the Soviets had told U.S. officials of their \nplans, and that the word had not been passed to the Senate.\n  I think that the conservative Republican anger at Henry Kissinger--\nwhich continues to this day--is due to his willingness to pursue arms \ncontrol with the Soviet Union and better relations with China, even as \nthe United States bombed their ships in Haiphong harbor. Nixon and \nKissinger pursued the Vietnam War far beyond the point of diminishing \nreturns, and they supported right-wing regimes from Greece to Chile and \nGuatemala. But their subtle power politics rejected isolationist \nideology, and true-blue conservatives never forgave them.\n  Gerald Ford was hardly better, as he signed the Threshold Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  Ronald Reagan could never be seen as a traitor to the right wing. He \nbrought it into the White House and brought Republicans to power in the \nSenate. He opposed SALT Two and breached the limits of that signed-but-\nunratified treaty. He also brought back the missile defense issue, with \nhis Strategic Defense Initiative--better known as ``Star Wars,'' as \nmuch for its overreaching ambition as for its space-based architecture.\n  Even Ronald Reagan puzzled many right-wingers, however, when he came \nout against nuclear weapons and proposed sharing Star Wars technology \nwith the Soviets. Puzzlement turned to frustration in the Bush \nAdministration, as some Reagan proposals were actually accepted by the \nSoviet Union and its successors: especially the Intermediate Nuclear \nForces agreement, the START Treaties, and the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  The Clinton Administration has achieved ratification of START Two and \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, but perhaps only because former \nRepublican officials worked with Democrats to complete President Bush's \nlegacy. The real political problem with the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty is that it was a Democratic president who signed it.\n  The truth is that conservative Republicans are still uncomfortable \nwith the whole concept of arms control. They see arms control treaties \nas either hamstringing the United States or defrauding the world by \nmerely codifying what the two sides would have done unilaterally.\n  Against this background, it is not so surprising that Republicans are \nwilling to sacrifice the START process in order to kill the ABM Treaty. \nConservatives were not very pleased to be signing arms control treaties \nin the first place. To them, the end of the Cold War is a time to rid \nourselves of those ``foreign entanglements,'' to use President \nWashington's famous phrase.\n  As a Democrat, I must admit to being perplexed by some of this \nbehavior. You might expect that conservatives would appreciate the \nvirtues of ``law and order'' in the field of strategic weapons, just as \nthey preach it at home.\n  Certainly professional military officers appreciate the virtue of \npredictability that enables them to prepare more rationally for any \nfuture conflict. As a result, the military nearly always supports \nratification of arms control treaties, again to the great frustration \nof conservative Republicans. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is just \nthe latest example, as every Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nsince General David Jones from the Reagan Administration supports \nratification, while conservative Republicans in the Senate vow to keep \nthat treaty from coming to a vote.\n  Perhaps the real clash here is between ideology and reality. \nConservative Republicans idolize self-reliance, both in the individual \nand in the state.\n  The Great Depression of 60 years ago and the interdependent world \neconomy of today have made rugged individualism an insufficient \nguideline in economic and social policy. Two world wars and the threat \nof annihilation posed by weapons of mass destruction have done the same \nthing in our international relations.\n  The American people understand this and vote consistently against \nthose who would sacrifice national or international consensus for the \nsake of left-wing or right-wing ideologies.\n  But the dream of unfettered individualism lives on. For some, it is \nthe dream of resuming nuclear weapons tests, even though the price of \nthat would be permitting similar tests by\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\nincreasing numbers of other countries. For others, it is the dream of \nfighting the next war in the so-called ``high frontier'' of outer \nspace. And for still others, it is the dream of a shield against enemy \nmissiles--perhaps a U.S. shield against our enemies or, in some \nversions, a U.S.-Russian shield against the rest of the world.\n  To these dreamers, the bill before us is but a first step. A ``thin'' \nnational missile defense will lead to ``thicker'' defenses. Demise of \nthe ABM Treaty and strategic arms control will merely usher in an age \nof unfettered nuclear dominion, as the United States builds an \neventually impregnable, space-based defense from missiles of all sorts.\n  This is only a dream. But it is a dream that energizes the right \nwing. And it is a dream that has become a litmus test for Republicans \nin this body.\n  That is truly a shame. For rational policy must be built on reality, \nnot on dreams.\n  Mr. President, the threat of a missile attack on the United States is \nreal; it is disturbing. But the true test of statecraft is not how \nangry you get, but how rationally you deal with threats to the national \ninterest.\n  A rational development and deployment of a limited national missile \ndefense does not require us to ignore our ABM Treaty obligations. Only \nfear and politics drive missile defense adherents to take such a risk \nin the bill before us.\n  My generation understands both that fear and the dream of a ballistic \nmissile defense. Anyone who has ducked under his desk in a school ``air \nraid'' drill knows the collective sense of vulnerability and futility \ncaused by the thought of a nuclear holocaust. We have spent well over a \nhundred billion dollars on efforts to ease that sense of helplessness \nthrough civil defense or missile defense.\n  But the role of this Senate, for over two centuries, has been to \nresist those savage fears and passionate dreams that would otherwise \ntake us down dangerous paths.\n  America needs a balanced strategy, to meet the rogue-state missile \nthreat while also preserving the ABM Treaty, continuing the START \nprocess, using non-proliferation assistance to combat ``loose nukes'' \nin Russia, and achieving entry into force of the Comprehensive Test-Ban \nTreaty.\n  That is what I hope Senator Kerrey, Senator Levin and I will propose \nin the ``National Security Policy Act of 1999.'' It is a far cry from \nthe bumper-sticker bill currently before us.\n  Let me make a special appeal to those Republican members with whom we \nDemocrats make common cause to support threat reduction programs in the \nformer Soviet Union. Some of those programs, like the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram, further the START process by underwriting the destruction of \nformer Soviet weapons.\n  Others guard against proliferation by safeguarding or downgrading \nspecial nuclear material and by improving export and border controls to \nprevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Still others \nhelp weapons scientists and technicians to find non-military \nemployment, so they will not have to consider contracts with rogue \nstates for their dangerous goods or services.\n  Economic collapse and resurgent nationalism may be closing Russia's \nwindow to the West. But these programs help to keep that window open. \nThe Clinton Administration has seen the risks and opportunities that \nare inherent in Russia's economic plight: the risk of rogue-state \nrecruitment has increased, but so has the buying power of every dollar \nand Deutschmark that we and our allies can devote to threat reduction \nand non-proliferation assistance.\n  The Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative announced last month \ndeserves our support, and I am confident that it will gain that \nsupport. I believe that we should do even more, including financing \nretired officer housing in return for Russian withdrawal of troops from \nMoldova and Georgia.\n  We should also consider more programs that employ former weapons \nexperts in non-military pursuits, even if their activities are not \nlikely to result in commercially viable ventures. Eventually the \nRussian economy will turn around and provide new careers for the \ntalented experts from the Soviet Union's nuclear, chemical weapons, \nbiological weapons, and long-range missile programs. Until that \nhappens, however, it is clearly in our national interest to keep that \ntalent off the international market.\n  Democrats will support our moderate Republican friends on these \nissues, and I believe that Republicans will support our similar efforts \nin return. But my moderate Republican friends should not deceive \nthemselves: these programs will not survive if right-wing policies on \nnational missile defense bring down the ABM Treaty and the START \nprocess.\n  Russian pride is already damaged by its shattered power and by the \nneed to accept our money. If a precipitous decision to deploy missile \ndefense leads Russia to preserve its MIRVed ICBM's, Cooperative Threat \nReduction will be ended. Once that goes, I predict that Russian \ncooperation on non-proliferation will go as well.\n  Then our nuclear and chemical and biological weapon fears will expand \nfrom the fear of missile warheads to the fear of every ship or plane or \ntruck that approaches our borders. And the far-sighted legacy of Sam \nNunn and his concerned co-sponsors will have been but a blissful rest \nstop on the highway to destruction.\n  If reason can overcome fear, perhaps reason can also overcome the \npolitics behind S. 257. If Republicans have the courage and foresight \nto pursue their goal of a limited national missile defense while \npreserving arms control and strategic stability, I urge them to \nwithdraw S. 257 and talk to us.\n  Otherwise, I urge all my colleagues to reject this bill and avert the \nsubstantial peril that it risks to our national security.\n  I hope the amendment of my friend from Louisiana prevails because, \nalthough she may not mean it this way, I read it to say arms reduction \nis still vitally important. Arms reductions are critical and, I would \nargue, are not capable of being conducted with any efficacy in the \nabsence of an ABM Treaty.\n  I thank my colleague for allowing me to speak, my colleague from \nLouisiana who is about to introduce her amendment. I also thank my \nfriend from Mississippi, who is a consummate gentleman for following \nand listening to what I have to say.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 72\n\n  (Purpose: To add a statement of policy that the United States seek \n       continued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), for herself, Mr. \n     Levin, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Lieberman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered seventy-two:\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY ON REDUCTION OF RUSSIAN NUCLEAR FORCES.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to seek continued \n     negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it is a simply worded amendment but a very important \namendment.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware brought up excellent points \nin terms of the necessity for us, as we consider this important bill \nthat the Senator from Mississippi has brought to us, to continue to \ntalk about our commitments to further reductions of nuclear weapons.\n  I strongly support a limited national missile defense. It is \nimportant that we pursue this program with energy and determination. \nBut we must also keep pursuing other means of enhancing our security.\n  We need to move our strategic relationship with Russia from the cold \nwar paradigm of mutually assured destruction to one of mutually assured \nsecurity. We have made great progress in this regard, as has been \npointed out in the last hour on this floor by Members on both sides, \nbut much remains to be done.\n  However, in making this transition, we cannot allow the territory of \nthe United States to be threatened by ballistic missiles from rogue \nnations, especially if it is in our capacity to protect ourselves from \nthis imminent\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\nthreat. Nevertheless, we should not allow our missile defense effort to \ndistract from our security relationship with Russia, if at all \npossible. And that is the essence of this amendment.\n  Our country and Russia have come a long way in terms of reducing \nstrategic nuclear threats to both countries, and nothing we do today \nshould negate this progress. But, in my view, nothing in the 20th \ncentury has contributed more to American security than an end to the \nimminent threat of nuclear war.\n  It is important that we carry this momentum to finish the task. No \nthreat from a rogue nation should outweigh the need for us to attain a \nmutually secure and stable relationship with our Russian partners. On \nthe eve of a visit from Prime Minister Primakov, it is important that \nwe continue to work towards this goal and we use this opportunity to \nfurther our negotiations.\n  Therefore, I offer this amendment, which simply states that it is our \npolicy to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear \nforces which will reaffirm the Senate's belief that such reductions are \nin our national interests. It would also be an important signal to the \nRussians on the eve of that visit.\n  Furthermore, this amendment is in keeping with the recommendations of \nour National Defense Panel. As you know, the NDP was created by \nCongress to review the Pentagon's conclusion in its Quadrennial Defense \nReview. It is a nonpartisan panel of defense experts, some of the \nfinest minds working on national security. They are in agreement that a \ndefensive system, such as our national missile defense, is best \ndeveloped if coupled with limiting our offensive capabilities in our \narms reduction efforts.\n  That is what we are trying to do with this amendment. I believe it \nwill receive bipartisan support. It will help make this bill an even \nbetter bill.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to add just a few things to the \nRecord that I think are very important as we negotiate the passage of \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  Our distinguished colleague from Mississippi did not include this \nlanguage in his very simple bill to deploy an effective national \nmissile defense system in his efforts to gain support. And I agree with \nthat. But I think it is important, Mr. President, for those who are \nconsidering whether or not to vote for this bill--and I hope they will \nvote for this amendment and then vote for the bill--for me to take 2 \nminutes to read into the Record some important statements that have \nbeen made by our President, as well as some of the enemies of this \ncountry, about why it is important for this bill to pass.\n  Not last year, not the year before, but in 1994, President Clinton \ncertified that:\n\n       I * * * find that the proliferation of nuclear, biological, \n     and chemical weapons (`weapons of mass destruction') and the \n     means of delivering such weapons, constitute an unusual and \n     extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \n     policy, and economy of the United States, and hereby declare \n     a national emergency to deal with that threat.\n\n  For those who say the threat is not real, recently--last year--some \nnew information came out about the significance of this threat.\n       This is 1994.\n       Let me go on to read:\n\n       Several countries hostile to the United States have been \n     particularly determined to acquire missiles and weapons of \n     mass destruction. President Clinton observed in January of \n     1998, for example, that ``Saddam Hussein has spent the better \n     part of this decade, and must of his nation's wealth, not on \n     providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, \n     chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver \n     them''.\n\n  Let me also say that it is not just this country. Qadhafi, the Libyan \nleader, has stated:\n\n       If they know that you have a deterrent force capable of \n     hitting the United States, they would not be able to hit you. \n     If we had possessed a deterrent--missiles that could reach \n     New York--we would have hit it at the same moment. \n     Consequently, we should build this force so that they and \n     others will no longer think about an attack.\n  I could go on. But I think the Record is replete with quote after \nquote by hostile leaders to the United States that it is most certainly \ntheir intention to develop these weapons that could possibly hit our \nhomeland. Although it is hard for people to think about this--and we \nmost certainly don't want people to panic--we want to be realistic to \nthe threat.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi for bringing this bill before us \nat this time.\n  I offer this amendment in an attempt to get more bipartisan support \nfor what I consider to be a good bill, and a quite timely one, that \nwill not, and should not, disrupt our ongoing and very beneficial \nrelations with Russia in our reductions, but one that will protect the \npeople of Louisiana, the people of Alaska, the people of Mississippi, \nthe people of Michigan, and everyone in this Nation for this growing \nand imminent threat that even the President himself has acknowledged \nover and over is real.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I ask the floor leaders to give \nwhatever time they think is appropriate to the discussion of this \namendment. I will call for a rollcall vote at the appropriate time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe the minority manager wants to be \nrecognized. I yield, with the understanding that I will follow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Colorado.\n  I want to make an inquiry of both him and the Senator from Louisiana \nas well and, of course, the floor managers, and the sponsors of the \nbill. We are trying to determine how much time is going to be needed on \nthe Landrieu-Levin amendment which is pending. We are seeking a fairly \nearly vote on this amendment. I wonder if I can inquire of my friend \nfrom Colorado approximately how long he plans on speaking.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Probably 15 to 20 minutes would be adequate for my \nremarks. I request 20 minutes, and then, if I finish before that, I \nwill yield back.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is no time limit, of course, at this point.\n  Mr. President, I then alert our colleagues. I think I am speaking for \nSenator Cochran also. We are seeking to know how many people will want \nto speak on the pending amendment after the Senator from Colorado has \ncompleted. Perhaps the cloakrooms can be notified of that promptly, if \nthat is appropriate, so we can determine just whether it is possible to \nhave a vote on the pending amendment sometime prior to the--what was \nthe Senator's goal?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I would like \nto see a vote around 4:30, or 4:45 at the latest.\n  But we don't want to cut any Senators off. If others want to speak on \nthis amendment, then we want to encourage them to come over and let us \nhear their remarks. This is an amendment we are prepared to recommend \nbe approved by the Senate. We think it is a good amendment, \nnoncontroversial, helps the bill, strengthens the bill, and I \ncompliment the distinguished Senator for offering it.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the privilege \nof the floor be granted to John Bradshaw, who is a fellow in Senator \nWellstone's office, during the pendency of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we will propound a unanimous consent \nagreement hopefully after the Senator from Colorado has completed his \npresentation. I will need about 10 minutes in support of the Landrieu-\nLevin amendment, which is a critically important amendment. It should \nbe discussed before we vote on it because of the impact it will have, I \nbelieve, on the bill and perhaps on the vote on the bill, because it \nwill also have an impact on the recommendation of the senior advisers \nto the President as to whether or not he will veto this bill.\n  Because it is so significant--it is simple but very vital and very \nsignificant--it is important that there be discussion of the Landrieu \namendment. So I will need about 10 minutes on that, I alert my friend \nfrom Mississippi. We can figure out if any time agreement is possible \nafter the Senator from Colorado has completed. I thank him for his \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 257, the National \nMissile Defense Act of 1999. Before I make my comments, I ask unanimous \nconsent\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\nthat Tim Coy be granted the privilege of the floor for the duration of \nthe consideration of S. 257.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis thought and effort in this regard.\n  Mr. President, I think we get stuck in the way things used to be. The \nfact is, this is a changing world. We have changing dynamics as far as \nwhat other countries are doing in regard to weapons development and \nwhat their risks may be to the mainland of the United States.\n  My colleague from Mississippi has said yes, this is a changing world \nout there and we need to make sure we have a national missile defense \nsystem. If you talk to the average Americans out here on the street, \nthey think we do have a national missile defense system. The fact is, \nwe are no longer in a cold war era where the foreign policy of threat \nof mutual destruction is going to be effective. We are in a modern era \nwhere countries can develop a missile rather quickly, because of the \nnatural resources that they have--maybe it is oil and gas--and with \nthese huge financial resources that all of a sudden become available to \nthem. In fact, we have heard testimony in the committees on which I \nserve--I serve on both the Intelligence Committee and the Armed \nServices Committee--that the time required for a newly developed \ncountry to build a missile from scratch has halved in the last few \nyears. That is because there is lots of technology out there, that is \nreadily available, that they can acquire quickly. They can put this all \ntogether into a very effective offensive system if they so choose.\n  So I want to take some time today to talk about what the bill means \nto me, and some of the language in the bill specifically. I would like \nto talk a little bit about the threats of today's world and talk about \nthe system's feasibility. We have heard comments here on the floor that \nwe are dreaming, that this is really not that feasible an approach. I \nwant to make some comments in that regard and talk a little bit about \nthe cost of the system and how I think we can pay for it. And then, \nfinally, before I conclude, I want to talk a little bit about the ABM \nTreaty and the treaty ramifications.\n  What does S. 257, the National Defense Act of 1999, do? Simply, the \nNational Defense Act of 1999 states that it is the policy of the United \nStates ``to deploy as soon as technologically possible a National \nMissile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United \nStates against limited ballistic missile attack (whether that is \naccidental, unauthorized or deliberate).''\n  The bill's policy statement is identical to that of S. 1873, which \nwas proposed during the 105th Congress, except for the addition of the \nstatement that missile defense is subject to the authorization and \nappropriations process, which is an amendment we just adopted here in a \nvote we had around 2 o'clock or 2:15.\n  This bill does not mandate a date for deployment of a system, calling \ninstead for deployment as soon as the required technology is mature.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the United States has no defense against \nthese systems, but I think it is important that we continue to push for \ntheir development as soon as it is technologically feasible--that we \nquickly move ahead. I think this is completely compatible with the \nJanuary 20, 1999, statement of the Secretary of Defense: ``The United \nStates in fact will face a rogue nation threat to our homeland \nagainst which we will have to defend the American people.'' And, he \ngoes on to say, ``technological readiness will be the sole remaining \ncriterion'' in deciding when to deploy a national missile defense \nsystem.\n\n  Secretary Cohen stated on February 3, 1999, during the Armed Services \nhearing, that any country which fires ballistic missiles at us will \nface immediate retaliation. Again, this is the old, cold war attitude \nof mutual destruction. While I agree with this statement, we again \ndecide to place ourselves at the mercy of rogue states instead of being \nproactive in protecting our citizens, because these rogue states have \nthe capability of developing a system of missiles with some type of \nwarhead--whether it is bacteriological, chemical, or nuclear--and we do \nnot have any defense system today to counteract any missile that would \nbe headed towards the United States.\n  I would like to talk a little bit about the threats that are posed to \nthe U.S. mainland today. I want to refer to the July 1998 Rumsfeld \nreport on ballistic missile threats to the United States. The \ncommissioners who put together the report concluded:\n\n       [T]he threat to the U.S. posed by these emerging \n     capabilities is broader, more mature and evolving more \n     rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports by \n     the Intelligence community.\n\n  The report goes on and further states:\n\n       [T]he warning times that the U.S. can expect of new \n     ballistic missile deployments are being reduced.\n\n  I believe the missile threat to the United States is growing at an \naccelerated pace. Numerous hostile nations have declared their intent \nto obtain missiles capable of attacking the United States, and are \nsucceeding in doing so. These include launches that have been made from \nNorth Korea and China, the old missile fields of the former Soviet \nUnion--now in the Commonwealth of Independent States. I happen to \nbelieve that very soon Iraq, Iran, Libya, India, and Pakistan will have \nthe same capability.\n  Two of the worst proliferators of ballistic missiles are North Korea \nand Russia. North Korea has tested a missile capable of attacking \nAlaska and Hawaii, and is apparently developing a second missile which \nwill be capable of reaching the entire United States mainland. North \nKorea has sold every missile it has developed, and the associated \ntechnology, to other rogue states.\n  During the Armed Services hearing on February 2, 1999, Director of \nCentral Intelligence George Tenet said:\n\n       North Korea is on the verge of developing ballistic \n     missiles capable of hitting the continental United States.\n\n  Again, relating to the North Koreans' launch when they set off a \nsecond-stage rocket that went over the tip of Japan, Tenet said:\n\n       The proliferation implications of these missiles are \n     obviously significant.\n\n  During the hearing, Director Tenet also warned that Russia is \nreneging on their earlier commitment to the United States to curb the \ntransfer of advanced missile technology to Iran. Again, he stated:\n\n       The bottom line is that assistance from Russian countries \n     is still contributing substantially to progress in Iran's \n     dangerous missile programs.\n\n  He added:\n\n       India, Pakistan, and Iran, who have traditionally been \n     considered technology customers, now have developed \n     capabilities that could, in some cases, be exported to \n     others.\n\n  So here we are. We have a commission set up by the United States to \nanalyze our defensive posture and our ability to counteract a missile \nattack, and we have the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency \nboth warning us that we need to update our defense system to a current \nsituation that exists throughout the world. I happen to believe both \nthe report as well as the comments by George Tenet. I think that we \nneed to move forward.\n  The President's 3+3 Missile Defense Plan has already been pushed back \nto 2005, but the problem is that the threat is right now. It is not in \n2005. In December, Robert Walpole, National Intelligence Officer for \nStrategic and Nuclear Programs, said in a speech that the Central \nIntelligence Agency was caught by surprise by North Korea's flight \ntesting of a three-stage missile. While the third stage of the missile \nfailed, CIA analysts had to agree to the Rumsfeld report, as I stated \nearlier in my comments, that the threat is here despite the CIA's \ndismissal of the report when it was released.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the feasibility of us moving ahead \nwith the technology that we have today. We have the pieces of a \nnational missile defense system with proven technology. However, the \nrisk to development lies not in the pieces but in the integration of \nthese pieces into an effective system in a timely manner, which is \nexactly what this bill does. When we talk about the term \n``technologically possible,'' it includes system integration. There is \nno date in the bill. The bill just calls for the policy to deploy when \ntechnologically possible.\n  During a February 3, 1999, Sea Power interview, General Shelton said:\n\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\n\n       The simple fact is that we do not have the technology to \n     field a national missile defense. . . . My colleagues--the \n     Joint Chiefs and I--believe that when we have the technology \n     for NMD, we ought to have the capability to be able to \n     transition right into the deployment, if the threat warrants.\n\n  A followup on that, Ted Warner, Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nStrategy and Threat Reduction, said that the threat is no longer the \nissue holding back national missile defense, but technical feasibility \nis all that drives deployment.\n  During a February 3, 1999, Armed Services hearing, Secretary Cohen \nstated that the Department is committed to advancing its missile \ndefense efforts as technology risks allow, without any mention of when \nthe threat is there. He admits that the threat is here now.\n  I will discuss the architecture of a national missile defense system. \nThe architecture for national missile defense consists of three pieces: \nthe battle management system, the radars that detect incoming missiles, \nand the booster and ground-based interceptor that will comprise our \nresponse.\n  The battle management command, control and communications system will \nreceive data on the incoming missiles, calculate the number of \ninterceptors needed to destroy the missiles, and monitor the status of \nthe test elements, giving decisionmakers a prioritized set of choices \nfor our response. Portions of this system have already been tested and \nperformed flawlessly in previous tests.\n  Our current detection system consists of a combination of upgraded \nearly warning radars, new ground-based radars and our space-based \nsatellites. Once the satellites detect a launch, they will pass the \ndata to our ground-based radars, which will create a detection net to \ngather high-fidelity data on the incoming missile that will help our \ninterceptor strike its target. The upgraded early warning radars have \nbeen rigorously tested using both computer simulations and actual test \nlaunches and are more than capable of performing their mission.\n  Their replacement, a space-based infrared radar system, will vastly \nimprove our detection. Moreover, our targeting capabilities will be \nincreased with the eventual deployment of a complementary low space-\nbased infrared system which performs cold-body tracking of incoming \nmissiles.\n  The least proven piece of the architecture may very well be the \nbooster and interceptor. Various parts of the interceptors, such as the \nseeker, have been tested many times, and the test objectives have been \nmet. Actually, just yesterday the PAC-3 missile collected, detected, \ntracked and gauged and then hit an incoming test missile.\n  The technology exists to build a national missile defense system. \nFurther testing of integration should show whether the system is ready \nto deploy. Requiring more studies and analysis to see if the technology \nis here, which it is, before we decide to deploy will only place us at \nthe mercy of a threat we already know is out there.\n  Let me speak a little bit about the cost of the system. With regard \nto the national missile defense budget, on one hand, the administration \nadded $600 million from its fiscal year 1999 emergency supplemental but \nhas yet to put forward exactly where this money will be spent. There \nwas discussion to use part of this money for the Wye peace agreement. \nThen the administration added $6.6 billion over the 5-year plan for the \nnational missile defense but pushed the majority of the money into the \noutyears, making it vulnerable to future cuts and the whims of another \nadministration. I happen to believe that we should field an NMD system \nas soon as it works. Given that most of the system is technologically \nfeasible already, we should be putting money in military construction \nand procurement starting in fiscal year 2000 and deploy much earlier \nthan the year 2005.\n  To make a few comments about the ABM Treaty and the treaty \nratification, this bill is not about the ABM Treaty, specific \narchitecture, deployment dates, or reports. The cold war is over, and \nwe shouldn't hold to the cold war ways of protecting ourselves, the ABM \nTreaty. MAD, referred to as mutually assured destruction, should not \nrule our defense posture. We are no longer facing a superpower but now \nface rogue states.\n  We keep hearing that if we deploy a missile defense system, Russia \nwill not ratify START II. They have used this threat entirely too many \ntimes--in the bombing of Iraq, they used it; in the sanctions for \nmissile proliferation with Iran.\n  As columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote:\n\n       What standing does Russia, of all nations, have to dictate \n     how and whether the United States will defend itself? Russia \n     is the principal supplier to Iran of the missile and nuclear \n     technology that could one day turn New York into a Hiroshima.\n\n  The administration has been saying that any national missile defense \nis not directed at Russia. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said:\n\n       It's directed at rogue states that have long range \n     missiles. These are threats not only to us, but to the \n     Russians.\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, a firm policy to build a defense \nagainst ballistic missiles will send a clear message to rogue states \nthat they are wasting their money building ballistic missiles with \nwhich to attack or threaten the United States. If rogue countries \ndecide to ignore this message, the United States will be prepared to \nprotect itself as soon as the technology is ready against such attack \nor threat of attack.\n  The bill is a policy declaration, making clear to the citizens, \nallies, and adversaries of the United States that it will not remain \ndefenseless against a ballistic missile attack. I believe there is a \nneed to have a bipartisan bill, and this is a bipartisan bill. This \nbill was introduced by Senator Cochran and Senator Inouye, and the \nexact same bill in the 105th Congress had three Democrat cosponsors, \nwith four voting for cloture.\n  Let me end with a final conclusion from the Rumsfeld report and our \nability to protect the threats for the future:\n\n       Therefore, we unanimously recommend that U.S. analyses, \n     practices and policies that depend on expectations of \n     extended warning of deployment be reviewed and, as \n     appropriate, revised to reflect the reality of an environment \n     in which there may be little or no warning.\n\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, has anyone propounded the unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be \n20 minutes for debate on the pending amendment, with the debate divided \nas follows: 10 minutes for Senator Levin; 5 minutes for Senator \nLandrieu; 5 minutes for Senator Cochran. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that following that debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on, or \nin relation to, the amendment, with no other amendments in order prior \nto the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment of Senator Landrieu that is \npending is a very simple and a very straightforward amendment, but it \nis a vital amendment. It will make a major difference in this bill, \nbecause if this amendment is adopted, this bill will contain two policy \nstatements. It now contains but one. The policy statement that it \ncurrently contains has to do with the deployment of a missile defense \nsystem. The policy statement, which the Landrieu amendment will add, is \nthat it is the policy of the United States to seek continued negotiated \nreductions in Russian nuclear forces.\n  This is a very significant policy statement, and I want to take just \na minute and explain why.\n  In my opening comments on this bill, I addressed what I consider to \nbe a number of flaws or omissions in this bill. I talked about the fact \nthat there is no reference here to ``operational effectiveness.'' One \ncan look at the word\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\n ``effective'' in this bill's language and argue, I think reasonably, \nthat operational effectiveness is included in that term \n``effectiveness.'' Nonetheless, I think the bill would be stronger if \nthat were clearer. That was one of the issues which was raised.\n  It is a very important question to our uniformed military and to the \nSecretary of Defense, because they want to be sure that before any \ndecision is made to deploy, that we have an operationally effective \nsystem, that it works. And those are not just casual words. \n``Operational effectiveness'' are words that have a very important \ntechnical meaning to our military.\n  I also pointed out in my opening remarks that there was no reference \nin here to cost. Now there is.\n  With the Cochran amendment that was adopted earlier this afternoon, \nwe now at least have an acknowledgment that the usual authorization and \nappropriation process is going to apply to national missile defense. \nThe authorizers and the appropriators naturally look at cost. So there \nis now, at least in this bill with the adoption of the Cochran \namendment, a way in which the cost issue will be addressed in the years \nto come.\n  Another factor which the uniformed military and our civilian \nleadership wanted to look at is the threat. I think it is clear to most \nof us that there is a threat that was not predicted to come this \nquickly but which is either here or will soon be here from states such \nas North Korea.\n  Finally--and this was the one which to me was the greatest sticking \npoint--is the omission in this bill, until Senator Landrieu's amendment \nwas introduced and hopefully will be adopted, of the acknowledgment of \nthe importance of continuing to negotiate reductions in Russian nuclear \nforces. Those reductions are critically important to our security. \nThose reductions have been carried out, and hopefully additional \nreductions will be carried out, because we have a treaty with Russia \nwhich has allowed for these reductions to be carried out in a way which \nis strategically stable.\n  That treaty, called the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, has been \ncritically important to nuclear arms reductions. Hopefully, there will \nbe further reductions negotiated. Hopefully, the Duma will ratify START \nII. But it is important that we be aware of the fact that arms \nreductions, nuclear arms reductions, are very important in terms of \nreducing proliferation threats and very important in terms of the \nterrorist threat.\n  If we act in such a way that leads Russia to stop the reduction of \nthe nuclear weapons on her soil, to stop the dismantling of the nuclear \nweapons on her soil, to stop negotiating further reductions in nuclear \nweapons, we are taking a very dangerous step in terms of our own \nsecurity.\n  That is why the fourth point which our uniformed military has pointed \nto as being important, in terms of considering national missile defense \ndeployment, is the effect of that deployment on nuclear arms \nreductions. Nobody is going to give Russia or any other country a veto \nover whether or not we deploy a national missile defense system. That \nissue has got to be resolved in terms of our own security. If it adds \nto our security, we should do it. If it diminishes our security, we \nshould not.\n  But whether or not it adds to our security is dependent upon a number \nof factors. And one of those factors is the effect on the nuclear \nweapons reduction program on Russian soil. This has been pointed out at \nthe highest level between President Clinton and President Yeltsin. In \ntheir Helsinki summit statement in March of 1997, they emphasized--and \nthese are their words-- ``the importance of further reductions in \nstrategic offensive arms'' and they recognized explicitly, in their \nwords, ``the significance of the ABM Treaty for those objectives.''\n  Secretary Cohen, has recognized and stated the importance of that \ntreaty between ourselves and Russia in terms of accomplishing these \nnuclear arms reduction objectives.\n  Sandy Berger, in a letter which he has addressed to us, has \nrecognized and stated the importance of that treaty between ourselves \nand Russia in terms of reducing nuclear arms and the threat of \nproliferation to this country.\n  In his letter he said:\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 257 because it \n     suggests that our decision on deploying this system should be \n     based solely on a determination that the system is \n     ``technologically possible.'' This unacceptably narrow \n     definition would ignore other critical factors that the \n     Administration believes must be addressed when it considers \n     the deployment question in 2000. . . .\n\n  And then he went on to say:\n\n       A decision regarding national missile defense deployment \n     must also be addressed within the context of the ABM Treaty \n     and our objectives for achieving future reductions in \n     strategic offensive arms through START II and [START] III. \n     The ABM Treaty remains a cornerstone of strategic \n     stability, and Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agree that \n     it is of fundamental significance to achieving the \n     elimination of thousands of strategic nuclear arms under \n     these treaties.\n\n  What this amendment before us does is simply acknowledge the policy \nof the United States to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian \nnuclear forces. That is all that it says. In that sense it is very \nstraightforward, very direct. But it also, to me at least, and I think \nto many other Members of this body, acknowledges that we have a number \nof policy goals that we should be achieving.\n  One is the deployment of an effective national missile defense system \nto meet a threat--I believe that is a legitimate policy goal that \nSenator Cochran's bill sets forth--a policy to deploy a cost-effective, \noperationally effective national missile defense to meet a threat. We \ndo not have that system yet. It is being developed as quickly as we \npossibly can.\n  Hopefully, someday we will have a cost-effective, operationally \neffective national missile defense system. And hopefully, we can take \nthat step after negotiating modifications with the Russians to that \ntreaty, so that we can proceed consistent with a cooperative \nrelationship with the Russians and not in a confrontational way. If we \ncannot do it cooperatively and with an amendment to that treaty, and if \nour security interests indicate that we should do it because we have \nsomething operationally effective and cost effective, and the threat is \nthere, then we should do it anyway.\n  But what the Landrieu language does is state a very important policy \nobjective that I hope all of us share: to seek continued negotiated \nreductions in Russian nuclear forces. It is that straightforward. It is \nthat important. I commend the Senator from Louisiana for framing an \namendment in a way which hopefully will attract broad bipartisan \nsupport but at the same time makes a very important addition to this \nbill by setting forth, if this is adopted, two important policies of \nthis Government.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank our ranking member, the Senator from Michigan, \nfor his good work in this area. He is a national leader and has been \noutspoken on this issue. His guidance and counsel have been very \nimportant as we have worked through this very important piece of \nlegislation. I thank him.\n  I also thank the Senator from Mississippi for his graciousness and \nbeing open to working out this bill--although simple, it is quite \nimportant and quite historic--and to make sure it is done in the right \nand appropriate way.\n  I am convinced, Mr. President, that if this amendment I have offered, \non behalf of myself, Senator Levin, and some of my colleagues here and \non the other side of the aisle, is adopted, it will enable us to vote \nin good faith and in good conscience for this bill, which I have said \nearlier I support but have some hesitation.\n  This amendment will make sure it is the policy that we have a \nnational missile defense system capable to deploy, as soon as \ntechnologically possible, an effective system and one that also states, \nwith this amendment, that while we are developing this we will continue \nto negotiate reductions in Russian nuclear forces. It is the policy, a \njoint policy. It makes this bill stronger and better. And it enables us \nto pass this bill that recognizes the threat is real, that the world \nhas changed significantly.\n  The record is replete, as I have mentioned earlier in my remarks, \nwith hostile neighbors to the United States, with the development of \nthese weapons that could, in fact, now threaten parts of our homeland--\nHawaii, for instance, which is why the distinguished Senators from \nHawaii are supporting this\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\nbill. And it is clear to many of us now that this threat is more real \nthan ever before, so the need for this bill is important.\n\n  I think this amendment helps to strengthen the bill. It most \ncertainly will enable several of us on this side of the aisle to vote \nfor this bill and to pass it with bipartisan support and, I believe, \nwith the administration's support.\n  I thank my distinguished ranking member. I thank the author and \nsponsor of this bill, and I yield back the remaining time I have.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to give consideration to this amendment \nwhich will make a good bill even better.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment of \nthe able Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) because I interpret that \nit refers to the policy of pursuing Russian ratification of the START \nII Treaty. Any proposed reduction below the START II level should, of \ncourse, be considered on its specific merits.\n  I commend Senator Landrieu for offering the amendment consistent with \nmy interpretation stated above.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I indicated earlier, I support the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana and thank \nher for her contribution to strengthening the legislation. Like the \nstatement of policy already contained in S. 257, this is a \nstraightforward statement of an important national security goal.\n  The high levels of strategic forces deployed during the cold war are \nno longer necessary in today's vastly changed strategic environment. \nAlready our two countries have reduced levels significantly through \nSTART I and will reduce them further under START II. Both policies \narticulated here, our determination to deploy a missile defense against \nlimited threats and our continued interest in further offensive \nreductions, are in our interests. Of course, inclusion of both in this \nbill does not imply that one is contingent upon the other, but that is \ncompletely consistent with what we have been saying all along--that \ndefensive and offensive reductions are not incompatible. I urge all \nSenators to support the amendment.\n  I also urge Senators, if they have other amendments, to let us know \nabout them. I am hoping that we can get an agreement that would \nidentify any other amendments and that we can have a time limit agreed \nupon with respect to those amendments. If there are no other \namendments, it would be our expectation that we could go to third \nreading within a short period of time. Senators communicating that to \nthe managers or their intentions to the managers would be appreciated \nvery much so we could go forward with the expeditious handling and \nconclusion of the bill.\n  I yield back whatever time remains, and I ask for the yeas and nays \non the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a brief 10 seconds. As I indicated earlier, \nI have been informed by the President's National Security Adviser that \nif this amendment is adopted, the recommendation to the President to \nveto this bill will be withdrawn. I think that is a very significant \ndevelopment and I think folks may want to consider that as part of the \noverall debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we understand that it is possible to \nreach an agreement on the identity of amendments that are yet to be \noffered to the bill. I will, on behalf of the leader, propound a \nunanimous consent request regarding the amendments that would be in \norder to the bill and a time agreement on each, in the hope that we can \ncomplete action on this bill tomorrow and have final passage. If we do \nget the agreement, we would then proceed to hear any further statements \nthat Senators might have on the bill tonight. Senator Ashcroft, I know, \nis here and available to speak on the bill, but there would be no \nfurther votes on amendments tonight.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be the only amendments remaining in order, that \nthey be subject to first- and second-degree amendments where \napplicable, and they must be relevant to the first-degree they propose \nto amend.\n  I further ask that all first-degree amendments be limited to 1 hour, \nequally divided in the usual form for debate, and any second-degree \namendments limited to 30 minutes in the usual form.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the listed \namendments, the bill be immediately advanced to third reading and \npassage occur, all without intervening action or debate, and that no \nmotions be in order other than motions to table.\n\n  The list is as follows: a Bingaman amendment on operational success \nof system; Conrad amendment, space-based missile defense; Dorgan \namendment on NMD deployment; a second Dorgan amendment on NMD \ndeployment; Harkin amendment on study on relevant risks, and a second \namendment on condition on relevant; Kerry amendment, relevant; a Levin \namendment, relevant; a Robb amendment, relevant; and a Wellstone \namendment, relevant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have no objection to that, and I believe \nthat all of the Senators on this side of the aisle now are included. I \nwanted to make sure that they all understand there is, in addition to \nthis list, a time agreement here, as the Senator from Mississippi has \nindicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in light of this agreement limiting \namendments, there will be no further votes this evening, and I thank \nall colleagues for their cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Stephanie \nSharp of my staff be granted the privilege of the floor during the \npendency of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n257, the\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999. I commend the two principal \nsponsors of the bill, Senator Cochran and Senator Inouye, for their \ncommitment to this legislation and for their dedication to the national \nsecurity of our country.\n  The fact that we are having a debate on this bill at all, in the \nsense of trying to overcome opposition to this legislation, is somewhat \ntroubling to me. The foreign missile threat has come to our very door \nin the last 6 years, and yet the administration and many of my \nDemocratic colleagues continue to oppose this legislation, which simply \nsays we will defend the American people as soon as we can.\n  A recent poll shows that more than 85 percent of Americans favor the \ndeployment of a missile defense system and that three out of every four \nAmericans were surprised to learn that the United States cannot destroy \nan incoming ballistic missile. The American people would be even more \nsurprised to learn that they remain defenseless today, not so much due \nto the cost or technological hurdles of missile defense as to a lack of \npolitical leadership here in Washington.\n  The administration's record on missile defense has been plagued with \nthe same inconsistency and lack of foresight that is characteristic of \nour more general foreign policy over the last 6 years. In each of the \ncritical areas that we are facing today in deploying a missile defense \nsystem--modifications of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, program \nmanagement and budgeting, and the assessment of the missile threat--the \nadministration is having to reverse astoundingly shortsighted policies \nadopted only a few years ago.\n  Secretary Albright has encountered firm resistance from Russia in \nmodifying the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, but Russia eagerly \ndiscussed possible modifications to the treaty in the Ross-Mamedov \ntalks in 1992. To Russia's great surprise, one of the first things \nPresident Clinton did after coming to office was suspend this dialogue \non modifying the ABM Treaty. Now, 6 years later, with a greatly altered \ndiplomatic landscape, the window of opportunity for active Russian \ncooperation on modifying the treaty may be permanently closed. \nRegardless of one's views on the ABM Treaty, squandering opportunities \nsuch as the Ross-Mamedov dialogue is serious negligence.\n  The lack of foresight in program management and budgeting for missile \ndefense also has undermined the development and deployment of an \neffective system. When President Clinton entered office in 1993, \npromising missile defense initiatives fostered under the Bush \nadministration were limited or curtailed. Ambassador Hank Cooper, \nPresident Bush's Director of the Strategic Defense Initiative \nOrganization, had a procurement program in place in 1992 for the first \nsite of a ground-based missile defense system which potentially could \nhave been deployed by the year 2000. This effort was suspended, and the \nbudget for the national missile defense system was slashed by an \nastounding 71 percent in the first year of the Clinton administration.\n  Here is a chart which shows our commitment to missile defense. During \nthe Reagan and Bush years, we saw a consistent and strong commitment to \nmissile defense. In the years when the budgeting was under the control \nof this administration, we saw an astounding drop, a 71-percent drop in \nthe funding to develop a national missile defense system.\n  Now, after 4 years of undermining the National Missile Defense \nProgram, the administration is rushing to increase the funding levels \nbecause the threat can no longer be ignored or denied.\n  The administration has used faulty intelligence estimates of the \nforeign missile threat to justify a missile defense policy of delay and \nobfuscation. Based in part on a National Intelligence Estimate in 1995 \nthat said the Continental United States would not face a new ballistic \nmissile threat until 2010, the President vetoed the FY 1996 defense \nauthorization bill because of language which called for the deployment \nof a missile defense system by the year 2003.\n  Now, 3 years after the President's veto, with North Korea and Iran \ndeveloping ballistic missiles to strike the United States, with China \nmodernizing its nuclear weapons, possibly with U.S. technology, and \nwith the threat of accidental missile launch from Russia rising, 2003 \nis, if anything, too late to deploy a national missile defense system.\n  The administration has relied on faulty intelligence to our \ncollective peril. North Korea's test of the Taepo Dong 1 in August of \n1998 was the last nail in the coffin of the National Intelligence \nEstimate and a strong indictment of the administration's complacency in \npreparing for an imminent foreign missile threat. But the Taepo Dong \ntest was a result of proliferation trends that have been detectable and \ndiscernible for over a decade.\n  We could see the threat coming as proliferation accelerated in the \n1980s. We saw the threat arrive when the largest single loss of life of \nU.S. soldiers in the Gulf War occurred when an Iraqi ballistic missile \nkilled 28 of our soldiers and wounded 89 more on February 25, 1991.\n  The threat was apparent by 1991, at the latest, and that is why the \nSenate passed the National Missile Defense Act that year as part of the \nDefense Authorization bill. The National Missile Defense Act was a \nstrong piece of legislation calling for modifications to the \nAntiballistic Missile Treaty and calling for deployment of an effective \nmissile defense system by a date certain, that date to be 1996.\n  Yet now, 8 years after passage of the National Missile Defense Act, 8 \nyears in which two terrorist governments, Iran and North Korea, have \ncome to the threshold of acquiring ICBM capability, this administration \nand many of my Democratic colleagues continue to oppose legislation \nwhich simply states that it is United States policy to defend the \nAmerican people as soon as we can.\n  Winston Churchill once said, ``Occasionally you must take the enemy \ninto consideration.'' This administration would be well advised to heed \nMr. Churchill's words and to grasp the seriousness of the multiple \nmissile threats posed to the United States.\n  At least 25 countries have or are pursuing weapons of mass \ndestruction programs that could threaten not only their neighbors but \nthe stability of this globe, and nearly all of those countries also \nhave ballistic missiles of one kind or another. The technology is out \nthere and is being proliferated at an alarming rate.\n  In spite of these rising missile threats to the United States, the \nadministration continues to speak of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty \nas the cornerstone of strategic stability. Although the legal status of \nthe treaty is in doubt after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the \naccord continues to guide administration policies that have undermined \nthe entire missile defense effort.\n  As William Graham, former science adviser to President Reagan, stated \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       Not only has the ABM Treaty prohibited the deployment of \n     national missile defenses, it has led to the prohibition of \n     funding for the research and development on systems which \n     might, if deployed, conflict with the ABM Treaty. Moreover, \n     it has made Defense Department program managers unwilling \n     even to propose missile defense systems and programs that \n     might. . .be viewed as conflicting with the largely ambiguous \n     details of the ABM Treaty. . . .\n\n  Mr. Graham's point is simply this: that the ABM Treaty has kept \npeople in the administration from even exploring alternatives that \nmight well defend the people of this country.\n  This administration's commitment to the ABM Treaty has precluded our \nbest space-based options for national missile defense and limited the \nmore advanced capabilities of our theater missile defense programs.\n  A host of critical missile defense initiatives under the Bush \nadministration were derailed or downsized in 1993. Brilliant Eyes, now \nknown as SBIRS Low, a satellite program to provide essential tracking \ncapabilities for national missile defense, has seen its deployment \ndelayed by as much as a decade.\n  Brilliant Pebbles, a system of hit-to-kill vehicles in low Earth \norbit and still potentially the best national missile defense option, \nwas canceled as a result of this administration's policies.\n  A space-based national missile defense system could best defend the \nAmerican people. So why isn't it being pursued? Even President \nClinton's current Director of the Ballistic Missile\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\nDefense Organization, General Lester Lyles, stated before the Armed \nServices Committee last month:\n\n       I think all of us recognize that the optimum way to do \n     missile defense, particularly in a robust manner in the \n     future, is from space.\n\n  This is President Clinton's Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense \nOrganization.\n  Space-based national missile defense systems have been shelved for \none simple reason: this administration's commitment to the outdated and \ndangerous Antiballistic Missile Treaty.\n  If the administration is so concerned about the cost of missile \ndefense, why is it expending precious missile defense dollars on the \nleast effective systems, rather than the most effective ones \nacknowledged by the administration's own Director of the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Organization?\n  If the administration is so concerned about deploying a \ntechnologically sound missile defense system, why is a ground-based \nsystem that has the highest technological challenges the \nadministration's only near-term missile defense initiative? As \nAmbassador Cooper testified before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee in September 1996, ground-based systems are the most \nexpensive, least effective defense that will take the longest to build. \nThe administration has cut the national missile defense budget and \ndiverted those scarce funds into the least effective national missile \ndefense programs.\n  All of this, because the administration refuses to relinquish its \ntight grip on the ABM Treaty.\n  Finally, the ABM Treaty is undermining the robustness of theater \nmissile defense programs. For example, limiting the use of additional \noff-site radars for theater missile defense programs out of concerns \nfor the ABM Treaty increases the cost of missile defense exponentially. \nBill Graham, former science adviser to Presidents Reagan and Bush, \nstates:\n\n       . . .the area that a surface-based interceptor system can \n     defend using only its. . .radar is one-tenth the area that \n     the same interceptor can defend using space-based sensing. \n     Therefore, to defend the same area without space-based \n     sensing, 10 times as many missile/radar systems would have to \n     be deployed at a cost that would be approximately 10 times as \n     much. . ..\n\n  So this persistent, dogged determination to honor an outdated treaty, \nthe ABM Treaty, increases the cost of our theater missile defense \nsystems ten-fold, just to cover the same territory.\n  In almost every theater missile defense program we have, serious \nconstraints have been imposed to try to limit the ICBM intercept \ncapability of regional theater missile defense systems. Software and \nradar of the Navy Aegis cruisers have been constrained to limit their \nability to track ballistic missiles. Software for THAAD has been \nconstrained to limit its intercept capability. The ballistic missile \nintercept capability of the Patriot system was restrained until the \nurgency of the gulf war.\n  Ambassador Cooper stated before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee:\n\n       . . .the 28 military personnel killed when an Iraqi Scud \n     hit their barracks during the Gulf War might have been spared \n     if Patriot had not been dumbed-down and delayed because of \n     ABM Treaty concerns.\n\n  It seems like the loss of life and the injury to dozens and dozens of \nothers in that particular incident should have sounded a wakeup call \nsufficiently urgent to at least startle this administration into \npursuing a course of action which would not be guided by an unwarranted \ncommitment to the ABM Treaty.\n  In spite of the restrictions the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \nimposes on U.S. missile defense efforts, the administration continues \nto view the accord as the cornerstone of strategic stability and \nessential for future arms control efforts. Although the past 27 years \nhave demonstrated that the treaty probably accelerated the arms race \nrather than curtailed it, this administration remains committed to the \nidea that reductions in nuclear weapons cannot occur unless the \nAmerican people are completely vulnerable to missile attack.\n  I want to say that again. This administration remains committed to \nthe idea that reductions in nuclear weapons cannot occur unless the \nAmerican people are completely vulnerable to missile attack. My view is \nthat we deter aggression through strength, not through increasing our \nown vulnerability. To continue to risk American lives for thoroughly \ninvalidated arms control policies is a serious abnegation of our duty \nto protect and defend the United States.\n  Administration officials seem mortified by the prospect that Russia \nwill reject the START II treaty if the United States builds an \neffective missile defense. The administration seems to have forgotten \nhowever that the size of Russia's nuclear stockpile will continue to \ndecline with or without another arms control agreement. The size of \nRussia's nuclear arsenal is in freefall thanks in large part to one \nAmerican President who returned America to the tried and true principle \nthat strength deters aggression.\n  Ronald Reagan knew that ``Nations do not mistrust each other because \nthey are armed; they are armed because they mistrust each other.'' He \nconfronted and deterred aggression, and although this administration \nwould like the forget it, Ronald Reagan used ballistic missile defense \nto hasten the demise of the Soviet Union.\n  This particular graph shows the level of nuclear warheads maintained \nby the United States and the Soviet Union, later Russia, over the last \nseveral decades. The ABM Treaty was negotiated in 1972, and shortly \nafter the ABM Treaty came into force, we see the levels of Soviet \nnuclear warheads begin to increase dramatically. This graph illustrates \nthat America's weaknesses under the ABM Treaty was one factor behind \nthe Soviet arms buildup, while Reagan's resolve to confront Soviet \naggression, in part through the Strategic Defense Initiative--hastened \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union. President Reagan used missile defense \nto deter Soviet aggression, and the dissolution of the Soviet empire \nled to the reductions in arms that always proved elusive to advocates \nof appeasement.\n  Reagan's success in confronting and undermining Soviet tyranny was \none of the greatest contributions to freedom in modern history. As part \nof that broader policy, Reagan's commitment to missile defense is at \nonce a telling indictment on the failed policies of the more recent \npast and a shining example of the courage needed to chart a course for \nthe revitalized defense of the American people.\n  The legislation we are considering today simply says this: We will \ndefend the American people against missile attack as soon as possible. \nHow could there be opposition to this bill when every conflict we have \nfought in the past has proven that weakness and vulnerability invite \naggression? We do not get a reduction in our vulnerability by remaining \nvulnerable. We get a reduction in our vulnerability by showing \nstrength.\n  How could there be opposition to this bill when missiles from North \nKorea and Iran pose an imminent threat to the United States? How can \nthere be opposition to this bill when China points the majority of its \nnuclear weapons at the United States and has implicitly threatened Los \nAngeles if American forces defend Taiwan?\n\n  Mr. President, the sad truth is that the United States is completely \ndefenseless against a ballistic missile strike. George Washington once \nsaid, ``If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it. . \n.'' Why are North Korea and Iran pursuing advanced missile technology \nat breakneck speed? These terrorist governments are seeking the tools \nof aggression because they know that we cannot repel their attacks.\n  Our ambivalence and complacency in providing an effective missile \ndefense for American citizens and for American interests is an \nunconscionable act of negligence. We should not shrink from or shirk \nthe burden of eternal vigilance in the defense of freedom because the \ncost of missile defense is high or the technology is complicated or \nthere will be difficulties to overcome in the development of a system.\n  As Franklin Roosevelt said in September 1941, ``Let us not ask \nourselves whether the Americas should begin to defend themselves after \nthe first attack, or the fifth attack, or the tenth attack, or the \ntwentieth attack. The time for active defense is now.''\n  Mr. President, those words ring as true today as they did before \nWorld War II and reflect the commitment of the American people to \nsafeguard the blessings of liberty. The defeatist policies which would \nleave America vulnerable to nuclear, chemical or biological\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\nwarheads have been followed for too long, to the great detriment of our \ncountry. We must return to the sound policies of an active defense \nsystem before a missile strike on U.S. soil eclipses the catastrophe of \nPearl Harbor. We do not have another 6 years to waste, Mr. President. I \napplaud Senator Cochran and Senator Inouye for their leadership on \nballistic missile defense and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \npass this legislation.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I stand today in support of a very simple \nyet essential piece of legislation, the National Missile Defense Act of \n1999. The bill states:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as \n     is technologically possible an effective National Missile \n     Defense system capable of defending the territory of the \n     United States against limited ballistic missile attack, \n     whether that attack is accidental, unauthorized, or \n     deliberate.\n\nThat is all the language does. Mr. President, this bill may concern \nrocket science but it does not take a rocket scientist to realize the \ninherent necessity of this legislation for the safety of this country.\n  Currently, our nation is defenseless against the threat of ballistic \nmissile attack. Some have shrugged their shoulders and said, ``So what, \nAmerica won the cold war without a missile defense. The Soviet Union \nnever attacked us and no one else will either.'' Yet the fact that the \nUnited States won the cold war is the very reason that America faces a \nnew and very real missile threat today.\n  The world is not as simple in 1999 as it was during the cold war. \nToday, a much less stable Russia still maintains an awesome nuclear \narsenal. Communist China is developing into a superpower with interests \nwhich are frequently adverse to our own. That development includes a \nforce of ballistic missiles capable of striking the continental United \nStates. And as we have seen in recent weeks, China is persistent in its \nefforts to acquire the technology necessary to make its missiles more \naccurate and deadly.\n  Equally disturbing, today's threat includes the use of ballistic \nmissiles by rogue nations and terrorist groups. The disintegration of \nthe Soviet Union has exacerbated the proliferation of missile \ntechnology and lethal payloads. Iran and North Korea are developing and \ntesting longer range missiles. Both countries are potential adversaries \nin regions vital to the national interest of the United States. Both \ncountries have ties to international terrorist groups. With \nproliferation rampant, these two countries will surely not be the last \nto acquire long range missile technology. The failure to deploy an \neffective national missile defense system could subject this nation to \ndiplomatic blackmail from any rogue state or terrorist group that can \npurchase or steal ballistic missile technology.\n  Some have argued, as does the administration, that this bill will \ndisrupt ongoing negotiations with Russia concerning the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty. Mr. President, if that is the case, then so be it. The \nABM Treaty was signed with the Soviet Union. That state no longer \nexists and as such the treaty should be declared void. A number of \nconstitutional scholars have adopted this view. Nevertheless, if it is \nthe policy of this administration to honor the treaty, that policy \nshould not be permitted to impede the deployment of a missile defense \nsystem. The administration can negotiate enough flexibility into the \ntreaty to permit a viable national missile defense.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are considering states that this nation \nwill deploy a system when it is technologically feasible. That \ntechnology is being developed as we speak and is nearly at hand. \nHowever, I would urge my colleagues in the months and years ahead to \ncontinue investment in missile defense support technology. It is an \nimportant yet often overlooked investment. Under funding support \ntechnology today will jeopardize the future effectiveness of any \nmissile defense system. Rapid changes in technology and potential \ndevelopment of missile defense countermeasures by our adversaries \nrequire that this nation maintain its technological superiority. That \nsuperiority does not come without a price. However the cost of losing \nour technological edge is one I hope this body never has to consider.\n  Mr. President, some well intentioned opponents of this bill have \nstated that treaties and superior intelligence gathering will protect \nus from a future ballistic missile attack. This is nothing more than a \ngamble with the lives of the American people. Treaties have been broken \nthroughout history. Intelligence is effective only when properly \ninterpreted and disseminated. Ask the men of the U.S.S. Arizona at the \nbottom of Pearl Harbor. Intelligence collection did them little good. \nMr. President, I am not willing to gamble with the lives of the \nAmerican people. I continue to strongly support the National Missile \nDefense Act of 1999 and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for S. \n257, the National Missile Defense Act currently pending before the \nSenate. I do so with the firm belief that passage of this legislation \nwill help keep the American people safe. Given the seriousness of the \nthreat posed by ballistic missiles, it is our duty to act to confront \nthis threat through the development of a national missile defense \nsystem.\n  I believe some of the controversy surrounding this piece of \nlegislation comes from the misperception of what national missile \ndefense really is. Mr. President, we are not proposing to build a star \nwars-style system. We are not proposing to build a system designed to \ncounter a massive nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. That plan was \nunworkable in the 1980s and is unnecessary today. Instead, the missile \ndefense system we are talking about today is a limited system, designed \nto protect the United States from rogue-state ballistic missile \nlaunches and accidental launches--precisely the kind of threats that \nwill not be countered by our traditional reliance on deterrence.\n  The truth is, Mr. President, we do not currently possess the ability \nto protect the American people from these threats. But we should. The \nlegislation we are debating today would take the first step toward \nprotecting the United States by declaring it to be the official policy \nof the United States to deploy a national missile defense system. The \nbill before us does not identify a particular system for deployment It \ndoes not authorize or appropriate a single dollar. These are decisions \nthat will be left up to this and future Congresses. Instead, the \nNational Missile Defense Act simply states that the United States \nshould deploy a missile defense system to protect the American people.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the only situation worse than not having an \nadequate missile defense system to protect the American people, is \ndeploying a system that has not been proven feasible. I am pleased with \nthe recent announcement by the Clinton administration that they plan to \nincrease spending on missile defense research by $6 billion over the \nnext five years. I applaud the administration's decision to fund \nmissile defense in the fiscal year 2000 Defense budget so that a \ndecision to deploy a missile defense in 2005 could be made as early as \nJune of next year. We should all take note of the outstanding \nscientific and engineering efforts which have been ongoing for years in \nthe Defense Department to get us to this point. This administration \ndeserves credit for vigorously attacking the very daunting set of \nscientific and engineering challenges by which a bullet can strike \nanother bullet. At the same time, development of a system will only \ncome through further research and development and a rigorous testing \nregime.\n  Many opponents of this legislation have asked why should we take this \nstep now? It's true, the threat of ballistic missiles is not a new one. \nThe American people have lived for decades under this threat. In fact, \nduring the cold war, the Soviet Union had thousands of nuclear-tipped \nballistic missiles pointed, ready to shoot at American cities. What has \nchanged is the source of the ballistic missile threat. During the cold \nwar, and even today, we used the power of deterrence to protect \nourselves. Nations like Russia and China know that an attack on America \nwould be met with an immediate and overwhelming response by United \nStates forces. They were and still are deterred by a calculation of \ntheir own self-interest. However, the underlying assumption of \ndeterrence is rational behavior by the other side. None of the\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\nemerging threats--whether they be terrorist states or rouge or \ndesperate individuals--can be counted on to respond rationally to the \nthreat of retaliation.\n\n  In the past, I have voted against cloture on the motion to proceed to \nthis bill. However, two distinct events over the last few months have \nhighlighted the changed nature of the threat and have led me to support \nthis legislation. First, the release of the Rumsfeld Commission Report \nlast July stated that the newer ballistic missile threats are \ndeveloping from countries like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. The report \nwent on to state that these nations could be able to acquire the \ncapability to inflict major destruction on the United States within \nabout 5 years of a decision to acquire ballistic missiles. Furthermore, \nthe Rumsfeld Report warmed that these emerging threats had more mature \ncapabilities than previous assessments has thought possible.\n  Then, almost on cue, North Korea tested the Taepo Dong I missile on \nAugust 31, 1998. The details of this test have been widely reported in \nthe media. But the real lesson of this missile test was that our \nintelligence community was surprised by the North Koreans' ability to \nlaunch a three-stage missile. We saw that North Korea may have the \nability to hit parts of the United States with a missile with a small \npayload. We also know that the North Koreans continue to work on the \nTaepo Dong II; an intercontinental missile with the capability of \nreaching the United States mainland. In addition, North Korea's nuclear \ncapability and nuclear ambitions turn these missile developments into a \nclear strategic warning.\n  Mr. President, aside from demonstrating the validity of the \nconclusions of the Rumsfeld Report, the North Korean missile test put a \nface on the emerging ballistic missile threat. There may not be a more \nunpredictable regime on earth than that of Kim Jong II. A government \nwhich continues to pour resources into weapons of mass destruction \nwhile its people undergo a famine is beyond our understanding. But I \nhave no doubt of North Korea's willingness to use ballistic missiles--\nin an all-out desperate act of terror--against United States cities. \nTraditional threats of massive retaliation are unlikely to deter a man \nas unstable as Kim Jong II. They will not likely deter the Iranian or \nLibyan governments or other future rogue states. Instead, we must \nprotect our nation through a limited missile defense. Time remains for \nus to counter this threat. But we must act now.\n  Mr. President, opponents of this legislation have valid concerns \nabout how national missile defense will affect our relationship with \nRussia. I share these concerns. Our long-term global interests are best \nsecured by maintaining a cooperative relationship with Russia. While a \nwide variety of Russian political leaders have expressed their \nopposition to United States national missile defense, I do not believe \nRussian opposition is insurmountable.\n  Just as our allies like Britain and France realize United States \nnational missile defense is not directed against them, the Russians can \nbe convinced the threats we seek to counter through missile defense \ncome from unauthorized and rouge-nation launches. Furthermore, these \nare threats--given their proximity to countries like Iraq, Iran, and \nNorth Kora--Russia must also confront. Although Russia has deployed an \nABM system around Moscow, there is nothing particular about Russia that \nwill make it impervious to these threats. Mr. President, in their \nvulnerability I see a chance to engage Russia; to work cooperatively to \nconfront the mutual threat of ballistic missile proliferation. By \njointly developing national missile defense with Russia, we will make \nour citizens safer and improve our bilateral relationship. Similarly, \nthe problems presented by the ABM Treaty may in fact present \nopportunities. There is no reason why we can't work with Russia to \nadapt the ABM Treaty to reflect the changes that have occurred in the \nworld since the treaty was signed in 1972. At that time, we could not \nanticipate the proliferation of ballistic missile technology we face \ntoday. By changing the treaty to allow each side to develop a limited \nmissile defense system to protect from unauthorized or rogue launches, \nwe can address the threat, maintain the treaty, and not upset the \nstrategic balance ABM sought to create.\n\n  Mr. President, I see further opportunity to reduce the threat of \nballistic missiles and make significant strides in our relationship \nwith Russia. In the past, and again today, I call on the President to \nseize this opportunity to make a bold gesture to reduce the danger \nposed by United States and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. More than \n6 years after the end of the cold war, both the United States and \nRussia maintain thousands of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert. My \nfear, Mr. President, is our maintenance of more weapons than we need to \ndefend our interests is prompting Russia to keep more weapons than she \nis able to control.\n  I have proposed that the President, acting in his capacity as \nCommander in Chief, order the immediate elimination of U.S. strategic \nnuclear forces in excess of proposed START III levels. Such a bold \ngesture would give the Russians the security to act reciprocally. \nRussia not only wants to follow our lead in such reductions, it must. \nRussia's own Defense Minister recently said, publicly, that Russia is \nthinking of its long-term nuclear arsenal in terms of hundreds, not \nthousands. To help Russia accomplish these reductions, Congress must be \nprepared to provide funding through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program. We should spend whatever is necessary to help Russia \ndismantle and secure its nuclear arsenal. The best form of missile \ndefense is helping Russia destroy its missiles.\n  Mr. President, my support for the bill before you comes from my \nbelief that its passage will make Americans safer. The time to prepare \nfor the emerging threat of ballistic missiles is today. The legislation \nbefore us sets us on the path to confront these threats in a real and \nmanageable way. I strongly encourage my colleagues support for this \nlegislation and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to enhance Federal enforcement of hate crimes, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the hate crimes prevention act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nSpector, Senator Wyden, Senator Schumer, and Senator Smith in \nintroducing the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999. This bill has the \nsupport of the Department of Justice, constitutional scholars, law \nenforcement officials, and many organizations with a long and \ndistinguished history of involvement in combating hate crimes, \nincluding the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Anti-\nDefamation League, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Gay and \nLesbian Task Force, the National Organization for Women Legal Defense \nand Education Fund, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence \nand The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Rights Task Force.\n  Congress has a responsibility to act this year to deal with the \nfestering problem of hate crimes. The silence of Congress on this basic \nissue has been deafening, and it is unacceptable. We must stop acting \nlike we don't care--that somehow this fundamental issue is just a state \nproblem. It isn't. It's a national problem, and it's an outrage that \nCongress has been A.W.O.L.\n  Few crimes tear more deeply at the fabric of our society than hate \ncrimes. These despicable acts injure the victim, the community, and the \nnation itself. The brutal murders in Texas, Wyoming, and most recently \nin Alabama have shocked the conscience of the nation. Sadly, these \nthree crimes are only the tip of the hate crimes iceberg. We need to do \nmore--much more--to combat them.\n  I'm convinced that if Congress acted today, and President Clinton \nsigned our bill tomorrow, we'd have fewer hate crimes in all the days \nthat follow.\n  Current federal laws are clearly inadequate. It's an embarrassment \nthat we haven't already acted to close these glaring gaps in present \nlaw. For too long, the federal government has been forced to fight hate \ncrimes with one hand tied behind its back.\n  Our bill does not undermine the role of the states in investigating \nand prosecuting hate crimes. States will continue to take the lead. But \nthe full power of federal law should also be available to investigate, \nprosecute, and punish these crimes.\n  The Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999 addresses two serious \ndeficiencies in the principal federal hate crimes statutes, 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 245, which applies to hate crimes committed on the basis of race, \ncolor, religion, or national origin.\n  First, the statute requires the government to prove that the \ndefendant committed an offense not only because of the victim's race, \ncolor, religion, or national origin, but also because of the victim's \nparticipation in one of six narrowly defined ``federally protected \nactivities'' enumerated in the statute. These activities are: (A) \nenrolling in or attending a public school or public college; (B) \nparticipating in or enjoying a service, program, facility or activity \nprovided or administered by any state or local government; (C) applying \nfor or enjoying employment; (D) serving in a state court as a grand or \npetit juror; (E) traveling in or using a facility of interstate \ncommerce; and (F) enjoying the goods or services of certain places of \npublic accommodation.\n  Second, the statute provides no coverage for hate crimes based on the \nvictim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Together, these \nlimitations prevent the federal government from working with state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies in the investigation and prosecution of \nmany of the most vicious hate crimes.\n  Our legislation amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245 to address each of these \nlimitations. In cases involving racial, religious, or ethnic violence, \nthe bill prohibits the intentional infliction of bodily injury without \nregard to the victim's participation in one of the six ``federally \nprotected activities''. In cases involving hate crimes based on the \nvictim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability, the bill prohibits \nthe intentional infliction of bodily injury whenever the act has a \nnexus, as defined in the bill, to interstate commerce. These provisions \nwill permit the federal government to work in partnership with state \nand local officials in the investigation and prosecution of hate \ncrimes. I urge the Senate to act quickly on this important legislation, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues to bring it to a vote. \nI ask unanimous consent that the bill and a more detailed description \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 618\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hate Crimes Prevention Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, national origin, religion, sexual \n     orientation, gender, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem;\n       (2) such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive;\n       (3) existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem;\n       (4) such violence affects interstate commerce in many ways, \n     including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n\n[[Page S2731]]\n\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment or participating in other commercial activity;\n       (5) perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence;\n       (6) instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used to \n     facilitate the commission of such violence;\n       (7) such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce;\n       (8) violence motivated by bias that is a relic of slavery \n     can constitute badges and incidents of slavery;\n       (9) although many State and local authorities are now and \n     will continue to be responsible for prosecuting the \n     overwhelming majority of violent crimes in the United States, \n     including violent crimes motivated by bias, Federal \n     jurisdiction over certain violent crimes motivated by bias is \n     necessary to supplement State and local jurisdiction and \n     ensure that justice is achieved in each case;\n       (10) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes; and\n       (11) the problem of hate crime is sufficiently serious, \n     widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal \n     assistance to States and local jurisdictions.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN ACTS OF VIOLENCE.\n\n       Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections \n     (d) and (e), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n       ``(c)(1) Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, \n     willfully causes bodily injury to any person or, through the \n     use of fire, a firearm, or an explosive device, attempts to \n     cause bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any \n     person--\n       ``(A) shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years, or fined \n     in accordance with this title, or both; and\n       ``(B) shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for \n     life, or fined in accordance with this title, or both if--\n       ``(i) death results from the acts committed in violation of \n     this paragraph; or\n       ``(ii) the acts omitted in violation of this paragraph \n     include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual \n     abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an \n     attempt to kill.\n       ``(2)(A) Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, \n     in any circumstance described in subparagraph (B), willfully \n     causes bodily injury to any person or, through the use of \n     fire, a firearm, or an explosive device, attempts to cause \n     bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or \n     perceived religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability \n     of any person--\n       ``(i) shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years, or fined \n     in accordance with this title, or both; and\n       ``(ii) shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for \n     life, or fined in accordance with this title, or both, if--\n       ``(I) death results from the acts committed in violation of \n     this paragraph; or\n       ``(II) the acts committed in violation of this paragraph \n     include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual \n     abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an \n     attempt to kill.\n       ``(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the circumstances \n     described in this subparagraph are that--\n       ``(i) in connection with the offense, the defendant or the \n     victim travels in interstate or foreign commerce, uses a \n     facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign \n     commerce, or engages in any activity affecting interstate or \n     foreign commerce; or\n       ``(ii) the offense is in or affects interstate or foreign \n     commerce.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. DUTIES OF FEDERAL SENTENCING COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Amendment of Federal Sentencing Guidelines.--Pursuant \n     to its authority under section 994 of title 28, United States \n     Code, the United States Sentencing Commission shall study the \n     issue of adult recruitment of juveniles to commit hate crimes \n     and shall, if appropriate, amend the Federal sentencing \n     guidelines to provide sentencing enhancements (in addition to \n     the sentencing enhancement provided for the use of a minor \n     during the commission of an offense) for adult defendants who \n     recruit juveniles to assist in the commission of hate crimes.\n       (b) Consistency With Other Guidelines.--In carrying out \n     this section, the United States Sentencing Commission shall--\n       (1) ensure that there is reasonable consistency with other \n     Federal sentencing guidelines; and\n       (2) avoid duplicative punishments for substantially the \n     same offense.\n\n     SEC. 6. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Authority to Make Grants.--The Office of Justice \n     Programs of the Department of Justice shall make grants, in \n     accordance with such regulations as the Attorney General may \n     prescribe, to State and local programs designed to combat \n     hate crimes committed by juveniles, including programs to \n     train local law enforcement officers in investigating, \n     prosecuting, and preventing hate crimes.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO ASSIST \n                   STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department \n     of the Treasury and the Department of Justice, including the \n     Community Relations Service, for fiscal years 2000, 2001 and \n     2002 such sums as are necessary to increase the number of \n     personnel to prevent and respond to alleged violations of \n     section 245 of title 18, United States Code (as amended by \n     this Act).\n\n     SEC. 8. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of the provisions of such to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Summary of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999\n\n       The Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999 creates a three-\n     tiered system for the federal prosecution of hate crimes \n     under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245, as follows:\n       1. The bill leaves 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245(b)(2) unchanged. That \n     provision prohibits the intentional interference, or \n     attempted interference, with a person's participation in one \n     of six specifically enumerated ``federally protected \n     activities'' on the basis of the person's race, color, \n     religion, or national origin. These activities are: (A) \n     enrolling in or attending a public school or public college; \n     (B) participating in or enjoying a service, program, facility \n     or activity provided or administered by any state or local \n     government; (C) applying for or enjoying employment; (D) \n     serving in a state court as a grand or petit juror; (E) \n     traveling in or using a facility of interstate commerce; and \n     (F) enjoying the goods or services of certain places of \n     public accommodation.\n       2. The bill adds a new provision, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245(c)(1), \n     which prohibits the intentional infliction of bodily injury \n     on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin. \n     This new provision does not require a showing that the \n     defendant committed the offense because of the victim's \n     participation in a federally protected activity. However, an \n     offense under the new 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245(c)(1) will be \n     prosecuted as a felony only, and a showing of bodily injury \n     or death or of an attempt to cause bodily injury or death \n     through the use of fire, a firearm, or an explosive device is \n     required. Other attempts will not constitute offenses under \n     this section.\n       3. The bill adds another new provision, 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 245(c)(2), which prohibits the intentional infliction of \n     bodily injury or death (or an attempt to inflict bodily \n     injury or death) through the use of fire, a firearm, or an \n     explosive device on the basis of religion, gender, sexual \n     orientation, or disability. Like 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245(c)(1), \n     this provision authorizes the prosecution of felonies only, \n     and excludes most attempts, while omitting the ``federally \n     protected activity'' requirement. Unlike 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 245(c)(1), this provision requires proof of a Commerce \n     Clause nexus as an element of the offense.\n       4. For prosecutions under both of the new provisions, a \n     certification by the Attorney General or other senior Justice \n     Department official that ``a prosecution by the United States \n     is in the public interest and necessary to secure substantial \n     justice.''\n\n\n                             FEDERALIZATION\n\n       It is expected that the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999 \n     will result in only a modest increase in the number of hate \n     crimes prosecutions brought by the federal government. The \n     intent is to ensure that the federal government will limit \n     its prosecutions of hate crimes to cases that implicate the \n     greatest federal interest and present a clear need for \n     federal intervention. The Act is not intended, for example, \n     to federalize all rapes or all acts of domestic violence.\n       The bill requires a nexus to interstate commerce for hate \n     crimes based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability. \n     This requirement, which the government must prove beyond a \n     reasonable doubt as an element of the offense, will limit \n     federal jurisdiction in these categories to cases that \n     involve clear federal interests.\n       The bill excludes misdemeanors and limits federal hate \n     crimes based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability to \n     those involving bodily injury or death (and a limited set of \n     attempts to cause bodily injury or death). These limitations \n     will limit federal cases to truly serious offenses.\n       18 U.S.C. Sec. 245 already requires a written certification \n     by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the \n     Associate Attorney General, or a specially designated \n     Assistant Attorney General that ``a prosecution by the United \n     States is in the public interest and necessary to secure \n     substantial justice.'' This requirement will apply to the new \n     crimes in the Act.\n\n\n      existing federal law and the need for expanded jurisdiction\n\n     1. The ``Federally Protected Activity'' requirement of 18 \n         U.S.C. Sec. 245(b)(2)\n       18 U.S.C. Sec. 245(b)(2) has been the principal federal \n     hate crimes statute for many years.\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\n     It prohibits the use of force, or threat of force, to injure, \n     intimidate, or interfere with (or to attempt to injure, \n     intimidate, or interfere with) ``any person because of his \n     race, color, religion, or national origin'' and because of \n     his participation in any of six ``federally protected \n     activities'' specifically enumerated in the statute. The six \n     enumerated ``federally protected activities'' are: (A) \n     enrolling in or attending a public school or public college; \n     (B) participating in or enjoying a service, program, facility \n     or activity provided or administered by any state or local \n     government; (C) applying for or enjoying employment; (D) \n     serving in a state court as a grand or petit juror; (E) \n     traveling in or using a facility of interstate commerce; and \n     (F) enjoying the goods or services of certain places of \n     public accommodation.\n       Federal jurisdiction exists under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245(b)(2) \n     only if a crime motivated by racial, ethnic, or religious \n     hatred has been committed with the intent to interfere with \n     the victim's participation in one or more of the six \n     federally protected activities. Even in the most blatant \n     cases of racial, ethnic, or religious violence, no federal \n     jurisdiction exists under this section unless the federally \n     protected activity requirement is satisfied. This requirement \n     has limited the ability of federal law enforcement officials \n     to work with state and local officials in the investigation \n     and prosecution of many incidents of brutal, hate-motivated \n     violence and has led to acquittals in several cases in which \n     the Department of Justice has found a need to assert federal \n     jurisdiction.\n       The most important benefit of concurrent state and federal \n     criminal jurisdiction is the ability of state and federal law \n     enforcement officials to work together as partners in the \n     investigation and prosecution of serious hate crimes. When \n     federal jurisdiction has existed in the limited contexts \n     authorized by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245(b)(2), the federal \n     government's resources, forensic expertise, and experience in \n     the identification and proof of hate-based motivations often \n     have provided a valuable investigative assistance to local \n     investigators. By working cooperatively, state and federal \n     law enforcement officials have the best chance of bringing \n     the perpetrators of hate crimes swiftly to justice.\n       The work of the National Church Arson Task Force is a \n     useful precedent. Created in 1996 to address the rash of \n     church arsons across the country, the Task Force's federal \n     prosecutors and investigators from ATF and the FBI have \n     collaborated with state and local officials in the \n     investigation of every church arson since then. The results \n     of these state-federal partnerships have been impressive. \n     Thirty-four percent of the joint state-federal church arson \n     investigations conducted by the Task Force resulted in \n     arrests of one or more suspects on state or federal charges. \n     This arrest rate is more than double the normal 16 percent \n     arrest rate in all arson cases nationwide, most of which are \n     investigated by local officials without federal assistance. \n     More than 80 percent of the suspects in joint state-federal \n     church arson investigations by the Task Force have been \n     prosecuted in state court under state law.\n     2. Violent hate crimes based on sexual orientation, gender, \n         or disability\n       Current federal law does not prohibit hate crimes based on \n     the victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability.\n\n                         a. Sexual Orientation\n\n       Statistics gathered by the federal government and private \n     organizations indicate that a significant number of hate \n     crimes based on the sexual orientation of the victim are \n     committed every year in the United States. Data collected by \n     the FBI pursuant to the Hate Crimes Statistics Act indicate \n     that 1,102 bias incidents based on the sexual orientation of \n     the victim were reported to local law enforcement agencies in \n     1997; that 1,256 such incidents were reported in 1996; and \n     1,019 and 677 such incidents were reported in 1995 and 1994, \n     respectively. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence \n     Programs (NCAVP), a private organization that tracks bias \n     incidents based on sexual orientation, reported 2,445 such \n     incidents in 1997; 2,529 in 1996; 2,395 in 1995; and 2,064 in \n     1994.\n       Even the higher statistics reported by NCAVP may \n     significantly understate the number of hate crimes based on \n     sexual orientation actually committed in this country. Many \n     victims of anti-lesbian and anti-gay incidents do not report \n     the crimes to local law enforcement officials because they \n     fear a hostile response or mistreatment. According to the \n     NCAVP survey, 12% of those who reported hate crimes based on \n     sexual orientation to the police in 1996 stated that the \n     police response was verbally or physically abusive.\n\n                               b. Gender\n\n       Although acts of violence committed against women \n     traditionally have been viewed as ``personal attacks'' rather \n     than as hate crimes, a significant number of women are \n     exposed to terror, brutality, serious injury, and even death \n     because of their gender. In the enactment of the Violence \n     Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994, Congress recognized that \n     some violent assaults committed against women are bias crimes \n     rather than mere ``random'' attacks. The Senate Report on \n     VAWA, which created a federal civil cause of action for \n     victims of gender-based hate crimes, stated: ``The Violence \n     Against Women Act aims to consider gender-motivated bias \n     crimes as seriously as other bias crimes. Whether the attack \n     is motivated by racial bias, ethnic bias, or gender bias, the \n     results are often the same. The victims are reduced to \n     symbols of hatred; they are chosen not because of who they \n     are as individuals but because of their class status. The \n     violence not only wounds physically, it degrades and \n     terrorizes, instilling fear and inhibiting the lives of all \n     those similarly situated. `Placing this violence in the \n     context of the civil rights laws recognizes it for what it \n     is--a hate crime.' '' Senate Repot No. 103-138 (1993) \n     (quoting testimony of Prof. Burt Neuborne.)\n       The majority of states do not specifically prohibit gender-\n     based hate crimes. All 50 states have statutes prohibiting \n     rape and other crimes typically committed against women, but \n     only 17 states have hate crimes statutes that include gender \n     among the categories of prohibited bias motives.\n       The federal government should have jurisdiction to work \n     with state and local law enforcement officials in the \n     investigation of violent gender-based hate crimes and, where \n     appropriate in rare circumstances, to bring federal \n     prosecutions to vindicate the strong federal interest in \n     combating the serious gender-based hate crimes of violence.\n       Enactment of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act will not result \n     in the federalization of all rapes, other sexual assaults, or \n     acts of domestic violence. The intent is to ensure that the \n     federal government's investigations and prosecutions of \n     gender-based hate crimes will be strictly limited to the most \n     flagrant cases.\n\n                             c. Disability\n\n       Congress has shown a consistent commitment over the past \n     decade to the protection of persons with disabilities from \n     discrimination. In amendments to the Fair Housing Act in \n     1988, and the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990, \n     Congress extended protections to persons with disabilities in \n     many traditional civil rights contexts.\n       The Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a measured response to a \n     critical problem facing the Nation. It will make the federal \n     government a full partner in the battle against hate crimes. \n     In recognition of State and local efforts, the Act also \n     provides grants to states and local governments to combat \n     hate crimes, including programs to train local law \n     enforcement officers in investigating, prosecuting and \n     preventing hate crimes.\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the legislation I am proud to be a \nprincipal cosponsor of again today is a referendum on whether Congress \nwill tolerate acts born out of prejudice. Every hate-filled attack, \nwhether the target is a young gay man in Alabama or Wyoming or an \nAfrican American man in Jasper, Texas, is an attack on all Americans. \nWe must not allow such acts to stain our national greatness.\n  Our nation is committed to the ideal that all men and women are \ncreated equal, and protected equally in the eyes of the law. But some \npeople aren't getting the message. It is high time to drive that \nmessage home.\n  The 1999 Hate Crimes Prevention Act will put bigots and racists on \nnotice: hate and bigotry will not be tolerated in America.\n  This bill will close the loopholes in the current hate crimes laws. \nRight now, there's a patchwork of hate crimes laws in states across the \ncountry. This bill will provide a unified, Federal approach in how to \ndeal with these despicable crimes.\n  It puts an end to the double standard where Federal authorities can \nhelp states and localities prosecute crimes motivated by ethnicity, \nreligion, race, and color, but not those motivated by gender, \ndisability, or sexual orientation. This bill would finally extend \nfederal hate crime laws to cover attacks against women, gays and \nlesbians, people with disabilities.\n  It also removes the current straightjacket on local law enforcement \nseeking Federal help to prosecute hate crimes. Current law targets hate \ncrimes that are committed against victims who are performing a \nfederally protected act, like voting, or eating in a restaurant. But a \nhate crime is a hate crime, regardless of what the victims are doing \nwhen they're attacked.\n  With this legislation, we could prosecute under Federal law the thugs \nwho murdered James Byrd, Matthew Shepard, and Billy Jack Gaither, as \nwell as other victims.\n  No one is suggesting that the Federal government should override \nlocal law enforcement authorities. This bill will complement, not \nsupplant, the work of local law enforcement in investigating and \nprosecuting hate crimes. It gives these local authorities more tools in \nprosecuting these crimes. If they need assistance in prosecuting a hate \ncrime, then Federal authorities would be available to assist them--to \nmake sure that justice is served.\n  Of course, no legislation can ever make up for the loss of any victim \nof a hate crime. But we can honor their memories by doing our best to \nmake\n\n[[Page S2733]]\n\nsure that crimes like these never happen again.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I again urge prompt consideration and \npassage of Hate Crimes Prevention Act. I cosponsored this measure in \nthe last Congress and do so again this year. This bill would amend the \nfederal hate crimes statute to make it easier for federal law \nenforcement officials to investigate and prosecute cases of racial and \nreligious violence. It would also focus the attention and resources of \nthe federal government on the problem of hate crimes committed against \npeople because of their sexual preference, gender, or disability.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to \nworking on hearings next month on this important initiative. Violent \ncrime motivated by prejudice demands attention from all of us. It is \nnot a new problem, but recent incidents of hate crimes have shocked the \nAmerican conscience. The beating death of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming \nwas one of those crimes; the dragging death of James Byrd in Texas was \nanother. The recent murder of Billy Jack Gaither in Alabama appears to \nbe yet another. These are sensational crimes, the ones that focus \npublic attention. But there is a toll we are paying each year in other \nhate crimes that find less notoriety, but with no less suffering for \nthe victims and their families.\n  It remains painfully clear that we as a nation still have serious \nwork to do in protecting all Americans and ensuring equal rights for \nall our citizens. The answer to hate and bigotry must ultimately be \nfound in increased respect and tolerance. But strengthening our federal \nhate crimes legislation is a step in the right direction. Bigotry and \nhatred are corrosive elements in any society, but especially in a \ncountry as diverse and open as ours. We need to make clear that a \nbigoted attack on one or some of us diminishes each of us, and it \ndiminishes our nation. As a nation, we must say loudly and clearly that \nwe will defend ourselves against such violence.\n  All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they \nchoose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to \npunish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 \nyears. This continues that great and honorable tradition.\n  Several of us come to this issue with backgrounds in local law \nenforcement. We support local law enforcement and work for initiatives \nthat assist law enforcement. It is in that vein that I support the Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act, which has received strong bipartisan support \nfrom state and local law enforcement organizations across the country.\n  When the Committee takes up the issue of hate crimes next month, one \nof the questions that must be addressed is whether the bill as drafted \nis sufficiently respectful of state and local law enforcement \ninterests. I welcome such questions and believe that Congress should \nthink carefully before federalizing prohibitions that already exist at \nthe state level.\n  To my mind, there is nothing questionable about the notion that hate \ncrimes warrant federal attention. As evidenced by the national outrage \nat the Byrd, Shepard, and Gaither murders, hate crimes have a broader \nand more injurious impact on our national society than ordinary street \ncrimes. The 1991 murder in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New \nYork, of an Hasidic Jew, Yankel Rosenbaum, by a youth later tried \nfederally for violation of the hate crime law, showed that hate crimes \nmay lead to civil unrest and even riots. This heightens the federal \ninterest in such cases, warranting enhanced federal penalties, \nparticularly if the state declines the case or does not adequately \ninvestigate or prosecute it.\n  Beyond this, hate crimes may be committed by multiple offenders who \nbelong to hate groups that operate across state lines. Criminal \nactivity with substantial multi-state or international aspects raises \nfederal interests and warrants federal enforcement attention.\n  Current law already provides some measure of protection against \nexcessive federalization by requiring the Attorney General to certify \nall prosecutions under the hate crimes statute as being ``in the public \ninterest and necessary to secure substantial justice.'' We should be \nconfident that this provision is sufficient to ensure restraint at the \nfederal level under the broader hate crimes legislation that we \nintroduce today. I look forward to examining that issue and considering \nways to guard against unwarranted federal intrusions under this \nlegislation. In the end, we should work on a bipartisan basis to ensure \nthat the Hate Crimes Prevention Act operates as intended, strengthening \nfederal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a back-up, but not a \nsubstitute, for state and local law enforcement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 623. A bill to amend Public Law 89-108 to increase authorization \nlevels for State and Indian tribal, municipal, rural, and industrial \nwater supplies, to meet current and future water quantity and quality \nneeds of the Red River Valley, to deauthorize certain project features \nand irrigation service areas, to enhance natural resources and fish and \nwildlife habitat, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                   Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I rise today to introduce the Dakota Water Resources Act \nof 1999, as cosponsored by my colleague, Senator Dorgan. Our colleague, \nCongressman Pomeroy, is introducing identical legislation in the House \nof Representatives today.\n  Mr. President, the Dakota Water Resources Act represents a fiscally \nresponsible, environmentally sound, treaty-compliant approach to \ncompleting the Garrison project. The U.S. Senate is well aware of the \nhistory of failed promises on water development projects on the \nMissouri River. The 1944 Flood Control Act authorized six main-stem \ndams along the Missouri River. These structures flooded about 550,000 \nacres of land in North Dakota. These were prime agricultural lands that \nwere flooded. We were promised that we would get certain things in \nreturn for the loss of these lands. We were promised that we would get \na major water project for the State of North Dakota. Unfortunately, \nonly part of that promise has been kept.\n  You can see here the kinds of things that have happened. This is the \ntown of Elbowoods, July 7, 1954. This town is now under water. It is \nnot the only town that is under water. Town after town along the \nMissouri was flooded in order to give protection to downstream States, \nto remove from them the flood threat that so long had devastated them \neconomically.\n  We accepted the permanent flood, a flood that came and has never \ngone. That flood has cost our State tremendously. All we are asking is \nthat the promise that was made to us in exchange for flooding these \n550,000 acres now be kept.\n  Mr. President, the Dakota Water Resources Act would assure North \nDakota an adequate supply of quality water for municipal, rural, and \nindustrial purposes. In fact, without these amendments, many \ncommunities in North Dakota will be forced to be without clean and \nreliable water supplies.\n  I think you can see these two jars. This is water that is delivered \nto rural North Dakotans via a pipeline. It is clean. It is healthy. It \nis wholesome.\n  This is the typical water supply for rural North Dakotans. It looks \nlike coffee or dark tea. This is actually what comes out when you turn \non your spigot in the homes of many of the people in rural North \nDakota. This is like living in the Third World. I tell my colleagues, \nthere is nothing quite like getting ready to step into a bathtub of \nwater when it looks like this; even worse, to have your child getting \nready to step into a bathtub of water that looks like this. This is \nabsolutely at the heart of what we are trying to accomplish with the \nDakota Water Resources Act, to provide clean, healthy supplies of water \nto our population.\n  Mr. President, water development is essential for economic \ndevelopment, agriculture, recreation and improving the environment. The \nlegislation that we are offering today will provide an adequate and \ndependable water supply throughout North Dakota, including communities \nin the Red River Valley.\n  This picture shows what we have faced in the past. This is 1910. This \nis the Red River, the famous Red River of the North. You could have \nwalked\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\nacross this river. You can see, at that point it was nothing more than \na few puddles. It had virtually dried up. Now, since that time we have \nhad major cities spring up, and we can't face a circumstance in which \nthose towns would be high and dry. Fargo, ND--I think many people have \nheard of Fargo, ND--Grand Forks, ND; they are on the Red River. They \ndepend, for their water supplies, on the Red River. Yet periodically in \nhistory the Red River all but dries up. We need to make certain that \nthere is ample supplies of water so that we aren't facing that \ncircumstance.\n\n  The bill that we are offering today is addressing the current water \nneeds of our State. Those needs are significantly different than what \nwe faced in 1944.\n  Let me briefly summarize the bill. It provides $300 million for \nstatewide MR projects. It provides $200 million for tribal MR \nprojects--in many cases, the water conditions on our reservations are \neven worse than the ones that I have shown that pertain in much of \nrural North Dakota--$200 million to deliver water to the Red River \nValley to make certain that those towns and cities have reliable and \nadequate supplies of water; $40 million to replace the dangerous Four \nBears Bridge that was required because of flooding that occurred, a \nbridge was built--that bridge is now badly out of date and dangerous--\n$25 million for a natural resources trust fund; $6.5 million for \nrecreation projects; and an understanding that the State pays for the \nproject facilities that it uses. We think that is a fundamental \nprinciple that ought to be recognized.\n  Those are the key elements of the bill that we are offering. Let me \nsay, this bill is friendly to taxpayers as well, because our bill, \nwhile proposing $770 million of new authority to complete the project, \ndeauthorizes many parts of the project that were previously authorized. \nThe total project cost of the Dakota Water Resources Act would be \nroughly $1.5 billion, nearly $500 million less than the current cost of \nconstructing the remainder of the 1986 project that is already \nauthorized. In other words, we are trading in parts of the project that \nno longer make the most sense in exchange for new elements which do \nmake sense, and we are doing it in a way that is cost-effective for the \ntaxpayers, reducing the overall bill by $500 million.\n  Now, there are some, representing certain national environmental \norganizations that will remain unnamed here, who have said that this is \nnearly a billion dollars of new spending. They aren't telling the \ntruth. That is not the truth. We are reducing the spending by \ndeauthorizing certain features previously authorized in exchange for \nnew ones, less costly ones that make sense in light of contemporary \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, North Dakota has been waiting a long time, a long time \nfor the promise to be kept to our State. It is desperately needed.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents a fiscally responsible, \nenvironmentally sound, treaty-compliant approach to completing the \nGarrison Project that was promised in North Dakota. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with Members of this body and the other body and the \nadministration to advance this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleague, Senator \nConrad, on the introduction of the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999. \nWe have previously introduced similar legislation.\n  We worked on this legislation with the Governor of North Dakota, as \nwell as the bi-partisan leadership in the State legislature in North \nDakota, Tribal leaders, and many others. Republicans and Democrats \ntogether developed a piece of legislation that we think is not only \ngood for our State and important for the State's long-term future, but \nwhich also completes the promise that was given our State many, many \nyears ago.\n  I will not talk about the specific provisions of the bill in a way \nthat will duplicate information which has already been provided, but \nlet me again describe the story, just for a moment. People say, Water \nprojects--this is some kind of proposal to enrich your region of the \ncountry. Well, there is more to the story.\n  In the 1940s, we had a wild Missouri River that would periodically \nflood in a very significant way, and in the downstream reaches of the \nriver, Kansas City, MO, and elsewhere, areas would have massive spring \nflooding. The Federal Government said, Let's put some main stem dams on \nthe Missouri River in order to control that flooding. As we put these \ndams on that river, we will also be able to generate electricity from \nthose dams, so we will prevent flooding and provide electrical \nbenefits. It will be a wonderful opportunity.\n  North Dakota, your deal in this is to accept a flood that comes and \nstays every year. You take a half-million-acre flood that comes to your \nState and stays there forever. If you are willing to play host to a \nflood forever, we will make you a deal. We know it is not in your \ninterest to say, please, bring us a permanent flood, so if you do that, \nwe will make you a deal. Accept a flood--the size of the State of Rhode \nIsland, by the way--and when that flood comes, you can take the water \nfrom behind the reservoir and move it around your State for water \ndevelopment and quality purposes.\n  That was the original Garrison proposal. Now, that promise, that \ncommitment has not been kept. The flood came; that part of the bargain \nhas been kept. But we have not received the full flower of benefits \nthat we would expect as a result of the Federal commitment. For that \nreason, we continue to insist that if your word is your bond and the \nFederal Government said take this flood and we will provide these \nbenefits for your State, and we need these benefits for our State to be \nable to move good quality water around our State, for that reason we \nfeel compelled to say to the Federal Government, finish the job.\n  That is what this legislation is about. It is not, as some \nenvironmental organizations insist, some new billion-dollar project. It \nis not that at all. In fact, what we are doing will, in a minor way, \nreduce the authorized project that already exists as a result of the \n1965 authorization and the 1986 authorization. This bill makes the \nfinal adjustments to this project.\n  I have a series of charts which I will not go through, recognizing \nthat the folks who are in charge of the timing of this institution want \nto go to lunch. Let me come back at a more appropriate time and go \nthrough all of my charts in great detail for the benefit of everyone.\n  I will only say in closing that my colleague and I feel that this is \na very important project and a bipartisan piece of legislation that \nwill be good for this country, allow our country to keep its promise \nand will especially be a good investment for North Dakota. My prepared \nremarks on the Dakota Water Resources Act will explain these points in \ngreater detail.\n  Mr. President, the new bill has been substantially modified in the \nform of a substitute amendment (No. 3112) which we introduced on July \n9, 1998. This revised bill represents a bi-partisan consensus carefully \nnegotiated by the major elected officials in our State.\n  It's a water development bill that I am proud to sponsor. It reduces \nFederal costs, meets environmental and international obligations, and \nfulfills the Federal promise to address North Dakota's contemporary \nwater needs.\n  This is still among the most important pieces of legislation I will \nintroduce for my State. I emphasize once more that this is because the \nkey to North Dakota's economic development is water resource management \nand development. And the key to water development in my State has come \nto be the Garrison Diversion Project in the Dakota Water Resources Act \nof 1999.\n  I want to share with my colleagues in greater detail the frustrating \nstory of an unfulfilled promise to build a water project because some \nhave questioned the rationale for the project. I want to explain why \nthe people of North Dakota need and expect to have this promise \nfulfilled in the form of the Dakota Water Resources Act.\n  Over 100 years ago, John Wesley Powell of the U.S. Geological Survey \npredicted to the North Dakota Constitutional Convention that the lean \nyears in agriculture would cause ``thousands of people . . . (to) \nbecome discouraged and leave.'' He was referring to the difficulty of \nmaking a living on farms and ranches in a state with abundant water but \nlimited rainfall.\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\n  Unfortunately, Powell's prediction is as telling today as it was in \nthe last century. Thousands of North Dakotans are leaving the State for \neconomic opportunities in cities such as Denver and Minneapolis. Due to \nthis substantial out-migration only 7 North Dakota counties, or less \nthan one in seven, had population increases in the past decade. What \nperhaps worries me even more is the fact that our farm youth population \nhas declined by 50% in both of the last two decades. In other words, \nout-migration is pummeling our State's well-being and threatening our \neconomic future.\n  I would say to my colleagues that the root of the North Dakota's \nproblem is two-fold. One, we need to diversify our agricultural base so \nthat family farmers can make a more dependable living. This requires \naccess to water for the growth and processing of specialty crops to \nreplace or augment the usual grains that North Dakota farmers have \ngrown for decades. Second, we must provide reliable supplies of clean, \naffordable water needed for economic growth in towns and cities across \nNorth Dakota. Too many of them now lack dependable water supplies for \nmunicipal and industrial growth.\n  What we need, then, is water development. And we thought we would get \nit!\n  Over fifty years ago, the Federal Government began building a series \nof main stem dams on the Missouri River to provide flood protection, \ndependable river navigation and inexpensive hydropower--primarily for \nthe benefit of states in the Lower Missouri Basin. The problem became \nacute when flooding during World War II disrupted the transport of war \nsupplies and spawned disaster relief needs in a budget already over-\nstretched.\n  When North Dakota allowed the Garrison Dam and Reservoir to be built \nin the State (and the consequences of the Oahe Reservoir in South \nDakota are added in), it agreed to host permanent floods that inundated \n500,000 acres of prime farm land and the Indian communities on two \nreservations. The State and Tribes did so in exchange for a promise \nthat the Federal Government would replace the loss of these economic \nand social assets with a major water development project, the Garrison \nDiversion Unit.\n  But 50 years later, the project is less than half done.\n  I would like to explain for the benefit of my colleagues just how \nthis bill relates to the Federal commitment to my State, what progress \nhas been made on that commitment, what remains to be done, and how this \nbill will complete the project in a prudent way.\n  May I remind my colleagues that the State lost a half million acres \nof prime farm land, a major component of its overall economic base. To \ngrasp the size of this negative impact, I ask my colleagues to think of \nflooding a chunk of farm land the size of Rhode Island. As a result, \nNorth Dakota has lost hundreds of millions of dollars in farm income. \nThink, too, of Indian Tribes that lost their traditional homelands, \ntheir economic and social base, hospitals and roads, and a healthy \nlifestyle. Their lives were disrupted and their culture was turned \nupside down.\n  We were promised, in exchange, a major water and irrigation project. \nIt was designed to help meet the agricultural needs of a semi-arid \nstate that gets only 15-17 inches of rainfall per year. We originally \nexpected the resources to irrigate over a million acres of land, most \nof it in areas less productive than the land lost to the Garrison \nReservoir. The Federal Government eventually started a scaled-down \nversion of the project, with 250,000 acres of irrigation. In response \nto criticisms that the project was too costly and too environmentally \ndisruptive, a federal commission proposed a major revision in 1984 and \nmade recommendations on how to meet the State's contemporary water \nneeds.\n  But make no mistake, the promise remained. The Garrison Diversion \nUnit Commission stated:\n\n       1. The State of North Dakota deserves a federally-funded \n     water project, at least some of which should be in the form \n     of irrigation development, for land lost through inundation \n     by reservoirs of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program.\n       2. The Commission agrees with Congress that a moral \n     commitment was made in 1944 to the Upper Basin States and \n     Indian Tribes with the passage of the Flood Control Act of \n     1944. The language of the statute establishing this \n     commission reinforces this view. The State of North Dakota \n     sacrificed hundreds of thousands of acres, much of it prime \n     river bottomland, for the greater benefit of the nation. In \n     return, the Federal Government promised assistance in \n     replacement of the economic base of the State and Indian \n     Tribes. There is evidence this has not taken place.\n\n  In 1986, I renegotiated the project with the Reagan Administration, \nthe House Interior Committee, and national environmental groups and \nthese talks resulted in the Garrison Diversion Reformulation Act of \n1986. The law implemented the Garrison Commission findings and \nrecommendations and included a 130,000 acre irrigation project for the \nState and tribes, the promise of Missouri River water to augment water \nsupplies in the Red River Valley, an installment on municipal, \nindustrial, and rural (MR) water for communities across the State, \nthe initial water systems for the Standing Rock, Fort Berthold, and Ft. \nTotten Indian reservations and a range of activities to mitigate and \nenhance wildlife and habitat.\n  So you may ask, ``What progress has been made on the project?''\n  Although the promise of irrigation remains largely unfulfilled--with \nthe exception of the Oakes Test Area--we have made substantial progress \nin laying the groundwork for water delivery and the provision of a \npartial network for MR supplies across the state.\n  Over one-third of North Dakotans now benefit from 25 MRI programs on \nfour Indian reservations and in some 80 communities.\n  The Southwest Pipeline constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation has \nbegun to solve water problems in the region where I grew up. For \nexample, in my hometown of Regent the ranching family of Michelle \nMcCormack used to struggle with coffee-colored water that stained their \nfixtures and clogged their distiller with sludge. Their well barely \nprovided enough water for a family of six, let alone a herd of cattle. \nBecause of the Garrison Project, the McCormacks can now enjoy ample \nsupplies of quality, clean water--something most of us take for \ngranted. And they can make a better living to boot.\n  We have also taken great strides to mitigate wildlife areas impacted \nby the development of the McClusky and New Rockford Canals. We now have \nmitigated over 200% of the required lands, developed a Wetlands Trust \nFund and programs, and begun to manage the former Lonetree Dam and \nReservoir as a state wildlife conservation area. Incidentally, our new \nlegislation would complete the process by de-authorizing the Lonetree \nfeatures and converting them into a wildlife conservation area.\n  For a variety of reasons, though, we have not fully realized the \npromise of the 1986 Act. Despite some strides, we have yet to develop a \nmajor irrigation unit under the Garrison Diversion project. We have \nonly been able to develop a pilot research plot near Oakes, which has \nvalidated the use of irrigation for growing high value crops in \nNorth Dakota. Under terms of the 1986 Act, we would have 130,000 acres \nof irrigation, which will be scaled back to 70,000 acres in the bill we \nintroduce today. This will reduce project costs and target limited \nfunds in the bill on high priority irrigation and MR water \ndevelopment.\n\n  We have completed Phase 1 of Municipal, Rural and Industrial \ndevelopment for three Indian tribes. There remains well over $200 \nmillion in needs to complete projects on all four reservations which \nwill meet the charge of the Garrison Reformulation Act for the \nSecretary of the Interior ``to meet the economic, public health, and \nenvironmental needs'' of North Dakota tribes. From hearings I have held \non the reservations, I can tell you that tribal members have some the \nworst water problems in the nation and we must fulfill the 1986 \nmandate. Our new legislation will provide $200 million to meet the \ncritical water needs of North Dakota's four Indian nations.\n  We have developed major elements of a water delivery system for the \nRed River Valley. But the Bureau of Reclamation is currently reviewing \nthat issue with the State of North Dakota to determine the best way to \nmeet the needs of Fargo, Grand Forks, and other communities throughout \nthe Red River Valley.\n  Let me illustrate the severity of the problem for the valley by \nnoting that in many years in this century, the Red River either has \nslowed to a trickle or\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nstopped running altogether. Imagine a major city that depends on a \nriver for its municipal and industrial water supply and that river \nstops running. That is why our bill provides $200 million to meet the \ncritical water needs the most populous part of our state. But let me \nadd that this money will be fully repaid by water users.\n  Finally, we have dozens of communities awaiting the promise of \nreliable supplies of clean and usable water. In several hearings I have \nheld up bottles of coffee-like water from the McCormack ranch and \nseveral others, which have not yet been served by such projects as the \nSouthwest Pipeline or the Northwest Area Water System.\n  Patsy Storhoff's family, for one, has to haul and store water for \ntheir household use. At times, they make 1,400 gallons last up to three \nweeks--what most families tap in just five days. She sometimes tells \nher kids they have to postpone a bath in order to conserve scarce water \nbecause the neighbor who hauls their water won't get to Nome for a \ncouple more days. Although when you pause to think about it, taking a \nbath in coffee-like water is a liquid oxymoron.\n  In part because the State would forego 60,000 acres of irrigation in \nthis bill and because we have realized only half of the Garrison \nCommission's promise of MR water for nearly 400,000 North Dakotans, \nwe do provide $300 million for MR development across the state. That \namount, plus the existing $200 million in authority for MR, will \nroughly match the amount promised by the Commission and the 1986 Act.\n  So the Dakota Water Resources Act provides $700 million in new \nauthority for water development, of which $200 million is fully \nrepayable. In order to complete this project, however, North Dakota has \nhad to make some major changes. In November of 1997, the delegation \nintroduced the Dakota Water Resources Act as a bill that reflected a \nconsensus of the bi-partisan elected leadership of the state, major \ncities, four tribal governments, water users, conservation groups, the \nState Water Coalition, and the Garrison Conservancy District.\n  In a word, the bill scaled back irrigation from 130,000 to 70,000 \nacres, provided new resources to complete the major MR delivery \nsystems for the four Indian tribes and the state's water supply \nnetwork, and provided a process for choosing the best way to address \nRed River Valley water needs. It also made wildlife conservation a \nproject purpose, expanded the Wetlands Trust into a more robust Natural \nResources Trust, funded a critical bridge on the Ft. Berthold \nReservation and a few priority recreation projects.\n  Subsequently, the Bureau of Reclamation raised several questions and \nconcerns about the bill which we have addressed in a series of \nnegotiations and discussions over the past months. The revisions mainly \naddress reducing costs, meeting tough environmental standards, \nstrengthening compliance with an international border agreement, and \nreaffirming the role of the Secretary of the Interior in decision-\nmaking. The bi-partisan elected leaders embraced those changes and have \nagreed to re-introduce the Dakota Water Resources Act with the same \nlanguage as the substitute amendment (No. 3112) which I offered with \nSenator Conrad last year.\n  Mr. President, permit me to outline the specific provisions in the \nnew version of the bill:\n  1. Retain the cost share of 25% for MR projects, along with a \ncredit for cost share contributions exceeding that amount. This, in \nplace of a 15% cost share.\n  2. Reimburse the federal government for the share of the capacity of \nthe main stem delivery features which are used by the state. This, \ninstead of writing off these features.\n  3. Index MR and Red River features only from the date of enactment, \nnot since 1986.\n  4. Expressly bar any irrigation in the Hudson's Bay Basin.\n  5. Give the Secretary of the Interior the authority to select the Red \nRiver Valley Water Supply feature and to determine the feasibility of \nany newly authorized irrigation areas in the scaled-back package.\n  6. Extend the Environmental Impact Studies period and firm up \nBoundary Waters Treaty measures.\n  Taken together with prior provisions, these changes achieve four \npurposes. First, they reduce costs by limiting indexing; by defining \nspecific State responsibility for repayment of existing features \ninstead of blanket debt forgiveness; by de-authorizing such major \nirrigation features as the Lonetree Dam and Reservoir, James River \nFeeder Canal and Sykeston Canal; and by retaining current law with \nrespect to MR cost-sharing and repayment for Red River supply \nfeatures.\n  Second, the changes affirm the decision making authority of the \nSecretary of the Interior on key issues. The Secretary consults with \nthe State of North Dakota on the plan to meet the water needs of the \nRed River Valley but he makes the final selection of the plan that \nworks best. The Secretary also negotiates cooperative agreements with \nthe State on other aspects of the project. These arrangements protect \nthe Federal interest while assuring that North Dakota is a partner in a \nproject so closely linked to its destiny.\n  Third, the bill forthrightly addresses concerns of Canada. The U.S. \nand Canada have a mutual responsibility to abide by the Boundary Waters \nTreaty and other environmental conventions. The Dakota Water Resources \nAct states in the purpose that the United States must comply strictly \nwith the Treaty. It further bars any irrigation in the Hudson's Bay \ndrainage with water diverted from the Missouri River, thus limiting \nbiota transfer between basins. Again, the Secretary of Interior chooses \nthe Red River Valley water supply plan, but if that choice entails \ndiversion of Missouri River water, then it must be fully treated with \nstate-of-the-art purification and screening to prevent biota transfer. \nAnd as noted before, the bill de-authorizes the Lonetree features to \nwhich Canada previously had objected.\n  Fourth, the revised bill strengthens environmental protection and \ndoes so by incorporating the specific recommendations of North Dakota \nwildlife and conservation groups. It lengthens the periods for \ncompleting Environmental Impact Statements. It also protects the \nSheyenne Lake National Wildlife Refuge. Moreover, it preserves the role \nof the Secretary of the Interior on compliance matters and drops the \nprovision that called for a study of bank stabilization on the Missouri \nRiver.\n  In other words, these measures improve even more the proposals in the \n1985 Garrison Commission Report on how to meet North Dakota's \ncontemporary water needs. This sounds reasonable, but how does it stack \nup against the fiscal and environmental challenges of 1999?\n  Irrespective of the Federal commitment to North Dakota, the State has \nnot even received a proportional share of Bureau of Reclamation funds. \nAlthough my state includes six percent of the population in western \nstates, it has received only two percent of Bureau funding.\n  Next, most Bureau projects were awarded to augment water development \nand economic growth, not to compensate states for losses suffered from \nthe construction of flood control projects by the Corps of Engineers. \nSo just on the equities, North Dakota has a fair claim to complete \nGarrison project.\n  The revised bill will also save the American taxpayer $500 million--\nwhen compared to the cost of completing the current project. Moreover, \nof the $770 million in new authority in the revised bill, North Dakota \nwill repay $345 million--almost half. There is no blanket debt \nretirement because North Dakota will pay for all facilities it uses.\n  Moreover, this bill is not just about costs, though reduced and \nrestrained, but about investments. The Dakota Water Resources Act \nunderpins North Dakota's entire effort to stop the out-migration of its \nyoung people, the dwindling of family farms, and the decimation of \nrural communities. It is a charter for rural renewal and economic \ngrowth that will help family farms keep the yard lights burning and \nsmall towns keep their shop signs glowing.\n  Finally, this bill is environmentally sound. It does not destroy \nwetlands, it preserves them. It preserves grasslands and riparian \nhabitat, too. It was not dreamed up by a water development group. It \nwas drafted with the input of tribal and community leaders, local and \nnational environmental groups,\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\n the bipartisan leadership of the state, and the Bureau of Reclamation \nand Office of Management and Budget. It reflects a balanced approach to \nwater resource development that applies the principles of conservation \nwhile offering the hope of economic development.\n  Ultimately, this bill practices the policy of being a good neighbor \nthat is the hallmark of our state. The Government of Canada approved \nthe 1986 Garrison Act. This bill provides even more protection for \nCanadian interests. So while we can't appease the political agendas of \ncertain folks in Canada, we can sure keep faith with the Boundary \nWaters Treaty. And we do.\n  In conclusion, the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999 will guarantee \nthat this project meets the tests of fiscal responsibility, \nenvironmental protection, and treaty compliance. It will do so while \nalso addressing the critical water development needs of North Dakota \nand fulfilling the Federal obligation for water development for the \ncommunities and tribes of our State. Accordingly, I urge that my \ncolleagues support the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 624. A bill to authorize construction of the Fort Peck Reservation \nRural Water System in the State of Montana, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      FORT PECK RURAL WATER SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that is vitally important for the Northeast corner of my \ngreat state of Montana. As you are aware, water is the most valuable \ncommodity in the West. Unfortunately, in many parts of the West the \nwater available is unsafe to use. This is the case on the Fort Peck \nReservation and in the surrounding communities.\n  These communities are currently dependent on water sources that are \neither unreliable or contaminated. In some areas the ground water is in \nshort supply, in others high levels of nitrates, sulfates, manganese, \niron, dissolved solids and other contaminates ensure that the water is \nnot only unusable for human consumption, but even unusable for \nlivestock. Quite simply, the water is not safe.\n  Safe drinking water is a necessity in all communities, however, these \ncommunities have a very unique set of needs that underscore the \nimportance of clean water. This legislation would ensure the \nAssiniboine and Sioux people of the Fort Peck Reservation a safe and \nreliable water supply system. One of the largest reservations in the \nnation, the Fort Peck Reservation is located in Northeastern Montana \nand is the home of more than 10,000 people. In addition to a 75 percent \nunemployment rate, the residents suffer from unusually high incidents \nof heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.\n  These health problems are magnified by the poor drinking water \ncurrently available on the reservation. In one community, the sulfate \nlevels in the water are four times the standard for safe drinking \nwater. In four other communities, the iron levels are five times the \nstandard. Some families have even been forced to abandon their homes as \na result of the substandard water quality.\n  In many cases, residents of the reservation purchased bottled water \nto avoid illness. While this isn't a big deal to those who can afford \nit, we are dealing with an area living in extreme poverty. To add \ninsult to injury, one of the largest man made reservoirs in the United \nStates is right down the road. Why must we continue to ask the \nresidents of these communities to place their health at risk when a \nclean, safe, stable source of water is readily available?\n  The economic health of the region is also affected by the poor water \nsupply. In fact, a major constraint on the growth of the livestock \nindustry around Fort Peck has been the lack of an adequate watering \nsites for cattle. Only an adequate water system will solve this \nproblem, and hopefully serve to spur economic activity on the \nreservation. Recently the administration designated this area as an \n``Empowerment Zone.'' The purpose of this designation is to help the \ntribal government enhance the economic and social well-being of the \narea's residents. What better foundation can we provide than a safe and \nreliable water infrastructure. This region's aspirations towards being \nhealthy, both economically and physically, will continue to be stifled \nuntil we reach out a helping hand and work towards providing a safe \nwater system.\n  This legislation, which has the support of Fort Peck residents and \nthe endorsement of the Tribal Council of the Assiniboine and Sioux \nTribes, would authorize a reservation-wide municipal, rural and \nindustrial water system for the Fort Peck Reservation. A safe and \nreliable source of water would improve the health status of the \nresidents and increase the region's attractiveness for economic \ndevelopment.\n  As the future water needs of the Fort Peck Reservation expand, I \nbelieve that it is only right that we take action now. The people of \nthe Fort Peck Reservation and the State of Montana are making a simple \nrequest--clean, safe drinking water.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2737-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2737-S2777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FORT PECK RESERVATION RURAL WATER SYSTEM ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, \nSenator Burns, to introduce the ``Fort Peck Reservation Rural Water \nSystem Act of 1999.'' This bill, which is broadly supported, will \nensure the Assiniboine and Sioux people of the Fort Peck Reservation, \nas well as the surrounding communities in my great state of Montana, \nsomething that each and everyone one of us in this body take for \ngranted everyday--a safe and reliable water supply.\n  This legislation authorizes a municipal, rural and industrial water \nsystem for the Fort Peck Reservation and the surrounding communities \noff the Reservation who compose the Dry Prairie Water Association. \nUsing a small amount of water from the Missouri River, this project \nwill benefit the entire region of Northeast Montana. This legislation \nhas the support of the State of Montana, the residents of the Fort Peck \nReservation, the Tribal Council of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes, \nand all of the towns and communities surrounding the Reservation.\n  I am proud to sponsor this legislation because it represents the \ncoming together of people who have traditionally been divided on many \nissues. The need for water has surfaced a tremendous show of friendship \nand trust in Northeast Montana. This project has given the Fort Peck \nAssiniboine and Sioux Tribes and the off-Reservation public common \nground to work towards and provided the trust needed for rural \ncommunities to grow and prosper. The need for water exists not only for \ndrinking, but also for agricultural, municipal, and industrial \npurposes.\n  Together, the people in this region are plagued with major drinking \nwater problems. The Reservation and surrounding communities are clearly \nin desperate need of a safe and good source of drinking water. In one \ncommunity, the sulfate levels in the water are four times the standard \nfor safe drinking water. In four of the communities, iron levels are \nfive times the standard. Sadly, some residents have been forced to \nabandon their homes and their farms because their only source of water \nhas been polluted with brine from oil production.\n  In all of the communities throughout the Reservation, groundwater \nexceeds the standards for total dissolved solids, iron, sulfates, and \nnitrates. In some instances, more lethal minerals such as selenium, \nmanganese, and fluorine are found in high concentrations.\n  In the area north of Culbertson, nitrate levels are too high to \nsafely use ground water. Along the Eastern borders, from Froid to \nPlentywood, the high manganese, iron and total dissolved solids, make \ntreating the water very expensive. In the Northeast, near Westby, there \nis oil field contamination from seismographing and salt water injection \nmethods.\n  In the middle of the service area, near Flaxville, nitrates and \nsulfates exceed safe drinking water standards also. Finally, in the \nwest, in the St. Marie area, ground water is so hard and in such short \nsupply that it is unusable. In addition, several local water\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\nsystems have had occurrences of biological contamination.\n  As a result of the poor water that exists here, the Indian Health \nService has issued several public health alerts. In most communities in \nthis region, residents are forced to buy bottled water at a cost of at \nleast $75 a month. Those who cannot afford to buy bottled water--of \nwhom there are many--must continue to use the existing water sources, \nat great risk to their health. Yet, despite the above mentioned health \nrisks, an ideal source of safe water, the Missouri River, flows past \nthese people every day.\n  In addition to the need for safe drinking water, an adequate source \nof water is needed to preserve and protect agricultural operations. As \nyou know Mr. President, Northeast Montana relies almost exclusively on \nagriculture to survive. The changing agricultural industry has brought \nhigh unemployment and low family income to this area. To compete in \nthese challenging times, most agriculture producers in rural America \nare adding value to the products they grow. To add value however, you \nmust have processing facilities that allow you to manufacture a high \nquality, finished product. The people of Northeast Montana do not have \nthe quality of water needed to support industry of this kind. The \nregion's ability to supply employment and compete in agriculture is \ndestroyed without essential infrastructure.\n  I have described a desperate and complex situation, Mr. President. \nThe solution however, is simple. We need to provide a water system that \nwill deliver a safe and good source of water to the residents of the \nRegion. Fortunately, most of the work has been done. By working \ntogether on a local and state level, these groups have struck a deal \nthat provides an adequate source of water for all who need it, for this \ngeneration of users and for future generations. By using a small amount \nof water from the Missouri River, combined with the structure this bill \nprovides, residents of Northeast Montana will be able to enjoy the \nsame, safe water supply that you and I do.\n  I look forward to swift passage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Biden, and Mr. \n        Sessions):\n  S. 625. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   THE BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1999'' with Senators Torricelli and Biden. \nThis bill builds on the conference report which the Senate and House \nproduced at the end of the 105th Congress, which melded together good \nlegislation from both the Senate and the House to create a final \nproduct that combined the best aspects of both bills.\n  The bill I'm introducing today makes important changes to the \nconference report from last year to accommodate concerns raised by some \nSenators.\n  The need for real bankruptcy reform is pretty obvious. You don't need \nan army of so-called scientists, law professors and academics to tell \nus that we have a serious bankruptcy problem.\n  These are good times in America. Thanks to the hard work of a \nRepublican Congress, we have the first balanced budget in a generation. \nUnemployment is low, we have a solid stock market and most Americans \nare optimistic about the future.\n  Despite the prosperity we are experiencing now, About one and a half \nmillion Americans will declare bankruptcy this year if previous trends \ncontinue. Since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings are up an \namazing 94.7 percent. That's almost a 100 percent increase in \nbankruptcies since 1990.\n  Clearly something is amiss, and to paraphrase, ``it's not the economy \nstupid.'' The problem with the explosion in bankruptcies lies \nelsewhere. While many Americans who declare bankruptcy undoubtedly need \na fresh start, it defies common sense to think that all of the million \nand a half Americans in bankruptcy court can't repay at least some of \ntheir debts. The point of bankruptcy reform is to limit chapter 7--\nwhich provides for a no-questions asked complete discharge of debts--to \npeople who don't have the ability to repay any of their debts. People \nwho can repay some or all of their debts should be required to do so in \na chapter 13 repayment plan.\n  An important aspect to remember about bankruptcies is that we all \nhave to pick up the tab for bankrupts who walk away from their debts. \nBusinesses have to raise prices on products and services to offset \nbankruptcy losses. When you realize this, it becomes very apparent that \nallowing unfettered access to chapter 7 bankruptcy for high income \npeople is a lot like a special interest tax loophole. Over 30 years \nago, Senator Albert Gore, Sr. recognized this in a speech on the Senate \nfloor. According to Senator Gore, like tax loopholes, chapter 7 allows \nsomeone to get out of paying his fair share and to shift the cost to \nhardworking Americans who play by the rules.\n  I think that Senator Gore had it exactly right. Bankruptcy reform is \nall about closing loopholes so higher income can't get out of paying \ntheir fair share.\n  As I indicated earlier, the bill I'm introducing now contains \nsignificant modifications to accommodate the concerns raised by some \nSenators. At the outset, I want to make it clear that, as was the case \nwith the original Senate bill from last Congress, under this bill, a \nperson in financial trouble can file in any chapter of the bankruptcy \ncode he or she chooses. And before a debtor can be transferred from \nchapter 7 to chapter 13 or kicked out of bankruptcy, a judge will have \nthe chance to review the merits of each and every case. I want to \nrepeat this: Each and every chapter 7 debtor who meets the means-test \nwill receive an individual hearing to press his or her own unique case \nbefore anything happens. In other words, this bill maintains much of \nthe judicial scrutiny and discretion that was the distinguishing factor \nof the Senate bill's means-test in the 105th Congress. In the bill \nSenator Torricelli and I are introducing today, there is more \nflexibility given to the bankruptcy judge.\n  Under the Grassley-Torricelli bill, there are even greater consumer \nprotections than were in last year's conference report. For instance, \nin order to protect consumers from deceptive and coercive collection \nPractices, the Justice Department and the FBI are directed to appoint \none agent and one prosecutor to investigate abusive or deceptive \nreaffirmation practices. Sears recently plead guilty in Massachusetts \nto bankruptcy fraud in connection with its business practices in \nseeking reaffirmations, and agreed to pay 60 million dollars in fines.\n\n  I think this shows that we already have tough laws on the books \nregarding reaffirmations. What we need is better law enforcement, not \nnew laws. That's why we require the Justice Department and the FBI to \ndesignate a person to investigate reaffirmation practices. Under the \nGrassley-Torricelli bill, State attorney generals may enforce State \ncriminal statutes similar to those under which Sears was prosecuted, \nand the State attorney generals are given the express authority to \nenforce consumer protections already in the bankruptcy code. Taken \ntogether, these provisions amount to a massive infusion of Federal and \nState law enforcment resources for the purpose of protecting consumers \nin bankruptcy court from abusive collection tactics.\n  The Grassley-Torricelli bill retains all the protections for child \nsupport in last year's conference report, with important new additions. \nNow, bankruptcy trustees would be required to notify State enforcment \nagencies of a bankrupt's address and telephone number if the bankrupt \nowes child support. This means that the bankruptcy court will now help \nto track down dead-beat parents.\n  Also, the bill I'm introducing today also provides that debts \nincurred prior to bankruptcy to pay off non-dischargeable debts will \nstill be dischargeable if the bankrupt owes child support. This means \nthat child support will never have to compete with this new category of \nnon-dischargeable debt after bankruptcy. Taken together, these \nprovisions will provide key new protections for child support \nclaimants.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the consumer provisions, the Grassley-\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\nTorricelli bill also contains numerous changes to improve the \nbankruptcy code for businesses. The bill makes numerous changes to the \ntreatment of tax claims in bankruptcy, and I expect that these \nprovision will be refined on the floor as the Finance Committee makes \nsome suggestions.\n  The bill also creates a new chapter 15 to address the growing problem \non transnational bankruptcies.\n  The bill contains provisions to make chapter 12 permanent and to \nexpand access to chapter 12.\n  The bill contains an entire title dedicated to expediting chapter 11 \nproceedings for small businesses.\n  One business-related provision I want to high-light relates to \nprotecting patients when hospitals and health-care businesses declare \nbankruptcy. I chaired a hearing on this topic last year and I was \nshocked to realize that the bankruptcy code doesn't require bankruptcy \ntrustees and creditor committees to consider the welfare of patients \nwhen closing down or re-organizing a hospital or nursing home. So, \nunder the Grassley-Torricelli bill, whenever a hospital or nursing home \ndeclares bankruptcy a patient ombudsman will be appointed to represent \nthe interests of patients during bankruptcy proceedings. And bankruptcy \ntrustees are required to safeguard the privacy of medical records when \nclosing a health care business. These provisions will provide \nsignificant protections for patients in bankruptcy proceedings.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains many much-needed reforms. This bill \nis fair, balanced and should receive strong bi-partisan support. I ask \nunanimous consent to print the bill in the Record as there is much \npublic interest in bankruptcy reform and I want to get as much \ninformation out as possible. I also ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record a summary of the major differences between this bill and the \nconference report from last year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 625\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This \n     effectively turns bankruptcy courts into locator services to \n     help track down ``deadbeat parents.''\n       The new Senate bill requires bankruptcy trustees to notify \n     child support claimants of their right to enforce payment \n     through an appropriate state agency.\n       The new Senate bill permits state agencies which enforce \n     payment of child support obligations to request that \n     creditors who hold reaffirmed or non-discharged debts to \n     provide the last known address and telephone number of the \n     debtor. Again, this effectively turns bankruptcy courts into \n     locator services which will help to track down ``deadbeat \n     parents.''\n       The new Senate bill provides that debts incurred to pay \n     non-dischargeable debts will continue to be dischargeable if \n     the debtor owes child support or alimony.\n\n\n                     Fewer Non-Dischargeable Debts\n\n       The new Senate bill raises the dollar limits on cash \n     advances on the eve of bankruptcy, presumed non-dischargeable \n     from $250 to $750.\n       The new Senate bill shortens the time during which \n     purchases and cash advances are presumed non-dischargeable \n     from 90 days to 70 days.\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with \nSenator Grassley and Senator Torricelli, along with our colleague from \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions, to introduce legislation to \nreform our nation's bankruptcy laws.\n  In a time of rising incomes, historic levels of job creation, and \nstrong economic growth, America has seen an unexpected rise in the \nnumber of personal bankruptcies. Last year, 1.4 million Americans filed \nfor personal bankruptcy, and we expect that number to grow again this \nyear, as it has for the last 4 years. This means more people are filing \nfor bankruptcy now than during the worst years of job losses in the \n1980's.\n  Bankruptcy laws give Americans a very special kind of protection from \nthe worst form of financial distress. As a nation of immigrants, our \ncountry is\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\nthe very embodiment of the idea of a fresh start. Bankruptcy protection \nwas considered so important that it was among the specific powers \ngranted to Congress in our Constitution. That is why we provide in law \nthat no one should have to shoulder an unsustainable burden of debt, a \nburden that can hurt us all by threatening the weakest links in our \nsociety.\n  But at the same time, Mr. President, our nation is founded on the \nidea of personal responsibility, the only foundation that can sustain \nand protect our freedom. Until recently, bankruptcy was considered a \nstain on one's personal reputation, an admission of failure, something \nto be avoided at all costs. While we may sympathize with the special \ncircumstances that can throw an individual into unexpected hardship, \nAmericans expect that those who have the resources must meet their \nfinancial obligations.\n  But the explosion in the number of personal bankruptcies, in a time \nof economic prosperity, raises serious questions. Mr. President, every \ntime one of us fails to pay a legitimate debt, the rest of us pay a \nlittle more, because of the higher interest rates lenders must charge \nto cover their loses. When the circumstances are unavoidable, and when \nit is clear that a fresh start is deserved, bankruptcy must be there \nfor those who need it. But when those who have the ability to pay use \nthe bankruptcy system to walk away from their debts, something is \nwrong.\n  It is now clear to most of us that our bankruptcy system--and the \nlaws that guide it--are in serious need of reform. Last year, in the \nSenate, we passed a bipartisan bill by the nearly unanimous vote of 97 \nto 1 to fix the problems in our bankruptcy laws. While that proposal \ndid not become law, we reached agreement that bankruptcy reform--done \nthe right way--is something we all can support.\n  Working closely with his new ranking member, Senator Torricelli, \nSenator Grassley has once again shown us the leadership on this issue \nthat he provided last year. I believe that we have built a foundation \nin this bill for a reasonable approach, one that restores some of the \nbalance that has been lost in recent years. To that end, this \nlegislation assures that those who have the ability to pay will \ncontinue to meet their obligations, and that bankruptcy is not seen as \na financial planning device, but the last resort for the most \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  At the same time, again with the help of Senator Torricelli we have \ngone a long way toward addressing the honest concerns that many of our \ncolleagues have expressed about the needs of those, like single parents \nand those who receive child support, who deserve greater protection.\n  This is a tough balance to strike, and I will continue to work with \nSenator Grassley, Senator Torricellie, and Senator Sessions, and with \nour colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, to listen to the concerns of \nother Senators, to achieve the kind of consensus that we found here in \nthe Senate last year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. Mr. ROBERTS (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 626. A bill to provide from unfair interest and penalties on \nrefunds retroactively ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      KANSAS NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nof critical importance to the natural gas industry in Kansas.\n  Natural gas production is an important industry in Kansas, paying \ngood wages to hard working Kansans and taxes to support county and \nstate tax rolls. Kansas is a national leader in natural gas production, \nand we pipe our product all over the nation. It is an affordable, \nabundant and clean energy source. This bill will ensure that we can \ncontinue to produce this natural resource in Kansas.\n  This issue is complex, full of legalities and arcane federal policy. \nBut I believe the crux of the matter will reverberate throughout the \nCongress.\n  The problem before us arises out of the system of federal price \ncontrols on natural gas. In 1974, natural gas producers were given \npermission to exceed the national ceiling rates for gas by the cost of \nany state or federal tax on production. In Kansas, one such tax was the \nad valorem tax. In 1974, the Federal Power Commission issued Opinion \n699-D, finding that the Kansas ad valorem tax was a production tax \neligible for recovery. Kansas gas producers, like producers in other \nstates, were allowed to exceed the national rates by the costs of a \nlocal production tax.\n  In 1978, Congress passed the Natural Gas Policy Act. That statute \ncontinued the practice of price controls on natural gas, but also \ncodified prior practices that allowed natural gas producers to exceed \nprice ceilings by the costs of production taxes. The newly created \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the federal body charged with \nimplementing federal policies in this field, continued the practice of \nallowing Kansas producers to recover the costs of the Kansas ad valorem \ntax. Business continued as it had since 1974.\n  This practice of adding on the Kansas ad valorem tax was challenged \nin 1983. The FERC responded with opinions in 1986 and again in 1987, \nstating that it is ``clear, beyond question,'' that the Kansas ad \nvalorem tax is a tax on production and therefore, under law, eligible \nfor recovery. Kansas producers had clear authority to recover the costs \nof the ad valorem tax.\n  What happened next is inexplicable. In 1988, the prior FERC decisions \non the Kansas ad valorem tax were challenged in court. The D.C. Circuit \nCourt remanded the issue to the FERC. In 1993, five years later, the \nFERC did the unthinkable. They overturned all their previous rulings in \nthis matter and required Kansas natural gas producers to refund, plus \ninterest, all ad valorem tax monies collected above the gas price \nceilings from 1988 forward. The FERC wisely chose 1988 as the \ncollection date based on the D.C. Circuit's decision date. \nUnfortunately, upon challenge in 1996, the D.C. Circuit extended the \nrefund period to 1983. The result is an estimated $340 million \nliability due by every producer operating between the years 1983 and \n1988.\n  What has occurred is an atrocious miscarriage of justice. Kansas \nnatural gas producers, who in their business practices relied on the \nrules and followed the orders of the FERC, were subsequently told they \nhad been breaking federal law since 1974, or for 19 years. They were \nthen retroactively found to be liable for all of the collected tax \nfunds back to 1983. In layman's terms, these producers are being held \nliable for following the orders of the FERC.\n  The FERC did not carry out its duties in a vacuum. Section 110 of the \nNatural Gas Policy Act clearly stated that production taxes could be \nadded to the price of gas, even if the add-on exceeded national price \nceilings. The NGPA report language went so far as to spell out what \nkind of taxes are production taxes, stating ``The term ``State \nseverance tax'' is intended to be construed broadly. It includes any \ntax imposed upon mineral or natural resource production including an ad \nvalorem tax. . .'' It is evident to me, and I hope to anyone reading \nthis, that Congress included the words ``ad valorem'' tax for an \nexplicit reason--because Congress intended that ad valorem taxes were \nto be included in the list of taxes eligible for recovery. I have all \nof these documents in my possession, and would be pleased to provide \nany of this information to my colleagues. Mr. President, we must remedy \nthis situation. Before us are the citizens of Kansas, the natural gas \nproducers, who for 19 years dutifully ran their businesses in \ncompliance with federal law, and strictly followed the edicts of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. They had a right, indeed a \nresponsibility, to rely on the FERC's orders. Today, they are being \npunished for following these very orders. The FERC's incompetence has \ncaused these honest citizens to be treated as criminals. However, it is \nthe incompetence of the FERC that is criminal.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce legislation from the last \nCongress. This bill would repeal the most unjust aspect of this order. \nRequiring producers to refund these recovered taxes is bad enough. \nHowever, assessing an interest penalty on this refund order extends \nbeyond the bounds of decency and fairness. The interest portion \nrepresents roughly two-thirds of the estimated $340 million cost to \nKansas producers. While the FERC had the\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\nopportunity to waive the interest portion, they refused to do so. This \nlegislation is made necessary by the FERC's refusal to take any actions \nto mitigate this harsh, retroactive and unjust decision.\n  Mr. President, I will do everything in my power to push this issue \nthrough to resolution. I will continue my efforts to encourage the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold hearings on this \nissue, so they may hear firsthand of the events that lead us where we \nfind ourselves today. I want Congress to hear from the citizens of my \nstate, the young and the old, those in business and those retired, \nthose who have money, and those living on a fixed income, all of whom \nthe FERC has ordered must pay refunds often ranging into the tens of \nthousands of dollars.\n  I also believe it is time for Congress to review the independence and \npower delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They are \nunaccountable for their actions, unwilling to accept responsibility and \nunmoved by the pleas of the stakeholders in this process. Congress \nentrusted oversight and administration of federal gas policy to the \nFERC. In this case, the FERC has failed to properly administer the law, \nand has exercised its authority in an egregious and inequitable manner \ninconsistent with congressional intent. Congress has a clear \nresponsibility to intervene in this case.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 626\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LIABILITY OF CERTAIN NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS.\n\n       The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 603. LIABILITY OF CERTAIN NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS.\n\n       ``If the Commission orders any refund of any rate or charge \n     made, demanded, or received for reimbursement of State ad \n     valorem taxes in connection with the sale of natural gas \n     before 1989, the refund shall be ordered to be made without \n     interest or penalty of any kind.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKFELLER (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 628. A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to expand and clarify the requirements regarding advance directives \nin order to ensure that an individual's health care decisions are \ncomplied with, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          ADVANCE PLANNING AND COMPASSIONATE CARE ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing \nthe ``Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act of 1999'' with my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Collins. We introduce this legislation to \nask Congress to take action that responds directly and humanely to the \nneeds of the elderly and others during some of their most difficult and \ntraumatic times of their lives. The time I refer to is the end-of-life.\n  Our perceptions of illness, end-of-life care, and death are changing \nin response to advances in medical technology, a shift from treating \nacute care illnesses to managing chronic care conditions, improvements \nin palliative care, and a greater respect for patient involvement and \nautonomy in end-of-life decisions.\n  Patients want to maintain a sense of control of their lives \nthroughout their last days. But studies show that tremendous variation \nexists in the medical care that Medicare beneficiaries receive in the \nlast few months of their lives. This sort of analysis highlights that \npatient preferences have little to do with the sort of care patients \nreceive in their final months of life. Where you live determines the \nsort of medical care you will receive more so than what you might \nprefer. Our bill addresses this issue by calling for an evaluation of \ncurrent standards of care and promoting better communication between \nhealth care providers and their patients.\n  Unfortunately, while people do worry about end-of-life issues, the \ntruth is that patients, families, and physicians have difficulty \ntalking about them. People have an endless list of reasons for not \ntalking about end-of-life care, for not making decisions to prepare for \nit. Some are afraid of jinxing themselves by planning their end-of-life \ncare, and many have faith that their families will know the right thing \nto do when the time comes.\n  Not talking about death does not stop it from occurring. We all know \nit is a natural, inevitable part of life. But by not talking about end-\nof-life care, we hamper our ability to learn about the options that are \navailable to relieve suffering, promote personal choice, and obtain \ngreater care and comfort in our final months.\n  End-of-life care is a major--and growing--issue in the future of \nhealth care. Unfortunately, in recent years, debates on end-of-life \ncare have focused almost exclusively on the subject of physician-\nassisted suicide. Mr. President, I have spent considerable time delving \ninto the concerns and dilemmas that face patients, their family members \nand their physicians when confronted with death or the possibility of \ndying. In almost all such difficult situations, people are not thinking \nabout physician-assisted suicide. The needs and dilemmas that confront \nthem have much more to do with the kind of care and information they \nneed desperately.\n  The legislation we are introducing today builds on bipartisan \nlegislation enacted in 1990, called the Patient Self-Determination Act. \nAs a result of that bill, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home \nhealth agencies, hospice programs, and HMO's participating in the \nMedicaid and Medicare programs must provide every adult receiving \nmedical care with written information concerning patient involvement in \ntheir own treatment decisions. The health care institutions must also \ndocument in the medical record whether the patient has an advance \ndirective. In addition, States were required to write descriptions of \ntheir State laws concerning advance directives.\n  The first section of the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act \ninstructs the Department of Health and Human Services to develop \nappropriate quality measures and models of care for persons with \nchronic, debilitating illnesses, including the very frail elderly who \nwill comprise an increasing number of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The second part of our bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to advise Congress on an approach to adopting the provisions \nof the Uniform Health Care Decisions Act for Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Uniform Health Care Decisions Act was developed by the Uniform Law \nCommissioners, a group with representation from all States that has \nbeen in existence for over 100 years. The Uniform Health Care Decisions \nAct includes all the important components of model advance directive \nlegislation. A great deal of legal effort went into its development, \nwith input by all the States and approval by the American Bar \nAssociation. Medicare beneficiaries deserve a uniform approach to \nadvance directives, especially since many move from one State to \nanother while in the Medicare Program. The tremendous variation in \nState laws that currently exists only adds to the confusion of health \ncare professionals and their patients.\n\n  The third section strengthens the previously enacted Patient Self \nDetermination Act in the following ways:\n  First, it requires that every Medicare beneficiary have the \nopportunity to discuss health care decision-making issues with an \nappropriately trained professional, when he or she makes a request. \nThis measure would help make sure that patients and their families have \nthe ability to discuss and address concerns and issues relating to \ntheir care, including end-of-life care, with a trained professional. \nMany health care institutions already have teams of providers to \naddress difficult health care decisions and some even mediate among \npatients, families, and providers. In smaller institutions, social \nworkers, chaplains, nurses or other trained professionals could be made \navailable for consultation.\n  Second, our bill requires that a person's advance directive be placed \nin a prominent part of the medical record. Often advance directives \ncannot even be found in the medical record, making\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\nit more difficult for providers to respect patients' wishes. It is \nessential that an individual's advance directive be readily available \nand visible to anyone involved in their health care.\n  Third, it will assure that an advance directive valid in one State \nwill be valid in another State. At present, portability of advance \ndirectives from State to State is not assured. Such portability can \nonly be guaranteed through Federal legislation.\n  The fourth part of this legislation would encourage the development \nof models for end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries who do not \nqualify for the Medicare hospice benefit but still have chronic, \ndebilitating and ultimately fatal illnesses. The tremendous advances in \nmedicine and medical technology over the past 30 to 50 years have \nresulted in a greatly lengthened life expectancy for Americans, as well \nas vastly improved functioning and quality of life for the elderly and \nthose with chronic disease. Many of these advances have been made \npossible by federally financed health care programs, such as the \nMedicare Program that assures access to high quality health care for \nall elderly Americans. Medicare has also funded much of the development \nof technology and a highly skilled physician workforce through support \nof medical education and academic medical centers. These advances have \nalso created major dilemmas in addressing terminal or potentially \nterminal disease, as well as a sense of loss of control by many with \nterminal illness.\n  Mr. President, I am learning more and more about the importance of \neducating health care providers and the public that chronic, \ndebilitating, terminal disease need not be associated with pain, major \ndiscomfort, and loss of control. We can control pain and treat \ndepression, as well as the other causes of suffering during the dying \nprocess. We must now apply this knowledge to assure all Americans \nappropriate end-of-life care. And to make sure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries are able to receive the most effective medicine to \ncontrol their pain, Medicare's coverage rules would be expanded under \nour bill to include coverage for self-administered pain medications.\n  Mr. President, I realize that there is still a lot of work to be \ndone. I believe our bill represents a significant step towards \nimproving end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries. By advocating \nchanges within the health care system, research community, and national \npolicy, we reaffirm our commitment to quality patient care. In our \nlegislation, we have set forth a broad framework to respond to many of \nthe concerns facing people at the end-of-life. This legislation \nembodies the fundamental principle of the Patient Self-Determination \nAct--to involve patients in their own treatment decisions and to \nrespect and follow their wishes when they are no longer capable of \nvoicing them.\n  To conclude, I am proud to offer this legislation with Senator \nCollins. We hope consideration of this bill will be an opportunity to \ntake notice of the many constructive steps that can be taken to address \nthe needs of patients and family members grappling with great pain and \nmedical difficulties. During this time when physician assisted suicide \nobtains so many headlines, we are eager to call on Congress to turn to \nthe alternative ways of providing help and relief to seniors and other \nAmericans who only are interested in such alternatives.\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing the \nAdvance Planning and Compassionate Care Act, which is intended to \nimprove the way we care for people at the end of their lives.\n  Noted health economist Uwe Reinhardt once observed that ``Americans \nare the only people on earth who believe that death is negotiable.'' \nAdvancements in medicine, public health, and technology have enabled \nmore and more of us to live longer and healthier lives. However, when \nmedical treatment can no longer promise a continuation of life, \npatients and their families should not have to fear that the process of \ndying will be marked by preventable pain, avoidable distress, or care \nthat is inconsistent with their values or wishes.\n  The fact is, dying is a universal experience, and it is time to re-\nexamine how we approach death and dying and how we care for people at \nthe end of their lives. Clearly, there is more that we can do to \nrelieve suffering, respect personal choice and dignity, and provide \nopportunities for people to find meaning and comfort at life's \nconclusion.\n  Unfortunately, most Medicare patients and their physicians do not \ncurrently discuss death or routinely make advance plans for end-of-life \ncare. As a result, about one-fourth of Medicare funds are now spent on \ncare at the end of life that is geared toward expensive, high-\ntechnology interventions and ``rescue'' care. While most Americans say \nthey would prefer to die at home, studies show that almost 80 percent \ndie in institutions where they may be in pain, and where they are \nsubjected to high-tech treatments that merely prolong suffering.\n  Moreover, according to a Dartmouth study conducted by Dr. Jack \nWennberg, where a patient lives has a direct impact on how that patient \ndies. The study found that the amount of medical treatment Americans \nreceive in their final months varies tremendously in the different \nparts of the country, and it concluded that the determination of \nwhether or not an older patient dies in the hospital probably has more \nto do with the supply of hospital beds than the patient's needs or \npreference.\n  The Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act is intended to help \nus improve the way our health care system serves patients at the end of \ntheir lives. Among other provisions, the bill makes a number of changes \nto the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 to facilitate appropriate \ndiscussions and individual autonomy in making difficult discussions \nabout end-of-life care. For instance, the legislation requires that \nevery Medicare beneficiary receiving care in a hospital or nursing \nfacility be given the opportunity to discuss end-of-life care and the \npreparation of an advanced directive with an appropriately trained \nprofessional within the institution. The legislation also requires that \nif a patient has an advanced directive, it must be displayed in a \nprominent place in the medical record so that all the doctors and \nnurses can clearly see it.\n  The legislation will expand access to effective and appropriate pain \nmedications for Medicare beneficiaries at the end of their lives. \nSevere pain, including breakthrough pain that defies usual methods of \npain control, is one of the most debilitating aspects of terminal \nillness. However, the only pain medication currently covered by \nMedicare in an outpatient setting is that which is administered by a \nportable pump.\n  It is widely recognized among physicians treating patients with \ncancer and other life-threatening diseases that self-administered pain \nmedications, including oral drugs and transdermal patches, offer \nalternatives that are equally effective in controlling pain, more \ncomfortable for the patient, and much less costly than the pump. \nTherefore, the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act would expand \nMedicare to cover self-administered pain medications prescribed for the \nrelief of chronic pain in life-threatening diseases or conditions.\n  In addition, the legislation authorizes the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to study end-of-life issues for Medicare and Medicaid \npatients and also to develop demonstration projects to develop models \nfor end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries who do not qualify for \nthe hospice benefit, but who still have chronic debilitating and \nultimately fatal illnesses. Currently, in order for a Medicare \nbeneficiary to qualify for the hospice benefit, a physician must \ndocument that the person has a life expectancy of six months or less. \nWith some conditions--like congestive heart failure--it is difficult to \nproject life expectancy with any certainty. However, these patients \nstill need hospice-like services, including advance planning, support \nservices, symptom management, and other services that are not currently \navailable.\n  Finally, the legislation establishes a telephone hotline to provide \nconsumer information and advice concerning advance directives, end-of-\nlife issues and medical decision making and directs the Agency for \nHealth Care Policy and Research to develop a research agenda for the \ndevelopment of quality measures for end-of-life care. In this regard,\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\nSenator Rockefeller and I are particularly appreciative that Senator \nBill Frist has incorporated our recommendation that end-of-life \nhealthcare be added as a priority population in the Agency for Health \nCare Policy and Research's overall mission and duties in the bipartisan \nlegislation he introduced last week to reauthorize the Agency.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important in \nlight of the current debate on physician-assisted suicide. The desire \nfor assisted suicide is generally driven by concerns about the quality \nof care for the terminally ill; by the fear of prolonged pain, loss of \ndignity and emotional strain on family members. Such worries would \nrecede and support for assisted suicide would evaporate if better \npalliative care and more effective pain management were widely \navailable.\n  Mr. President, patients and their families should be able to trust \nthat the care they receive at the end of their lives is not only of \nhigh quality, but also that it respects their desires for peace, \nautonomy and dignity. The Advanced Planning and Compassionate Care Act \nthat Senator Rockefeller and I are introducing today will give us some \nof the tools that we need to improve care of the dying in this country, \nand I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 629. A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act and the \nAgricultural Market Transition Act to provide for a safety net to \nproducers through cost of production crop insurance coverage, to \nimprove procedures used to determine yields for crop insurance, to \nimprove the noninsured crop assistance program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n               ``crop insurance improvement act of 1999''\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the \nintroduction of the Crop Insurance Improvement Act of 1999. Senator \nCraig and I are introducing this bill today to provide a safety net to \nour agricultural producers and make rural America stronger than ever.\n  I especially would like to thank Senator Craig's staff, Wayne Hammon, \nwho has worked diligently with my staff in bringing together this \nbipartisan effort for agriculture. I also compliment my colleagues \nSenators Kerry and Roberts who have introduced crop insurance reform \nlegislation, of which I am also a cosponsor, for setting the stage for \na major overhaul of the crop insurance program. This bill, the Crop \nInsurance Improvement Act of 1999 is designed to compliment their \nefforts by extending the safety net to help those producers of \nspeciality or alternative crops who find particular challenges in the \npresent system.\n  Now more than ever this crop insurance reform legislation is needed \nfor my state's leading industry.\n  Mr. President, agriculture is Montana's leading industry. More than \n100,000 Montanans work in farm and ranch related jobs. That is nearly \n20 percent of our state's total employment. In 1998, Montana \nagriculture generated $2.4 billion--65 percent of our state's total \neconomy. In Montana, agriculture is not only an integral part of our \neconomy, it's a way of life. And that way of life is in peril.\n  In 1998, Montana producers were hit hard as our ag exports dropped by \n$570 million, and commodities such as wheat and beef plummeted to \nDepression-era prices.\n  In response to this severe economic hit, we fought hard in the 105th \nCongress to install a safety net where the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill \nfell short. With help from the White House, we were able to get almost \n$8 billion in emergency assistance for our producers in Montana and \nacross the country. We responded to the crisis but there's no assurance \nthat we won't be faced with the same problems each year.\n  This bill is aimed at getting Montana producers back on their feet. \nWe do that by focusing on, and fighting for agriculture, together. I \nsincerely hope that 1999 will be the ``Year of Recovery.'' And I \nbelieve we can do this by maintaining focus on three goals:\n  We must pry open foreign markets to Montana products.\n  We must help agriculture producers at home.\n  We must install a permanent safety net to help producers weather \ntimes of crisis.\n  By aggressively pursuing these three goals, I am confident that we \ncan help Montana agriculture not only recover, but be stronger than \never before.\n  Today, however, I would like to focus on the goal of installing a \nsafety net to help producers during times of crisis.\n  Mr. President, no matter how well we are doing nationally and \ninternationally, we must be prepared for hard times. In 1996, Congress \npassed the Freedom to Farm Act. Since then, wheat prices have fallen 55 \npercent. Who could have predicted that prices would plunge from $4.50 a \nbushel for wheat in 1996 to $2.91 a bushel by September 1998? This \ndrop, triggered by a combination of natural disasters and oversupply in \nthe marketplace, was impossible to predict.\n  As wheat and other agricultural commodity prices dipped to record \nlows, America's producers were suddenly stranded without a safety net, \ncausing a severe financial crisis. This made it clear to me that we \nneed a contingency plan to help us when hard times come so that we can \ncontinue to grow when times are good.\n  In February I hosted a crop insurance field hearing in Shelby, \nMontana. Ken Ackerman, Director of the Risk Management Agency traveled \nfrom Washington, D.C. to meet with Montana producers to hear first hand \ntheir concerns about crop insurance. At that hearing some of Montana's \noutstanding producers shared their stories, their frustrations and \ntheir ideas about reforming the system. I would like to thank Rick \nSampsen, Bill Brewer, Verg Aageson, Brian Schweitzer, Nancy Peterson, \nRollie Schlepp, Scott Kulbeck and Mary Schuler for taking the time to \nlend their voices to this important discussion. Their ideas are \nreflected in this legislation today which will:\n  (1) Install a safety net;\n  (2) Allow producers to buy a policy that covers their cost of \nproduction;\n  (3) Shorten the Actual Production History requirement for rotated \ncrops; and\n  (4) Eliminate the Area Requirement for speciality crops reliant on \nthe Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP).\n  Simply put, Mr. President, the Crop Insurance Improvement Act of 1999 \ntakes decisive action to help those producers who are presently in \ndanger of losing their agricultural heritage. It provides them the \nflexibility to try new and alternative crops and gives them the freedom \nto farm, as originally intended, by allowing them the chance to build \nup a production history, cover their cost of production, and eventually \npurchase crop insurance coverage for their speciality crops. It gives \nproducers a chance to do what they do best--farm.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of all of my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation, and join Senators Craig and myself in getting \nrural America back on its feet.\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nSenator Baucus in the introduction of legislation to reform the federal \nagricultural crop insurance program. Like legislation introduced \nearlier this month by Senator Roberts, Kerrey, myself, and others, this \nbill aims at bringing about common sense reform to the program and will \nassist farmers through the economic hardship they currently face.\n  The bill addresses several concerns farmers from my state and I have \nabout the current crop insurance program. Specifically, I am pleased \nthat the legislation includes provisions to reform the noninsured crop \ndisaster assistance program, or NAP. NAP is used by farmers who grow \n``specialty'' or ``minor'' crops across the nation.\n  Idaho's great agricultural economy is based on minor and non-\ntraditional crops. We lead the nation in the production of such crops \nas potatoes, winter peas, and trout. Idaho is second in the production \nof seed peas, lentils, sugar beets, barley, and mint. Furthermore, we \nare in the top 5 states in the production of hops, onions, plums, sweet \ncherries, alfalfa, and American cheese. The needs of these producers \nare just as important as those of more traditional farm commodity \nproducers.\n  I believe this bill to be an important step toward meaningful and \nsweeping\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\nreform and includes changes that are long overdue. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the Senate Agricultural Committee to \nenact these important reforms and give farmers the risk management \ntools they need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Levin, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 631. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to eliminate the time \nlimitation on benefits for immunosuppressive drugs under the medicare \nprogram, to provide continued entitlement for such drugs for certain \nindividuals after medicare benefits end, and to extend certain medicare \nsecondary payer requirements; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              immunosuppressive Drug Coverage Act of 1999\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, for quite some time, I have worked \nwith the organ and tissue donation community to help educate others \nabout donation and transplant issues. With each organ that is \nsuccessfully transplanted, a gift of new life is given to the \nrecipient.\n  Today I rise to offer the Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage Act of 1999 \nto help ensure that those receiving Medicare covered transplants will \nbe able to afford the drugs necessary to keep their bodies from \nrejecting their new organs. The current 36-month Medicare coverage \nlimit is arbitrary, and frankly, sorely inadequate. We are not talking \nabout a car lease, but about a new lease on life. This coverage can \nmean the difference between life and death for some, and at the very \nleast, the difference between a Medicare transplant recipient having to \nexperience the pain of an organ rejection, a return to dialysis--for \nkidney recipients--and the return to a very long waiting list for \nanother organ.\n  These organs are a precious investment, and it simply defies logic \nthat Medicare covers the initial transplant, the life-long extensive \nmedical treatment that is needed if the organ is rejected, and a second \ntransplant (if that person is fortunate enough to find a second \norgan)--but not the drugs that can help prevent the rejection of the \ninitial transplanted organ beyond 36 months. Many Medicare transplant \nrecipients are not able to afford these immunosuppressive drugs, so \nthey may ration their use of the drugs or they may stop taking them \naltogether. Let's give them a third alternative--to keep taking the \ndrugs and to keep their organs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Graham, \n        Mr. Bond, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Burns, and \n        Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 632. A bill to provide assistance for poison prevention and to \nstabilize the funding of regional poison control centers; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n      poison control center enhancement and awareness act of 1999\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nPoison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act of 1999. These \npoison control centers need our help. The unstable sources of funding \nfor these centers have resulted in many of them having to close. This \nunfortunate decline can be reversed and cost savings can be achieved by \nthe efficient use of these centers. I would like to thank my colleague, \nSenator Abraham, for his efforts on behalf of this bill and I'd also \nlike to thank my colleagues on the Congressional Prevention Coalition, \nSenators Chafee and Graham of Florida, for their support of this \nlegislation.\n  This bill establishes and authorizes funding for a national toll-free \nnumber to ensure that all Americans have access to poison control \ncenter services. This number will be automatically routed to the center \ndesignated to cover the caller's region. By having to only remember one \nnational phone number, parents will be able to call this number in the \nevent their child accidentally swallows a poisonous substance while \nthey are away from home on vacation, and be routed to the closest \npoison control center for treatment advice. This system will improve \naccess to poison control center services for everyone. It will simplify \nefforts to educate parents and the public about what to do in the event \nof a poisoning exposure.\n  Each year, more than 2 million poisoning are reported to poison \ncontrol centers throughout the United States. More than 90% of these \npoisonings happen in the home--and over 50 percent of poisoning victims \nare children under 6 years of age. By providing expert advice to \ndistraught parents, babysitters, poisoning victims, and health care \nprofessionals, poison control centers decrease the severity of illness \nand prevent deaths.\n  These centers serve cost-effective public health services. For every \ndollar spent on poison control center services, $7 in medical costs are \nsaved by reducing the inappropriate services. Most importantly, we can \nsave lives by ensuring that stabilizing funding sources for these \ncenters. My home state of Ohio, for example, has 3 poison control \ncenters--one in Columbus, Cincinnati, and Cleveland--that rely on an \nuncertain patchwork of federal, state, local, and private funding \nsources. The federal dollars that will be provided by this legislation \nmay be used to supplement, NOT replace, existing federal, state, local, \nand private funds that are invested in these centers. For those states \nthat have recently experienced the closure of the only existing poison \ncontrol center in the area, this grant funding can be used to open a \nnew center--provided it can meet certification requirements. It is \nessential for us to act now to prevent further closures of such \nvaluable resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 633. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nrequire that investment decisions regarding the social security trust \nfunds be made on the basis of the best interests of beneficiaries, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         the social security trust fund management act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, there is no more worthy government \nobligation than ensuring that those who paid a lifetime of Social \nSecurity taxes will receive their full Social Security benefits. Social \nSecurity is our most important social program, a contract between the \ngovernment and its citizens. Americans, including one million \nMissourians, depend on this commitment.\n  Unfortunately, as you know, the Social Security system is facing some \nlong-term difficulties. While the Trust Funds are currently building up \nhealthy surpluses--$127 billion in FY 99--by 2013 these surpluses will \ndisappear, and by 2032 the system is facing bankruptcy.\n  With this impeding crisis in mind, I have embarked on a serious \nexamination of the Social Security system. I have spent many hours in \nthe last few months, analyzing the history and workings of this \nimportant program, in order to figure out how we can make this program \nwork better.\n  The result of this effort has been a package of important reforms \ndesigned to protect Social Security. This package is designed to \nprotect Social Security but, more importantly, it is designed to \nprotect the American people--from debt, from risky, unwise investments, \nfrom policies that unfairly deny Social Security to some seniors who \nchoose to work after retirement, and from attempts to use our \nretirement dollars on spending purposes other than Social Security. The \nSocial Security system has some imperfections that now make our long-\nterm situation worse than it should be, and my package is designed to \nimprove the system in the near term, so that we can begin the important \nwork of reforming Social Security for the long term.\n  One of the points I have already introduced. Last week, I introduced \nthe Protect Social Security Benefits Act. This legislation will prevent \nsurpluses in the Social Security Trust Funds from financing deficits in \nthe rest of the federal budget. Social Security should not finance \nirresponsible spending or tax cuts that are not otherwise paid for. No \nrules now stop deficit budgets from being considered. That must end.\n  In addition to the problem of the misdirection of Social Security's \nsurpluses, I also want to improve the way the funds are handled. There \nis no getting around the fact that a key to the long-term solvency of \nSocial Security is how the current mushrooming Social Security Trust \nFunds Management Act, which focuses on how the current Social Security \nsurplus is invested and managed.\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\n  The bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury, the Managing Trustee \nof Social Security, to consult with the Social Security Commissioner \nbefore decisions are made about investing the Social Security trust \nfunds. This additional step will preserve the independence of Social \nSecurity and make sure investment decisions are based on the best \ninterest of paying current and future benefits. Currently, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, who is by law the Managing Trustee, has the \nsole authority to invest Social Security surpluses, although the law \nlimits that authority to two types of government debt. Nowhere in \ncurrent law is the Managing Trustee or the Board of Trustees or the \nSocial Security Commissioner directed to make investment decisions on \nthe basis of protecting current and future benefits. Making sure that \nwe can pay benefits now and in the future should be the highest \npriority. My bill adds this important change to the law.\n  The Social Security Trust Funds Management Act explicitly forbids \nSocial Security Trust Funds from being invested in the stock market. \nChairman Alan Greenspan says that investing Social Security funds in \nthe market is bad for Social Security and bad for our economy. When \nAlan Greenspan talks, Congress ought to listen. The federal government \nshould not own corporate stocks and bonds. The government must not have \nundue influence over the market. In addition, having the government put \nSocial Security taxes in the stock market adds risk to retirement, and \nthat is a gamble I am unwilling to make for the one million Missourians \nwho now rely on Social Security. The Social Security Trust Funds \nManagement Act legislates that government will not gamble with Social \nSecurity in the stock market.\n  In addition, the bill requires Social Security to provide upon \nrequest--and, as soon as secure enough to ensure confidentiality, over \nthe Internet--more detailed information about individuals' contribution \nlevels and rates of return.\n  Let me explain the reasons for these three provisions.\n  In order to understand the investment of the Social Security Trust \nFunds, we must first answer the question, Where is the Social Security \nsurplus? This question helps us understand what the Social Security \nsurplus is, and is not. In truth, the Trust Funds have no money, only \ninterest-bearing notes. It would be foolish to have money in the trust \nfund that earned no interest or had no return. In return for the Social \nSecurity notes, Social Security taxes are sent to the U.S. Treasury and \nmingled with other government revenues, where the entire pool of cash \npays the government's day-to-day expenses. While the Trust Funds \nrecords now show a total of $857 billion in the fund, these assets \nexist only in the form of government securities, or debt. According to \nthe Washington Post, ``The entire Social Security Trust Fund, all \n[$857] billion or so of it, fits readily in four ordinary brown, \naccordion-style folders that one can easily hold in both hands. The 174 \ncertificates reside in a plain combination-lock filing cabinet on the \nthird floor of the bureau's office building.''\n  The placement of all of these funds into nonmarketable government \nsecurities raises some questions about the law that governs the \nmanagement of Social Security money. Under current law, Social Security \nis now an independent agency. Its Board of Trustees oversees the \nfinancial operations of Social Security. This Board is composed of six \nmembers: The Secretaries of Treasury, Labor, Health and Human Services, \nthe Commissioner of Social Security and two members of the public \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This Board \nreports annually to Congress on the financial status of the Trust \nFunds. The Secretary of Treasury is the Managing Trustee. The Managing \nTrustee has sole authority to invest the surplus trust funds not needed \nto pay current benefits. As for the investment of the fund, while the \nManaging Trustee is responsible for the investment, his investment \noptions are limited by law to two types of Federal Government debt \nsecurities.\n\n  The law directs the Managing Trustee to invest the surplus in \n``special issue non-marketable'' federal debt obligations, except where \nhe determines that the purchase of ``marketable securities is ``in the \npublic interest,'' not Social Security's interest. Sadly, it is all too \neasy to think of times when an administration strapped for funds might \nuse this power to act in the public interest, and not in the interest \nof Social Security. It`s even happened recently. In 1995, the Clinton \nAdministration used Federal employee pension funds to prevent the \ngovernment from breaching the debt limit during the two week Government \nshutdown.\n  Right now, about 99% of the securities in the trust funds are special \nissue non-marketable securities, and about 1% are marketable \nsecurities. These two types of bonds are similar in that they both \nrepresent government debt. They differ in that non-marketable \nsecurities are available only to the trust funds and not to the public \nand they pay a rate of interest that is calculated and set in law. \nMarketable securities, in contrast, are sold to the public at auction \nand pay the prevailing yield as determined by the marketplace.\n  This review of current law highlights three important points.\n  First, nowhere in current law is the Managing Trustee or the Board of \nTrustees or the Social Security Commissioner directed to make \ninvestment decisions on the basis of how to best protect payment of \ncurrent and future benefits, taking risk into account. This is \nunacceptable. The Social Security Trust Funds Management Act changes \nthis. This change is consistent with the legal concept that a trustee \nowes a fiduciary duty to act on behalf of the intended beneficiary, and \nexercises a heightened standard of care in management decisions and \nactions.\n  Second, although Social Security is an independent agency, the \nSecretary of Treasury retains sole authority to invest Social Security \nsurpluses. There is a conflict of responsibilities held by the \nSecretary of Treasury in his dual capacity as Managing Trustee of \nSocial Security. Presumably, the Trustee is to invest those funds as \nsecurely as possible, but also with the highest possible rate of \nreturn. The role of the Secretary of the Treasury is to manage the \nfinances of the United States Government, minimizing, to the extent \npossible, the interest charges that the government has to pay in the \nlong run. The problem is that the interest received by the trust fund \nis also interest that must be paid by the Treasury. If the Managing \nTrustee is maximizing Social Security's returns, he may not be \nminimizing the Treasury's interest obligations. And if he is minimizing \nthe Treasury's interest obligations, he may not be maximizing the \nreturns for the Social Security Trust Funds.\n  The Social Security Trust Funds Management Act is designed to resolve \nthis inherent conflict, and still be consistent with the principle that \nSocial Security is distinct from the Federal Government generally. The \nAct requires the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with the Social \nSecurity Commissioner before investment decisions are made. If the \nSocial Security Commissioner disagrees with investment decisions made \nby the Secretary, he or she must notify the President and Congress \nimmediately in writing.\n  Some experts believe that in some years and in certain market \nconditions it is preferable for the Trust Funds to buy marketable \nsecurities rather than non-market securities. A leading Missouri \ninvestment firm, Edward Jones, says the following:\n\n       Edward Jones believes that this idea has merit because it \n     provides additional flexibility to the management of the \n     federal debt. The use of marketable securities would not only \n     increase liquidity, but also would make bond swaps possible \n     (the exchange of one bond issue for another) which could \n     better facilitate management of the debt. It also could \n     reduce interest payments by targeting specific securities \n     when market conditions dictate.\n\n  Under the Social Security Trust Funds Management Act, the \nCommissioner of Social Security could so advise the Treasury Secretary. \nIf the Treasury Secretary does not accept the recommendation of the \nSocial Security Commissioner, the Commissioner has the duty to inform \nboth the President and to Congress.\n  These investment issues take on greater importance in the context of \nthe President's proposal to allow, for the first time in the history of \nSocial Security, as much as $700 billion in Social Security funds to be \ninvested in the stock market by the Government.\n  The legislation I am proposing reaffirms current law, making explicit\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\nwhat is now implicit that this kind of governmental meddling into \nprivate markets is forbidden. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nsays this idea is bad for Social Security and bad for our economy. As I \nsaid before, when Chairman Greenspan talks, Congress ought to listen. \nChairman Greenspan has said this plan ``will create a lower rate of \nreturn for Social Security recipients,'' and he ``does not believe that \nit is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from a \ngovernmental direction.'' The last thing this country needs is the \nFederal Government directing the investment of Social Security funds \nbased on some trendy politically-driven notion of which industries or \nwhich countries are in political favor at the moment.\n  The Government's putting Social Security taxes in the stock market \nadds risk to retirement and is a gamble I am unwilling to make for one \nmillion Missourians who get Social Security. This legislation puts \nCongress on record that Government will not gamble Social Security in \nthe stock market. While I understand the impulse to harness the great \npotential of the stock market, significant government involvement in \nthe stock market could tend toward economic nationalization, excess \ngovernment involvement in private financial markets, and short-term, \npolitically motivated investment decisions that could diminish Social \nSecurity's potential rate of return.\n\n  This scheme is dangerous. Imagine, if you will, what would happen if \nthe government had $2.7 billion in the market on Black Monday, October \n19, 1987, when the stock market lost 22% of its value. The trust fund's \nowners--America's current and future retirees--would have lost a \ncollective total of $633 billion. Imagine seniors who depend on Social \nSecurity watching TV news of the stock market collapse, wondering, even \nfearing, if their Social Security was in danger. While individuals \nproperly manage their financial portfolios to control risk, the \ngovernment has no business taking these gambles with the people's \nmoney.\n  Even President Clinton has expressed skepticism with this idea. In \nAlbuquerque last year, the President said the following: ``I think most \npeople just think if there is going to be a risk taken, I'd rather take \nit than have the government take it for me.'' He was right then, and he \nis wrong now. While Americans should invest as much as they can afford \nin private equities to plan for their own retirements, the government \nshould stay out of the stock market.\n  I recently received a letter from Todd Lawrence of Greenwood, \nMissouri, who wrote: ``It has been suggested that the government would \ninvest in the stock market with my Social Security money. No offense, \nbut there is not much that the Government touches that works well. Why \nwould making MY investment decisions for me be any different. Looking \nat it from a business perspective, would the owner of a corporation \nfeel comfortable if the government were the primary shareholder?'' Todd \nLawrence understands what President Clinton does not. No corporation \nwould want the government as a shareholder, and no investor should want \nthe government handling their investment.\n  The last provision of my bill gives Americans more information about \nhow much they can expect to receive from the Social Security system. \nWhile the Social Security Administration already provides helpful and \ncomprehensive information about future benefits, it does not provide \nmuch information about its costs or its rate of return. While the \nSocial Security's current practice of providing benefit information is \nuseful, it is not enough.\n  It is not fair to ask Americans to plan for retirement and not tell \nthem the actual cost or the opportunity costs of those benefits. As the \nAmerican people consider that further steps are necessary to reform \nSocial Security, they are entitled to accurate information about how \nwell their Social Security investments are doing.\n  This legislation would address this problem by requiring the Social \nSecurity Administration, upon request, to provide individuals' own rate \nof return information, and to make such information available over the \nInternet as soon as it is sufficiently secure to ensure beneficiary \nconfidentiality. Americans need to know the rate of return on Social \nSecurity. This information is vital for Americans in order for them to \nmake the right decisions about their own financial futures, as well as \nthe future of the Social Security program.\n  The Social Security Trust Funds Management Act is designed to protect \nthe Social Security Trust Funds. More importantly, it is designed to \nprotect the American people--from conflicts of interest, from bad \ninvestments, from misinformation, and from attempts to place the Trust \nFunds in risky and inappropriate investments. While I value the Social \nSecurity system, I value the American people, people like Todd Lawrence \nand the four million other Missourians who either pay into the Social \nSecurity system or receive Social Security benefits, more. My primary \nresponsibility is to them. My plan to protect the Social Security \nsystem will protect the American people first, and I will work to make \nsure that this package becomes law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 633\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to more \naccurately codify the depreciable life of printed wiring board and \nprinted wiring assembly equipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the printed circuit investment act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Grams, Lieberman, \nand Kyl, I introduce the Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1999. This \nbill would allow manufacturers of printed wiring boards and printed \nwiring assemblies, known as the electronic interconnection industry, to \ndepreciate their production equipment in 3 years rather than the 5 year \nperiod under current law.\n  As we approach the 21st century, our Nation's Tax Code should not \nstand in the way of technological progress. Printed wiring boards and \nassemblies are literally central to our economy, as they are the nerve \ncenters of nearly every electronic device from camcorders and \ntelevisions to medical devices, computers and defense systems. But the \nTax Code places U.S. manufacturers at the disadvantage relative to \ntheir Asian competitors, because of different depreciation treatment. \nThis disadvantage is particularly difficult for U.S. firms to bear, as \nthe interconnection industry consists overwhelmingly of small firms \nthat cannot easily absorb the costs inflicted by an irrationally-long \ndepreciated schedule.\n  As technology continues to advance at light speed, the exhilaration \nof competition in a dynamic market is dampened by the effects of a tax \ncode that has not kept pace with these changes. Obsolete \ninterconnection manufacturing equipment is kept on the books long after \nthis equipment has gone out the door. Companies with the competitive \nfire to enter such a rapidly-evolving industry must constantly invest \nin new state-of-the art equipment, replacing obsolete equipment every \n18 to 36 months just to remain competitive. U.S. investments in new \nprinted wiring board and assembly manufacturing equipment have nearly \ntripled since 1991--growing from $847 million to an estimated $2.4 \nbillion.\n  But this investment is taxed at an artificially-high rate, because \ndeductions for the cost of the equipment are spread over a period that \nis several years longer than justified. The industry is at the mercy of \ntax laws passed in the 1980s, which were based on 1970s-era electronics \ntechnology. It is no wonder that the market share of U.S. \ninterconnection companies has been cut in half over this period. Our \nTax Code should not continue to undermine the competitiveness of \nAmerican businesses. The opportunity is before us to correct the tax \nlaws that dictate how rapidly board manufacturers and electronic \nassemblers can depreciate equipment needed to fabricate and assemble \ncircuit boards.\n  The Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1999 will provide modest tax \nrelief to the electronics interconnection industry and the 250,000 \nAmericans, residing in every state in the Union, whose jobs rely on the \nsuccess of this industry. This industry should get fair and accurate \ntax treatment.\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 635\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to regulate the \ntransfer of firearms over the Internet, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                The Internet Gun Trafficking Act of 1999\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nInternet Gun Trafficking Act of 1999. The Act would plug a gaping \nloophole in the enforcement of federal firearms laws--the ability of \nfelons and minors to find guns for sale on-line and illegally acquire \nthose guns without detection.\n  The Internet affords computer users--including children and felons--\neasier-than-ever access to individuals offering firearms for sale. It \nalso facilitates firearms transactions in which sellers and buyers need \nnot meet face-to-face. For these reasons, individuals who are legally \nprohibited from purchasing or selling firearms can turn to the Internet \nto find others willing to engage in gun transactions with them--either \nknowing or not knowing of the illegality of such transactions. Unlike \nfirearms sales at gun dealerships and even gun shows, illegal Internet \nfirearms sales occur ``sight unseen,'' thus presenting significant \nenforcement challenges for federal, state and local authorities.\n  In particular, a number of Internet web-sites are designed \nspecifically to allow individuals who are not licensed firearms dealers \nto offer their firearms for sale. These individuals post phone numbers \nor e-mail addresses by which potential buyers may contact them. \nUnfortunately, the operators of these web-sites do not monitor the \ninteractions between firearms sellers and buyers. Thus, sellers and \nbuyers may with ``no-questions-asked'' and little prospect of detection \nevade laws prohibiting sales of certain types of firearms, prohibiting \nfirearms sales to felons and minors, and prohibiting the direct \nshipment of firearms to unlicensed persons.\n  Last month, eBay--a popular on-line auction site that had allowed \nusers to list firearms for sale--changed its policy to prohibit \nauctions selling firearms, explaining: ``The current laws governing the \nsale of firearms were created for the non-Internet sale of firearms. \nThese laws may work well in the real world, but they work less well for \nthe on-line trading of firearms, where the seller and the buyer rarely \nmeet face-to-face. The on-line seller cannot readily guarantee that the \nbuyer meets all the qualifications and complies with the laws governing \nthe sale of firearms.''\n  The Internet Gun Trafficking Act of 1999 would end the unlicensed \nsale of firearms using the Internet.\n  First, it would require anyone who operates an Internet web-site \nwhich offers firearms for sale or otherwise facilitates the sale of \nfirearms posted or listed on the web-site to become a federally \nlicensed firearms manufacturer, importer, or dealer. Currently, persons \nwho operate web-sites that post classified advertisements for the sale \nof hundreds of firearms need not be licensed under federal law, even \nthough such sales may be intricately linked to their trade or business \nand provide them with substantial profits. Requiring these persons to \nsecure a federal firearms license would, among other things, enable \nthem to more actively monitor firearms transactions facilitated by \ntheir web-sites.\n  Second, it would require anyone who operates an Internet web-site \nwhich offers firearms for sale or otherwise facilitates the sale of \nfirearms posted or listed on the web-site to notify the Secretary of \nthe Treasury of the address of the web-site. This requirement aims to \nfacilitate necessary law enforcement investigations of Internet \nfirearms sales.\n  Third, it would require anyone who operates an Internet web-site \nwhich posts or lists firearms for sale on behalf of other persons to \nserve as a ``middleman'' for any resulting gun transactions. Under the \nbill, the web-site operators in question would do this by, first, \nprohibiting the posting of information on these sites that would enable \nprospective firearms sellers and buyers to contact one another directly \n(such as phone numbers or e-mail addresses), and thus bypass \ninvolvement by web-site operators, and, second, requiring that all \nfirearms sold as a result of being listed on their web-sites be shipped \nto them, as federally licensed firearms dealers, rather than directly \nto the buyers. Once the operator of the web-site received a firearm \nfrom the seller, it would have to comply with federal firearms laws in \ntransferring the firearm to the buyer, including laws requiring that \nfirearms be shipped to a licensed dealer in an unlicensed buyer's state \nrather than directly to an unlicensed buyer.\n  And fourth, it would prohibit unlicensed individuals who offer \nfirearms for sale on ``gun show'' web-sites from shipping firearms sold \nas a result of being listed on such web-sites to anyone other than the \nweb-site operator.\n  Certainly, there is much to embrace about the Internet. It \nfacilitates commercial competition and places a wealth of valuable and \nformerly inaccessible information at the fingertips of computer users. \nBut as we praise this important new medium of communication and \ncommerce, we cannot afford to ignore its potential for facilitating \nillegal and dangerous conduct. I believe that the Internet Gun \nTrafficking Act of 1999 is a measured and appropriate response to the \nchallenges posed by the Internet to the enforcement of federal firearms \nlaws. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 637\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(i), the person--\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\n       ``(I) enters such information about the firearm as the \n     Secretary may require by regulation into a separate bound \n     record;\n       ``(II) in transferring the firearm to any transferee, \n     complies with the requirements of this chapter as if the \n     firearm were being transferred from the business inventory of \n     that person; and\n       ``(III) if the prospective transferor does not provide the \n     person with a certified copy of a valid firearms license \n     issued to the prospective transferor under this chapter, \n     submits to the Secretary a report of the transfer or other \n     disposition of the firearm on a form specified by the \n     Secretary, which report shall not include the name of, or any \n

Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. \nTorricelli) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 62\n\n       Whereas cervical cancer annually strikes approximately \n     15,000 American women;\n       Whereas cervical cancer strikes 1 out of 50 American women;\n       Whereas estimates show that physicians will diagnose more \n     than 150,000 American women with cervical cancer during the \n     1990's;\n       Whereas according to the National Cancer Institute \n     Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, the 5-\n     year survival rate of cervical cancer victims is 91 percent \n     when physicians detect the cancer at an early stage;\n       Whereas cervical cancer is preventable, yet remains one of \n     the leading causes of death among American women;\n       Whereas according to the United States Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, the mortality rate among American \n     women with cervical cancer declined between 1960 and 1997, \n     yet recently began to rise;\n       Whereas cervical cancer survivors show tremendous courage \n     and determination in the face of adversity; and\n       Whereas it is important that the United States support \n     individuals with cervical cancer, as well as their families \n     and loved ones, through public awareness and education \n     programs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the month of January 1999 as ``National \n     Cervical Health Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     month with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in an effort to help increase \nawareness and education about cervical cancer, and to pay tribute to \nwomen who have battled the disease, today I am submitting a Senate \nResolution to designate the month of January as ``National Cervical \nHealth Month.'' I am pleased that Senator Dianne Feinstein and 31 \nbipartisan colleagues in the Senate have agreed to be original co-\nsponsors of this Senate Resolution. I understand that Representative \nJuanita Millender-McDonald will be introducing similar legislation in \nthe United States House of Representatives, and I would like to commend \nher for the leadership she has shown in this important effort.\n  I would also like to pay tribute to Ms. Carol Ann Armenti, Director \nof the Center for Cervical Health in Toms River, New Jersey. Ms. \nArmenti has worked tirelessly on behalf of cervical cancer patients and \ntheir families, and she has been a true leader in educating women about \nthis disease. In January, her organization, along with the American \nMedical Women's Association, launched the National Cervical Cancer \nPublic Education Campaign. The leadership of Ms. Armenti will have a \nlasting impact upon the lives of women of today, and future generations \nwill be the beneficiaries of her work.\n  Mr. President, the issue of cervical cancer is one which is deeply \npersonal to my wife, Priscilla, and to me. In 1990, our daughter, \nDebbie, was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Because of our family \nhistory with cancer, Debbie was aware that she had an increased risk of \ncancer and she made sure to take advantage of early detection screening \nprocedures. Fortunately, her cervical cancer was detected at an early \nstage, and she was treated successfully with surgery. Not long after \nher treatment, she have birth to our third grandson. Debbie's \nexperience with cervical cancer exemplifies the fact that early \ndetection saves lives.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1,000 women in \nFlorida will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1999. This year, \nFlorida will have the third largest number of new cases of cervical \ncancer. Yet, despite significant progress being made in the war on \ncancer, not all segments of the U.S. population have benefitted to the \nfullest extent from the advances made in the understanding of cancer. \nAccording to the U.S. Institute of Medicine report, ``The Unequal \nBurden of Cancer,'' rates of cervical cancer are significantly higher \nin Hispanic and African-American women. We simply must reinforce our \nefforts to eradicate this terrible disease.\n  Research, education, and early detection are the most effective \nweapons we have in the war on cervical cancer.\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\n  Research is the key to finding a cure for cervical cancer, and \nsignificant progress is being made in this regard. Last month, the \nNational Cancer Institute (NCI) took the rarely-used step of issuing a \nClinical Announcement urging physicians to give strong consideration to \nadding chemotherapy to radiation therapy in the treatment of invasive \ncervical cancer. According to NCI Director Rick Klausner, this will \nlikely change the standard of treatment for cervical cancer. Dr. \nMitchell Morris of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center called this new \ntreatment approach, ``the first fundamental advance in the treatment of \ncervical cancer in more than 40 years.''\n  I'm also proud to say that several cutting-edge cervical cancer \nstudies are taking place in my home state of Florida. Scientists at the \nUniversity of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center are studying a new type of \ncervical cancer immunotherapy. They are developing ``killer cells'' \nspecifically designed to target cancer cells which express human \npapilloma virus (HPV). By eradicating these cells, the hope is to kill \nthe tumor, even if the cancer has spread. At the H. Lee Moffitt \nComprehensive Cancer Center in Tampa, studies are underway to develop a \ncervical cancer vaccine using some of the same characteristics of the \nhuman papilloma virus. They are also examining biomarkers to detect \ncervical cancer before malignant changes occur.\n  The U.S. Senate and House, working in bipartisan cooperation, have \nembarked upon an historic mission to double funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health over the next five years. Last year, the Congress \noverwhelmingly passed, with bipartisan support, a $2 billion increase \nfor the National Institutes of Health--the largest increase in NIH \nhistory.\n  With the tremendous progress being made in cervical cancer and other \ndiseases, I was astonished and extremely disappointed the President's \nFY 2000 budget only calls for a meager 2.6% increase for medical \nresearch at the NIH. This is simply unacceptable. The President's \nproposed budget means a cease-fire in the war against cancer, \nParkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other illnesses. In \neffect, the President's proposal is a formal act of retreat in the heat \nof battle.\n  I was also shocked that the President's FY 2000 budget calls for not \none additional penny of funding for the Breast and Cervical Cancer \nScreening program at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. \nFor FY 1999, the bipartisan Congress provided a $16 million increase. \nBy contrast, the President's request for FY 1999 was for an increase of \nless than $1 million for this life-saving program, and he proposes no \nincrease for next year.\n  When it comes to cervical cancer research and screening, the \nPresident just doesn't get it. It's obvious the leadership on these \ninitiatives will have to come from this end of Pennsylvania Avenue. It \nwill be through the bipartisan commitment of the Senate and House that \nthese important research and detection programs will receive adequate \nfunding. I want to pledge my support, and to work with my colleagues in \nCongress to make sure this happens. Far too many lives depend upon it.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to co-sponsor this \nresolution to designate January as ``National Cervical Health \nMonth.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2779-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 63--RECOGNIZING AND HONORING JOE DiMAGGIO\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Helms, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. Schumer) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, on May 1-3, 1999 more than 1,200 \nstudents from across the United States will be in Washington DC to \ncompete in the national finals of the ``We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution'' program. I am proud to announce that a class \nfrom Corner High School from the city of Warrior will represent my home \nstate of Alabama in this national event. These young scholars have \nworked diligently to reach the national finals and through their \nexperience have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the \nfundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program \nis the most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress. These hearings consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. \nThe students testify as constitutional experts before a ``congressional \ncommittee,'' that is, the panel of judges representing various regions \nof the country and a variety of appropriate professional fields. The \nstudent testimony is followed by a period of questioning during which \nthe judges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability \nto apply their constitutional knowledge.\n  The student team from Corner High School is currently conducting \nresearch and preparing for the upcoming national competition in \nWashington, DC. I am extremely proud of the students and teacher and \nwish them the best of luck at ``We the People'' national finals. I look \nforward to greeting them when they visit Capitol Hill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2781-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PHIL LERMAN\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute \nto my friend, Phil Lerman, who recently passed away. Throughout his \nlifetime, Phil was a steadfast advocate for civil rights. Perhaps most \nimpressive, is the number of different avenues Phil marched down to \npromote the ideals of equal justice. As a former union representative, \nstate official, businessman, founder and director of the employment and \ntraining institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Phil \nhelped to promote racial and social justice throughout the state of \nWisconsin.\n  Phil said that he learned his ``strategizing and speechifying,'' as \nhe called it, for civil rights from his father. In a 1997 interview, \nPhil stated ``I learned to respect people as people. Color meant \nnothing.'' Perhaps it was this respect that caused Phil to devote time \nto preforming countless acts of community service, such as donating \nfree tires to the vehicles that carried so many civil rights marchers.\n  Phil was an inspiration to the entire state. I am sure those in the \ngreater Milwaukee area will miss his guidance and helpful advice. \nHowever, I am proud to remember, and of course repeat, his well-worn \nstatement, ``a house doesn't care who lives there.'' I can only hope \nthat we will someday translate this ideal into reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2781-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 43rd ANNIVERSARY OF TUNISIA'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the \nforty-third anniversary of Tunisia's independence. Although Tunisia \nreceived its independence in 1956, America has maintained close ties \nwith Tunisia since 1797. This historic partnership has promoted peace \nand cooperation between our two countries.\n  In America's early years, Tunisia provided important commercial \nadvantages and a safe harbor for American vessels establishing maritime \ntrade in the Mediterranean. During America's darkest hour, the Civil \nWar, Tunisia supported the anti-slavery movement, and its leaders \nconversed with American officials on the significance of human dignity.\n  During World War II, Tunisia continued to fight for the values of the \nfree world by supporting American and Allied forces as they landed in \nNorth Africa. After the war, Tunisia sought American support for its \nindependence; and in 1956, the United States was the first world power \nto recognize Tunisia's newly won sovereignty.\n  Since that time, the United States and Tunisia have garnered further \nachievements in bilateral cooperation. Impressive strides have been \ntaken in advancing the development of Tunisia, as well as sustaining \nfurther security and stability in all relations. Tunisia and the United \nStates have also been important allies in striving for progress towards \npeace in the Middle East.\n  As the relationship between Tunisia and the United States continues \nto grow, I believe it is important that we take time to observe this \nimportant milestone. In echoing the historic words of President Dwight \nEisenhower, it is my sincere hope and desire that Tunisia continues to \nconsider the United States as its friend and partner in \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2781-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DUKE ELLINGTON\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the 100th birthday of one of the greatest \nAmerican Jazz musicians and composers this country has seen, Duke \nEllington. Duke's contributions to today's music are immeasurable, and \nhis hundreds of compositions, including ``Satin Doll'' and ``Take the \nA-Train,'' are all time classics. Jazz and all genres of music will \nforever be influenced by the sophisticated, yet emotional and spiritual \nsound of Duke Ellington's music.\n  Born in a segregated Washington, DC neighborhood, Edward Kennedy \n``Duke'' Ellington, achieved an enduring legacy and popularity that has \nnot been equaled or exceeded. He developed his talent during the Harlem \nRenaissance period and became one of the top five band leaders from \n1926-74. Duke's contribution to music can be summed up best by Miles \nDavis: ``All musicians should get down on their knees once a year and \nthank the Lord for Duke Ellington.''\n  Duke was the first jazz composer to produce extended compositions, \nsuch as ``Creole Rhapsody'' and ``Reminiscing in Tempo'' as well as a \nseries of long works like ``Jump for Joy,'' ``Black, Brown, and \nBeige,'' and ``A Drum is a Woman.'' He wrote for large orchestras, \nsmall combos, vocalists, choirs, movies, theater, church and \nnightclubs. He produced thousands of songs for more than fifty years, \nwhich are still as fresh and vibrant today as they were when he wrote \nthem decades ago.\n  It is my honor to express an enthusiastic tribute to this jazz legend \nduring this year-long celebration of his amazing contributions to \nAmerican music.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2781-5", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2781-S2782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNITION OF THE 160TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL SOCIETY\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \nsalute the Georgia Historical Society, which on March 20, 1999 will \ncelebrate 160 years of collecting and preserving our rich history for \nall Georgians.\n  The Georgia Historical Society was chartered in 1839 by the Georgia \nGeneral Assembly and currently has more than 5,000 members from all \nacross Georgia and the entire nation. As a non-profit organization, the \nSociety remains the oldest cultural institution in the State of Georgia \nand is one of the oldest organizations in our country. For sixteen \ndecades the Society has collected, preserved and shared Georgia's rich \nhistory with many Georgians through various educational outreach \nprograms and research services.\n  The Georgia Historical Society's archives and library are operated in \ncooperation with the office of Georgia's Secretary of State. During my \nyears as Secretary of State I relied on the Georgia Historical Society \non numerous occasions for valuable information concerning our State's \nhistory, and I truly believe that the Society is a real treasure that \nall of us should use and enjoy.\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nThe Society has the most extensive collection in the country of \nmanuscripts, books, maps, photographs, newspapers, architectural \ndrawings, portraits and artifacts related to Georgia's history that \ndate back to the founding of the Colony and continue through the \ntwentieth century.\n  The Georgia Historical Society stays in close contact with the \ncitizens it serves so well. Since the founding of the Colony of Georgia \nat Savannah on February 12, 1733 by James Edward Oglethorpe, Georgians \nhave celebrated this historical date. This year the Georgia Historical \nSociety and the Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools continued this \ntradition by organizing and hosting the Georgia Heritage Celebration on \nThursday, February 12, 1999. As part of the Celebration the Society \nhonors Georgians who have made a positive impact on the state. This \nyear's honoree was Peter Tonedd, who was a master carpenter and tavern \nowner. Previous honorees have included James Jackson, Revolutionary War \nhero, U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator and Governor of Georgia; Mary \nTelfair, philanthropist in the arts and medicine; Abraham Baldwin, \nsigner of the Declaration of Independence; Juliette G. Low, Founder of \nthe Girl Scouts; Andrew Bryan, a Baptist minister; and James \nOglethorpe.\n  The Society also holds monthly lectures on a wide variety of \nhistorical topics and yearly conferences focusing on local communities, \nand conducts special tours at various historical locations across \nGeorgia. The Georgia Historical Society also publishes books and a \nquarterly news magazine, Footnotes, on Georgia's history and genealogy, \nas well as The Georgia Historical Quarterly, a journal on Georgia's \nhistory that was established in 1917.\n  I would especially like to commend the Georgia Historical Society for \ndiligently working on behalf of all Georgians in the historical \npreservation of our State's history. The Society provides a vast \ncollection of records and artifacts to thousands of researchers and \ngenealogists from around the world.\n  I applaud the Georgia Historical Society for preserving and teaching \nour State's history. We must not allow the pride and glory of our State \nand our Nation to be forgotten--it must be celebrated by all. The \nbenefits of enriching the people of Georgia by promoting a better \nunderstanding of our past and who we are as Georgians must not be \nignored.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in \nrecognizing and honoring the dedication and hard work of the Georgia \nHistorical Society during the past 160 years. The efforts put forth by \nthe Society have preserved and will continue to preserve our rich \nhistory by ensuring a future for Georgia's past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2782-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GEORGE MOSSE\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sorrow \nover the loss of my friend, and former teacher, George Mosse. George \nwas truly an extraordinary man, a great humanist and a wonderful \nteacher. While his 25 books were influential, he would not want us to \nforget that we were almost deprived of his brilliance. Lucky for us, \nGeorge was able to escape the Nazis at age 19 by way of Switzerland.\n  I had the honor of studying under George at the University of \nWisconsin-Madison. His lectures were unique in both their style and \nsubject. George first developed his dynamic, bellowing style while at \nthe University of Iowa, where he taught classes of up to 1,000 \nstudents. He is perhaps best known for his work on Nazi Germany, but \nhis later work on subjects like national symbols and monuments was \nequally as impressive.\n  In addition to his countless articles and essays, George was simply a \nwonderful teacher. His challenging and invigorating teaching style \ncompelled his students to learn. I think many of his students naively \ntook for granted his endless lack of energy and ideas. This expectation \nis understandable given his almost ritualistic process of exploring a \nnew and dynamic area of study each decade. The University of Wisconsin, \nand the field of history, have truly lost an asset, but his work will \nsurely live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2782-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE ASSASSINATION OF ROSEMARY NELSON\n\n   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, tomorrow is St. Patrick's Day. \nAnd in a few days, we will celebrate the first anniversary of the Good \nFriday peace accord, which our esteemed former colleague, George \nMitchell, negotiated, and which promises to resolve and heal one of the \noldest conflicts in Europe: Northern Ireland. Now comes the distressing \nnews that a car bomb has taken the life of Rosemary Nelson, a prominent \nRoman Catholic human rights lawyer. A group known as the ``Protestant \nRed Hand Defenders,'' outlawed earlier this month for bomb and grenade \nattacks, has claimed responsibility for this heinous and cowardly act.\n  These dissidents, and others like them--both Protestant and Roman \nCatholic--are determined to prevent peace. They claim they act on \nreligious principles but, in fact, they worship only violence. \nFortunately, they are the minority. Northern Ireland is on the path to \npeace.\n  Rosemary Nelson was 40. She was married and had three children. She \nwas murdered because she represented nationalists in high profile \ncases, including the Roman Catholic residents of the Garvaghy Road area \nin Portadown who asked, simply, that Protestant unionists pick some \nother place to march.\n  Last September, Ms. Nelson testified before the House International \nRelations Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. \nShe spoke about the harassment and intimidation of defense lawyers who \nrepresent Republicans and nationalists, and she accused the Royal \nUlster Constabulary (RUC) of threatening her and her family.\n  These are serious charges. Unfortunately, she is not alone. Last \nyear, I met with Sean McPhilemy, author of The Committee: Political \nAssassination in Northern Ireland. The book, based on a documentary \nshown on British television in 1991, charges that current and former \nmembers of the RUC have colluded with Loyalist terrorists to murder \nIrish Republicans and nationalists. McPhilemy struck me as an earnest, \nprincipled, and exceedingly careful journalist--married to a \nProtestant, by the way.\n  Tomorrow, Senators Dodd, Kennedy, Mack, and I, and our House \ncolleagues--Speaker of the House Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, and \nCongressman Walsh--will release our annual ``Friends of Ireland \nExecutive Committee St. Patrick's Day Statement.'' In that statement, \nwe will express our concern about protection for lawyers active on \nhuman rights cases, and bring to attention a report on the subject by \nthe Special Rapporteur of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.\n  Attacks on the judiciary--whether on judges, lawyers, officers of the \ncourts, or witnesses--are intolerable and represent, perhaps, the \ngravest threat to the fragile peace which now prevails, tenuously, over \nNorthern Ireland. There can be no permanent peace in Northern Ireland \nif these charges regarding the RUC are true. RUC complicity in \npolitical assassinations would be state-sponsored terrorism.\n  Authorities in Northern Ireland need to catch and prosecute Rosemary \nNelson's murderers, and they need to ensure that members of the RUC did \nnot aid and abet these cowards. The RUC needs to go under a microscope. \nIf there are problems, a new law enforcement authority, which has the \nunquestioned support of nationalists and unionists, needs to be \nestablished.\n  Rosemary Nelson saw the seeds of peace planted in Northern Ireland. I \nhope and pray that her three children will live to see those seeds \nblossom into something permanent and beautiful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/16/senate-section/article/S2782-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 63, introduced \nearlier today by Senators Moynihan, Lott, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:.\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 63) recognizing and honoring Joe \n     DiMaggio.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. ``Joe, Joe DiMaggio, we want you on our side!'' Well, \nhe is on the other side now, but stays with us in our memories.\n  Mine are, well, special to me. It would be in 1938 or 1939 in \nManhattan. The Depression lingered. Life was, well, life. But there was \neven so somebody who made a great difference and that was Lou Gehrig of \nthe New York Yankees. I admired him as no other man. Read of him each \nday, or so it seemed, in the Daily News. And yet I had never seen him \nplay. One summer day my mother somehow found the needful sixty cents. \nFifty cents for a ticket at the Stadium, a nickel for the subway up and \nback. Off I went in high expectation. But Gehrig, disease I must assume \nwas now in progress, got no hit. A young player I had scarce noticed \nhit a home run. Joe DiMaggio. It began to drizzle, but they kept the \ngame going just long enough so there would be no raincheck. I went home \nlifeless and lay on my bed desolate.\n  Clearly I was in pain, if that is the word. The next day my mother \nsomehow came up with yet another sixty cents. Up I went. And the exact \nsame sequence occurred.\n  I went home. But not lifeless. To the contrary, animated.\n  For I hated Joe DiMaggio. For life.\n  I knew this to be a sin, but it did not matter. Gehrig retired, then \ndied. My animus only grew more animated.\n  Thirty years and some went by. I was now the United States Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations. One evening I was having dinner \nat an Italian restaurant in midtown. As our company was about finished, \nwho walked in but DiMaggio himself, accompanied by a friend. They took \na table against the wall opposite. I watched. He looked over, smiled \nand gave a sort of wave. Emboldened, as we were leaving, I went over to \nshake hands. He rose wonderfully to the occasion.\n  I went out on 54th Street as I recall. And of a sudden was struck as \nif by some Old Testament lightening. ``My God,'' I thought, ``he has \nforgiven me!'' He must have known about me all those years, but he \nreturned hate with love. My soul had been in danger and he had rescued \nme.\n  Still years later, just a little while ago the Yankees won another \npennant. Mayor Guiliani arranged a parade from the Battery to City \nHall. Joe was in the lead car; I was to follow. As we waited to get \nstarted, I went up to him, introduced myself and told of having watched \nhim at the Stadium these many years ago. ``But I have to tell you,'' I \nadded, ``Lou Gehrig was my hero.''\n  ``He was my hero, too,'' said Joe.\n  Well, Joe, too, was a hero to many people. Few have embodied the \nAmerican dream or created a more enduring legend than ``Joltin'' Joe \nDiMaggio. And fewer have carried themselves, both on and off the field, \nwith the pride and courtliness of, as Hemingway said, ``the great \nDiMaggio.''\n  Born the fourth son of an immigrant fisherman--two other brothers \nalso played in the majors--he joined the Yankees in 1936 after dropping \nout of high school and grew into the game's most complete center \nfielder. He wore No. 5 and became the heir to Babe Ruth (No. 3) and Lou \nGehrig (No. 4) in the team's pantheon. DiMaggio was the team's \nsuperstar, on a team of superstars, for 13 seasons. By the time his \ncareer ended in 1951, he had played in 11 All-Star games and 10 World \nSeries, nine of which the Yankees won.\n  The ``Yankee Clipper'' was acclaimed at baseball's centennial in 1969 \nas ``the greatest living ballplayer.'' Even his main rival Ted \nWilliams, admitted this: ``. . . he [DiMaggio] was the greatest \nbaseball player of our time. He could do it all.'' DiMaggio played \n1,736 games with the Yankees. He had a career batting average of .325 \nand hit 361 home runs while striking out only 369 times. He could \nindeed do it all.\n  But there is one statistic for which DiMaggio will be most \nremembered: his 56-game hitting streak, possibly the most enduring \naccomplishment in all of sports. The streak began on May 15, 1941, with \na single in four at-bats against the Chicago White Sox, and ended 56 \ngames later on July 17 during a hot night in Cleveland. In 56 games, \nDiMaggio had gone to bat 223 times and delivered 91 hits, including 15 \nhome runs, for a .408 average. He drew 21 walks, twice was hit by \npitched balls, scored 56 runs, and knocked in 55. He hit in every game \nfor two months, striking out just seven times.\n  But DiMaggio's game was so complete and elegant that statistics \ncannot do it justice. The New York Times said in an editorial when he \nretired, ``The combination of proficiency and exquisite grace which Joe \nDiMaggio brought to the art of playing center field was something no \nbaseball averages can measure and that must be seen to be believed and \nappreciated.''\n  Today, I join the Majority Leader and Senators Charles Schumer (D-\nNY), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Jim H. Bunning \n(R-KY) in introducing a resolution that honors Joe DiMaggio for his \nstoried baseball career and for all that he has done off the field. As \nwe reflect on his life and mourn his death, I ask that we consider \nourselves extremely lucky for knowing such a man, particularly in this \nage of pampered sports heroes, when ego and self-importance often \novershadow what is occurring on the field. Even I, who resented \nDiMaggio for displacing my hero Gehrig, have come to realize that there \nwill never be another like Joseph Paul DiMaggio.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the March 9, 1999, New York Times \neditorial and George F. Will's op-ed in the Washington Post on Joe \nDiMaggio be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 9, 1999]\n\n                         The DiMaggio Mystique\n\n       It has been almost half a century since Joe DiMaggio turned \n     his center-field kingdom in Yankee Stadium over to a \n     strapping youngster named Mickey Mantle, but even now, in \n     death, Joe DiMaggio still owns that green acreage. He roamed \n     the great open spaces there with a grace and grandeur that \n     redefined the art of fielding. Even more than the prolific \n     hitting that earned him enduring fame, his silky, seemingly \n     effortless motion across the outfield grass was the signature \n     of his game.\n       DiMaggio was one of those rare sports stars, like Babe \n     Ruth, Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan, who not only set new \n     standards of athletic excellence but also became a \n     distinctive part of American culture. As stylish off the \n     field as on, DiMaggio was an icon of elegance and success, a \n     name as recognizable on Broadway and in Hollywood as at the \n     ball park. Millions of baby boomers who never saw DiMaggio \n     play instantly understood the reference in the Paul Simon \n     song of the 1960's--``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A \n     nation turns its lonely eyes to you.''\n       Other men have hit the ball farther and run the bases \n     faster, but few have excelled at so many elements of the \n     sport. DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak in 1941 remains \n     untouched, one of the great benchmarks of consistency and \n     productivity in all of sports. In 13 seasons with the \n     Yankees, DiMaggio produced a career batting average of .325, \n     hit 361 home runs and knocked in more than 100 runs in a \n     season nine times. He played in 10 World Series, 9 of which \n     the Yankees won. He possessed one of the sweetest swings \n     baseball has ever seen, a hitting stroke of such precision \n     that he struck out only 369 times in his major league career.\n       But the numbers alone do not explain the DiMaggio mystique. \n     Part of it was his brief, turbulent marriage to Marilyn \n     Monroe and his taste for nightclubs and tony hotels. Part of \n     it was his $100,000-a-year salary, a small fortune in his \n     days as a Yankee. For younger fans, there was also an almost \n     mystical link to the past--DiMaggio joined the Yankees in \n     1936, just two years after Babe Ruth left and before Lou \n     Gehrig retired. His appearance on ceremonial occasions at \n     Yankee Stadium in recent years was thrilling for fans of all \n     ages.\n       His fame also flowed from the aura of quiet dignity that \n     DiMaggio carefully preserved throughout his career and \n     retirement. With the notable exception of his service as a \n     pitchman for the Bowery Savings Bank and Mr. Coffee brewing \n     appliances, he dodged the celebrity limelight. The mystery \n     only added to his allure.\n       DiMaggio, who was 84, died with opening day a month away. \n     Though he will no longer return to Yankee Stadium to deliver \n     the ceremonial first pitch, his singular record of\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\n     athletic achievement and classy conduct will be long revered.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                (From the Washington Post, Mar. 9, 1999]\n\n                       DiMaggio's Elegant Career\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       There is peculiar pathos to the lives of most great \n     athletes because their careers compress life's trajectory of \n     aspiration, accomplishment and decline. Then what? For most, \n     the rest of life, which is most of life, is anticlimax, like \n     that of\n       Runners whom renown outran,\n       And the name died before the man,\n       But there was seamlessness to Joe DiMaggio's life in and \n     after the game. The patina of age did not dull the luster of \n     his name. Baseball, sport of the long season and much \n     history, has an unusually rich statistical geology--a \n     sediment of numbers. Some numbers are so talismanic that \n     simply citing them suffices to identify the achievement and \n     achiever.\n       Examples are 116 (victories in a season, 1906 Cubs); 511 \n     (career victories, Cy Young); 1.12 (season earned run \n     average, Bob Gibson, 1968); 130 (stolen bases in a season, \n     Rickey Henderson, 1982); 755 (home runs, career, Hank Aaron); \n     60, then 61 and now 70 (home runs by Babe Ruth in 1927, Roger \n     Maris in 1961 and Mark McGwire in 1998); .406 (most recent \n     .400 season, Ted Williams, 1941). And baseball's most \n     instantly recognized number, 56--Joe DiMaggio's consecutive \n     game hitting streak in 1941.\n       The Streak, as it is still known, was stunning, even if a \n     sympathetic official scorer at Yankee Stadium may have turned \n     an error or two into hits. It took two sensational plays by \n     Indians third baseman Ken Keltner to stop The Streak, and the \n     next day DiMaggio started a 16-game streak. His 56 has not \n     been seriously challenged in 57 seasons. His 1993 minor \n     league streak of 61 has not been matched since then.\n       Because of baseball's grinding everydayness, professionals \n     place a premium on consistency. DiMaggio brought his best, \n     which was baseball's best, to the ballpark every day. What he \n     epitomized to a mesmerized nation in 1941--steely will, \n     understated style, heroism for the long haul--the nation \n     would need after Dec. 7.\n       However, the unrivaled elegance of his career is defined by \n     two numbers even more impressive than his 56. They are 8 and \n     0.\n       Eight is the astonishingly small difference between his 13-\n     year career totals for home runs (361) and strikeouts (369). \n     (In the 1986 and 1987 season, Jose Canseco hit 64 home runs \n     and struck out 332 times.) Zero is the number of times \n     DiMaggio was thrown out going from first to third.\n       On the field, the man made few mistakes. Off the field, he \n     made a big one in his marriage to Marilyn Monroe. But even it \n     enlarged his mythic status. As when they were in Japan, and \n     she visited U.S. troops in Korea. Upon her return to Tokyo, \n     she said to him, ingenuously: You've never heard cheering \n     like that--there must have been fifty or sixty thousand. He \n     said, dryly: Oh, yes I have.\n       They had gone to Japan at the recommendation of a friend \n     (Lefty O'Doul, manager of the San Francisco Seals), who said \n     that in a foreign country they could wander around without \n     drawing crowds. The friend did not know that Japan was then \n     obsessed with things American, especially baseball stars and \n     movie stars. When the most famous of each category landed, it \n     took their car six hours to creep to their hotel through more \n     than a million people.\n       As a Californian, he represented baseball's future--he and \n     San Diego's Ted Williams, a 21-year-old rookie in 1939, when \n     DiMaggio was 24. DiMaggio, son of a San Francisco fisherman, \n     was proud, reserved and as private as possible for the \n     bearer--the second generation--of America's premium athletic \n     tradition, the Yankee greatness established by Babe Ruth and \n     Lou Gehrig. DiMaggio felt violated by the sight of Marilyn \n     filming the famous scene in ``The Seven Year Itch'' when a \n     gust of wind from a Manhattan subway grate blows her skirt up \n     above her waist.\n       Pride, supposedly one of the seven deadly sins, is often a \n     virtue and the source of others. DiMaggio was pride \n     incarnate, and he and Hank Greenberg did much to stir ethnic \n     pride among Italian Americans and Jews. When as a player \n     DiMaggio had nothing left to prove, he was asked why he still \n     played so hard, every day. Because, he said, every day there \n     is apt to be some child in the stand who has never before \n     seen me play.\n       An entire ethic, the code of craftsmanship, can be tickled \n     from that admirable thought. Not that DiMaggio practiced the \n     full range of his craft. When one of his managers was asked \n     if DiMaggio could bunt, he said he did not know and ``I'll \n     never find out, either.''\n       DiMaggio, one of Jefferson's ``natural aristocrats,'' \n     proved that a healthy democracy knows and honors nobility \n     when it sees it.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as a Senator from Joe DiMaggio's home \nstate, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the resolution \nhonoring ``the Yankee Clipper.'' Joe DiMaggio holds a unique place in \nthe hearts of every baseball fan and every Californian.\n  Joe DiMaggio was born in 1914 in Martinez, California, near San \nFrancisco Bay. Like many Californians then and now, Joe was the child \nof immigrants. His parents came from Sicily to California, where his \nfather found work as a fisherman.\n  At age 18, Joe began his professional baseball career with the San \nFrancisco Seals, where he set a Pacific Coast League record that still \nstands by hitting in 61 straight games. Three years later, he joined \nthe New York Yankees and immediately became one of baseball's brightest \nstars. In 1941, his 56-game hitting streak set a major league record \nthat most baseball fans consider the game's greatest achievement.\n  DiMaggio played 13 seasons for the Yankees, winning three Most \nValuable Player awards and playing on nine World Series championship \nteams. He was selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955 and voted \nMajor League Baseball's greatest living player in 1969.\n  Joe DiMaggio was a great ballplayer, but he was far more than that. \nJoe was a role model for young people and a model citizen. At the \nheight of his career, he left baseball to volunteer for the Army Air \nCorps and served three years in World War II. In his later years he \nworked tirelessly to support the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in \nHollywood, Florida.\n  I will never forget a televised image of Joe DiMaggio from a decade \nago. In October 1989, as the Oakland A's and San Francisco Giants were \nabout to start a World Series game, a mammoth earthquake struck the Bay \nArea. Fire swept through San Francisco's Marina district, where \nDiMaggio lived at the time. That night, as residents struggled to deal \nwith the earthquake and its aftermath, they saw a man who--despite his \nadvanced age--showed the strength and dignity to walk calmly through \nthe rubble and reassure his neighbors. At this moment, as always, \nDiMaggio was an inspiration to us all.\n  From his early days with the San Francisco Seals to his service as \nbaseball's greatest ambassador, Joe DiMaggio was the epitome of \nelegance, grace, and good sportsmanship.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Moynihan, \nLott, and Boxer in cosponsoring this resolution to honor Mr. Joe \nDiMaggio. On March 8, 1999, Joe DiMaggio, one of the greatest baseball \nplayers of all-time, died in Tampa, Florida. The Yankee Clipper led his \nlife with class and dignity. A true hero and the quintessential \nAmerican, Mr. DiMaggio gave people something to believe in.\n  Playing 13 seasons in the major leagues, all for the New York \nYankees, Number 5 not only took left field in Yankee Stadium, but also \ntook over New York and baseball showing us his talent day in and day \nout. When one looks at the numbers accumulated by Mr. DiMaggio, it is \nhard to think of anyone who did it better and in such a genuine \nfashion. As a baseball player, few have approached DiMaggio. With a \n.325 batting average, nine World Series rings, a 56 consecutive game \nhitting streak in 1941 (a major league record that has never been \nseriously challenged for more than 5 decades), 361 home runs with only \n369 strike-outs, Joe DiMaggio transcended the game of baseball and will \nremain a symbol for the ages of talent, commitment, and grace. As Simon \nand Garfunkel sang in their hit song Mrs. Robinson, ``where have you \ngone Joe DiMaggio. . ..'', the answer is, into our hearts, which will \nstay with us forever.\n  But Joe DiMaggio was more than a great baseball player, he \ntranscended the game and will remain a symbol for the ages--a symbol of \ntalent, commitment, and grace. With so few true heroes today, we are \nlucky that millions of New Yorkers and baseball fans everywhere could \nlive their lives touched by a hero like Joe DiMaggio.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the resolution be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
