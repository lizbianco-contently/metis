Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes for debate on the cloture motion on amendment No. 255.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, might I just ask, is the 30 minutes of \ndebate to be equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. In that case, Mr. President, I yield myself up to 5 \nminutes at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, just to remind our colleagues, as well as \nthose who watch our deliberations, what we are trying to do with this \namendment is to amend the budget process in such a fashion that we \nprotect the surpluses that will be built up over the next 10 years in \nthe Social Security trust fund. We have now entered an era in which we \nproject very substantial surpluses coming into the Federal Government, \nnot just as a result of\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\nSocial Security trust fund payments but also in the rest of the budget \nas well. We do not need to use Social Security trust funds to balance \nthe budget. We are at the point now where we can accomplish that \nwithout any Social Security money being used.\n  That, combined with the fact we are facing a huge long-term unfunded \nobligation problem in the Social Security trust fund, in my judgment, \nabsolutely requires us at this time to protect those Social Security \ntrust fund dollars so they can be used to modernize Social Security. \nThe purpose of this amendment is to try to accomplish that.\n  In short, this amendment says that until we come up with a plan to \nmodernize Social Security, the Social Security trust fund surpluses \nshould be used to pay down the publicly held debt.\n  I do not think this is a very complicated proposal. I think it is one \nthat people on both sides of the aisle were applauding just a few \nmonths ago when it was talked about by the President in the State of \nthe Union Address, and yet now we hear one after another argument as to \nwhy we should not do this. The arguments range from those of some \ncolleagues who say, well, let's just take all the Social Security trust \nfund surplus and, instead of paying down the national debt, put it in \nFort Knox or some other place where it is secure--I can't quite even \nfigure out how that one would work--to others who say this is not the \nright kind of lockbox; instead of just protecting the Social Security \ntrust fund surplus, we should also save money for fixing Medicare.\n  Well, their argument seems to be that if we don't somehow address \nMedicare simultaneously, we should spend the Social Security trust fund \nsurplus. That one I can't figure out, either. Then we have heard, from \nthe Secretary of Treasury, various concerns raised about the process by \nwhich this amendment would work. We have offered to try to address \nthose concerns. We attempt to do that. We address that in this \namendment, responding to his initial letter. Then we heard additional \nconcerns in a second letter. Yet, we have heard no proposal from either \nthe White House or the Treasury as to how to put together a lockbox \nthat would satisfy them.\n  Based on the vote last week, and what I expect to be the vote today, \nI think we are hearing an awful lot of protests, but I am increasingly \nquestioning whether or not people are really sincere about truly trying \nto save this trust fund surplus.\n  So for those reasons we are going to keep pushing this issue. We are \ngoing to keep bringing this back to the floor. We believe the money \npeople send in for Social Security which creates a surplus ought to be \nsaved to either modernize Social Security or used to pay down the debt \nand not spent on more programs here in Washington. The people pay in \nthe money. They deserve to have it for their own retirement. We are \ngoing to keep working very hard to make sure they do.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I will yield back any remaining time I \nhad in this first 5 minutes, and now for 5 minutes I yield to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in favor of the provision to protect \nSocial Security, to, in effect, put it in a lockbox to make sure it is \nnot dissipated or misallocated or used to cover deficits in other parts \nof Government.\n  The votes we are about to cast are important votes. They relate to \nthe future of Social Security, the integrity of Social Security, the \nstrength of America and its ability to meet its obligations when \nindividuals call upon Social Security to do what Congress has said \nSocial Security would be able to do.\n  This vote is about making sure the Social Security surpluses are not \nused to pay for new budget deficit spending in other parts of \nGovernment.\n  Congress is committed to stopping the raid on Social Security. This \nCongress has passed a budget without using Social Security trust funds. \nThis is historic and it is novel. We have not been passing budgets like \nthis. We have not done it before.\n  It is important; we have passed a budget that says we are not going \nto raid the Social Security trust fund. In contrast, over the next 5 \nyears, President Clinton's budget would have taken $158 billion from \nthe Social Security trust fund to pay for non-Social Security programs.\n  I think Congress is on the right track. Should we have a $158 billion \nraid or no raid at all? I think Congress has it right: Don't have any \nraid at all on Social Security.\n  Frankly, this vote should be bipartisan and unanimous. Last month, \nthe Senate voted 99 to nothing in support of legislation to protect \nSocial Security. We are calling on every Senator to vote with us to \npass the legislation that implements the unanimous resolution passed by \nthe Senate 99 to nothing earlier this month.\n  The Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft lockbox will make sure that Social \nSecurity funds do not go for anything other than Social Security.\n  The bill will achieve these three important results:\n  No. 1, the President will no longer be able to propose budgets that \nuse Social Security funds to balance the budget. Write into the law the \nPresident is not to send us proposals for spending which include a \nbackdoor raid on Social Security. It really establishes a priority. It \nsays Social Security is more important than these other new programs or \nideas for spending.\n  No. 2, Congress will no longer routinely pass budgets that use Social \nSecurity trust funds to balance the budget. A congressional budget that \nuses Social Security funds to balance the budget will be subject to \nwhat is called a point of order.\n  All of us have been involved at one point or another in meetings \nwhere someone tries to bring something up and the chairman simply says \nwith a thump of the gavel, ``That's out of order; we are not going to \ndiscuss it.'' That is how it should be when people propose, for \nexample, raiding the Social Security trust fund for other Government \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, you, as the occupant of the Chair, should say, with a \nthump, ``That is out of order, that is off the table, we do not discuss \nthose things, that is not part of what we do.'' A point of order then \nsimply allows, provides for the Chair to say, ``That's out of order, \nthat's not something we do, and if you want to do that, you have to \nchange the way we do business around here, you have to change the rules \nor suspend them.'' I think that is a major step forward.\n  As a final tool to make sure Social Security trust funds are not used \nto finance new deficits, this provision will reduce the amount of debt \nheld by the public by the amount of the Social Security surplus, so \nthat when the Social Security surplus is not spent on programs but is \ninvested to pay down the national debt so that we are stronger when we \nneed to pay for Social Security, this makes sure the money will not go \ninto other programs. This will ensure that any and all Social Security \nsurpluses will be directed toward reducing the debt, which means \nstrengthening the capacity to pay Social Security when the time comes.\n\n  Americans, including the 1 million Missourians who receive Social \nSecurity benefits, want Social Security protected, and they have a \nright to have it protected. They paid for it, they have earned it, and \nwe should protect the integrity of the fund.\n  This bill does what America wants and what every Senator has \npreviously said they want to do as well in behalf of their \nconstituents. It is time for the Senate to vote now to end the debate \non this bill, to pass this bill, to do this month what we said last \nmonth we wanted to do when we passed the budget resolution; that is, to \nprotect the Social Security trust fund, to reserve it for the benefit \nof the recipients of the fund, to strengthen and protect the integrity \nof the fund. I call upon other Members of the Senate to join in this \nnoble cause to which they have already registered their serious \ncommitment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I inquire as to how much time is left on \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 6 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. It is my understanding that the chairman of the\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, wants to be the final speaker on \nour side for approximately 5 minutes, and Senator Lautenberg, who is \nthe ranking member of the committee, wants to have approximately 5 \nminutes before that. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask, in our \ndesire to protect the time on our side, that the time be assessed \nagainst Senator Lautenberg's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 10 minutes 20 \nseconds left, and the Senator from Michigan has 5 minutes 51 seconds \nleft.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support walling off all Social Security \nsurpluses and in strong opposition to the pending Social Security \nlockbox.\n  I stand in opposition to the Social Security lockbox proposal that is \nin front of us because I believe this legislation is a lockbox in name \nonly. In reality, instead of protecting Social Security benefits, I \nbelieve it would actually threaten them, and I think the threat is a \nserious one. It could cause a Government default and trigger worldwide \neconomic instability.\n  Before I review the problem with the Social Security lockbox, I will \ntake a minute to talk about saving Social Security and my continuing \nhope that we can address this issue in the near future.\n  I am fairly optimistic, Mr. President, but I have heard a lot of \ngloomy comments about the prospects for legislation to protect and \npreserve Social Security for the future. I hope we do not give up on \nthis.\n  I do not want to be critical in any way of any of my colleagues. I \nknow many are concerned that this issue is just too hot to handle \npolitically, but I do not see it that way. In fact, I think we have a \nunique opportunity this year to really prepare our country for the \nfuture, and it is an opportunity we should seize.\n  President Clinton has made Social Security reform a top priority. He \nis in his second term and is eager to take on this politically \ndifficult task and can lend us the leadership it requires. We are now \nin pretty good financial shape. We are projecting budget surpluses for \nyears to come. And with the economy going so strong, our Nation is \nready to accept some of the hard choices that will be necessary to get \nthe job done.\n  If we cannot solve the Social Security problem now, I would ask, When \ncan we? This is the time to act, and we need to do it soon before we \nget too close to the next year's Presidential election. And we need to \ndo it on a bipartisan basis. Frankly, that is the only way it can be \ndone--through direct negotiations between the congressional leadership \nof both parties in both Houses and the White House.\n  One thing should be clear to everyone, and that is that the Social \nSecurity lockbox amendment before us does not represent Social Security \nreform. It does nothing to prepare our country for the financial \npressures which will be created when the baby boomers retire. It does \nnot extend Social Security solvency by even a single day. I just hope \nit will not be used as an excuse to avoid dealing with Social Security \nin a real and meaningful way.\n  I have reviewed this before, but I want to again recount for my \ncolleagues the three serious problems I see with this legislation.\n  First, it directly threatens Social Security benefits. Treasury \nSecretary Rubin has explained in a letter that under this proposal an \nunexpected economic downturn could block the issuance of Social \nSecurity checks, as well as Medicare, veterans', and other benefits.\n  Additionally, the amendment contains a huge loophole that would allow \nSocial Security contributions to be diverted for purposes other than \ndirect Social Security benefits. Anything the Congress labels as \n``Social Security reform'' would be exempt from the lockbox. So this \ncould include privatization plans that might be risky, tax cuts, or who \nknows what.\n  I know some of my colleagues dispute my interpretation of this \nprovision. But I would simply point to the broad language of the \nlegislation itself. It effectively exempts from the lockbox any \nlegislation which includes a provision designating itself as Social \nSecurity reform. So if Congress passes a big tax cut, even if it \nprovides significant benefit to wealthy retirees, we can just claim \nthat this represents Social Security reform, and all the costs of the \nlegislation will be exempt from the lockbox. Some of the bill's \ncosponsors may say that is not their intent. But that is what the bill \nsays.\n  I would like to be able to offer an amendment to correct this \nproblem. The majority, however, has prohibited us from offering any \namendments whatsoever. So we have had little opportunity to do anything \nbut point out the loophole.\n  Mr. President, the second major problem with the pending bill is that \nit does absolutely nothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows \nCongress to squander funds needed for Medicare on tax breaks which go \nlargely to the wealthier among us.\n  Senator Conrad and I have developed a different lockbox to protect \nboth Social Security and Medicare. Our bill, S. 862, would reserve all \nof the Social Security surpluses exclusively for Social Security, and \n40 percent of the non-Social Security surpluses for Medicare. We would \nlike an opportunity to offer that lockbox amendment to this bill, but \nagain the majority is blocking all of these amendments.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Republicans' so-called \nlockbox threatens a potential Government default. In the short term \nthis could undermine our Nation's credit standing and increase interest \ncosts. Ultimately, it could block benefit payments and lead to a \nworldwide economic crisis. That is why the Treasury Secretary, Robert \nRubin, has said he would recommend that the President veto the bill if \nit ever reaches his desk.\n  Mr. President, the lockbox Senator Conrad and I have developed avoids \nthe risk of default, while protecting both Social Security and \nMedicare. Our lockbox would not establish a new debt limit. It would \nuse supermajority points of order and across-the-board cuts to \nguarantee enforcement. I think it is a far better, more responsible \napproach.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on this legislation. Let's \nestablish a Social Security lockbox. In fact, let's establish a Social \nSecurity and Medicare lockbox. Let's make it a real, responsible \nlockbox, not one that actually, in its implementation, could threaten \nSocial Security benefits, risking a worldwide financial crisis. And \nthen, Mr. President, let's sit down with the White House and negotiate \na compromise which will truly protect Social Security and Medicare for \nthe long term.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican ``lockbox'' proposal is \ndeeply flawed, and does not deserve to be adopted. It does nothing to \nextend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund for future \nbeneficiaries. In fact, it would do just the reverse. This legislation \nactually places Social Security at greater risk than it is today. It \nwould allow payroll tax dollars that belong to Social Security to be \nspent instead on risky privatization schemes. And, because of the harsh \ndebt ceiling limits it would impose, this plan could produce a \ngovernmental shutdown that would jeopardize the timely payment of \nSocial Security benefits to current recipients.\n  It is time to look behind the rhetoric of the proponents of the \n``lockbox.'' Their statements convey the impression that they have \ntaken a major step toward protecting Social Security. In truth, they \nhave done nothing to strengthen Social Security. Their proposal would \nnot provide even one additional dollar to pay benefits to future \nretirees. Nor would it extend the solvency of the Trust Fund by even \none more day. It merely recommits to Social Security those dollars \nwhich already belong to the Trust Fund under current law. At best, that \nis all their so-called ``lockbox'' would do.\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\n  By contrast, President Clinton's proposed budget would contribute 2.8 \ntrillion new dollars of the surplus to Social Security over the next 15 \nyears. By doing so, the President's budget would extend the life of the \nTrust Fund by more than a generation, to beyond 2050.\n  There is a fundamental difference between the parties over what to do \nwith the savings which will result from using the surplus for debt \nreduction. The Federal Government will realize enormous savings from \npaying down the debt. As a result, billions of dollars that would have \nbeen required to pay interest on the national debt will become \navailable each year for other purposes. President Clinton believes \nthose debt savings should be used to strengthen Social Security. Since \nit is payroll tax revenues which make the debt reduction possible, \nthose savings should in turn be used to strengthen Social Security. I \nwholeheartedly agree. It is an eminently reasonable plan. But \nRepublican Members of Congress oppose it.\n  Not only does the Republican plan fail to provide any new resources \nto fund Social Security benefits for future retirees, it does not even \neffectively guarantee that existing payroll tax revenues will be used \nto pay Social Security benefits. They have deliberately built a \ntrapdoor in their ``lockbox.'' Their plan would allow Social Security \npayroll taxes to be used instead to finance unspecified ``reform'' \nplans. This loophole opens the door to risky schemes to finance private \nretirement accounts at the expense of Social Security's guaranteed \nbenefits. If these dollars are expended on private accounts, there will \nbe nothing left for debt reduction, and no new resources to fund future \nSocial Security benefits. Such a privatization plan could actually make \nSocial Security's financial picture far worse than it is today, \nnecessitating deep benefit cuts in the future.\n  A genuine ``lockbox'' would prevent any such diversion of funds. A \ngenuine ``lockbox'' would guarantee that those payroll tax dollars \nwould be in the Trust Fund when needed to pay benefits to future \nrecipients. The Republican ``lockbox'' does just the opposite. It \nactually invites a raid on the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  The Social Security reform proposal put forth by Chairman Archer and \nCongressman Shaw earlier this week demonstrates that the real \nRepublican agenda is to substitute private accounts for traditional \nSocial Security benefits. That plan would spend the entire Social \nSecurity surplus on tax credits to subsidize private accounts. There \nwould be no money left for debt reduction, and thus no debt service \nsavings which could be used to help fund future Social Security \nbenefits. In fact, their plan will ultimately require either enormous \nnew borrowing or drastic program cuts to continue funding the private \naccounts after the Social Security surplus is exhausted. These costly \ntax credits would go to subsidize private accounts disproportionately \nbenefiting the most affluent workers. Low and middle income workers \nwould receive little or no net benefit from the Archer plan. Their \nretirement security would not be enhanced at all.\n  Placing Social Security on a firm financial footing should be our \nhighest budget priority, not further enriching the already wealthy. \nTwo-thirds of our senior citizens depend upon Social Security \nretirement benefits for more than fifty percent of their annual income. \nWithout it, half the nation's elderly would fall below the poverty \nline.\n  To our Republican colleagues, I say: ``If you are unwilling to \nstrengthen Social Security, at least do not weaken it. Do not divert \ndollars which belong to the Social Security Trust Fund for other \npurposes. Every dollar in that Trust Fund is needed to pay future \nSocial Security benefits.''\n  The proposed ``lockbox'' poses a second, very serious threat to \nSocial Security. By using the debt ceiling as an enforcement mechanism, \nit runs the risk of creating a government shutdown crisis. The \nRepublicans propose to enforce their ``lockbox'' by mandating \ndangerously low debt ceilings. Such a reduced debt ceiling could make \nit impossible for the federal government to meet its financial \nobligations--including its obligation to pay Social Security benefits \nto millions of men and women who depend upon them. The risk is real. It \nis fundamentally wrong to put those who depend on Social Security at \nrisk in this way.\n  The ``lockbox'' which proponents claim will save Social Security \nactually imperils it. As Treasury Secretary Rubin has said, ``This \nlegislation does nothing to extend the solvency of the Social Security \nTrust Fund, while potentially threatening the ability to make Social \nSecurity payments to millions of Americans.''\n  While this ``lockbox'' provides no genuine protection for Social \nSecurity, it provides no protection at all for Medicare. The \nRepublicans are so indifferent to senior citizens' health care that \nthey have completely omitted Medicare from their ``lockbox''.\n  By contrast, Democrats have proposed to devote 15% of the surplus to \nMedicare over the next 15 years. Those new dollars would come entirely \nfrom the on-budget portion of the surplus. The Republicans have \nadamantly refused to provide any additional funds for Medicare. \nInstead, they propose to spend the entire on-budget surplus on tax cuts \ndisproportionately benefiting the wealthiest Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to reject this ill-\nconceived proposal. It jeopardizes Social Security and ignores \nMedicare. It is an assault on America's senior citizens, and it does \nnot deserve to pass.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we are taking a critical step \ntoward saving Social Security. However, in considering this measure we \nare seeking to reaffirm provisions in the current law stating that \nmoney earmarked for Social Security should not be considered for \npurposes of the Federal budget. Furthermore, this measure would make it \nvery difficult for this Congress and Administration, or future \nCongresses and Administrations, to use Social Security surpluses to \nachieve a balanced budget.\n  In his 1998 State of the Union address, the President pledged to save \nevery penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security. Many of \nus supported his pledge and worked not to spend Social Security surplus \nmoney. However, his fiscal year 2000 budget request would require the \nuse of $158 billion in Social Security surplus money over the next five \nyears.\n  The ``lockbox'' measure we are considering today would prohibit \nCongress or the President from spending Social Security trust fund \nmoney but would still allow Congress the flexibility needed in case \nunforeseen emergencies, such as a war or a recession, develop. It is \nvital that we take steps to exercise fiscal restraint so that we don't \nsquander the surpluses necessary to enact improvements to the Social \nSecurity program which would enhance the retirement security of our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  I believe that this is of critical importance in the path toward \nsaving Social Security, so much so that I am missing a field hearing by \nthe Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation back home \nin Iowa that Senator McCain was gracious enough to hold on the \ndifficulties Iowa faces with competition in the airline industry. \nUnfortunately, I can't be there right now, but I hope my being here to \ncast this vote supporting this proposal is a testament to the \nimportance of taking steps to bring us closer to saving Social \nSecurity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes 51 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself such time as I use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me suggest that this idea \nthat we are locking out any amendments with our Social Security \nProtection Act is nice to say, but it isn't true. If the Democrats let \nus vote on this, we will see whether it passes or not, but once it \npasses, it is subject to amendments.\n  The good Senator from New Jersey, my dear friend, can offer his \nsubstitute or his amendment, but first we have to have an opportunity \nto vote on this amendment, which for some strange reason, while the \nother side of the aisle and the President keep saying, ``Let's\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\nnot spend any of the Social Security trust fund,'' they somehow do not \nwant to vote for a proposition that will really lock it up so it cannot \nbe spent, it cannot be embezzled, as some Democrats called it a few \nyears ago, when you use it. They said you were embezzling the trust \nfund. I would think if that is true--I never used that word--you ought \nto lock it up tough, you ought to put a whopping key on it that can't \nhardly be moved. So that is what we have done.\n  For those who say, ``If you can't spend the Social Security trust \nfund, you are going to destroy the economy of America,'' that is just \nabsolutely untrue. Would anyone believe that taking a trust fund which \nbelongs to Social Security, using it to pay down the debt until we need \nit for Social Security reform, would anybody submit that that is going \nto harm America? That is going to help us. We are going to be reducing \nthe debt right at the right time by a huge amount, which is going to \nkeep inflation down, which is going to keep interest rates down, all of \nwhich helps Social Security.\n  All of these arguments about cash management, and you can't pay \nSocial Security--just read the bill. The bill says, under all \ncircumstances the Social Security checks are forthcoming, just by \nspecific item. The management problems that the Treasury Secretary has \nhave been fixed.\n  The truth of the matter is, those on the other side of the aisle \nthink it might be easy to spend this money if you do not have this \nlockbox. And they are right, it will be easy to spend it. In fact, the \nPresident of the United States, in his budget, spent $158 billion of it \nin the first 5 years. No wonder he does not want this lockbox. It \nwrecks his budget, because he is already going to spend it. We say, \n``No. No, you can't spend it. You challenged us not to spend it. We are \nfor real.'' That is what this is all about.\n  Last but not least, let me suggest that it is really amazing for some \non the other side of the aisle to talk about saving both Medicare and \nSocial Security in some kind of a lockbox when you see what it really \nis. It is sort of a Democratic position that we should not cut taxes \nfor the American people or, if we do, we ought to do it their way--even \nthough we are in the majority and the President has a veto pen, we \nought to do it their way.\n  We say there is plenty of money outside of Social Security to give \nthe American taxpayers back a real tax reduction over the next decade. \nWhenever you say, let's take more of that surplus that does not belong \nto Social Security, and say let's spend it on something else, you are \nreally choosing not to give the American people a tax reduction that \nthey deserve.\n  Frankly, I do not believe today we are going to get cloture. But I \nthink sooner or later--and hopefully it will not be too much later--we \nwill make this filibuster a real one. We will stay down here until we \nwear out, around the clock. And let's stay here a couple nights so \neverybody will understand this is serious business, and who is keeping \nus from voting on it, to protect our seniors and their money for the \nnext decade when it is most in jeopardy. It will be those on that side \nof the aisle who will not vote today. They will probably not vote for \nit the next time. But sooner or later, a lot of Americans are going to \nbe asking, who is holding up the real lockbox that will protect our \nmoney? It is going to dawn on a few people on the other side of the \naisle that they are and that the American people are cognizant and \naware of it, and maybe some people will change their minds.\n\n  With that, if I have any remaining time, I yield it back. I \nunderstand we have agreed to start voting at this time, in any event.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, does the Senator from New Mexico have \nsome time remaining, may I ask?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, with all due respect and friendship \nfor my colleague, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, we both \nwould like to get to the same place. I am sure he has never heard me \nuse terms like ``embezzlement.'' I don't do that kind of stuff. \nFrankly, I do not like that terminology. I don't care from where it \ncomes.\n  But what we see here is what I would call a couple of escape hatches \nin the legislation that worry the devil out of us. That is, perhaps in \nthe interest of Social Security reform or retirement security, we are \nlocking ourselves into a position where we would be unable to respond \nto changes in the economy. That is not where we ought to be.\n  This economy is too important in the whole world scheme of things. It \nis too important in terms of those who are very dependent, totally \ndependent, in some cases, on the benefits derived from Social Security, \nveterans' benefits, Medicare. That is all they have in many cases. With \nthe threat of creating a debt limit, and I think artificially creating \na new debt limit, I think we could immediately be damaging the \npossibility that these benefits might be offered.\n  That is where we differ. I always enjoy my work with the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, except when he wins, which we \ndoes so often. But other than that, we ought to be able to sit down and \nreason out some of these things.\n  I hope this vote, by discouraging cloture, will give us some impetus \nto sit down and try to work the problems out.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to use it at this point to make a \ncouple of points.\n  Senior citizens, what some like to do is to say, to protect your \nSocial Security trust fund, we are going to hurt other people who are \nentitled to Federal money because we may have a recession one of these \ndays and things may change.\n  We are aware of that. Read the bill. It says the lockbox is held in \nabeyance in the event we have two quarters of economic downturn, which \nnormally is called a recession. You hold it steady there and see where \nwe come out. Anybody who would be looking at this kind of proposition \nwould think that is a prudent thing to do. We did that.\n  Likewise, in case of a national emergency like a war, we have said, \nyou cannot not spend money on that, and so there is an emergency that \ntakes place then and you can temporarily use it. Remember, we are \nholding $1.8 trillion for the seniors and these emergencies of which we \nare speaking. If they occur, they will be very small in proportion to \nthe good we are doing under this proposal.\n\n  I, too, hope we can get a true lockbox put together. If bipartisan, \nfine; if not, I am very comfortable with this one.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 33, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 33) designating May 1999 as \n     ``National Military Appreciation Month''.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nResolution 33, which designates May 1999 as ``National Military \nAppreciation Month.'' I congratulate Senator McCain for introducing \nthis important legislation, and I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  In Congress, we spend many hours discussing this Nation's national \nsecurity and how our Armed Forces will be used to secure America's \ndefenses. We spend far too little time discussing what is central in \nmaking our national security possible--the individual service member. \nGreat warplanes, warships, tanks and ground weapon systems are only as \ngood as the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who man the front \nlines. American military service members are unique in their mission, \ntheir special culture and have a special place in our society.\n  The American military lives by fundamental values: duty, honor, \ncountry. We are unique in the world in this respect. Our service \npersonnel put their lives on the line not for danger or the thrill of \ncombat, but for a higher cause. To do their job effectively, those in \nthe military must have faith in the society they serve. In turn, our \nsociety must support and honor its Armed Forces. General Matthew \nRidgway strongly believed that those in uniform must be forthright with \nthe American citizen they serve. He said, ``The professional soldier \nshould never pull his punches, should never let himself for one moment \nbe dissuaded from stating honest opinions based on his own military \nexperience and judgment which tells him what will be needed to do the \njob required of him.'' No factor of political motivation should excuse, \nand no reason of political expediency should interfere with the supreme \nduties our military undertake. General Ridgway went on to note that \n``Since George Washington's time, no top soldier has forgotten that he \nis a citizen first and a soldier second, and that the troops under his \ncommand are an instrument of the people's will.'' This is why the \nAmerican people have always had a special relationship with its  \nmilitary.\n\n  This is what makes the American military men and women unique. If you \nhave been there, you know exactly what I mean. For those who have not \nhad the opportunity to serve, you should speak with our military men \nand women. Learn more about their accomplishments, challenges, and \nsacrifices. In combat, in conflict and violence, bonds of trust and \nlove are forged. This is a very powerful experience which contributes \nto how the words duty, honor, country have a sacred meaning to our \nmilitary. As the military, we learn that every decision we make calls \nupon us to act on our own personal integrity and our own willingness to \nsacrifice. No commitment is more powerful.\n  The military instills a sense of purpose, a sense of belonging, a \nsense that the military matters to the citizens they serve. After all, \nthis is a profession where people are called upon to make the ultimate \nand most personal sacrifice. The military is not a mere interest group. \nIn the turmoil following Vietnam, General Fred Weyand wrote, ``The \nAmerican Army is really a people's Army in the sense that it belongs to \nthe American people who take a jealous proprietary interest in its \ninvolvement . . . The American Army is not so much an arm of the \nFederal Government as it is an arm of the American people.'' We \nAmericans should keep this in mind before we make the serious decisions \nwhich may put our best youngsters into harm's way. The American \nmilitary is a national treasure, for which we all are accountable.\n  The military professional is set apart from those who have followed \nother walks of life. It is a family. This is true throughout the \nservices and down to the level of small units, whose cohesiveness was \nclearly illustrated during the Gulf War. When a television \ncorrespondent interviewed a young African American soldier in a tank \nplatoon on the eve of Desert Storm and repeatedly asked him to speak to \nhis fear of the impending battle, the young soldier just as \npersistently repeated his answer: ``This is my family and we'll take \ncare of each other.'' The values and beliefs that form the substance of \nmilitary professionalism determine in no small measure the role of the \nmilitary in our great Nation.\n  We Americans should at the very least show appreciation to our \nmilitary service members.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, on Monday, in the afternoon, the \ndistinguished majority leader has scheduled a vote, so far denominated \nas a tabling motion on the pending S.J. Res. 20, concerning the \ndeployment of United States Armed Forces in the Kosovo region of the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n  Since Monday afternoon is likely to be crowded with debate on this \nsubject and there is free time in the Senate Chamber today, I have \ndecided to speak about this issue because I believe it is a matter of \noverwhelming importance for the United States, for NATO, for Europe \nand, for that matter, for the world.\n  The resolution provides in a short statement worth reading in its \nentirety:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, that the \n     President is authorized to use all necessary force and other \n     means, in concert with United States allies, to accomplish \n     United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     objectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n     Montenegro).\n\n  Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to this resolution because it \ngives a total blank check to the President to involve the United States \nin any type of military action which he deems appropriate when it is \nthe Congress of the United States that has the sole authority under the \nConstitution to declare war. In my view, the Congress ought not to give \nsuch a blank check, but instead ought to ask the President to come \nbefore the Congress, specifying what the President seeks to accomplish \nand what the means are for accomplishing that objective.\n  I supported the resolution for airstrikes with a specific limitation \nthat there would not be a deployment of ground forces. We have a great \nmany very, very important questions, the answers to which ought to be \nprovided, in my judgment, by the executive branch, by the President, to \nthe Congress before the Congress exercises its authority to, in effect, \ndeclare war.\n  Bear in mind at the outset, that the President has asked for no such \nauthority, and that is a very important point and a threshold matter. \nBut\n\n[[Page S4484]]\n\nthese are some of the questions which ought to be examined. I know that \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Roberts from Kansas, who \nis on the Armed Services Committee, has participated in offering \nlegislation which conditions funding and conditions congressional \nauthority on a number of similar issues.\n  These questions are of such vital importance that they bear \nrepetition and they bear analysis and understanding by the American \npeople, at least the relatively few who are watching on C-SPAN2 \ntoday. But these are monumental matters. These are some of the issues \nwhich I think have to be answered before the Congress is in a position \nto decide what authorization is to be given to the President:\n\n  First, to what extent have the forces of the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia been degraded by the air attacks?\n  Second, what would the projected resistance be of the armed forces of \nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?\n  Third, what is the President's plan? So far we do not know what the \nPresident would like to do. There is not agreement among the alliance. \nThe President has stated that he wishes to proceed with the support of \nthe alliance, just as he has had the support of the alliance up to \ndate.\n  Once we know what the plan is, the fourth question would be, what \nresources are necessary to implement a specific plan?\n  Fifth, what would the risks be to U.S. military personnel in carrying \nout the plan?\n  Next, what contributions would be made by others of the alliance?\n  And an additional question: What other pressures are available to use \nagainst the forces of President Milosevic, such as the pressure of the \nWar Crimes Tribunal?\n  These are all vital questions which ought to be answered before the \nCongress of the United States plunges into this field precipitously, \nwithout a request by the President, without a request by NATO, without \nany plan for us to consider on issues which can be answered only by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  What we are being asked for on this resolution is a blank check, and \nit is really an unusual form of a blank check because the check is not \nonly blank as to amount, but the check is also blank as to the identity \nof the payee; that is, who receives the funds.\n  A check has a number of ingredients. There is the party who writes \nthe check. That would be the Congress of the United States in the case \nof this resolution. A check has the identification of the party who \nreceives the check, the payee. And the check has the amount of the \ncheck. And this check is blank in both material aspects. What is the \namount of the check and who is to receive the check?\n  I think the Congress of the United States would be most unwise to \nenact such a resolution on the state of the record which exists at the \npresent time.\n  What we have in Kosovo, what we have with NATO, what we have in our \nmilitary action against the Republic of Yugoslavia is really a \nconstitutional crisis. It is a constitutional crisis of major import, \nif anybody would pay attention to the Constitution. Only by ignoring \nthe Constitution are we able to ignore the constitutional crisis.\n  But the Constitution is explicit that only the Congress of the United \nStates has the authority to declare war. Only the Congress of the \nUnited States has the power, responsibility and authority to engage the \nU.S. Armed Forces in war. But what we have going on at the present time \nin Kosovo against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a war.\n  The military actions there are clear-cut acts of war. We have this \nwar in process without the authority of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  As of Wednesday of this week, we have the war in process with a \nspecific action of the House of Representatives in rejecting the use of \nairstrikes by a tie vote of 213-213.\n  It is true that the Senate authorized the use of airstrikes with the \nreservation against ground forces by a vote of 58-41. But we have, as \nwe all know, a bicameral legislature. You cannot have a declaration of \nwar by the Senate. You could only have a declaration of war by the \nCongress; and that means joint action of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  And now we have the House of Representatives rejecting the \nPresident's authority to conduct air operations by a vote of 213-213. \nAnd that is as forceful a rejection as had it been 426-0. Unless it \npasses, albeit by as little as a single vote, it is a rejection.\n  The House of Representatives had a curious legislative day on \nWednesday, April 28, taking up a series of resolutions by Congressman \nTom Campbell of California. And I compliment Congressman Campbell for \nbringing the issues to a head--or trying to bring the issues to a head.\n  The House of Representatives rejected a resolution calling for a \nstate of war by a vote of 2 in favor, 427 against.\n  The House of Representatives then voted on a resolution directing the \nPresident, under the War Powers Resolution, to withdraw troops from the \noperation against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That, too, was \nrejected by a vote of 139-290.\n  Then there was the resolution authorizing the President to conduct \nair operations similar to the one passed by the Senate on March 23. As \npreviously noted, that was rejected 213-213.\n  Then, the House passed a resolution 249-180, placing limitations on \nthe funding of the President to use ground troops in Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia without prior congressional authority.\n  When we read through the War Powers Act, the legislation which was \npassed to try to limit the erosion of Congress' authority to declare \nwar with the taking on of that authority by the President under his \nconstitutional powers as Commander in Chief, the provisions of 5c \nspecify that ``at any time the United States Armed Forces are engaged \nin hostilities outside the territory of the United States, its \npossessions and territories, without a declaration of war or specific \nstatutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President \nif a Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.''\n  So here we have the anomalous situation that the House turns down a \ndeclaration of war, the House turns down the use of airstrikes, the \nSenate has authorized airstrikes with the reservation prohibiting the \nuse of ground forces, and you do not have the Congress--even the \nHouse--directing the withdrawal of forces. So it is a quagmire, to say \nthe least.\n  And it is a constitutional confrontation and a constitutional crisis \nto identify it squarely, when you have the Constitution requiring \naction by the Congress to declare war to involve the United States in \nwar, and you have one House of the Congress, the House of \nRepresentatives, failing to authorize the airstrikes which are \ncurrently underway.\n  The resolution which is going to be voted on on Monday, Mr. \nPresident, bears a striking similarity to the infamous Gulf of Tonkin \nResolution, which was used to justify United States participation in \nthe Vietnam war without a declaration of war.\n  Section 2 of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution provides as follows:\n\n       ``. . .The United States is, therefore, prepared, as the \n     President determines, to take all necessary steps, including \n     the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol \n     state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty \n     requesting assistance in defense of its freedom.''\n\n  And note with particularity the language ``to take all necessary \nsteps, including the use of armed force'' from the Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution compared to the resolution to be voted on on Monday that the \nPresident is ``authorized to use all necessary force and other \nmeans.'' These are blank checks which are not in the interest of the \nUnited States, but these checks ought to be very carefully considered, \nand ought to be very carefully written before the United States is \nengaged in war with the authorization of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n\n  The President has, to his credit, held a series of meetings with \nMembers of Congress, going really beyond notification and really beyond \nwhat is customarily regarded as consultation in seeking opinions of \nMembers of the Senate and the House of Representatives. In one of these \nmeetings, the President raised the issue of collateral activities, \nbeyond or in addition to the use of military force, and made a specific \nreference to the War Crimes Tribunal. We have had President Milosevic \ndenominated as early as the end of 1992, by\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\nthen-Secretary of State Eagleburger, as, in effect, being a war \ncriminal.\n  We know that the War Crimes Tribunal has successfully completed \nprosecutions arising out of the incidents in Bosnia. There has been a \nvery noteworthy plea of guilty and a life sentence for the Prime \nMinister of Rwanda for the genocide which occurred there, a guilty \nplea, a conviction, and a life sentence--the life sentence now being \nunder appeal--of enormous importance, although hardly noticed by the \npress in the United States or the press in Europe. Somehow a matter of \ngenocide or a matter of a conviction or a matter of a prosecution of a \nwar criminal in Rwanda is of lesser status. It should not be, but that \nhappens to be the practical fact of life.\n  This morning there was a bipartisan meeting with Justice Louise \nArbour, the chief prosecutor in the War Crimes Tribunal. Justice Arbour \nmade a strong point of seeking support for the arrest of Karadzic, who \nis under indictment for war crimes in Bosnia, and for seeking an arrest \nfor others in cases where there are sealed indictments arising from war \ncrimes in Bosnia.\n  Justice Arbour described the number of these cases, by the reference \nthat there are only a handful, but she made the point--and I think it \nis a very valid point--that IFOR should proceed to arrest those \nindividuals--even those under sealed indictment who have been \nidentified to the military forces now in Bosnia, and Karadzic is an \nespecially prominent war criminal under indictment, where the \nindictment has been outstanding for some 4 years. Not only has Karadzic \nthumbed his nose at the War Crimes Tribunal, but the reality is that \nthe IFOR troops who have a responsibility to execute those warrants \nhave, in effect, similarly thumbed their nose at the War Crimes \nTribunal. The military commanders on the scene have been heard to say \nthat they could make these arrests, that they could make the arrest of \nKaradzic who is, according to reportedly reliable information, in the \nFrench quarter. A real question arises as to the willingness of the \nFrench to cooperate in the arrest of Karadzic, but this is something \nwhich could be accomplished.\n  Justice Arbour makes the point, and I think with great validity, that \nit would send a very strong message and have a chilling effect on the \nmilitary and political leaders under Milosevic, if they saw that the \nWar Crimes Tribunal had the skill to acquire evidence to bring forth \nindictments and then to follow with convictions; and, if the NATO and \nthe IFOR forces had the political courage to execute those warrants of \narrest by taking those indictees into custody. This would be a very, \nvery strong deterrent to the continuation of the criminal activity by \nthe Serbian forces and by the forces of the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia.\n  The War Crimes Tribunal has done its job. Now it is a matter of \ncourage, the political courage and the military courage to serve those \nwarrants of arrest and take those individuals into custody.\n  By way of a footnote, Justice Arbour outlined the need for some $18 \nmillion in funding. The entire War Crimes Tribunal has only 17 \ninvestigators, an amazingly small number, to carry out the sort of work \nwhich has to be undertaken. For example, investigating overhead \nsatellites intelligence which is telling something about the mass grave \nsites. This funding is something which will be coming before the \nAppropriations Committee next week, soon before the full Senate, and \nthen the Congress. And at least judging from the reaction of the \nSenators who were present at the meeting today with Justice Arbour, \nthere will be a favorable response. Certainly $18 million for the War \nCrimes Tribunal and an additional $2 million for extra State Department \nofficials and extra help from the Central Intelligence Agency is a very \nsmall amount of the $6 billion requested by the President and the \nadditions which have been made by the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. President, in conclusion--the two most popular words of any \nspeech--I urge my colleagues to focus with great care on this \nresolution. I have a strong sense that it won't be possible to make \nextended remarks on Monday, when a vote grows nearer. The number of \nSenators will increase, from the presiding Senator and the one Senator \non the floor making a speech, to a fair number of Senators who will be \nseeking recognition. When we had the resolution authorizing the use of \nforce with the airstrikes, there was a limited time agreement. Speakers \nwere limited to 2 minutes in the final stage of that debate before the \nvote, not too much time to express a Senatorial judgment on an \nimportant issue, but more time than many of us were accorded later when \nthe time was so limited that we couldn't even speak. So seeing an empty \nChamber, and in attendance an attentive Presiding Officer, I thought I \nwould take this opportunity to speak at some length on this important \nsubject.\n  I thank the Chair for his attention. The Chair is customarily in \nattendance, infrequently at attention.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/30/senate-section/article/S4485-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4485-S4486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DRAFT RESOLUTION ON YUGOSLAVIA\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

This draft resolution has been the subject of discussion \namong numerous Senators, as a possible compromise measure on the \nsubject of Kosovo.

A bill to provide for the protection of the flag of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                      flag protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the American flag is our most precious \nnational symbol and the Constitution is our most revered national \ndocument. They both represent the ideas, values and traditions that \nunify us as a people and a nation. Brave men and women have fought and \ngiven their lives in defense of the freedom and way of life that they \nboth represent.\n  Today, I am proud to introduce, along with my colleague from Utah, \nSenator Bennett, and my colleagues from North Dakota, Senator Conrad \nand Senator Dorgan, the Flag Protection Act of 1999. This legislation \nwould ensure that acts of deliberately confrontational flag-burnings \nare punished with stiff fines and even jail time. My bill will help \nprevent desecration of the flag, and at the same time, protect the \nConstitution.\n  Those malcontents who desecrate the flag do so to grab attention for \nthemselves and to inflame the passions of patriotic Americans. And, \nspeech that incites lawlessness or is intended to do so merits no First \nAmendment protection, as the Supreme Court has made abundantly clear. \nFrom Chaplinsky's ``fighting words'' doctrine in 1942 to Brandenburg's \n``incitement'' test in 1969 to Wisconsin v. Mitchell's ``physical \nassault'' standard in 1993, the Supreme Court has never protected \nspeech which causes or intends to cause physical harm to others.\n  And, that, Mr. President, is the basis for this legislation. My bill \noutlaws three types of illegal flag desecration. First, anyone who \ndestroys or damages a U.S. flag with a clear intent to incite imminent \nviolence or a breach of the peace may be punished by a fine of up to \n$100,000, or up to one year in jail, or both.\n  Second, anyone who steals a flag that belongs to the United States \nand destroys or damages that flag may be fined up to $250,000 or \nimprisoned up to 2 years, or both.\n  And third, anyone who steals a flag from U.S. property and destroys \nor damages that flag may also be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up \nto 2 years, or both.\n  Some of my colleagues will argue that we've been down the statutory \nroad before and the Supreme Court has rejected it. However, the \nSenate's previous statutory effort wasn't pegged to the well-\nestablished Supreme Court precedents in this area.\n  This bill differs from the statutes reviewed by the Supreme Court in \nthe two leading cases: Texas v. Johnson, (1989) and U.S. v. Eichman, \n(1990).\n  In Johnson, the defendant violated a Texas law banning the \ndesecration of a venerated object, including the flag, in a way that \nwill offend one or more persons. Johnson took a stolen flag and burned \nit as part of a political protest staged outside the 1984 Republican \nconvention in Dallas. The state of Texas argued that its interest in \nenforcing the law centered on preventing breaches of the peace. But the \ngovernment, according to the Supreme Court, may not ``assume every \nexpression of a provocative idea will incite a riot. . . .'' Johnson, \naccording to the Court, was prosecuted for the expression of his \nparticular ideas: dissatisfaction with government policies. And it is a \nbedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, said the Court, that \nan individual cannot be punished for expressing an idea that offends.\n  The Johnson decision started a national debate on flag-burning and as \na result, Congress, in 1989, enacted the Flag Protection Act. In \nseeking to safeguard the flag as the symbol of our nation, Congress \ntook a different tack from the Texas legislature. The federal statute \nsimply outlawed the mutilation or other desecration of the flag.\n  The Supreme Court, however, ruled in Eichman that the federal statute \nwas unconstitutional. Specifically, the Court found that Congressional \nintent to protect the national symbol was insufficient to overcome the \nFirst Amendment protection for the expressive conduct exhibited by \nflag-burning.\n  Notwithstanding these decisions, the Court clearly left the door open \nfor outlawing flag-burning that incites lawlessness: ``the mere \ndestruction or disfigurement of a particular physical manifestation of \nthe symbol, without more, does not diminish or otherwise affect the \nsymbol itself in any way.''\n  But Mr. President, you don't have to take my word on it. The \nCongressional Research Service has offered legal opinions concluding \nthat this initiative will withstand constitutional scrutiny:\n\n       The judicial precedents establish that the [Flag Protection \n     and Free Speech Act], if enacted, while not reversing Johnson \n     and Eichman, should survive constitutional attack on First \n     Amendment grounds.\n\n  In addition, Bruce Fein, a former official in the Reagan \nAdministration and respected constitutional scholar, concurs:\n\n       In holding flag desecration statutes unconstitutional in \n     Johnson, the Court cast no doubt on the continuing vitality \n     of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky as applied to expression \n     through use or abuse of the flag. [The Flag Protection and \n     Free Speech Act] falls well within the protective \n     constitutional umbrella of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky . . . \n     [and it] also avoids content-based discrimination which is \n     generally frowned on by the First Amendment.\n\n  And several other constitutional specialists also agree that this \ninitiative respects the First Amendment and will withstand \nconstitutional challenge. A memo by Robert Peck, and Professors Robert \nO'Neil and Erwin Chemerinsky concludes that this legislation ``conforms \nto constitutional requirements in both its purpose and its \nprovisions.''\n  And, these same three respected men have looked at the few State \ncourt cases which have been decided since we had this debate 3 years \nago and have reiterated their original finding of constitutionality. In \na recent memo, they explained:\n\n       Three years ago . . . [w]e expressed our strongly held \n     opinion that [the Flag Protection and Free Speech Act] would \n     be compatible with the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in Texas \n     v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989) and United States v. Eichman, \n     496 U.S. 310 (1990). We write now to reiterate that position, \n     finding that nothing that has occurred in the interim casts \n     any doubt on our conclusion.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of these \nvarious memos be printed in the Record. And, I note that some of the \nmemos refer to S. 982 in the 105th Congress and some refer to S. 1335 \nin the 104th Congress. These bills, introduced in different sessions of \nCongress, are the same, and are both entitled the Flag Protection and \nFree Speech Act.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\n                                                       Bruce Fein,\n\n\n                                              Attorney at Law,\n\n                                Great Falls, VA, October 21, 1995.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: This letter responds for your request for an \n     appraisal of the constitutionality of the proposed ``Flag \n     Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995.'' I believe it easily \n     passes constitutional muster with flying banners or guidons.\n       The only non-frivolous constitutional question is raised by \n     section 3(a). It criminalizes the destruction or damaging of \n     the flag of the United States with the intent to provoke \n     imminent violence or a breach of the peace in circumstances \n     where the provocation is reasonably likely to succeed. In \n     Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court upheld \n     the constitutionality of laws that prohibit expression \n     calculated and likely to cause a breach of the peace. Writing \n     for a unanimous Court, Justice Frank Murphy explained that \n     such ``fighting'' words ``are no essential part of any \n     exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a \n     step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them \n     is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and \n     morality.''\n       In Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the Court concluded that the \n     First Amendment is no bar to the punishment of expression \n     ``directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action \n     and is likely to incite or produce such action.''\n       In holding flag desecration statutes unconstitutional in \n     Texas v. Johnson (1989), the Court cast no doubt on the \n     continuing vitality of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky as applied \n     to expression through use or abuse of the flag. See 491 U.S. \n     at 409-410.\n       Section 3(a) falls well within the protective \n     constitutional umbrella of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky. It \n     prohibits only expressive uses of the flag that constitute \n     ``fighting'' words or are otherwise intended to provoke \n     imminent violence and in circumstances where the provocation \n     is reasonably likely to occasion lawlessness. The section is \n     also sufficiently specific in defining ``flag of the United \n     States'' to avoid the vice of vagueness. The phrase is \n     defined to include any flag in any size and in a form \n     commonly displayed as a flag that would be perceived by the \n     reasonable observer to be a flag of the United States. The \n     definition is intended to prevent circumvention by \n     destruction or damage to virtual flag representations that \n     could be as provocative to an audience as mutilating the \n     genuine article. Any potential chilling effect on free speech \n     caused by inherent definitional vagueness, moreover, is \n     nonexistent because the only type of expression punished by \n     section 3(a) is that intended by the speaker to provoke \n     imminent lawlessness, not a thoughtful response. The First \n     Amendment was not intended to protect appeals to imminent \n     criminality.\n       Section 3(a) also avoids content-based discrimination which \n     is generally frowned on by the First Amendment. It does not \n     punish based on a particular ideology or viewpoint of the \n     speaker. Rather, it punishes based on calculated provocations \n     of imminent violence through the destruction or damage of the \n     flag of the United States that are reasonably likely to \n     succeed irrespective of the content of the speaker's \n     expression. Such expressive neutrality is not \n     unconstitutional discrimination because the prohibition is \n     intended to safeguard the social interest in order, not to \n     suppress a particular idea. See F.C.C. v. Pacifica \n     Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 744-746 (1978).\n       I would welcome the opportunity to amplify on the \n     constitutionality of section 3(a) as your bill progresses \n     through the legislative process.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Bruce Fein.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Interested Parties.\n     From: Robert S. Peck, Esq. Robert M. O'Neil, Professor, \n         University of Virginia Law School and Director, Thomas \n         Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression. \n         Erwin Chemerinsky, Sydney Irmas Professor of Law and \n         Political Science, University of Southern California.\n     Re: S. 982, the Flag Protection and Free Speech Act of 1997.\n\n       Three years ago, we offered our analysis of constitutional \n     issues raised by S. 1335, which has been reintroduced this \n     Congress as S. 982, the Flag Protection and Free Speech Act. \n     We expressed our strongly held opinion that such a statute \n     would be compatible with the First Amendment and not conflict \n     with the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in Texas v. Johnson, \n     491 U.S. 397 (1989) and United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. \n     310 (1990). We write now to reiterate that position, finding \n     that nothing that has occurred in the interim casts any doubt \n     on our conclusion.\n       We observed in our earlier memorandum that the Eichman \n     Court expressly left open a number of options for flag-\n     related laws, including the approach taken by then-S. 1335 \n     (now S. 982). Moreover, we noted that, in R.A.V. v. City of \n     St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 385 (1992), the Court reiterated this \n     opening by indicating that flag burning could be punishable \n     under circumstances where dishonoring the flag did not \n     comprise the gist of the crime.\n       S. 982 targets for punishment incitement to violence, which \n     has never been regarded as a constitutionally protected \n     activity. Some opponents of S. 982 have suggested that \n     several recent state court decisions raise questions about \n     our conclusions. They are mistaken. This memorandum will \n     supplement our earlier analysis by reviewing those cases. \n     Once again, we find that our earlier reasoning remains sound.\n       The most recent of these state court decisions, and the \n     only one that was not available to us when we wrote our \n     earlier memorandum, is Wisconsin v. Janssen, 570 N.W. 2d 746 \n     (Wis. App. 1997)., review granted, 215 Wis. 2d 421 (Wis. Nov. \n     20, 1997). This memorandum will also review the holdings in \n     Ohio v. Lessin, 620 N.E. 2d 72 (Ohio 1993), cert. denied, 510 \n     U.S. 1194 (1994), and Texas v. Jimenez, 828 S.W. 2d 455 (Tex. \n     App.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 917 (1992). In preparing our \n     original memorandum in 1995, we found these two cases \n     irrelevant to the constitutionality of S. 1335 (now S. 982). \n     Review of these cases, in fact, strengthens our conclusion \n     about the constitutional viability of S. 982 because these \n     courts recognized the same distinction between the protected \n     expression of disparaging views of the flag, and the \n     punishable conduct outlined in our earlier memorandum.\n       In Janssen, a state statute made punishable as a crime both \n     contemptuous treatment of the American flag, as well as \n     conduct that did not contain expressive elements. A Wisconsin \n     Court of Appeals invalidated the statute that penalized \n     anyone who ``intentionally and publicly mutilates, defiles, \n     or casts contempt upon the flag . . .'' Such a statute, the \n     court said, improperly punishes contemptuous treatment of the \n     flag and impermissibly discriminates against a viewpoint, the \n     same flaw that the U.S. Supreme Court found in its original \n     flag burning decisions, Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989) \n     and United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990). Thus, the \n     court found that the statute's broad language ``. . . clearly \n     encompasses acts that the United States Supreme Court has \n     deemed to be protected speech.'' The Wisconsin court did not \n     specifically examine the non-expressive portion of the \n     statute, which did not implicate First Amendment concerns, \n     finding that courts cannot rewrite statutes to bring them \n     into compliance with constitutional commands. The court's \n     treatment of the statute endorses the view that a statute \n     that eschews punishment for expressing a point of view by \n     mistreatment of the flag and instead focuses solely on \n     punishable non-expressive conduct will pass constitutional \n     muster. The far more precise language of S. 982 is \n     carefully designed to avoid punishing an expressed \n     viewpoint. The Janssen case thus has no bearing on S. 982.\n       The Ohio Supreme Court's decision in Lessin also has no \n     impact on any analysis of S. 982. The Court did not overturn \n     the statute in question, which was a general incitement \n     statute, but instead reversed a conviction because of flawed \n     jury instructions. In fact, the Court indicated that a \n     conviction would be upheld if a jury convicted the accused on \n     the basis of a more ``accurate and thorough set of jury \n     instructions.'' The fatal flaw in the jury instructions was \n     that there was a failure to separate purely expressive \n     conduct from legitimately criminalized violence. Because of \n     that failure, the Court could not say whether the jury \n     convicted the defendant for contempt for the flag or \n     incitement. The Court said that the jury must be informed \n     that ``flag burning in the absence of a call to violence is \n     protected speech under the First Amendment.'' By the same \n     token, the Court's statement clearly indicates that burning \n     an American flag to incite violence is not protected by the \n     First Amendment. S. 982 properly punishes the use of the flag \n     to incite violence, and Lessin supports its \n     constitutionality.\n       Finally, Jimenez invalidated a Texas law that a court of \n     appeals in that state found indistinguishable from the \n     federal law invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court in Eichman. \n     Unlike S. 982, the Texas law did not require proof of direct \n     incitement to imminent lawless action. Instead, it still \n     targeted protected expression, though it contained no \n     viewpoint bias. While the Jimenez Court speculated that no \n     flag burning law could ever be constitutional, that question \n     was definitively answered otherwise, as we indicated in our \n     first memorandum, by the U.S. Supreme Court in R.A.V., a \n     decision issued several months after Jimenez. In R.A.V., the \n     Court said that flag burning that did not publish the message \n     or viewpoint of the flag burner, but concentrated solely on \n     the criminal conduct, would meet constitutional requirements.\n       Opponents of S. 982 also argue that the fact that the \n     Supreme Court denied certiorari in Jimenez and Lessin shows \n     that the Court would likely find S. 982 unconstitutional. \n     This argument is flawed for two principal reasons. First, \n     since the underlying state decisions do not address the \n     constitutionality of S. 982, or call into question the \n     premises upon which its validity rests, the Court's denial of \n     certiorari in those cases could not support the claim that \n     the Court would invalidate S. 982 on constitutional grounds.\n       Second, the Supreme Court each year decides to review only \n     a tiny fraction of the several thousand appeals and petitions \n     that are filed. The Court is not a court of error, but rather \n     takes cases that require a national resolution, and it spoke \n     definitively to the flag burning issue in Johnson and \n     Eichman. Given that neither Jimenez nor Lessin raised novel \n     or undecided constitutional issues that required such a \n     national\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\n     resolution, there was very little chance that the Court would \n     be interested in hearing these cases. As Justice Stevens \n     stated last year, ``it is well settled that our decision to \n     deny a petition for a writ of certiorari does not in any \n     sense constitute a ruling on the merits of the case in which \n     the writ is sought.'' Bethley v. Louisiana, 117 S. Ct. 2425 \n     (1997) (statement of Stevens, J.); see also Maryland v. \n     Baltimore Radio Show, Inc., 228 U.S. 912, 919 (1950) (opinion \n     of Frankfurter, J., respecting denial of petition for writ of \n     cert.), U.S. v. Carver, 260 U.S. 482 (1923). The value of the \n     Jimenez and Lessin decisions, therefore, is in no way \n     enhanced by the Court's refusal of review.\n       We conclude, on the basis of all relevant judicial \n     decisions, that S. 982 is constitutional.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Interested Parties.\n     From: Robert S. Peck, Esq. Robert M. O'Neil, Professor, \n         University of Virginia Law School Erwin Chemerinsky, \n         Legion Lex Professor of Law, University of Southern \n         California.\n     Re: S. 1335, the Flag Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995.\n     Date: November 7, 1995.\n\n       This memorandum will analyze the constitutional \n     implications of S. 1335, the Flag Protection and Free Speech \n     Act of 1995. As its name implies and the legislation states \n     as its purpose, S. 1335 seeks ``to provide the maximum \n     protection against the use of the flag of the United States \n     to promote violence while respecting the liberties that it \n     symbolizes.'' S. 1335, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. Sec. 2(b) \n     (1995). This memorandum concludes that the bill conforms to \n     constitutional requirements in both its purpose and its \n     provisions.\n       It would be a mistake to conclude that S. 1335 is \n     unconstitutional simply because the U.S. Supreme Court \n     invalidated the Flag Protection Act of 1990 in its decision \n     in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990). In this \n     decision, as well as its earlier flag-desecration opinion, \n     the Court specifically left open a number of options for \n     flag-related laws, including the approach undertaken by S. \n     1335. The Court reiterated its stand in its 1992 cross-\n     burning case, indicating that flag burning could be \n     punishable under circumstances where dishonoring the flag did \n     not comprise the gist of the crime. R.A.V. v. City of St. \n     Paul, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2544 (1992).\n       Unlike the 1990 flag law that the Court negated, S. 1335 is \n     not aimed at suppressing non-violent political protest; in \n     fact, it fully acknowledges that constitutionally protected \n     right. In contrast, the Flag Protection Act, the Court said, \n     unconstitutionally attempted to reserve the use of the flag \n     as a symbol for governmentally approved expressive purposes. \n     S. 1335 makes no similar attempt to prohibit the use of the \n     flag to express certain points of view. Instead, it both \n     advances a legitimate anti-violent purpose while remaining \n     solicitous of our tradition of ``uninhibited, robust, and \n     wide-open'' public debate. New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 \n     U.S. 254, 270 (1964).\n       Moreover, the statute is sensitive to, and complies with, \n     several other constitutional considerations, namely: (1) it \n     does not discriminate between expression on the basis of its \n     content or viewpoint, since it avoids the kind of \n     discrimination condemned by the court in R.A.V.; (2) it does \n     not provide opponents of controversial political ideas with \n     an excuse to use their own propensity for violence as a means \n     of exercising a veto over otherwise protected speech, since \n     it requires that the defendant have a specific intent to \n     instigate a violent response; and (3) it does not usurp \n     authority vested in the states, since it does not intrude \n     upon police powers traditionally exercised by the states. \n     Each of these points will be discussed in greater detail \n     below.\n       One additional point is worth noting. Passing a statute is \n     far preferable to enacting a constitutional amendment that \n     would mark the first time in its more than two centuries as a \n     beacon of freedom that the United States amended the Bill of \n     Rights. Totalitarian regimes fear freedom and enact broad \n     authorizations to pick and choose the freedoms they allow. \n     The broadly worded proposed constitutional amendment follows \n     that blueprint by giving plenary authority to the federal and \n     state governments to pick and choose which exercises of \n     freedom will be tolerated. On the contrary, American \n     democracy has never feared freedom, and no crisis exists that \n     should cause us to reconsider this path. Because the Court \n     has never said that Congress lacks the constitutional power \n     to enact a statute to prevent the flag from becoming a tool \n     of violence, a statute--rather than a constitutional \n     amendment--is an incomparably better choice.\n\n\nI. S. 1335 Punishes Violence or Incitement to Violence, Not Expressive \n                                Conduct\n\n       The fatal common flaw in the flag-desecration prosecution \n     of Gregory Lee Johnson, whose Supreme Court case started the \n     controversy that has led to the proposed constitutional \n     amendment, and the subsequent enactment by Congress of the \n     Flag Protection Act of 1989 was the focus on punishing \n     contemptuous views concerning the American flag. Eichman, 496 \n     U.S. at 317-19; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 405-07 \n     (1989). In both instances, law was employed in an attempt to \n     reserve use of the flag for governmentally approved \n     viewpoints (i.e., patriotic purposes). The Court held such a \n     reservation violated bedrock First Amendment principles in \n     that the government has no power to ``ensure that a symbol be \n     used to express only one view of that symbol or its \n     referents.'' Id. at 417.\n       Johnson had been charged with desecrating a venerated \n     object, rather than any of a number of other criminal charges \n     that he could have been prosecuted for and that would not \n     have raised any constitutional issues. Critical to the \n     Supreme Court's decision in his case, as well as to the \n     Texas courts that also held the conviction \n     unconstitutional, was the fact that ``[n]o one was \n     physically injured or threatened with injury.'' 491 U.S. \n     at 399. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals noted that \n     ``there was no breach of the peace nor does the record \n     reflect that the situation was potentially explosive.'' \n     Id. at 401 (quoting 755 S.W. 2d 92, 96 (1988)). Thus, the \n     primary concern addressed by S. 1335, incitement to \n     violence, was not at issue in the Johnson case. The \n     Eichman Court found the congressional statute to be \n     indistinguishable in its intent and purpose from the \n     prosecution reviewed in Johnson and thus also \n     unconstitutional.\n       In reaching its conclusion about the issue of \n     constitutionality, the Court, however, specifically declared \n     that ``[w]e do not suggest that the First Amendment forbids a \n     State to prevent, `imminent lawless action.' '' Id. at 410 \n     (quoting Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969)). In \n     Brandenburg, the Court said that government may not ``forbid \n     or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation \n     except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or \n     producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or \n     produce such action.'' 395 U.S. at 447. It went on to state \n     that ``[a] statute which fails to draw this distinction \n     impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the \n     First and Fourteenth Amendments. It sweeps within its \n     condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from \n     government control.'' Id. at 448.\n       S. 1335 merely takes up the Court's invitation to focus a \n     proper law on ``imminent lawless action.'' It specifically \n     punishes ``[a]ny person who destroys or damages a flag of the \n     United States with the primary purpose and intent to incite \n     or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace, and in \n     circumstances where the person knows it is reasonably likely \n     to produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace.'' S. \n     1335, at Sec. 3(a). The language precisely mirrors the \n     Court's Brandenburg criteria. It does not implicate the \n     Constitution's free-speech protections, because ``[t]he First \n     Amendment does not protect violence.'' NAACP v. Claiborne \n     Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 916 (1982).\n       More recently, the Court put it this way: ``a physical \n     assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive \n     conduct protected by the First Amendment.'' Wisconsin v. \n     Mitchell, 113 S. Ct. 2194, 2199 (1993). Under the Court's \n     criteria, for example, a symbolic protest that consists of \n     hanging the President in effigy is indeed protected symbolic \n     speech. Although hanging the actual President might convey \n     the same message of protest, a physical assault on the \n     nation's chief executive cannot be justified as \n     constitutionally protected expressive activity and could \n     constitutionally be singled out for specific punishment. S. \n     1335 makes this necessary distinction as well, protecting \n     the use of the flag to make a political statement, whether \n     pro- or anti-government, while imposing sanctions for its \n     use to incite a violent response.\n       Courts and prosecutors are quite capable of discerning the \n     difference between protected speech and actionable conduct. \n     Federal law already makes a variety of threats of violence a \n     crime. Congress has, for example, targeted for criminal \n     sanction interference with commerce by threat or violence, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1951, (1994), incitement to riot, 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2101, tampering with consumer products, U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1365, and interfering with certain federally protected \n     activities. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245. S. 1335 fits well within the \n     rubric that these laws have previously occupied. It cannot be \n     reasonably asserted that S. 1335 attempts to suppress \n     protected expression.\n\n\n II. S. 1335 Does Not Unconstitutionally Discriminate on the Basis of \n                          Content or Viewpoint\n\n       The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that ``above \n     all else, the First Amendment means that government has no \n     power to restrict expression because of its message, its \n     ideas, its subject matter, or its content.'' Police \n     Department v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972). On this basis, \n     the Court recently invalidated a St. Paul, Minnesota \n     ordinance that purported to punish symbolic expression when \n     it constituted fighting words directed toward people because \n     of their race, color, creed, religion or gender. Fighting \n     words is a category of expression that the Court had \n     previously held to be outside the First Amendment's \n     protections. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-\n     72 (1942). In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S. Ct. 2538, \n     2543 (1992), the Court gave this statement greater nuance by \n     stating that categories of speech such as fighting words are \n     not so entirely without constitutional import ``that they may \n     be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to \n     their distinctively proscribable content.'' Explaining this \n     concept, the Court gave an example involving libel: ``the \n     government may proscribe libel; but it may not make the \n     further content discrimination of proscribing only libel \n     critical of the government.'' Id.\n       As a further example, the Court said a city council could \n     not enact an ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene \n     works that\n\n[[Page S4490]]\n\n     contain criticism of the city government. Id. As yet another \n     example, the Court stated that ``burning a flag in violation \n     of an ordinance against outdoor fires could be punishable, \n     whereas burning a flag in violation of an ordinance against \n     dishonoring the flag is not.'' Id. at 2544. The rationale \n     behind this limitation, the Court explained, was that \n     government could not be vested with the power to ``drive \n     certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.'' Id. at \n     2545 (quoting Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the \n     N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 112 S.Ct. 501, 508 (1991)).\n       No such danger exists under S. 1335. Both the patriotic \n     group that makes use of the flag to provoke a violent \n     response from dissenters and the protesters who use the flag \n     to provoke a violent response from loyalists are subject to \n     its provisions. A law that would only punish one or the other \n     perspective would have the kind of constitutional flaw \n     identified by the Court in R.A.V. Moreover, the legislation \n     recognizes, as the Supreme Court itself did (``the flag \n     occupies a ``deservedly cherished place in our community,'' \n     491 U.S. at 419) that the flag has a special status that \n     justifies its special attention. Similarly, the R.A.V. Court \n     noted that a law aimed at protecting the President against \n     threats of violence, even though it did not protect other \n     citizens, is constitutional because such threats ``have \n     special force when applied to the person of the President.'' \n     Id. at 2546. The rule against content discrimination, the \n     Court explained, is not a rule against content \n     discrimination, the Court explained, is not a rule against \n     under-inclusiveness. For example, ``a State may choose to \n     regulate price advertising in one industry but not in others, \n     because the risk of fraud is in its view greater there.'' Id. \n     (parenthetical and citation omitted).\n       The federal law cited earlier that make certain types of \n     threats of violence into crimes are not thought to pose \n     content discrimination problems because they deal with only \n     limited kinds of threats. To give another example, federal \n     law also makes the use of a gun in the course of a crime \n     grounds for special additional punishment. See 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 924(c). In Brandenburg, the Court found that a Ku Klux \n     Klan rally at which guns were brandished and overthrow of the \n     government discussed remained protected free speech. Because \n     guns were used for expressive purposes in Brandenburg and \n     found to be beyond the law's reach there does not mean that \n     the law enhancing punishment because a gun is used during the \n     commission of a crime unlawfully infringes on any expressive \n     rights.\n       The gun law makes the necessary constitutional distinctions \n     that the Court requires, and so does S. 1335's concentration \n     on crimes involving the American flag rather than protests \n     involving the flag. S. 1335 properly identifies in its \n     findings the reason for Congress to take special note of the \n     flag: ``it is a unique symbol of national unity.'' \n     Sec. 2(a)(1). It notes that ``destruction of the flag of the \n     United States can occur to incite a violent response rather \n     than make a political statement.'' Sec. 2(a)(4). As a result, \n     Congress has developed the necessary legislative facts to \n     justify such a particularized law.\n       In its only post-R.A.V. decision on a hate-crimes statute, \n     the Court upheld a statute that enhanced the punishment of an \n     individual who ``intentionally selects'' his victim on the \n     basis of race, religion, color, disability, sexual \n     orientation, national origin or ancestry. Wisconsin v. \n     Mitchell, 113 S.Ct. 2194 (1993). A fair reading of the \n     Court's unanimous decision in that case supports the \n     conclusion that the Court would not strike down S. 1335 on \n     R.A.V. grounds. In Mitchell, the Court concluded that the \n     statute did not impermissibly punish the defendant's \n     ``abstract beliefs,'' id. at 2200 (citing Dawson v. \n     Delaware, 122 S. Ct. 1093 (1992)), but instead spotlighted \n     conduct that had the potential to cause a physical harm \n     that the State could properly proscribe. S. 1335 similarly \n     eschews ideological or viewpoint discrimination to focus \n     on the intentional provocation of violence, a harm well \n     within the government's power to punish.\n\n\n            iii. s. 1335 does not encourage a heckler's veto\n\n       First Amendment doctrine does not permit the government to \n     use the excuse of a hostile audience to prevent the \n     expression of political ideas. Thus, the First Amendment will \n     not allow the government to give a heckler some sort of veto \n     against the expression of ideas that he or she finds \n     offensive. As a result, the Court has observed, ``in public \n     debate our own citizens must tolerate insulting, and even \n     outrageous, speech in order to provide `adequate breathing \n     space' to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment.'' \n     Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 322 (1988). Any other approach \n     to free speech ``would lead to standardization of ideas \n     either by legislatures, courts, or dominant political or \n     community groups.'' Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4 \n     (1949). Thus, simply because some might be provoked and \n     respond violently to a march that expressed hatred of the \n     residents of a community, that is insufficient justification \n     to overcome the First Amendment's protection of ideas, no \n     matter how noxious they may be deemed. See, e.g., Collin v. \n     Smith, 578 F.2d 1197 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 953 \n     (1978).\n       The Supreme Court's flag-burning decisions applied this \n     principal. In Johnson, the state of Texas attempted to \n     counter the argument against its flag-desecration prosecution \n     by asserting an overriding governmental interest; it claimed \n     that the burning of a flag ``is necessarily likely to disturb \n     the peace and that the expression may be prohibited on this \n     basis.'' 491 U.S. at 408 (footnote omitted). The Court \n     rejected this argument on two grounds: (1) no evidence had \n     been submitted to indicate that there was an actual breach of \n     the peace, nor was evidence adduced that a breach of the \n     peace was one of Johnson's goals; Id. at 407, and (2) to hold \n     ``that every flag burning necessarily possesses [violent] \n     potential would be to eviscerate our holding in Brandenburg \n     [that the expression must be directed to and likely to incite \n     or produce violence to be subject to criminalization].'' Id. \n     at 409.\n       S. 1335 avoids the problems that Texas had by requiring \n     that the defendant have ``the primary purpose and intent to \n     incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace, \n     . . . in circumstances where the person knows it is \n     reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or a breach of \n     the peace.'' S. 1335, at Sec. (a)(a). If Texas had \n     demonstrated that Johnson had intended to breach the peace \n     and was likely to accomplish this goal, Johnson could have \n     been convicted of a crime for burning the U.S. flag. Texas, \n     however, never attempted to prove this.\n       Moreover, S. 1335 does not enable hecklers to veto \n     expression by reacting violently because it requires that the \n     defendant have the specific intent to provoke that response, \n     while at the same time taking away any bias-motivated \n     discretion from law enforcers. The existence of a scienter \n     requirement and a likelihood element is critical to \n     distinguishing between a law that unconstitutionally punishes \n     a viewpoint because some people hate it and one that \n     legitimately punishes incitement to violence.\n\n\n          iv. s. 1335 is consistent with federalism principles\n\n       Earlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Gun-Free \n     School Zones Act of 1990, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(q)(1)(a) \n     unconstitutionally exceeded the power of Congress to regulate \n     Commerce. Untied States v. Lopez, 63 U.S.L.W. 4343(1995). In \n     doing so, the Court reaffirmed the original principle that \n     ``the powers delegated by the [] Constitution to the federal \n     government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in \n     the State governments are numerous and indefinite.'' Id. at \n     4344 (quoting The Federalist No. 45, pp. 292-293 (C. Rossiter \n     ed. 1961) (James Madison)).\n       S. 1335 respects these principles by directing its \n     sanctions only at preventing the use of the national flag to \n     incite violence, preventing someone from damaging an American \n     flag belonging to the United States, or damaging, on federal \n     land, an American flag stolen from another person. Each of \n     these acts have a clear federal nexus and remain properly \n     within the jurisdiction of the federal government. Moreover, \n     the bill concedes jurisdiction to the states wherever it may \n     properly be exercised. S. 1335, at Sec. 3(a)(d).\n\n\n                             v. conclusion\n\n       S. 1335 is carefully crafted to avoid constitutional \n     difficulties by being solicitous of federalism and freedom of \n     speech by focusing on incitement to violence. By doing so, it \n     meets all constitutional requirements.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 1995.\n     To: Honorable Robert F. Bennett. Attention: Lisa Norton.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Constitutionality of Flag Desecration Bill.\n       This memorandum is in response to your request for a \n     constitutional evaluation of S. 1335, 104th Congress, a bill \n     to provide for the protection of the flag of the United \n     States and free speech and for other purposes.\n       Briefly, the bill would criminalize the destruction or \n     damage of a United States flag under three circumstances. \n     First, subsection (a) would penalize such conduct when the \n     person engaging in it does so with the primary purpose and \n     intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of \n     the peace and in circumstances where the person knows it is \n     reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or a breach of \n     the peace.\n       Second, subsection (b) would punish any person who steals \n     or knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use of \n     another, a United States flag belonging to the United States \n     and who intentionally destroys or damages that flag. Third, \n     subsection (c) punishes any person who, within any lands \n     reserved for the use of the United States or under the \n     exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction of the United States, \n     steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use \n     of another, a flag of the United States belonging to another \n     person and who intentionally destroys or damages that flag.\n       Of course, the bill is intended to protect the flag of the \n     United States in circumstances under which statutory \n     protection may be afforded. The obstacle to a general \n     prohibition of destruction of or damage to the flag is the \n     principle enunciated in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. \n     310 (1990), and Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), that \n     flag desecration, usually through burning, is expressive \n     conduct if committed to ``send a message,'' and that the \n     Court would review limits on this conduct with exacting \n     scrutiny; legislation that proposed to penalize the conduct \n     in order to silence the message or out of disagreement with \n     the message violates the First Amendment speech clause.\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\n       Rather clearly, subsections (b) and (c) would present no \n     constitutional difficulties, based on judicial precedents, \n     either facially or as applied. The Court has been plain that \n     one may not exercise expressive conduct or symbolic speech \n     with or upon the property of others or by trespass upon the \n     property of another Eichman, supra, 496 U.S., 316 n. 5; \n     Johnson, supra, 412 n. 8; Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, \n     408-409 (1974). See also R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 \n     S.Ct. 2538 (1992) (cross burning on another's property). The \n     subsections are directed precisely to the theft or conversion \n     of a flag belonging to someone else, the government or a \n     private party, and the destruction of or damage to that flag.\n       Almost as evident from the Supreme Court's precedents, \n     subsection (a) is quite likely to pass constitutional muster. \n     The provision's language is drawn from the ``fighting words'' \n     doctrine of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942). \n     That case defined a variety of expression that was \n     unprotected by the First Amendment, among the categories \n     being speech that inflicts injury or tends to incite \n     immediate violence. Id., 572. While the Court over the years \n     has modified the other categories listed in Chaplinsky, it \n     has not departed from the holding that the ``fighting words'' \n     exception continues to exist. It has, of course, laid down \n     some governing principles, which are reflected in the \n     subsection's language.\n       Thus, the Court has applied to ``fighting words'' the \n     principle of Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), under \n     which speech advocating unlawful action may be punished only \n     if it directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless \n     action and is likely to incite or produce such action. Id., \n     447. This development is spelled out in Cohen v. California, \n     403 U.S. 15, 20, 22-23 (1971). See also NAACP v. Claiborne \n     Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 928 (1982); Hess v. Indiana, 414 \n     U.S. 105 (1973).\n       A second principle, enunciated in an opinion demonstrating \n     the continuing vitality of the ``fighting words'' doctrine, \n     is that it is impermissible to punish only those ``fighting \n     words'' of which government disapproves. Government may not \n     distinguish between classes of ``fighting words'' on an \n     ideological basis. R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S.Ct. \n     2538 (1992).\n       Subsection (a) is drafted in a manner to reflect both these \n     principles. It requires not only that the conduct be \n     reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or breach of \n     the peace, but that the person intend to bring about imminent \n     violence or breach of the peace. Further, nothing in the \n     subsection draws a distinction between approved or \n     disapproved expression that is communicated by the action \n     committed with or on the flag.\n       In conclusion, the judicial precedents establish that the \n     bill, if enacted, would survive constitutional attack. \n     Subsections (b) and (c) are more securely grounded in \n     constitutional law, but subsection (a) is only a little less \n     anchored in decisional law.\n       Because of time constraints, this memorandum is necessarily \n     brief. If, however, you desire a more generous treatment, \n     please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.\n\n                                            Johnny H. Killian,\n\n                                                Senior Specialist,\n                                      American Constitutional Law.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I urge the Senate to pass this legislation and protect \nour Nation's most cherished symbol and our most revered document.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill in its entirety \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 931\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Flag Protection Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the flag of the United States is a unique symbol of \n     national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice, \n     and equality that make this Nation an example of freedom \n     unmatched throughout the world;\n       (2) the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and \n     should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted \n     to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to \n     by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by \n     free and democratic nations;\n       (3) abuse of the flag of the United States causes more than \n     pain and distress to the overwhelming majority of the \n     American people and may amount to fighting words or a direct \n     threat to the physical and emotional well-being of \n     individuals at whom the threat is targeted; and\n       (4) destruction of the flag of the United States can be \n     intended to incite a violent response rather than make a \n     political statement and such conduct is outside the \n     protections afforded by the first amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide the \n     maximum protection against the use of the flag of the United \n     States to promote violence while respecting the liberties \n     that it symbolizes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST \n                   USE FOR PROMOTING VIOLENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 700 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property \n       involving the flag of the United States\n\n       ``(a) Definition of Flag of the United States.--In this \n     section, the term `flag of the United States' means any flag \n     of the United States, or any part thereof, made of any \n     substance, in any size, in a form that is commonly displayed \n     as a flag and that would be taken to be a flag by the \n     reasonable observer.\n       ``(b) Actions Promoting Violence.--Any person who destroys \n     or damages a flag of the United States with the primary \n     purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, and under circumstances in which the \n     person knows that it is reasonably likely to produce imminent \n     violence or a breach of the peace, shall be fined not more \n     than $100,000, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n       ``(c) Damaging a Flag Belonging to the United States.--Any \n     person who steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or \n     to the use of another, a flag of the United States belonging \n     to the United States, and who intentionally destroys or \n     damages that flag, shall be fined not more than $250,000 \n     imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.\n       ``(d) Damaging a Flag of Another on Federal Land.--Any \n     person who, within any lands reserved for the use of the \n     United States, or under the exclusive or concurrent \n     jurisdiction of the United States, steals or knowingly \n     converts to his or her use, or to the use of another, a flag \n     of the United States belonging to another person, and who \n     intentionally destroys or damages that flag, shall be fined \n     not more than $250,000, imprisoned not more than 2 years, or \n     both.\n       ``(e) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to indicate an intent on the part of Congress to \n     deprive any State, territory, or possession of the United \n     States, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of jurisdiction \n     over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the \n     absence of this section.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for chapter 33 of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended by striking the item \n     relating to section 700 and inserting the following:\n\n``700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property involving the flag \n              of the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe bipartisan Flag Protection Act of 1999. I salute its author, \nSenator McConnell of Kentucky.\n  I believe every Member of this body abhors acts of desecration \nagainst the flag. Burning a flag, or otherwise dishonoring this symbol \nof freedom, is repugnant to me, to my colleagues, and to the vast \nmajority of American citizens. I believe we should protect the flag \nfrom the acts of those few who would dishonor it.\n  But the question is, How do we do it? Mr. President, we have \npreviously passed a statute to protect the flag but that was overturned \nby the U.S. Supreme Court as unconstitutional.\n  Some now say the only alternative is to pass a constitutional \namendment. After considerable study and review, I have concluded that \nis not the case. There is an alternative, and the alternative is the \nlegislation that we offer today, the Flag Protection Act of 1999. It is \na statute. It is not a constitutional amendment. It will protect the \nflag, and I believe it will be upheld as constitutional.\n  We have a clear responsibility to exhaust all other options before we \ntake the very serious step of amending the Constitution of the United \nStates. Every one of us in the Senate pledges on our first day in this \nChamber to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates. Amending that time-honored, time-tested document is among the \nmost serious of our duties--a step we have taken only rarely in the \nlong history of our country.\n  The Constitution is the foundation of our Government. I believe it is \none of the greatest documents in human history. Its freedoms are the \nsource of our strength as a nation--and a model of freedom to the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, the Founding Fathers wisely made it very difficult to \namend the Constitution. They knew that a process that would allow for \neasy amendment of the Constitution could destabilize our country, that \nit could undermine the stability we have enjoyed through our long \nhistory. The Constitution has been amended only 27 times in 200 years, \nalthough many more attempts have been made.\n  Those 27 amendments, beginning with the Bill of Rights, were the \nresult\n\n[[Page S4492]]\n\nof fundamental debates about the nature of our society, and who we \nwould be as a nation. Freedom of religion, freedom of the press, \nfreedom to assemble peacefully, the right to a trial by jury, the right \nto vote--these amendments address rights so basic we almost take them \nfor granted today. Yet, some of them at the time of adoption provoked \nserious debate and division, division so deep they threatened to split \nthe country.\n  Mr. President, I hesitate to launch this Nation on an undertaking of \nsuch magnitude and divisiveness. When there is an alternative--and \nthere is an alternative--I believe we can protect the flag without \namending the Constitution. I believe we can propose and pass a statute \nthat will protect the flag against burning and other acts of \ndesecration, and I believe that statute will be upheld as \nconstitutional.\n  That is why today I am joining this bipartisan effort with my \ncolleagues, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, Senator Dorgan of North \nDakota, and Senator Bennett of Utah, to introduce the Flag Protection \nAct of 1999. This statute provides for maximum protection for the flag \nwhile respecting the liberties it symbolizes. We have been assured by \nexperts at the Congressional Research Service and by constitutional \nscholars that it will be upheld by the courts.\n  When it comes to amending the Constitution, I am conservative. I feel \nstrongly that the flag can and should be protected. But before we take \nthe step of amending the Constitution of the United States, we should \nexhaust every other remedy. Today we have introduced a statutory \nremedy. I ask my colleagues to join me in approving this law to protect \nthe flag and the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the AMVETS of North Dakota. The AMVETS, in a letter to \nme, dated September 29, 1998, have endorsed this approach. I also ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the specific provision \nthat they adopted at their convention supporting the approach that we \nare taking today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                           AMVETS,\n\n\n                                   Department of North Dakota,\n\n                                    Fargo, ND, September 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: I am sure your are hearing both sides \n     of the issue concerning SJR-40. During our May 1998 \n     Department convention in West Fargo, our membership passed an \n     amended resolution to petition congress to work towards \n     legislation to prevent U.S. Flag Desecration. Enclosed is a \n     copy of the passed resolution S98-14. During the convention \n     you addressed our membership and stated you felt this was a \n     viable and defensible alternative to a proposed \n     Constitutional amendment. At our State Executive Committee \n     meeting Wahpeton, ND, on September 26, 1998, the SEC voted to \n     continue pursuing this goal.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.\n                                              Randall A. LeKander,\n     Department Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Resolution S. 98-14\n\n\n                         u.s. flag desecration\n\n       Whereas although the right of free expression is part of \n     the foundation of the Constitution of the United States, very \n     carefully drawn limits on expression, in specific instances, \n     have long been recognized as legitimate means of maintaining \n     public safety and defining other societal standards, and\n       Whereas certain actions, although arguably related to a \n     person's free expression, nevertheless raise issues \n     concerning public decency, public space, and the rights of \n     other citizens, and\n       Whereas the United States flag is a most honorable and \n     worthy banner of a nation which is thankful for its strengths \n     and committed to curing its faults, a nation that remains the \n     destination of millions of immigrants attracted by the \n     universal power of the American ideal, and\n       Whereas the law, as interpreted by the United States \n     Supreme Court, no longer accords the Stars and Stripes the \n     reverence, respect and dignity befitting a banner of that \n     most noble experiment of a nation-state, and\n       Whereas it is only fitting the Americans everywhere should \n     lend their voices to a forceful call for restoration of the \n     Stars and Stripes to a proper station under law and decency; \n     now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That AMVETS petition Congress to work towards \n     legislation which specifies that Congress shall have the \n     power to prohibit physical desecration of the United States \n     flag.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would also like to read briefly from a \nletter I received from a constituent in North Dakota. He wrote to me \nthe following:\n\n       As a third generation military officer, I cannot support an \n     amendment to the Constitution with respect to the flag. I \n     have many compelling reasons to ask that you not support this \n     amendment. My sworn duty as an officer in the United States \n     Air Force to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United \n     States lies at the heart of my opposition. This amendment \n     will weaken the Constitution and open the door for more \n     frivolous amendments in the future. I cannot stand by and let \n     this happen without raising my voice.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Of the gallant Americans who fought and died in the service \n     of our country within the last 200 years, I tell you this: \n     They did not die defending the flag. They died defending our \n     freedom and the ideals upon which our country was founded. \n     Don't cheapen their sacrifice by supporting this misguided \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, a third letter that I received was from a man also \nfrom North Dakota. He wrote me this:\n\n       On my mother's side, my great-grandfather came to the \n     United States from Bohemia and fought in the Union Army. On \n     my father's side, my great-grandmother lost her two oldest \n     sons, Iowa soldiers, at the Siege of Vicksburg. And members \n     of my family have represented the United States in every war \n     since. I am a Korean War combat veteran.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The flag is strong enough to take care of itself. But if \n     these flag protectors are sincere about its protection, then \n     strong legislation is the safest way to go.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what we are offering today on a bipartisan \nbasis--four Senators; two Democrats, two Republicans--offering the Flag \nProtection Act of 1999. We believe this is the appropriate way to \nprotect the flag.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nlegislation that my colleagues, Senator McConnell, Senator Bennett, \nSenator Conrad and I have jointly introduced--a piece of legislation \ncalled the Flag Protection Act.\n  This, at its roots, is about the Constitution. Some will say the \nConstitution is an easy issue.\n  A decade ago, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Texas statute, a \nstatute which provided criminal sanctions for the burning of an \nAmerican flag. The Supreme Court said, no, the desecration of a flag is \nan expression of speech. That fellow in Texas had a constitutional \nright to do that. That was a 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court. I \ndisagreed with that decision. I think the Supreme Court was wrong. But \nimmediately--and for 10 years--there was an effort to amend the \nConstitution to overturn the Supreme Court's decision and allow a \nstatute to be deemed constitutional that would prohibit the desecration \nof the American flag.\n\n  I have voted on two occasions against a constitutional amendment to \nprohibit flag desecration. Those who say it is an easy vote say it is \njust an amendment amending the Constitution. Let's just do it and \nprotect the flag.\n  It might be easy for them; it is not easy for me.\n  Then there are those who say we should never amend the Constitution, \nthat you have a right to desecrate the flag. They too say this is an \neasy choice. Let's just make that choice.\n  This decision has been just as difficult. I have agonized about this \nissue.\n  There are many, many Americans, over many, many years, who have shed \ntheir blood to nurture this country's liberties and freedoms. The \nburning of an American flag is a disgusting act, one that I personally \ndo not think is protected under the first amendment of the \nConstitution.\n  The question is, however, what do you do to remedy this situation? Do \nyou amend the Constitution, or is there a way to craft a statute saying \nflag desecration is wrong in a manner that the Supreme Court would say, \nyes, this statute will meet the test?\n  I believe there is. I have believed all along there is. I pledged to \nsome folks back in my home State that I would review this, reanalyze it \nagain. I have done that over and over. I have read everything that has \nbeen written by virtually all of the scholars on both sides of this \nissue. I conclude, once again, that our country is better served by \nreserving our attempts to alter the U.S. Constitution for those things \nthat are extraordinary occasions, as one of the\n\n[[Page S4493]]\n\nauthors of the Constitution, James Madison discussed. Then the \nConstitution should be amended only in circumstances when it is the \nonly remedy.\n  Some 12 or 13 years ago, I went to Philadelphia in the summertime for \nthe 200th birthday of the writing of the U.S. Constitution. I have told \nmy colleagues this before, but I want to say it again, because it \ndescribes how I feel for the Constitution.\n  Two hundred years previously, 55 white men marched into the assembly \nroom in Independence Hall, a room that is substantially smaller than \nthis Chamber. Those 55 men wrote a Constitution for this country. \nWalking down the cobbled streets of Philadelphia, someone asked \nBenjamin Franklin, one of the 55, what they were doing. He said, we are \nwriting a Constitution, if you can keep it.\n  Two hundred years after the writing of that Constitution, 55 of us \nwere privileged to go back into the very same room. The chair where \nGeorge Washington presided still sits in the front of the room. Mason \nsat over here, Madison, Ben Franklin. I was one of the 55 chosen, men, \nwomen, minorities. I come from a town of 300 people, a high school \nclass of 9. I got goose bumps sitting in this room where they wrote the \nConstitution of the United States. I have never forgotten that day, \nthinking that I am in the room where the historic figures of our \ncountry created the framework for governance in our country.\n  That day is always etched in my memory when we debate the questions \nof whether we should amend the Constitution of the United States.\n  There have been 11,000 proposals to change America's Constitution. \nOutside of the first 10, the Bill of Rights, only 17 amendments have \nchanged our Constitution in the more than two centuries of history in \nthis country.\n  Now we have a proposal during these past 10 years to change the \nConstitution. Is it a serious proposal about a serious issue? Yes, it \nis. Our flag is important. So is our Constitution. It seems to me, as I \nsaid, our country is better served if there is a way to address the \nissue of flag desecration by passing a statute that will meet the test \nof the Supreme Court, to do that rather than alter our U.S. \nConstitution.\n  The piece of legislation we have introduced today has been reviewed \nby a number of constitutional experts, the Congressional Research \nService and elsewhere, and they indicate they feel it does meet the \ntest. It would be upheld by the Supreme Court.\n  To be able to enact a statute of this type and avoid altering the \nConstitution makes eminent good sense to me. I think future generations \nand our Founding Fathers would agree that it is worth the effort for us \nto find a way to protect our flag without having to wonder about the \nunintended consequences of altering this significant area of our \nConstitution that guarantees and preserves important rights for the \ncitizens of our country.\n  Mr. President, I know that many who have invested a great amount of \ntime and effort to enact a constitutional amendment will be sorely \ndisappointed by my decision and, perhaps, Senator Conrad's decision and \nothers, to not support a constitutional amendment on flag desecration. \nI know they are impatient to correct a decision by the Supreme Court \nthat they and I believe was wrong.\n  I have wrestled with this issue for so long. I wish I were not, with \nmy decision, disappointing so many, including some of my friends who \npassionately believe we must amend the Constitution to protect the \nflag. But as I sift through all of the material and think about the \nhistory of our country and think about this constitutional framework of \nour government and all of the appetite that exists here and elsewhere \nto change this Constitution for 100 different reasons and 100 different \nways, I think our country is better served by patience and by a \nthoughtful effort to correct a problem short of altering our country's \nConstitution.\n  For that reason, I join my colleagues today, two Republicans and two \nDemocrats, to offer a piece of legislation that would serve, instead of \naltering our Constitution, as an effort to protect our American flag.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my written statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 10 years ago the U.S. Supreme Court \nin a 5-4 decision struck down a Texas flag protection statute on the \ngrounds that burning an American flag was ``speech'' and therefore \nprotected under the First Amendment of the Constitution. I disagreed \nwith the Court's decision then and I still do. I don't believe that the \nact of desecrating a flag is an act of speech. I believe that our flag, \nas our national symbol, can and should be protected by law.\n  In the intervening years since the Supreme Court decision I have \ntwice supported federal legislation that would make flag desecration \nillegal, and on two occasions I voted against amendments to the \nConstitution to do the same. I voted that way because, while I believe \nthat flag desecration is despicable conduct that should be prohibited \nby law, I also believe that amending our Constitution is a step that \nshould be taken only rarely and then only as a last resort.\n  In the past year I have once again reviewed in detail nearly all of \nthe legal opinions and written materials published by Constitutional \nscholars and courts on all sides of this issue. I pledged to the \nsupporters of the Constitutional amendment that I would re-evaluate \nwhether a Constitutional amendment is necessary to resolve this issue.\n  From my review I have concluded that there remains a way to protect \nour flag without having to alter the Constitution of the United States. \nI am joining with Senators Bennett, McConnell and Conrad today to \nintroduce legislation that I believe accomplishes that goal. The bill \nwe introduce today protects the flag but does so without altering the \nConstitution and a number of respected Constitutional scholars tell us \nthey believe this type of statute will be upheld by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. This statute protects the flag by criminalizing flag desecration \nwhen the purpose is to, and the person doing it knows, it is likely to \nlead to violence.\n  Supporters of a Constitutional amendment will be disappointed I know \nby my decision to support this statutory remedy to protect the flag \nrather than support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I know they \nare impatient to correct a decision by the Supreme Court that they and \nI believe was wrong. I have wrestled with this issue for so long and I \nwish I were not, with my decision, disappointing those, including many \nof my friends, who passionately believe that we must amend the \nConstitution to protect the flag.\n  But in the end I know that our country will be better served \nreserving our attempts to alter the Constitution only for those things \nthat are ``extraordinary occasions'' as outlined by President James \nMadison, one of the authors of the Constitution, and only in \ncircumstances when it is the only remedy for something that must be \ndone.\n  More than 11,000 Constitutional amendments have been proposed since \nour Constitution was ratified. However, since the ratification of the \nBill of Rights in 1791 only 17 amendments have been enacted. These 17 \ninclude three reconstruction era amendments that abolished slavery, and \ngave African-Americans the right to vote. The amendments included \ngiving women the right to vote, limiting Presidents to two terms, and \nestablishing an order of succession in case of a President's death or \ndeparture from office. The last time Congress considered and passed a \nnew Constitutional amendment was when it changed the voting age to 18, \nmore than a quarter of a century ago. All of these matters were of such \nscope they required a Constitutional amendment to be accomplished.\n  But protecting the American flag can be accomplished without amending \nthe Constitution, and that is a critically important point.\n  Constitutional scholars, including those at the Congressional \nResearch Service, the research arm of Congress, and Duke University's \nProfessor William Alstyne, have concluded that this statute passes \nConstitutional muster, because it recognizes that the same standard \nthat already applies to other forms of speech applies to burning the \nflag as well. This is the same standard which makes it illegal to \nfalsely cry ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Reckless speech that is \nlikely to cause violence is not protected under the ``fighting words'' \nstandard, long recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n[[Page S4494]]\n\n  I believe that future generations--and our founding fathers--would \nagree that it's worth the effort for us to find a way to protect our \nflag without having to wonder about the unintended consequences of \naltering our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 932. A bill to prevent Federal agencies from pursuing policies of \nunjustifiable nonacquiescence in, and relitigation of, precedent \nestablished in the Federal judicial courts; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             federal bureaucracy accountability act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal \nBureaucracy Accountability Act of 1999.\n  This legislation is clearly needed because when federal bureaucracies \nare faced with a decision between enforcing their rules and regulations \nor complying with our nation's laws they all to often choose to ignore \nthe law and follow their rules. These bureaucracies can get away with \nignoring laws passed by Congress, signed into law and then interpreted \nby our federal courts because of a technical, legal loophole. \nBureaucracies ought not ignore our laws and courts simply because they \nmay find it easier and more convenient to stick with their familiar \nrules and regulations rather than changing their ways and complying \nwith the law. And when these bureaucracies choose to ignore the law it \nis almost always average Americans who end up suffering.\n  There are thousands of stories of Americans who have been wrongfully \ndenied their rightful benefits because some federal agency refuses to \nfollow the legal decisions reached by our federal courts. In these \nsituations ordinary American citizens must comply with the law, but \nfederal agencies may simply choose to ignore that same law whenever \nthey may so choose. This is not equal justice under the law.\n  Our Founding Fathers envisioned a justice system in which everyone is \nrequired to obey the laws as they are interpreted and enforced through \nour courts. When there are disagreements appeals can be made to higher \ncourts. But otherwise, when the courts have spoken, we all must obey \nthe law or face the consequences, as it was intended.\n  Currently, if a federal court in one jurisdiction rules against a \nfederal agency's rule, that same federal agency can continue to follow \nthat same rule in other jurisdictions, even if it is to the detriment \nof the American citizens they are purportedly serving. This needlessly \nleads to years of costly legal wrangling while also compounding the \npain and suffering American citizens endure as they try to secure the \nsame services other Americans are already receiving in neighboring \njurisdictions.\n\n  Some of the more egregious actions are seen in the Social Security \nAdministration, the federal agencies running Medicare and Medicaid, the \nBureau of Land Management, and the Internal Revenue Service.\n  In legal terms, this bill would prevent federal agencies from \npursuing policies of unjustifiable nonacquiesence with, or the \nrelitigation of, judicial precedents as established through the federal \ncourts.\n  This legislation is a revised version of S. 1166, a bill I introduced \nin the 105th Congress. The bill I am introducing today contains \nperfecting language reflecting the valuable input I received during a \nJune 15, 1998, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts hearing on S. 1166.\n  During that hearing, a fellow Coloradan, Lynn Conforti, testified \nabout how her claims for disability benefits were repeatedly denied by \nthe Social Security Administration, not on the basis of existing law, \nbut on the basis of bureaucratic policies. Her testimony highlighted \nhow her physical suffering was compounded by severe financial troubles \nand mental anguish as a result of her 32-month struggle with the Social \nSecurity Administration. This was her return for 27 years of \ncontributing to Social Security. Ms. Conforti hopes to be able to \nreturn to work in the future, but she still requires access to the \nresources she needs to continue her rehabilitation efforts. Finally, \nMs. Conforti was awarded her disability benefits by an Administrative \nLaw Judge in an on the record determination.\n  Ms. Conforti's story is just one sad example of how agencies too \noften fail to help the very people whose need is real. Thousands of \nother Americans go through similar experiences each year. Something \nclearly must be done to ensure that federal agencies comply with \nfederal law.\n  There are important organizations that also make it clear that \nsomething needs to be done. The Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, chaired by Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, \nserves as the Federal Judiciary's governing body. The Judicial \nConference has identified federal agency nonacquiesence as a policy \nthat undermines legal certainty and the fair application of the law. \nThe American Bar Association has also strongly recommended that \nCongress pass legislation to stop federal agencies from disregarding \nfederal judicial decisions. In addition, organizations such as the \nNational Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Diabetes Research Institute \nalso came out in support of last year's bill, S. 1166.\n  It's time we made sure federal agencies comply with the law. I urge \nmy colleagues to support passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Federal \nBureaucracy Accountability Act of 1999 be printed in the Record \nfollowing my comments.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 932\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe tax treatment of Settlement Trusts established pursuant to the \nAlaska Native Claims Settlement Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             Alaska Native Settlement Trust Tax Legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nStevens in introducing legislation that will allow Alaska Native \nCorporations to establish settlement trusts designed to promote the \nhealth, education, welfare and cultural heritage of Alaska Natives.\n  Mr. President, in 1987, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\namended to permit Native Corporations to establish settlement trusts to \nhold lands and investments for the benefit of current and future \ngenerations of Alaska Natives. Assets in these trusts are insulated \nfrom business exposure and risks and can be invested to provide \ndistributions of income to Native shareholders and their future \ngenerations.\n  Although the 1987 amendments were designed to facilitate the \ndevelopment of settlement trusts, many Native Corporations have been \nstymied in their efforts because the tax law, in many cases, imposes \nonerous penalties on the Native shareholders when the trusts are \ncreated. For example, when assets are transferred to the trust, they \nare treated as a de facto distribution of assets directly to the \nshareholders themselves to the extent of the corporation's earnings and \nprofits.\n  Even though the current shareholders receive no actual income at the \ntime of the transfer into the trust, they are liable for income taxes \nas if they received an actual distribution. This not only requires the \nshareholder to come up with money to pay taxes on a distribution he or \nshe never received, but also can result in a situation where a trust \nfund beneficiary is required to prepay taxes on his share of the entire \ntrust corpus, which may be substantially more in taxes than the amount \nof cash benefits he or she will actually receive in the future.\n  Our legislation remedies this inequity by requiring that a \nbeneficiary of a settlement trust will be subject to taxation with \nrespect to assets conveyed to the trust only when the actual \ndistribution is received by the beneficiary. Moreover, the legislation \nprovides that distributions from the trust will be taxable as ordinary \nincome even if the distribution represents a return of capital. In \naddition, to ensure that these trusts do not accumulate excessive \nlevels of the corporation's earnings, the legislation requires that the \ntrust must annually distribute at least 55 percent of their taxable \nincome.\n  Mr. President, Alaska Native Corporations are unique entities. Unlike \nNative American tribes in the lower 48, Alaska Native corporations are \nsubject to income tax. But unlike ordinary C corporations, Alaska \nNative corporations have diverse purposes, one of which is to preserve \nand protect the heritage of the Native shareholders. The settlement \ntrust concept is well suited to the special needs of Alaska's Natives. \nAs the Conference Committee Report to ANSCA amendments of 1987 stated:\n\n       Trust distributions may be used to fight poverty, provide \n     food, shelter and clothing and served comparable economic \n     welfare purposes. Additionally, cash distributions of trust \n     income may be made on an across-the-board basis to the \n     beneficiary population as part of the economic welfare \n     function.\n\n  Settlement trusts will ensure that for generations to come, Native \nAlaskans will have a steady stream of income on which to continue \nbuilding an economic base. The current tax rules discourage the \ncreation of such trusts with the result that Native corporations are \nunder extreme pressure to distribute all current earnings rather than \nprudently reinvesting for the future.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that we will be able to see this \nlegislation adopted into law this year. For the long-term benefit of \nAlaska Natives, this tax law change is fundamentally necessary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 933\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance rights and protections for victims of \ncrime; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      crime victims assistance act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past Sunday marked the beginning of \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year \nto focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims. I am \npleased to take this opportunity to introduce legislation with my good \nfriend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and our cosponsors, \nSenators Sarbanes, Kerry, Harkin, and Murray. Our ``Crime Victims \nAssistance Act'' represents the next step in our continuing efforts to \nafford dignity and recognition to victims of crime.\n  My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago \nwhen I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, Vermont, and \nwitnessed first hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since \nto ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the \nrights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than one that presents \nadditional ordeals for those already victimized.\n  I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution \nto provide victims with greater rights and assistance. Over the past 15 \nyears, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills have \nincluded: the Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982; the Victims \nof Crime Act of 1984; the Victims' Bill of Rights of 1990; the 1994 \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act; the Justice for Victims \nof Terrorism Act of 1996; the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997; \nand the Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act.\n  Also, on the first day of this session, we introduced S.9, a youth \ncrime bill. In that legislation, which we have identified as a \nlegislative priority for the entire Democratic caucus, we included \nprovisions for victims of juvenile crime so that their rights to \nappear, to be heard, and to be informed would be protected. The recent \ntragedy in Littleton, Colorado, was only the most recent reminder of \nthe urgent need to enhance protections for these victims, to ensure \nthat their voices are heard.\n  The legislation that we introduce today, the ``Crime Victims \nAssistance Act,'' builds upon this progress. It provides for a \nwholesale reform of the Federal Rules and Federal law to establish \nadditional rights and protections for victims of federal crime.\n  Particularly, the legislation would provide crime victims with an \nenhanced: right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention; right \nto be heard on plea bargains; right to a speedy trial; right to be \npresent in the courtroom throughout a trial; right to give a statement \nat sentencing; right to be heard on probation revocation; and right to \nbe notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison.\n\n  The legislation goes further than other victims rights proposals that \nare currently before Congress by including: enhanced penalties for \nwitness intimidation; an increase in Federal victim assistance \npersonnel; enhanced training for State and local law enforcement and \nofficers of the Court; the development of state-of-the-art systems for \nnotifying victims of important dates and developments in their cases; \nthe establishment of ombudsman programs for crime victims; the \nestablishment of pilot programs that implement balanced and restorative \njustice models; and more direct and effective Federal assistance to \nvictims of international terrorism, including victims of the Lockerbie \nbombing and other terrorist acts occurring prior to passage of the \nVictims of Crime Act.\n  These are all matters that can be considered and enacted this year \nwith a simple majority of both Houses of Congress. They need not \novercome the delay and higher standards necessitated by proposing to \namend the Constitution. They need not wait the hammering out of \nimplementing legislation before making a difference in the lives of \ncrime victims.\n  The Judiciary Committee has already held another hearing this year on \na proposed constitutional amendment regarding crime victims. Previous \nhearings on this proposal were held in 1996, 1997, and 1998. \nUnfortunately, the Committee has devoted not a minute to consideration \nof legislative initiatives like the Crime Victims Assistance Act, which \nSenator Kennedy and I have introduced over the past years to assist \ncrime victims and better protect their rights. Like many other \ndeserving initiatives, it has taken a back seat to the constitutional \namendment debate that continues.\n  I regret that we did not do more for victims last year or the year \nbefore. Over the course of that time, I have noted my concern that we \nnot dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing exclusively \non efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, I must\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\nnote that the pace of victims legislation has slowed noticeably and \nmany opportunities for progress have been squandered.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, victims \ngroups, prosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can \nmost effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and \nState legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights \nover the past 20 years and we have a golden opportunity to make \nadditional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice \nand rights that crime victims deserve.\n  I would like to acknowledge several groups and individuals who have \nbeen extremely helpful with regards to the legislation that we are \nintroducing today: The Office for Victims of Crime at the Justice \nDepartment; the National Network to End Domestic Violence; the NOW \nLegal Defense Fund; the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of \nBattered Women; the National Victim Center; the National Organization \nfor Victim Assistance; Professor Lynne Henderson of Indiana Law School; \nand Roger Pilon, Director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at \nthe Cato Institute.\n  While we have greatly improved our crime victims assistance programs \nand made advances in recognizing crime victims rights, we still have \nmore to do. That is why it is my hope that Democrats and Republicans, \nsupporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment on this issue, \nwill join in advancing this important legislation through Congress. We \ncan make a difference in the lives of crime victims right now, and I \nhope Congress will make it a top priority and pass the Crime Victims \nAssistance Act before the end of the year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nthe section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 934\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PILOT PROGRAM TO STUDY EFFECTIVENESS OF RESTORATIVE \n                   JUSTICE APPROACH ON BEHALF OF VICTIMS OF CRIME.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, amounts collected pursuant to sections 3729 through 3731 \n     of title 31, United States Code (commonly known as the \n     ``False Claims Act''), may be used by the Office of Victims \n     of Crime to make grants to States, units of local government, \n     and qualified private entities for the establishment of pilot \n     programs that implement balanced and restorative justice \n     models.\n       (b) Definition of Balanced and Restorative Justice Model.--\n     In this section, the term ``balanced and restorative justice \n     model'' means an approach to criminal justice that promotes \n     the maximum degree of involvement by a victim, offender, and \n     the community served by a criminal justice system by allowing \n     the criminal justice system and related criminal justice \n     agencies to improve the capacity of the system and agencies \n     to--\n       (1) protect the community served by the system and \n     agencies; and\n       (2) ensure accountability of the offender and the system.\n\n     SEC. 208. VICTIMS OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1404B of the Victims of Crime Act \n     of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10603b) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 1404B. COMPENSATION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS OF \n                   TERRORISM OR MASS VIOLENCE.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Director may make grants, as \n     provided in either section 1402(d)(4)(B) or 1404--\n       ``(1) to States, which shall be used for eligible crime \n     victim compensation and assistance programs for the benefit \n     of victims described in subsection (b); and\n       ``(2) to victim service organizations, and public agencies \n     that provide emergency or ongoing assistance to victims of \n     crime, which shall be used to provide, for the benefit of \n     victims described in subsection (b)--\n       ``(A) emergency relief (including compensation, assistance, \n     and crisis response) and other related victim services; and\n       ``(B) emergency response training and technical assistance.\n       ``(b) Victims Described.--Victims described in this \n     subsection are victims of a terrorist act or mass violence, \n     whether occurring within or outside the United States, who \n     are--\n       ``(1) citizens or employees of the United States; and\n       ``(2) not eligible for compensation under title VIII of the \n     Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986.''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by this section \n     applies to any terrorist act or mass violence occurring on or \n     after December 20, 1989.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Section-by-Section Summary of the Crime Victims Assistance Act\n\n\n             TITLE I--VICTIMS RIGHTS IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM\n\n       Title I reforms federal law and the federal rules of \n     evidence to provide enhanced protections to victims of \n     federal crime, from the time of the defendant's arrest \n     through sentencing, including post-sentencing hearings.\n     Subtitle A. Amendments to Title 18\n       Sec. 101. Right to be Notified of Detention Hearing and \n           Right to be Heard on the Issue of Detention\n       Section 101 amends federal law to establish a victim's \n     right to be notified of a detention hearing, to attend the \n     detention hearing, and be heard on the issue of detention. No \n     such right currently exists in federal law.\n       In cases where identification of the defendant remains at \n     issue, section 101 provides flexibility to the presiding \n     judge to protect the integrity of the identification.\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\n       Sec. 102. Right to a Speedy Trial and Prompt Disposition \n           Free From Unreasonable Delay\n       Section 102 amends the Speedy Trial Act to require the \n     Court to take into account the interests of the victim in the \n     prompt and appropriate disposition of the case, free from \n     unreasonable delay when considering a motion to continue a \n     trial.\n       Sec. 103. Enhanced Right to Order of Restitution\n       Section 103 amends federal law to ensure that the victim \n     has the right to attend a sentencing hearing and to make a \n     statement to the court at sentencing.\n       Sec. 104. Right to be Notified of Escape or Release from \n           Prison\n       Section 104 amends the Victims Rights and Restitution Act \n     of 1990 to expand the victim's right to be notified of an \n     offender's release or escape from custody. Specifically, this \n     section clarifies that a victim has the right to be notified \n     of the offender's escape or release from a psychiatric \n     institution. Current law does not address this potentially \n     critical issue.\n       Sec. 105. Enhanced Penalties for Witness Tampering\n       Section 105 amends a federal witness tampering statute (18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1512) to raise the statutory maximum penalties in \n     witness tampering cases involving the use or threatened use \n     of physical force from 10 years to 20 years.\n     Subtitle B. Amendments to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n       Sec. 121. Right to be Notified of Plea Agreement and to be \n           Heard on Merits of the Plea Agreement\n       Section 121 (a) amends Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of \n     Criminal Procedure (governing pleas) to require the \n     government to make a reasonable effort to notify the victim \n     of an upcoming plea hearing, and of the victim's right to be \n     heard at the plea hearing. In cases involving more than 15 \n     victims, the Court, after consultation with the government \n     and the victims, may appoint a number of victims as \n     representatives of the victims' interests.\n       Section 121 (b) provides a timetable for the implementation \n     of the amendments to Rule 11, taking into consideration the \n     recommendations of the United States Judicial Conference.\n       Sec. 122. Enhanced Rights of Notification and Allocution at \n           Sentencing\n       Section 122 (a) amends Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of \n     Criminal Procedures (Sentencing) to provide for enhanced \n     opportunities for victims to participate in the criminal \n     sentencing process. Specifically, section 122(a) amends Rule \n     32 to require that presentence reports contain very specific \n     information about victim impact. Probation officers are \n     required to make reasonable efforts to notify the victim \n     about the preparation of the presentence reports, and must \n     provide victims with an opportunity to submit oral or written \n     statements, including statements on audio or videotape, \n     describing the impact of the offense on the victim. In \n     addition, Rule 32 is amended to require the government to \n     make a reasonable effort to notify the victim of the time and \n     place of sentencing, and the victim's right to be heard at \n     sentencing. These provisions are intended to insure that \n     victims remain actively involved throughout the criminal \n     process.\n       Section 122(b) provides a timetable for the implementation \n     of the amendments to Rule 32, taking into consideration the \n     recommendations of the United States Judicial Conference.\n       Sec. 123. Rights of Notification and Allocution At a \n           Probation Revocation Hearing\n       Section 123(a) amends Rule 32.1 of the Federal Rules of \n     Criminal Procedure (Probation Revocation or Modification of \n     Supervised Release) to provide enhanced opportunities for \n     victims to be notified of and participate in revocation \n     hearings. Often times, when a defendant is taken into custody \n     for violating conditions of release or conditions of \n     probation, a victim is unaware of these important \n     developments. Section 123 (a) amends Rule 32.1 to direct the \n     government to make a reasonable effort to notify the victim \n     of the impending revocation hearing, and to notify the victim \n     of his or her right to attend the hearing and address the \n     court.\n       Section 123(b) provides a timetable for the implementation \n     of the amendments to Rule 32.1, taking into consideration the \n     recommendations of the United States Judicial Conference.\n     Subtitle C. Amendment to Federal Rules of Evidence\n       Sec. 131. Enhanced Right to Be Present At Trial\n       Section 131 amends Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence (Witness Sequestration) to establish a statutory \n     right for crime victims to attend court proceedings, \n     including trials. Currently, victims are routinely prevented \n     from being present at trials, except during their own \n     testimony. Section 131(a) amends Rule 615 to permit crime \n     victims to attend trials and other court proceedings, unless \n     the court makes a finding that the testimony of the person \n     will be materially affected by hearing the testimony of other \n     witnesses, and the material effect will result in unfair \n     prejudice to any party, or that due to large numbers of \n     victims or family members of victims who may be called as \n     witnesses, permitting attendance in the courtroom when \n     testimony is being heard is not feasible.\n       Section 131(b) provides a timetable for the implementation \n     of the amendment to Rule 615, taking into consideration the \n     recommendations of the United States Judicial Conference.\n     Subtitle D. Remedies for Noncompliance\n       Sec. 141. Remedies for Noncompliance\n       Section 141 establishes a mechanism for addressing \n     violations of the newly created statutory rights of crime \n     victims. Section 141(a) clarifies that no party can file a \n     civil action for damages or injunctive relief against the \n     U.S., any employee of the U.S., any officer of the court, nor \n     any entity contracting with the U.S., for failure to comply \n     with any amendment in this Act.\n       Section 141(b) directs the Attorney General and the Chair \n     of the U.S. Parole Commission to establish a workable \n     regulatory scheme that will permit the effective \n     administrative enforcement of victims rights. These \n     regulations must contain disciplinary sanctions, including \n     termination for employees of the Department of Justice who \n     willfully violate or refuse to comply with Federal provisions \n     pertaining to the treatment of victims of crime. These \n     regulations must also include an administrative procedure \n     through which formal complaints with the Department of \n     Justice alleging violations of this title can be filed. Under \n     the proposed administrative scheme a complainant is \n     prohibited from recovering any monetary damages against the \n     United States.\n       This subsection states that the Attorney General is the \n     ultimate arbiter of the complaint, and there will be no \n     judicial review of the final decision of the Attorney \n     General.\n\n\n                TITLE II--VICTIM ASSISTANCE INITIATIVES\n\n       Title II contains a series of provisions designed primarily \n     to assist victims of state crime, and to ensure that victims \n     participate in the criminal process to the maximum extent.\n       Sec. 201. Increase in Victim Assistance Personnel\n       Section 201 authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may \n     be necessary to enable the Attorney General to provide grants \n     through the Office of Victims of Crime (OVC) to qualified \n     private entities to fund 50 victim-witness advocate \n     positions, who can assist victims of state crimes.\n       This section also authorizes to be appropriated such sums \n     as may be necessary to enable the Attorney General to hire 50 \n     full-time (or full-time equivalent) employees to serve as \n     victim-witness advocates to provide assistance to victims of \n     any federal criminal offense investigation.\n       Sec. 202. Increased Training for State and Local Law \n           Enforcement, State Court Personnel, and Officers of the \n           Court to Respond Effectively to the Needs of Victims of \n           Crime\n       Section 202 provides that funds collected pursuant to the \n     False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731) may be used by OVC to \n     make grants to States, units of local government, and \n     qualified private entities, to provide training and \n     information to prosecutors, judges, law enforcement officers, \n     probation officers, and other officers and employees of \n     Federal and State court in order to assist them in responding \n     effectively to the needs of victims of crime.\n       Sec. 203. Increased Resources for State and Local Law \n           Enforcement Agencies, Courts, and Prosecutors' Offices \n           to Develop State-of-the-Art Systems for Notifying \n           Victims of Crime of Important Dates and Developments\n       Section 203 amends subtitle A of title 23 of the Violent \n     Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-322; \n     108 Stat. 2077) by authorizing to be appropriated such sums \n     as may be necessary to OVC to fund grants to State and local \n     prosecutors' offices, State courts, county jails, State \n     correctional institutions, and qualified private entities, to \n     develop and implement state-of-the-art systems for notifying \n     victims of crime of important dates and developments relating \n     to the criminal proceedings at issue.\n       Section 203 authorizes funds collected pursuant to the \n     False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731) to be used for these \n     grants.\n       This section also amends Section 310004(d) of the Violent \n     Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to permit funds \n     from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund to be used for \n     grants outlined in this section.\n       Sec. 204. Pilot Programs to Establish Ombudsman Programs \n           for Crime Victims\n       Section 204 authorizes pilot programs designed to establish \n     innovative programs to assist victims of both federal and \n     state crime in vindicating their rights. All too frequently, \n     victims do not have a sufficient voice during the criminal \n     process. Some localities have responded to this problem by \n     creating ombudsman programs wherein independent officers are \n     established whose function is to represent the victim's \n     interests. These ombudsmen will educate prosecutors and \n     judges as to their victim-related responsibilities, and will \n     provide helpful guidance and support to crime victims \n     themselves. These programs have shown considerable promise in \n     a number of cities.\n       Section 204 authorizes the creation of these ombudsman \n     programs. Subsection (a) sets out definitions of the terms \n     ``director,'' ``office,'' ``qualified private entity,'' \n     ``qualified unit of State or local government,'' and ``VOICE \n     Centers'' for the purposes of this section.\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\n       Subsection (b) provides that within a year after the \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General (acting through \n     the Director of OVC) will establish pilot programs to operate \n     Victim Ombudsman Information Centers (``VOICE'' Centers) in \n     Iowa, Massachusetts, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, and Vermont.\n       This subsection also authorizes the Attorney General to \n     enter into agreement with and provide for a grant to assist a \n     qualified private entity or unit of State or local government \n     in carrying out the pilot program. The agreement shall \n     specify that the VOICE Center shall, excepting applicable \n     requirements of this section, operate independently of OVC, \n     and OVC shall have no supervisory or decision making \n     authority over the day-to-day operations of a VOICE Center. \n     The purpose of this provision is to ensure that VOICE centers \n     operate independently.\n       Subsection (c) provides that the mission of each VOICE \n     Center shall be to ensure that victims of Federal or State \n     crimes are fully appraised of the rights of victims and that \n     the victims participate in the criminal justice process to \n     the fullest extent of the law.\n       This subsection also sets out the duties of the VOICE \n     Centers. The duties include providing information to victims \n     concerning their right to participate in the criminal justice \n     process; identifying and responding to situations in which \n     rights of victims of crime may have been violated; attempting \n     to rectify violations of victims' rights; educating police, \n     prosecutors, court officials, and employees of jails and \n     prisons about the rights of victims; and taking measures to \n     ensure victims are treated with respect, dignity, and \n     compassion during the justice process.\n       Subsection (d) authorizes OVC to provide technical \n     assistance to each VOICE Center. Each pilot VOICE Center \n     shall submit an annual report to the Director of OVC \n     detailing the activities of the VOICE Center and the \n     strategic plan for the following year.\n       Subsection (e) provides that within two years of each VOICE \n     Center's pilot program establishment, the Comptroller General \n     of the U.S. shall review their effectiveness in carrying out \n     their mission and duties as described in subsection (c). This \n     subsection also requires that within two years of each VOICE \n     Center's pilot program establishment, the Attorney General \n     shall have private entities study the effectiveness of the \n     VOICE Centers in carrying out their mission and duties as \n     described in subsection (c).\n       Subsection (f) states that the pilot program shall \n     terminate 4 years after the date of enactment of the Act. If \n     the Attorney General determines that any of the pilot \n     programs should be renewed for an additional period, they may \n     be renewable for up to two years.\n       Subsection (g) authorizes an amount not to exceed \n     $5,000,000 of the amounts collected pursuant to the False \n     Claims Act to be used by the Director of OVC to make grants \n     to fund the pilot programs.\n       Sec. 205. Amendments to Victims of Crime Act of 1994\n       Section 205 provides for various improvements in the \n     program of federal support for victim assistance and \n     compensation under the Victims of Crime Act.\n       Subsection (a) authorizes the receipt of private donations \n     to the Crime Victims Fund. It also provides that unobligated \n     funds transferred to the judicial branch for the \n     establishment of the (now defunct) National Fine Center are \n     to be returned to the Crime Victims Fund and may be used for \n     the benefit of federal crime victims. Moreover, it requires \n     states to return to the Crime Victims Fund amounts for which \n     they are reimbursed under subrogation provisions as a result \n     of third party payments to victims, or where the state has \n     received supplemental funding for incidents of terrorism or \n     mass violence. This will help replenish the funds available \n     for assistance to victims of terrorism and mass violence.\n       Subsection (b) changes the minimum threshold for the annual \n     grant that the Director shall make from the Fund to an \n     eligible crime victim compensation program. The change is \n     from 40 percent of the amounts awarded during the preceding \n     fiscal year to 60 percent.\n       Subsection (b) also enhances authority and support for \n     demonstration projects, training, technical assistance, and \n     program evaluation, and clarifies that compensation will not \n     be denied to any victim because the identity of the offender \n     was not determined beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal \n     trial or because criminal charges were not brought against \n     the offender.\n       Subsection (c) clarifies that the Director may enter into \n     cooperative agreements in addition to making grants; that \n     such cooperative agreements or grants may be for evaluation \n     purposes and training and technical assistance that address \n     the significance of and effective delivery strategies for \n     providing long-term psychological care; that the Director may \n     use funds for fellowships, clinical internships, and programs \n     of training and special workshops for the presentation and \n     dissemination of information resulting from demonstrations, \n     surveys, and special projects. Subsection (c) also tightens \n     some of the definitions in the Victims of Crime Act.\n       Sec. 206. Services for Victims of Crime and Domestic \n           Violence\n       Section 206 directs that a specified statute not be \n     construed to prohibit a recipient from using funds derived \n     from a source other than the Legal Services Corporation to \n     provide related legal assistance to any person with whom an \n     alien has a relationship covered by the domestic violence \n     laws of the State in which the alien resides or in which an \n     incidence of violence occurred.\n       Sec. 207. Pilot Program to Study Effectiveness of \n           Restorative Justice Approach on Behalf of Victims of \n           Crime\n       Section 207 authorizes the use of funds collected under the \n     False Claims Act by OVC to make grants to States, units of \n     local government, and qualified private entities for the \n     establishment of pilot programs that implement balanced and \n     restorative justice models.\n       Sec. 208. Victims of Terrorism\n       Section 208 clarifies the intent of the antiterrorism \n     amendment to the Victims of Crime Act by enabling OVC to \n     assist the victims of terrorist acts or mass violence \n     occurring outside the United States and authorizing it to \n     provide funding directly to non-profits and other Federal \n     agencies, medical and mental health organizations and others \n     in response to such victims' needs.\n       Section 208 will also enable OVC to provide assistance to \n     the victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring \n     prior to the passage of the Victims of Crime Act, but on or \n     after December 20, 1989. This will allow OVC to assist the \n     family members of those killed in the bombing of Pan Am 103. \n     These family members reside in various states around the \n     country including Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \n     Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, \n     Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, \n     Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, \n     Washington, and West Virginia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, Senator Leahy and I are \nintroducing the Crime Victims Assistance Act. For too long, our \ncriminal justice system has neglected the hundreds of thousands of \nvictims of crime whose lives are shattered by violence or threats of \nviolence each year.\n  Clearly, the rights of victims deserve better from our criminal \njustice system. Too often, the system does not provide adequate relief \nfor victims of crime. They are not given basic information about their \ncase--such as the status of the case, scheduling changes in court \nproceedings, and notice of a defendant's arrest, bail status and \nrelease from prison.\n  Victims deserve to know about their case. They deserve to know about \nhearings and other court proceedings. They deserve to know when their \nassailants are being considered for parole. And they certainly deserve \nto know when their attackers are released from incarceration.\n  But there is a right way and a wrong way to protect victims' rights. \nThe wrong way is to amend the Constitution. One of the guiding \nprinciples that has served the nation well for two hundred years is \nthat if it is not necessary to amend the Constitution, it is necessary \nnot to amend it.\n  We have amended the Constitution only 17 times in the two centuries \nsince the adoption of the Bill of Rights. We should consider such \namendments only in rare instances, when the enactment of a statute is \nclearly inadequate.\n  The right way to protect victims' rights is by statute, not by \nconstitutional amendment. One of the most obvious provisions of such a \nstatute is additional resources for courts and prosecutors. These \nresources can be used to establish better notification, provide better \ntraining to deal with victims' needs, and to take all the other steps \nrequired to see that the criminal justice system deals fairly with the \nvictims of crime. If Congress is truly committed to victims rights, we \ncan act quickly by statute.\n  Senator Leahy and I are proposing a victims rights statute--not a \nconstitutional amendment, because we believe it accomplishes the needed \ngoals. It provides protection for victims now--this year. We do not \nhave to wait for a constitutional amendment that may take years for the \nStates to ratify.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist also opposes amending the Constitution. He \nhas specifically stated that a statute, rather than a constitutional \namendment, ``would have the virtue of making any provisions in the bill \nwhich appeared mistaken by hindsight to be amended by a simple act of \nCongress.''\n  Crime victims must be treated with dignity, compassion and \nunderstanding. Being victimized by crime is traumatic enough. We must \ndo all we can to see that victims of crime are not victimized again by \nthe criminal justice system.\n  At the federal level, the system has become more victim friendly. I \nam\n\n[[Page S4504]]\n\nproud to have sponsored the Sentencing Reform Act of 1994, which vastly \nexpanded the authority of the courts to order defendants to pay \nrestitution to the victims. Subsequent laws have given victims the \nright to be heard at sentencing.\n  This legislation we are introducing today assures victims of a \ngreater voice in decisions on the detention and prosecution of \ncriminals.\n  It contains a series of provisions to assist victims of state crimes, \nand to ensure that victims participate in the criminal justice process \nto the maximum extent. For example, it provides grants to fund victim-\nwitness advocate positions. It provides training for judges, \nprosecutors, and law enforcement. It establishes our ombudsman \nprograms.\n  Legislation on victims' rights deserves high priority in this \nCongress. I urge the Senate to act swiftly to accomplish the goal we \nshare of genuine protections for victims rights.\n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 935. A bill to amend the National Agricultural Research, \nExtension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to authorize research to \npromote the conversion of biomass into biobased industrial products, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n          NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE FUELS AND CHEMICALS ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The National \nSustainable Fuels and Chemicals Act, with the goal of advancing \nbiotechnologies likely to offer outstanding benefits in terms of \nstrategic security, reduction of greenhouse gases and healthier rural \neconomies.\n  At the heart of the National Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Act is a \nnovel research Initiative, jointly administered by the Secretary of \nAgriculture and the Secretary of Energy, that authorizes research for \nthe purpose of overcoming technical barriers to low cost biomass \nconversion and gives priority funding to consortia composed of \ntechnical experts from academia, national laboratories, Federal \nresearch agencies and industry. By enhancing creative and imaginative \napproaches toward biomass processing, the Sustainable Fuels and \nChemicals Research Initiative will serve to develop the next generation \nof advanced technologies making possible low cost biobased industrial \nproducts.\n  Innovative in both purpose and structure, the Initiative will promote \nintegrated research partnerships as the best means of overcoming \ntechnical challenges that span multiple academic disciplines while also \nleveraging scarce Federal discretionary spending. 49 million dollars \nper annum is proposed for the Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Research \nInitiative; funding is authorized for six years, through 2005. Given \nthe potential benefits in improved national security, rural development \nand greenhouse gas reductions, this expenditure represents an \ninvestment in America's future and is in line with recommendations from \na report of the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and \nTechnology (PCAST).\n  The legislation will also coordinate and focus Federal research in \ncellulosic biomass processing through creation of the Sustainable Fuels \nand Chemicals Board consisting of senior representatives from the \nNational Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nDepartment of the Interior and the White House Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy. Co-chaired by designees of the Secretary of \nAgriculture and Secretary of Energy, the Board shall coordinate \nresearch, development and demonstration activities relating to biobased \nindustrial products between the Departments of Energy and Agriculture \nwhich are the two principal agencies for biotechnology research on \nfuels, chemicals and power. The Board will also serve to coordinate \nresearch activities across the many Federal agencies that are involved \nin research, regulation and policy formulation of fuels, commodity \nchemicals and power.\n  To advise the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Energy on the \ntechnical focus and direction of the request for proposals issued under \nthe research Initiative, a Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Technical \nAdvisory Committee is established. Modeled on the National Defense \nSciences Board, the Advisory Committee consists of experts from \nacademia, prominent engineers and scientists, representatives from \ncommodity trade organizations and environmental or conservation groups. \nAs an independent panel of technical experts, the Sustainable Fuels and \nChemicals Technical Advisory Committee will serve an important role in \nthe strategic planning and oversight of research carried out under the \nInitiative.\n  The case for promoting technology that will supply fuels, notably \nethanol, chemicals and power from cellulosic biomass can be made \nindependently of whether the world will continue to enjoy cheap oil. \nHowever, a wealth of scientific data indicates both that the world's \nsupply of conventional oil is nearly half exhausted and that with each \npassing year, the demand for petroleum-derived energy increases. \nHistory gives us a clear warning that individual oil wells, oil fields, \nand national petroleum outputs have all shown a decline in production \nrates when the level of reserves reaches 50 percent. Balanced against \nboth such `common sense' and Malthusian theory are optimists, including \nthe late economist Julian Simon, who uses energy supplies as one \nexample when arguing that natural resources have become more available \nrather than more scarce.\n  I would suggest that cellulosic biomass offers a unique opportunity \nfor consensus between these seemingly unalterable opposing views. No \nlonger is the debate centered on the delicate political and \ninternational issue of how best to divide the shrinking pie of world \nresources. Rather, application of the limitless supply of human \ningenuity will be used to create a new and sustainable resource. In \nthis regard, nature offers us the hint of a solution by demonstrating \nits own methods for harnessing power from the sun, nutrients in the \nsoil and water, in support of a vast array of plant life.\n  Following nature's elegant example, engineers and scientists have \ndeveloped biotechnologies capable of breaking down nearly any form of \nplant, tree or grass into their constituent chemical building blocks, \nprincipally in the form of complex sugars. From this intermediate step, \na wide variety of biobased industrial products including feed, fuels, \nchemicals, materials and power can be produced. With this capability, \nplants, trees, grasses and agricultural residues assume a new \nsignificance as a potential source of biobased industrial products. \nSignificantly, cellulosic biomass is the only foreseeable sustainable \nsource of organic fuels, chemicals and materials that find ubiquitous \nuse in any modern economy.\n\n  Consider that biobased industrial chemicals can provide functional \nreplacements for essentially all organic chemicals currently derived \nfrom petroleum, and have clear potential for product life cycles that \nare much more environmentally friendly than their fossil fuel \ncounterparts. The new cellulosic conversion technology under \ndevelopment will contribute towards growth of what is now a fledgling \nindustry centered on biobased products--including chemicals, \nlubricants, plastics, adhesives and building materials--with a market \nworth an estimated $300 billion per year in its infancy.\n  Biobased fuels such as ethanol have clear potential to be \nsustainable, low-cost and high performance, are compatible with both \ncurrent and future transportation systems, and provide near zero net \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The impact of bioethanol on greenhouse gas \nemissions is particularly significant because the transportation sector \naccounts for one-third of the total greenhouse gas emissions. Of the \nmany contributing factors to possible climate change, the \ntransportation sector is our most difficult challenge because of the \nubiquitous dependence on greenhouse gas producing fossil fuels. \nCellulosic ethanol, a renewable fuel derived from grasses, plants, \ntrees and waste materials, offers a positive long-term approach to the \nproblem of global warming that does not assume a shift from the \nautomobile culture or increased costs for American employers and \nconsumers.\n  Cellulosic ethanol is a versatile, liquid fuel and consequently will \nbe able to use much of the existing infrastructure built over the last \ncentury in support of gasoline and internal combustion engines. The \ncompatibility of water with biomass derived products,\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\nincluding ethanol, is an important environmental consideration and a \npowerful demonstration of green chemistry. As my friend Jim Woolsey is \nfond of saying, ``If a second Exxon Valdez filled with ethanol ran \naground off Alaska, it would produce a lot of evaporation and some \ndrunk seals.''\n  By providing farmers of the world the possibility of additional \ncommodity products, whether dedicated crops or income from collection \nof agricultural residues, biomass processing can lead to healthier \nrural economies. A major strength of the new technologies for breaking \ndown cellulosic biomass is that almost any type of plant, tree, or \nagricultural waste can be used as a source of fuel. This high degree of \nflexibility allows farmers the possibility of a cash crop simply by \ncollecting their agricultural wastes. Local crops that enrich the soil, \nprevent erosion and improve local environmental conditions can be \nplanted and then harvested for fuel. My firm belief is that innovations \nin biotechnology enabling the co-production of food, fuel, chemicals \nand materials from the sustainable supply of cellulosic biomass, are \nvital to the future of agriculture.\n  While undertaking this effort, I remain mindful that biofuels must be \nproduced in ways that enhance overall environmental quality. Sound \nland-use policies must be followed to protect wildlife habitat and \nbiological diversity concerns. But professional land-use techniques \nshould readily accomplish this.\n  Providing an alternative fuel that will power the internal combustion \nengine of the automobile will help reduce our dependence on Middle \nEastern oil without necessitating a rebuilding of the massive \ninfrastructure built in support of gasoline. Reliance on the unstable \nstates of the Middle East adversely impacts American strategic \nsecurity, while massive oil imports skew our balance of payments. With \nthe need for affordable energy rising with increasing population, and \nthe transportation sector fueled almost exclusively by fossil fuels, \nthe Middle East will control something approaching three-quarters of \nthe world's oil in the coming century, providing that unstable region \nwith a disproportionate leverage over diplomatic affairs. At a time \nwhen the United States confronts an ill-defined and confused drama of \nevents on the international stage, including an increasingly assertive \nChina, and nuclear and missile technology proliferation to North Korea, \nit seems clear we should dedicate a relatively small amount of money \ntoward research that could lead to a revolution in the way we produce \nand consume energy. Or as presented by a distinguished panel of \nscientists and industrial experts in a recent PCAST report, ``. . . the \nsecurity of the United States is at least as likely to be imperiled in \nthe first half of the next century by the consequences of inadequacies \nin the energy options available to the world as by inadequacies in the \ncapabilities of U.S. weapons systems.'' The report succinctly \nconcludes, ``It is striking that the Federal government spends about \ntwenty times more R money on the latter problem than on the former.''\n  Before we are able to reap the significant benefits offered by \nbiobased industrial products, the cost of the new conversion technology \nmust be significantly reduced. Research and development is the only \nsystematic means for creating the innovations and technical \nimprovements that will lower the costs of biomass processing. Given the \nrelatively short-term horizon characteristic of private sector \ninvestments, and because many benefits of biomass processing are in the \npublic interest, industry is ill-equipped to fund the necessary \nfundamental research that will result in cost effective technologies \nfor biomass conversion.\n  Research activities carried out by the Department of Agriculture, \nDepartment of Energy and other Federal agencies are a principal reason \nfor much of the progress witnessed in biomass processing and underscore \nthe future promise if new technology is developed. Nonetheless, \ncoordination among the Federal agencies is disjointed and the research \ntends to be driven by institutional missions rather than by an \noverarching strategy to develop cost-effective technologies for biomass \nconversion. The National Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Act is \ndesigned to overcome these shortcomings and raise the level of the \nFederal commitment to biotechnologies that are already demonstrating \npotential as powerful new alternatives to the traditional practices of \nthe past.\n  In this effort, I am asking for the support of President Clinton and \nVice President Gore who have indicated their commitment to the \ndevelopment of sustainable resources. On this issue we can develop a \nconsensus for undertaking research that will improve our national \nsecurity and balance of payments, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \nstrengthen rural economies in America and around the world. Working \ntogether we can promote the type of innovation-focused research \nessential for improvements in the utilization of America's biomass \nresource. It is my firm belief that future Americans will enjoy a rich \nreturn on our investment in the promise of a green revolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work \nand accomplishments of a team of individuals in Hawaii who have been \nhonored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \nas 1999 ``Environmental Heroes.'' We seldom take the time to recognize \nthe outstanding accomplishments of those working at the community \nlevel, with high school students, far from Washington, D.C. Their \ndedication can make a big difference in people's lives and the health \nof our environment.\n  Honored in Hawaii were Hawaii Sea Grant's Extension Director Bruce \nMiller, Hawaii State Representative Brian Schatz, and Youth for \nEnvironment Service Coordinator Sean Casey.\n  This marks the third year that NOAA has recognized individuals and \norganizations throughout the United States for their ``tireless efforts \nto preserve and protect the nation's environment.'' The 1999 NOAA Class \nof Environmental Heroes included 34 individuals or programs, and the \nhonorees are traditionally announced as part of Earth Day activities \nnationwide. Each honoree was also sent personal commendations from Vice \nPresident Al Gore who congratulated this year's heroes for their \ncommitment and accomplishments in protecting the environment of our \nnation.\n  The Hawaii team was recognized for their creation of Youth for \nEnvironmental Service, called YES. The YES program educates and engages \nK-12 students in discussions of local environmental issues and \nactivities that sustain the environment. YES gives students a chance to \nget involved through projects such as restoring trails, planting trees, \npicking up litter from beaches and streams, and more. To date, YES has \ngiven presentations to more than 65,000 students in 450 schools, \ninvolved 25,000 students in environmental community service projects, \nremoved 20 tons of debris from Honolulu streams, restored one mile of \nthe most used hiking trail on Oahu; planted approximately 2,000 plants, \ncleaned 40 beaches, stenciled more than 2,500 storm drains with a \n``Dump No Waste'' message, and organized more than 350 other community \nservice projects.\n  The YES project is an excellent example of the partnering of \nextension and educational goals through the University of Hawaii's Sea \nGrant Program. Mr. President, I extend my warmest congratulations to \nour three Hawaii Environmental Heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/30/senate-section/article/S4506-5", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4506-S4507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATIONS TO US AIRWAYS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate one \nof the many employers in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which, \nthrough innovation and dynamic business planning, has recently received \nprestigious recognition. The W. Frank Barton School of Business at \nWichita State University and the University of Nebraska at Omaha \nAviation Institute have ranked US Airways number one in their annual \n``Airline Quality Rating'' study.\n  I congratulate the over 16,000 Pennsylvanians who work at US Airways \non\n\n[[Page S4507]]\n\ntheir dedication and hard work. I also make special note of President \nand Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Gangwal, whose ongoing commitment to \nexcellence has had a major impact on this airline, to the great benefit \nof our Commonwealth.\n  In my eight years of service in the U.S. House and Senate, I have \nwatched as US Airways (formerly USAir) has struggled through some very \ndifficult times. For this airline to be recognized as number one in \nquality only a few years after its financial struggles is a true \ntestament to the energy and skill of its workforce and executives. An \nindication of this is Mr. Gangwal's first comment after learning of the \nquality rating, ``While we are very proud of our No. 1 ranking and its \nreflection of accomplishment, there is more to be done in meeting the \nneeds of the traveling public and we are focused on achieving this \ngoal.''\n  Again, I offer my congratulations to US Airways and its many \nemployees. I look forward to continued work with its executives, \nmanagement teams, and labor unions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/30/senate-section/article/S4507-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EFFORTS TO RESEARCH S.A.D.\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nseventh and eighth graders from Dzantik'i Henni Middle School. They are \ndoing important work by educating the public on something that affects \nmuch of Alaska in the winter: Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD. This \ndisorder causes severe depression during the winter months in Alaska \nwhen there can be up to 24 hours of darkness in some places.\n  About one in three Alaskans suffer from mild to severe Seasonal \nAffective Disorder. Researchers suggest SAD may play a role in a \nvariety of Alaska's social and medical problems, ranging from spousal \nabuse to alcoholism.\n  These incredible students, led by teacher Robert Traul Jones, \ndeveloped a community health project to combat SAD. The project had two \nmajor goals. The first was to educate people about depression and its \nimpact on northern communities and their residents. The second goal was \nto provide affordable treatment for this condition. The students did \nthis by designing, marketing and building high-intensity light boxes, \nwhich they distributed to the surrounding communities. The light boxes \ncombat the daily darkness outside with light therapy.\n  Their efforts were extraordinarily successful. The students projected \n10 units being sold and ended up selling 39 units. The students are \ncurrently working with the Juneau Economic Development Commission to \ntransfer their business to a local nonprofit organization.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pride that I recognize the \nachievements of these students. Their hard work and dedication is an \ninspiration to us all. These are the future leaders of our country and \nour single greatest resource. The seventh and eighth grade students \nfrom Dzantik'I Heeni Middle School should be proud of their \nachievements in combating SAD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/30/senate-section/article/S4507-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BLUE KNIGHTS INTERNATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT \n                            MOTORCYCLE CLUB\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nacknowledge the 25th year anniversary of the Blue Knights International \nLaw Enforcement Motorcycle Club.\n  The Blue Knights International Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club is a \nfraternal organization of law enforcement professionals and their \nfamilies actively serving communities throughout the United States, \nCanada, Australia, France, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, \nLuxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and Mexico.\n  This fraternal organization was established in Bangor, Maine, in 1974 \nand has grown to more than 10,000 members both male and female. They \nshare a common bond of promoting motorcycling, which includes safety \nand awareness to the non-motorcycle riding public.\n  In addition, the Blue Knights also assists many organizations and \ncommunities with developing and implementing fund-raising programs such \nas the March of Dimes ``Bikers for Babies,'' the Muscular Dystrophy \nAssociation, the Breast Cancer Foundation's ``Race for the Cure'' and \nthe Blue Knights ``Youth Identification Program.'' The combined efforts \nof the Blue Knights has made a positive contribution to society.\n  The Blue Knights began in April 1974 when Ed Gallant, a police \nofficer with the Bangor Police Department, had an idea and several of \nhis colleagues worked with him to see the idea become a reality. The \nidea was to form a motorcycle club for people in law enforcement. The \nnews of the Blue Knights organization spread after an article in the \nBangor Daily News was picked up by U.P.I. inquiries started pouring in \nand consequently chapters started to form worldwide.\n  As an honorary member of the Blue Knights, I have had the privilege \nof meeting numerous members from around the world and participate in \nmany worthy causes. On this, their 25th anniversary, I applaud the \nefforts of the Blue Knights and look forward to learning of their \nfuture successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/30/senate-section/article/S4507-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4507-S4508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KEN KNIGHT\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to Kenneth Y. Knight, a fellow Utahan whose selfless \ncontributions have benefited many, and whose indelible imprint will be \nfelt for many years to come across the great State of Utah.\n  Ken Knight is truly a hero to the community of Salt Lake City. His \nselfless acts of kindness along with his unparalleled wisdom have made \nhim one of the most respected individuals the State of Utah has had the \ngood fortune of calling ``one of its own.''\n  Ken is truly a ``man for all seasons.'' He is a devoted husband and \nfather, a highly respected businessman, a loyal community servant, and \na deeply patriotic and religious leader.\n  Mr. Knight has had a life full of extraordinary achievement. As a \nyouth, he gained the Boy Scouts of America Eagle Rank--an honor he \ncontinues to hold dear--and was elected student body president at his \nhigh school. He excelled in academics and athletics as well.\n  For the past several years, Ken Knight has distinguished himself in \nbusiness, serving as Vice Chairman of the Board of Sinclair Oil \nCorporation and Little America. He was instrumental in the remarkable \nexpansion of Sinclair and Little America, and he has mentored and \nshared his skills with dozens of corporate employees and community \nleaders.\n  Mr. Knight's special friend and professional partner R. Earl Holding \nrecognized the value of Ken's service when he stated, ``Perhaps the \nbiggest challenge I faced with Ken--a challenge in which I failed was \nto keep him to myself. Every organization, every board, and every \nworthwhile charity you can think of, all wanted him to be part of their \ncause. His personal contributions--in time and resources--have been \nprofound. He loves the community and the community loves him. And he \nhad the admiration and respect of civic and government leaders \nthroughout the State of Utah.''\n  Many organizations in Utah have benefited from his service and \ninvolvement including--Intermountain Health Care, the Salt Lake City \nChamber of Commerce, Brigham Young University, the Salt Lake Convention \nand Visitors Bureau, the Salt Place Advisory Board, the Utah Travel \nCouncil, LDS Hospital, U.S. West, Utah Economic Development \nCorporation, the LDS Foundation's National Executive Committee for \nNatural Resources, Utah Youth Village, and the Utah Symphony.\n  Gordon B. Hinckley, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-day Saints, described Mr. Knight this way: ``The measure of any \nman is his contribution to the society of which he is a part. Using \nthat measure, Ken stands very tall. He truly has been a giant in our \ncity. He knows the pulse of the community. He measures well before he \nleaps. There is nothing impetuous about him. He is quiet and methodical \n. . . He has been a good friend to each of us. He has been a man of \nsingular accomplishment. We are all indebted to him.''\n  While serving as Chairman of the Utah Symphony, Mr. Knight was faced \nwith a great challenge. ``Ken is the kind of person who relishes a \nchallenge and it was in that spirit that he took on the chairmanship of \nthe Utah Symphony during its darkest hour, when it\n\n[[Page S4508]]\n\nhad virtually depleted its reserves after running deficits for a period \nof several years,'' stated Harris H. Simmons, president and chief \nexecutive officer for Zions Bancorporation. To secure its future, he \nled legislative efforts and a public referendum to permanently devote \ncivic funds for artistic achievement. This action not only saved the \nsymphony, but it also widened cultural opportunities in dance, opera, \ntheater, and other artistic expressions.\n  ``When he was Chairman of the Salt Lake Convention and Visitors \nBureau, he was the champion for expansion of the Salt Palace Convention \nCenter, which has had a positive economic impact of hundreds of \nmillions of dollars from increased convention and visitor spending,'' \nstated Richard E. Davis, president and CEO of the Bureau.\n  While serving the Chamber of Commerce he helped overhaul the Workers \nCompensation Fund in Utah. Fred Ball, who was the Executive Director of \nthe Chamber at the time, stated, ``The results of his efforts have now \nmade Utah one of the very best States in the Nation for both rates and \nfor benefits. Costs and claims were reduced dramatically and all agree \nthat without Ken Knight, it would never have happened. Every Utah \nbusiness, large and small, are enjoying the efforts of Ken Knight.''\n  Ken and his wife Nancy have raised five wonderful children, all of \nwhom are decent, responsible citizens and--like their parents--\nachievers. Perhaps the greatest tribute written about Ken comes from \nhis daughter Lucy Knight Andre when she wrote: ``My father is often \nhonored for his many professional and civic accomplishments. While \nthose honors are well-deserved, they do not represent the most \nimportant and least known side of my father--his complete devotion to \nhis family. He adores his children and his grandchildren, and \neverything he has done in his life has been for the ultimate benefit of \nhis family . . . He taught us to work hard, laugh often, and never look \nat any problem as insurmountable. He has a great love for his Heavenly \nFather and an absolute commitment to his Church. He taught us by \nexample the importance of service to our God and our fellow men. \nWhatever his myriad accomplishments in the community might be, those of \nus in his family have a remarkable legacy of ingenuity, devotion and \nlove.''\n  These are indeed wonderful words for a truly remarkable man. It is an \nhonor for me to call all of his magnificent achievements to the \nattention of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/30/senate-section/article/S4508-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SAFE AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. KYL.
