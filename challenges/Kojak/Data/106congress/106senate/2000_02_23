Mr. President, this will be a session in Congress in \nwhich we will have plenty of challenges and opportunities to discuss \nissues. We live in a country where we are blessed with an economy that \nis growing, and with unemployment that is about as low as it has been \nin my adult lifetime. Inflation is down. We have had the blessings\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\nof a rising stock market; we recently had some adjustments there. But \nhome ownership is up. Personal income is up. We have a lot of things \nthat exist in our economy that represent good news for our country.\n  I come from a farm State, and there is not such good news for family \nfarmers. They are suffering through a very severe crisis with collapsed \ngrain prices and other difficulties. But, generally speaking, our \ncountry has been doing quite well. Our economy is stronger than almost \nany other economy in the world. Economists now predict that we will \nhave budget surpluses as far out as the eye can see. Of course, that is \nnot very far; economists who can't remember their home address try to \ntell us what is going to happen with the economy three, five, and ten \nyears from now.\n  It is interesting to note, if you go back to the early 1990s, \nvirtually all leading economists in America predicted that the 1990s \nwould be a decade of slow, anemic economic growth. Of course, they were \nalmost all wrong. So as we confront our challenges and opportunities in \nthe future, I think it is wise for us in this Chamber not to be seduced \nby some who would say that if we are going to have continued budget \nsurpluses, let's have a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years. I think it \nis much wiser to provide some targeted tax cuts with some of the \nsurplus, if it materializes, and use a fair amount of the expected \nsurplus to reduce Federal indebtedness.\n  Why? Because during tough economic times you need to use increased \ndebt to help you through those tough times, and during good economic \ntimes it seems to me you would want to reduce indebtedness. So I hope \nthat is what we do.\n  However, even as we discuss all of those fiscal policy changes and \nchallenges, it is important for us to evaluate what else is necessary \nto be done, and what investments should be made. One is education. \nClearly, our future is our children, and clearly we all, Republics and \nDemocrats, want the same thing for our children. We want every single \nyoung child in our country to walk through a classroom door and \nbelieve, as parents and as Americans and as legislators, that that \nclassroom is one of which we are proud.\n  That is a classroom in which that young child can learn, in which \nthat young child may grow up to be a nuclear physicist, or to be a \ndoctor, or a lawyer, or the best plumber, mathematician, carpenter--\nwhatever it is the talents of that young child allow it to be. That is \nwhat we want for our children in education.\n  There are a range of other education challenges that we will debate \nand discuss this year. In the area of health care, there are challenges \nas well.\n  I came to the floor to talk about one specific area which, it seems \nto me, we must work together to address, and that is this: How do we \nrespond to the increasing needs in Medicare, especially with respect to \nprescription drugs?\n  Times have changed in this country. Many people are living longer and \nmuch more productive and healthy lives. I have talked before about my \nuncle, and I will not describe him again in great detail. But my uncle \nis 79 years old. My Uncle Harold is a runner. He didn't discover he \ncould run until he was in his early 70s. Then he discovered quite by \naccident that he was a pretty good runner. My uncle is now 79 years \nold, and he has 39 gold medals from running in races all over the \ncountry. He runs in the 400 and the 800 in Senior Olympic events. My \nuncle is probably a perfect description of how things have changed in \nour country.\n  It wasn't too many decades ago that when you reached 79, there was a \nspecial place for you. It was a big, easy chair where someone would \nserve you soft food--probably oatmeal. You were 79, you were old, \nrelaxed, and you were retired, eating soft food. That is not true \nanymore. People are living longer, better, and healthier lives. My \nuncle, God bless him, is in Arizona today training for his next race at \nage 79.\n  In this job, we all meet and confront wonderful and interesting \npeople. I have met some senior citizens who now, reaching the \nretirement portion of their lives and facing diminished income because \nthey are no longer working, are able to look forward to responding to \nsome of the health challenges with lifesaving drugs and therapies. They \nweren't previously available to them. But medicine has marched forward \nwith new procedures, surgeries, and medicines.\n  A woman came to a town meeting one day and told me that she had two \nnew knees, a new hip, and cataract surgery. She said she feels like a \nmillion dollars. I told her that it was a pretty big investment, but \ngood for you.\n  Forty years ago, if I had held a town meeting in that small \ncommunity, she would have been there in a wheelchair--if she was there \nat all--with bad knees and cataracts. But now, with surgical advances, \nthere are so many things happening that allow people to live longer, \nbetter, more productive and healthier lives. And a part of that is the \nmedicine that allows people to deal with their difficulties. There are \nbreakthroughs in medicine that are quite remarkable.\n  One of the things we must do in this session of the Congress, in my \njudgment, is to try to attach some sort of prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare. What is happening to senior citizens in this country is that \nall too often they reach that portion of their lives when they have \ndiminished income and they have an increased need for prescription \ndrugs, and they can't afford them.\n  Senior citizens are 12 percent of the population in America, and they \nconsume one-third of the prescription drugs in our country. Let me say \nthat again because it is important. Senior citizens are only 12 percent \nof our population, but they consume one-third of the prescription \ndrugs. Why? Because they need them.\n  In Dickinson, ND, a doctor said to me that one of his Medicare \npatients had breast cancer. She was being treated for breast cancer, \nfirst with surgery, and with some prescription drugs to reduce her \nchances of recurrence of breast cancer.\n  The doctor told his patient that she needed to take \nthese prescription drugs to reduce the chances of recurrence of breast \ncancer. This woman told the doctor that she couldn't afford those \nprescription drugs, and therefore couldn't take them. She told him that \nshe couldn't afford them because she didn't have coverage to help her \npay for them through insurance or Medicare. This woman told the doctor \nthat she was just going to have to take her chances with the recurrence \nof breast cancer because she couldn't afford the prescription drug.\n\n  What about the woman with heart disease and diabetes, in her 80s, \nliving on several hundreds of dollars a month of income who is told \nthat she needs several different kinds of expensive prescription drugs \nto manage her heart disease, her diabetes, and all the other health \nchallenges that come from that? She said to me: ``Mr. Senator, I don't \nhave the money to do that. I can't buy these prescription drugs because \nI cannot afford them. I buy prescriptions as much as I can, and I try \nto cut the pills in half and take a half a dose occasionally in order \nto try to make it stretch.''\n  Doctors tell me that can actually exacerbate health problems. That is \nthe difficulty.\n  How do we respond to that? We respond to that by providing a \nthoughtful, sensible, affordable prescription drug benefit in the \nMedicare program. We can do that. To put this together is not rocket \nscience. All of us together can do that, understanding that people are \nliving longer. But when they reach diminished income, as senior \ncitizens do, they need affordable prescription drugs to deal with their \nhealth care problems.\n  I have held Democratic Policy Committee hearings in New York, \nChicago, and North Dakota. We will be having future hearings in Atlanta \nand other places to talk about these issues and to take testimony from \nsenior citizens about the issue of prescription drugs and Medicare. The \ntestimony is so gripping.\n  Senator Durbin and I held a hearing in Chicago. A woman came to \ntestify who had a double lung transplant. She explained to us that the \nway the system works for her health care is it costs her $2,400 a month \nin prescription drug costs for the very expensive drugs to prevent the \nrejection of these organ transplants. She said she didn't have the \nmoney. She said that because she couldn't afford them, she could get \nthem through Medicaid for 1 month.\n\n[[Page S707]]\n\n Then they stop coverage for a second month. So she described to me the \ncircumstances.\n  It is like every other testimony you hear all across this country \nfrom senior citizens. Lifesaving drugs can only save your life if you \nare able to afford to take them. If you do not have the money, and \ndon't have access to the drug that you need for your health--especially \nsenior citizens--you will discover their life is not so long and not so \nhealthy.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my friend yield for a colloquy?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am so happy Senator Dorgan took the time to come over \nhere to discuss this. I thought it would be interesting to talk with \nhim about some facts that came out in recent studies because he has \nbeen on this issue before a lot of folks. He was talking about the cost \nof prescription drugs. I think he would be a very good person for me to \ndirect a few questions to, if he would be willing to do that.\n  When he talked about a particular woman who came to him and told him \nthat she essentially could not afford to take the correct number of \npills for her condition and she was trying to figure it out--well, if I \ntook a half a pill now and a quarter of a pill later--I wonder if the \nSenator is aware that this is a widespread situation. If the Senator \ncould comment on it, one report found that one in eight seniors has to \nchoose between buying food and buying medicine.\n  If my friend could comment on how it makes him feel as someone who \nhas always been a fighter for the average person. Here we have senior \ncitizens in our country, one out of eight, after they have worked all \ntheir lives, have saved their money, have taken care of their family, \nhaving to choose between buying food and buying medicine. I wonder if \nmy friend would comment on that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Boxer raises the question that is raised in so \nmany hearings. We had a woman testify at a hearing I held who said \nsomething you hear often. She goes to a grocery store that has a \npharmacy in the back of the store, and she takes a number of \nprescription drugs.\n  By the way, a lot of senior citizens will take three, five, or seven. \nI have had senior citizens tell me they are on ten different \nprescription drugs for a whole series of health challenges and \nproblems. This woman told me that when she goes to the grocery store, \nshe must first go to the back of the store, to the pharmacy, to buy her \nmedicine. She said that she does this so she will then know how much \nmoney she has left to purchase food. Only then will she know how much \nfood she can buy.\n\n  We hear that time and time again.\n  Last year, spending on prescription drugs in America rose 16 percent. \nSome of that is price inflation; much of it is increased utilization.\n  Let me talk just for a moment about the cost of these drugs because \nthat is part of the other issue. A fellow named Alan Holmer, who \nrepresents the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, wrote a letter to \nthe newspapers in North Dakota because he was upset about prescription \ndrugs.\n  I have been putting pressure on the prescription drug industry to try \nto moderate prices. How much do we pay for prescription drugs? When we \npay $1 for a drug, the same pill, in the same bottle, made by the same \ncompany, the Canadians pay 64 cents; we pay $1 for what the English pay \n65 cents for; we pay $1 for what the Swedish pay 68 cents for; we pay \n$1 for what the Italians pay 51 cents for. We pay the highest prices \nfor prescription drugs for any consumer in the world.\n  I want to show my colleagues four pill bottles which make the point \nbetter than I, and I ask unanimous consent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is a bottle of medicine called Cipro, used to treat \ninfections. It is a commonly used medicine. This bottle contains pills \nmade by the same company, from the same plant--the same pill, inspected \nby the Food and Drug Administration.\n  The difference? There is no difference in the medicine, no difference \nin the bottle. The difference is in price. This bottle of 100, 500-\nmilligram tablets is sold for $399 to the U.S. consumer. This bottle--\nsame company, same medicine, same pill--that sells for $399 in the \nUnited States is sold for $171 in Canada.\n  Why? Good question.\n  This is a different bottle, same pill, same company. Everyone will \nrecognize this drug called Claritin, 10 milligrams, 100 tablets. In \nNorth Dakota, this is purchased for $218. The same pill--same company, \nin plants inspected by the Food and Drug Administration, approved by \nthe Food and Drug Administration, sold for $218 to the United States \nconsumer--is sold for $61 in Canada.\n  Why? Good question.\n  The same is true with a whole list of drugs, especially the most \ncommonly prescribed drugs for senior citizens. The drugs on this chart \ninclude Zocor, a cholesterol drug. Buy it in the United States, it \ncosts $106; in Canada, $43; in Mexico, $47.\n  The question is this: Why is the U.S. consumer required to pay the \nhighest prices of anyone in the world for the exact same drug that is \nsold for a fraction of the cost in virtually every other country in the \nworld?\n  Mr. Holmer, who represents the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, \nhas written a critical letter to the editor, which is fine. It is a \nfree country; he can do that. I want the drug companies to do well and \nbe profitable. I want them to produce good products. I want them to do \nresearch to find new medicines. We do it at the Federal level; there is \na lot of federally sponsored research. I also want fair pricing for the \nAmerican consumer. Fair pricing gives us an opportunity to put a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. This is a very \nimportant issue for all Americans, especially senior citizens.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend will continue to yield, this is my next \nquestion. I am appreciative the Senator has gone in this direction.\n  The General Accounting Office found United States drug prices for \nspecific drugs were, on average, one-third higher than in Canada and 60 \npercent higher than in the United Kingdom. When my friend shows charts, \nthis has been borne out by studies of a Federal agency.\n  The Federal Trade Commission has reported that drug manufacturers use \na two-tiered pricing structure under which they charge higher prices to \nthose without insurance. In other words, if I go to a pharmacy where my \ninsurance is not accepted, it costs an arm and a leg. However, if I \nhave coverage, then the cost to my insurance company is way less.\n  I pivot to this question: Because the Federal Trade Commission has \nstudied it, we know there is a two-tiered pricing insurance, for those \nwho have insurance and those who do not, so does it not make sense, for \nall of our people whom we can possibly reach, particularly those in the \nolder years where they need these drugs to survive, thrive, and live, \nthat they get into some kind of system?\n  In other words, does my friend agree that even though we don't have \nto get into the details of what system it would be, in unity there is \nstrength? If we can walk away from the high-tiered pricing and get into \na system where citizens can avail themselves of the better price, this \nis something we should fight for. If we don't fight for it here, I \ndon't know whom we are representing.\n  Would my friend comment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from California says it better than I. In the \nmultiple-tiered pricing systems, we have preferred customers who get \ndrugs at a fraction of the price if they are in the right system; \nothers pay the highest price on Main Street because the local \npharmacies are not able to access, in most cases, those less expensive \ndrugs.\n  We have several different problems with pricing. One is internal. A \npreferred customer gets one price; if one is not preferred, they get \nanother price. Often, senior citizens are the ones who walk to the \ncorner drugstore in their hometown. The corner drugstores buy from a \ndistributor that does not give them the preferred prices, and senior \ncitizen pay the highest prices.\n  I took senior citizens to Emerson, Canada. Senator Wellstone and \nothers are working with me on a piece of legislation that deals with \nthe international pricing issues. Senator Wellstone has done the same \nwith Minnesotans and talked about this\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\nissue. We went to Emerson, Canada, which is 5 miles north of the North \nDakota border. The same drugs are being sold 5 miles north of the \nborder at a fraction of the price as in Walhalla or Pembina, ND. Does \nanyone think the drug companies are selling in Emerson County at a \nloss? Of course not. A small drugstore--a little, one-room drugstore in \nEmerson County is making a profit, pricing at a fraction of what they \ncharge 5 miles south.\n  We have two issues. One is something called the International \nPrescription Drug Parity Act. If the global economy is good for \neveryone, make it work for everyone. Let the pharmacist go up to \nWinnipeg, Canada, and access the same drug for a fraction of the price \nand pass the savings on to the pharmacist customer. There is a Federal \nlaw now that prohibits that. We ought to pass the International \nPrescription Drug Parity Act that Senator Wellstone and I and others \nintroduced.\n  Also, this Congress ought to work, Republicans and Democrats \ntogether, to understand that after 35 years it is time to add a \nsensible, thoughtful, and affordable prescription drug benefit to the \nMedicare program. Let's help those folks who are in their declining \nincome years be able to access lifesaving drugs that will allow them to \ncontinue to live healthy lives. That is our challenge.\n  Mrs. BOXER. One last question. As with everything else, we have to \nmake choices about what we will do to help people. There is a big \ndebate across party lines about the surplus. We know it is reflected in \nthe Presidential race, even within the parties.\n  I raise the subject of the marriage tax penalty. We know there is a \npenalty in our Tax Code for married couples, and everyone in this \nChamber wants to fix it. If we fix it in the wrong way, where we help, \ninstead of Mrs. Jones or Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Trump or Mrs. Helmsley, then \nwe won't have enough money to take care of the one third of the \nMedicare beneficiaries who do not have prescription drug benefits, \nresulting in the story the Senator told in a very poignant way about a \nwoman chopping up her prescription pill that she needs to stay alive, \nstay healthy, be vibrant, and have those golden years, as we always say \nwe promise our seniors.\n\n  We do not have a bottomless cookie jar. We learned that lesson in the \n1980s. We have to make some tough choices. When we talk about a \nprescription drug benefit, we are not enacting it in a vacuum. We are \nnot just coming down with a laundry list of everything we wanted to do \nwith the surplus. We have thought it out.\n  As the Republican Party decides where it is going to go with the \nsurplus, I hope they will consider, since they run this place right \nnow, that if you give it all away to the wealthiest people with \nbenefits they do not need because they are doing just fine, that they \nwill be forgetting these senior citizens who are living 5 miles to the \nnorth of North Dakota and going to Canada to buy their drugs. That, as \nyou say, is dicey right now. It is not even allowed, unless they have a \nparticular note.\n  So my closing question is a global question. It is more of a larger \nissue. How do we make room for this and can we make room for this \nbenefit?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I should mention also, about the trip to Canada, the \nCustoms folks will allow you to bring a small amount of prescription \ndrugs back across the border for personal use.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I see.\n  Mr. DORGAN. They would not allow a pharmacist who runs a drug store \nin Grand Forks to go to Canada and purchase Claritin and bring it back \nand sell it to a consumer. That is the problem. We have a global \neconomy that is apparently good for the global interests, but it \ndoesn't work for the Main Street pharmacist or distributor who wants to \naccess lower prescription drug prices in Canada, for example.\n  But if you ask doctors where we go from here, they will tell you that \nif you have a senior citizen who has a series of health difficulties--\nand often they do, perhaps diabetes, perhaps some cardiac problems, \narthritis, a whole series of problems--the most expensive way to treat \nthem is to wait until the problem is magnified because they cannot \nafford the prescription drugs they need. If they cannot afford them, \nthey will just not get them, and that is the expensive way to solve \nmedical problems. What will happen to that patient? He will end up in a \nhospital bed someplace. And what does it cost for a day in the \nhospital?\n  It is less expensive way to say to those folks: Here are the \nopportunities for you to access the right kind of prescription \nmedicines that you need to manage your disease, and to allow you to \nstay out of the hospital. That is the most thoughtful and the least \nexpensive way to treat health problems.\n  In some ways it is like the old argument about wellness. We have \nalways, as a country, been willing to treat somebody who is desperately \nill. The minute someone becomes ill, we want to help. But when it comes \nto preventing someone from becoming ill, we don't want to worry about \nthat. We would never pay for that in an insurance policy. We will only \npay for the higher cost treatments once you are admitted to a hospital \nsomewhere.\n  The same thing applies to providing prescription drug benefits to \nMedicare. It will promote wellness, in the sense that it will keep \npeople out of the most expensive medical treatment--time in an acute \ncare hospital bed. We can do this.\n  The Senator from California asked the right question at the start of \nher last discussion: What are our priorities? John F. Kennedy used to \nsay that every mother hopes her child might grow up to be President, as \nlong as they don't have to be active in politics. But, of course, \npolitics is the process by which we make choices in our country. We do \nnot have an unlimited opportunity to make choices.\n  I hope this economy continues in ways that provide significant budget \nsurpluses. If we have those surpluses, then let's be sensible and \nthoughtful about what we do with them. Let's have some targeted tax \ncuts, and, especially, pay down the Federal debt. But, in addition, we \nshould find ways to use some of that surplus to do important things in \neducation and health care. Let's construct together, in this Chamber, a \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare that, in my judgment, has been \nneeded for a long time and is an issue Congress has ignored. We can do \nthis.\n\n  We cannot do any of this--we cannot even begin to talk or think about \nit, if someone comes to the floor, gives us a bill, and says they would \nlike a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years. First of all, we don't have \nthose surpluses; they are simply economic projections. Second, $1.3 \ntrillion means you are going to dip into the Social Security trust fund \nto give the tax cut, and it means nothing else can be discussed because \nyou have given out all that money in tax cuts.\n  At least one of the Presidential candidates out there has proposed \nthe $1.3 trillion tax cut in a way that, as always, gives the bulk of \nthe money to those who need it the least. These at the upper side of \nthe income scale will get the preponderance of this money and it will \nforeclose the opportunity to do some other important things.\n  Yes, let's have a targeted tax cut; yes, let's reduce the debt and \npass some other measures that will help this country offer a \nprescription drug benefit, and then let's invest in an education for \nour children that we can be proud of as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask the Senator from California, did she not intend \nto speak?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No. I am done.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, very briefly, how much \ntime do the Democrats have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Until 10:45, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me try to do this in 10 minutes. I \nmight ask unanimous consent for a couple of more minutes but not much \nmore.\n  I thank my colleagues for their discussion about prescription drug \ncosts. In the State of Minnesota, actually only one-third of senior \ncitizens have any prescription drug coverage at all. Let me also point \nout that in the State of Minnesota, we have many seniors who cut their \npills in half because they think they will save money and still will be \nable to help themselves and actually, doctors say, sometimes that can \nbe more dangerous than not even taking the drug at all.\n  The investment in prescription drug coverage cannot be done on the \ncheap.\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\n I am in complete agreement with my colleagues about the tradeoff \nbetween tax cuts, the vast majority of which benefit people at the top, \nand not having the money for this investment. But to be fair in a \ncritique here, I think all of us, Democrats and Republicans, have to \nunderstand even if we provide a benefit but we are unwilling to spend \ntoo much money for fear of being called, I suppose, big spending \nliberals or whatever, if you set a cap and you say only $1,000 will be \ncovered and no more than that, then I can tell you many of our senior \ncitizens, and others who are the frailest and most sick, will bump up \nagainst that cap, and it will still not cover their catastrophic \nexpenses. We have to be very careful people can afford it on the front \nside as well.\n  So whether it be too high deductibles or caps that are set too low, \nwe have to be very careful if we say we are going to have this coverage \nfor people and security for people, that it will be there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S709-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S709-S710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CHECHNYA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have in hand an article, titled \n``Rights Group Reports Massacre in Chechnya.'' The first two paragraphs \nread:\n\n       Moscow, Feb. 22--Russian soldiers went on a deadly rampage \n     earlier this month in a neighborhood of the Chechen capital \n     of Grozny, killing at least 60 civilians in the worst case \n     yet disclosed of Russian military atrocities, an \n     international human rights group charged today.\n       During the attack, which began the morning of Feb. 5 in the \n     Aldi neighborhood, soldiers, ``systematically'' robbed and \n     shot civilians, raped women and looted and burned homes, \n     according to a draft report prepared by Human Rights Watch \n     and based on interviews with witnesses and relatives of those \n     killed.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Post, February 23, 2000]\n\n               Rights Group Reports Massacre in Chechnya\n\n                           (By David Hoffman)\n\n       Moscow, Feb. 22--Russian soldiers went on a deadly rampage \n     earlier this month in a neighborhood of the Chechen capital \n     of Grozny, killing at least 60 civilians in the worst case \n     yet disclosed of Russian military atrocities, an \n     international human rights group charged today.\n       During the attack, which began the morning of Feb. 5 in the \n     Aldi neighborhood, soldiers ``systematically'' robbed and \n     shot civilians, raped women and looted and burned homes, \n     according to a draft report prepared by the Human Rights \n     Watch and based on interviews with witnesses and relatives of \n     those killed.\n       ``Russian soldiers murdered their way through Aldi, killing \n     more than 60 civilians who were peacefully waiting for them \n     in the streets,'' said Peter Bouckaert, a spokesman for Human \n     Rights Watch who researched the events. ``These are war \n     crimes, and they must be investigated and punished as such.''\n       Human Rights Watch has documented two earlier rampages by \n     Russian troops: in Alkhan-Yurt; where 17 people were killed \n     in mid-December, and in the Staropromyslovsky district of \n     Grozny, where 44 died in December and January. Russian \n     commanders have denied that their troops murdered civilians \n     but, faced with continuing criticism from Western \n     organizations and governments, acting President Vladimir \n     Putin recently appointed a new human rights commissioner for \n     Chechnya.\n       The new commissioner, Vladimir Kalamanov, the former chief \n     of the migration service, promised in a news conference today \n     to check the reports, but refused to discuss specific \n     allegations.\n       According to the Human Rights Watch report, witnesses \n     painted a consistent picture of the events in Aldi, when a \n     large group of soldiers, ``numbering in the hundreds,'' began \n     killing civilians. Witnesses said residents had been summoned \n     to the streets to have their passports checked when the \n     shooting started.\n       The human rights group quoted witnesses as saying the \n     soldiers also extorted money from residents, allowing them to \n     buy their own lives with cash. One man who offered the \n     soldiers rubles was told to come up with dollars, and when he \n     offered $100 he was killed, Human Rights Watch said.\n       At least two women were raped by soldiers during the \n     rampage, the group added. Russian soldiers warned witnesses \n     that they faced revenge if they spoke of the atrocities, so \n     some were unwilling to talk, the group added.\n       Human Rights Watch said at least two sources had confirmed \n     the deaths of 34 people, but the group has obtained the names \n     of more than 60 people believed to have been killed in Aldi \n     on Feb. 5. Local witnesses have stated the death toll was at \n     least 82 persons, the group added.\n       Meanwhile, Russian forces continued battling Chechen \n     fighters in the southern mountains, launching an attack on \n     the village of Shatoi, said to be a major rebel stronghold. A \n     battle also was underway near the Georgian border. The \n     Interfax news agency quoted Russian sources as saying that \n     three helicopter gunships were shot down today, an unusually \n     high single-day toll.\n       Russian authorities also announced that they have clamped \n     down on the movement of all people and vehicles in Chechnya--\n     and sealed the border with the neighboring region of \n     Ingushetia--in anticipation of the Chechen commemoration on \n     Wednesday of Joseph Stalin's mass deportation of Chechens \n     during World War II. Russian authorities have said they are \n     bracing for terrorist acts on Wednesday, which also is a \n     Russian military holiday.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I hope to have the opportunity to \nintroduce a freestanding resolution on the floor of the Senate. I hope \nthis resolution will receive unanimous support. It expresses the sense \nof the Senate that the Russian Federation should devote every effort to \nachieving a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Chechnya, allowing \nto Chechnya an international monitoring mission to monitor and report \non the situation there and allow international humanitarian agencies to \nmake sure there is immediate and full and unimpeded access to Chechen \ncivilians.\n  This is a question on which the Senate should not be silent. It does \nmake a difference if we speak up. Two weeks ago, I met with members of \nthe Chechen Government. They discussed with me the horrific conditions \ncurrently facing their homeland. I do not think any of us should be \nsilent while this is happening.\n  We in the Senate should express our distress over the escalating \nhumanitarian situation in Chechnya, and we should urge the \nadministration to enlarge its public demands on Russia to confront it.\n  It is clear that the Russian Government must move immediately to \nallow into Chechnya an international monitoring force to monitor and \nreport on the situation there. We need that. The world needs that. The \npeople in Chechnya need that. It must also immediately move to assist \nthose persons who have been displaced from Chechnya as a result of this \nconflict, and the Russian Government must allow representatives of the \ninternational community access to those persons in order to provide \nhumanitarian relief.\n  Russian authorities agree to permit the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe to engage in monitoring in Chechnya, yet it has \nnot permitted OSCE's six monitors currently in Moscow to visit the \nregion. The administration must demand that Russia permit the \nmonitoring mission to go forward and take steps to expand it \nsubstantially.\n  The administration must urge Russia to grant human rights monitors \naccess to the region, including those from our own diplomatic missions \nin the area. The administration must engage Russian authorities at the \nhighest levels to secure cooperation in addressing the humanitarian \nemergency in Chechnya and in its neighboring province. It must demand \nRussia assist those persons who have been displaced from Chechnya as a \nresult of this conflict and grant humanitarian organizations access to \nChechen civilians to provide some relief. The civilian population in \nChechnya has been victimized to an extraordinary degree, and it is in \ndesperate need of humanitarian aid. The Senate should not be silent on \nthis question.\n  Finally, the administration must urge the Russian Government to \nachieve a peaceful resolution and durable settlement in a manner \nconsistent with Russia's obligation to the international community.\n  We must strongly support the OSCE mediation process. The Russian \nGovernment acknowledged the OSCE's competence in serving as a mediator \nand achieving a political settlement to the conflict in Chechnya during \nthe war of 1994 to 1996. However, to date, the Russians have rebuffed \nrepeated efforts by the OSCE to mediate the current conflict. The \nadministration must increase its efforts to persuade Russia to \nimplement an immediate cease-fire and accept OSCE-mediated \nnegotiations.\n  As this conflict drags on and the number and intensity of human \nrights abuses by Russian forces in Chechnya increase, the \nadministration must support the creation of a United Nations\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\ncommission of inquiry to investigate serious violations of \ninternational humanitarian law by Russian forces.\n  We must confront the suffering of the Chechen people. As many of my \ncolleagues know, the recent Russian assault on the Chechen capital of \nGrozny was one more campaign in a continuing series of Russian military \noffensives in Chechnya. In September, I expressed my concerns to \nYeltsin and Putin about the humanitarian tragedy that was, for the \nsecond time, unfolding in Chechnya. It is hard to imagine that after \nthe use of force in Chechnya from 1994 to 1996, which left over 80,000 \ncivilians dead, the Russian leadership could again see the use of force \nas enhancing the prospects for a durable settlement to this conflict. \nBut the Russian leadership has again chosen use of force, and the \ncurrent tragedy before us has now reached unimaginable heights, as \nevidenced by the piece today in the Washington Post.\n  Russian forces have used indiscriminate and disproportionate force in \ntheir bombings of civilian targets. This has resulted in the deaths of \nthousands of innocent civilian and displaced countless other. Russian \nauthorities maintain a virtual ban on access to Chechen civilians by \nmedia and international humanitarian agencies resulting in our having \nto rely on the personal testimony of refugees fleeing the fighting to \ndetermine the nature and extent of the crisis and best means to provide \nhumanitarian relief.\n  These testimonies are horrific: incidents of widespread looting, \nsummary executions, detentions, denial of civilians safe passage from \nthe fighting, torture, and rape.\n  Many civilians report being detained at the Chechen border as they \ntried to flee the fighting. They tell of brothers and fathers who had \nsimply been denied safe passage out. It is fundamentally unacceptable \nto deny any civilian the right to flee the fighting--to trap them in \nthis dangerous war. And where do these trapped civilians go? Into \ndetention camps. No one needs to be reminded of the systematic torture \nthat took place in detention camps set up to detain Chechens in the \n1994-96 Chechen war. That event stains the memory of the Chechen people \nand it is happening again.\n  One twenty-one-year-old tells of the horror in the camps:\n\n       About fifteen or twenty soldiers were standing in two lines \n     with rubber sticks. . . . When I was running through the \n     corridor, each soldier beat me with the sticks. They made us \n     undress and started checking our clothes. They took away the \n     clothes they liked. . . . For a week, I had to sit in the \n     jail almost naked.\n\n  In addition to this torture, young men report that in order to be \nreleased from the camps their family members must pay outrageous bribes \nto camp officers and upon release, must sign papers saying they \nsuffered no harm in captivity.\n  Then there are the numerous reports of rape. In one Chechen town a \nsix-month pregnant 23-year-old woman was raped and murdered. Her \nmother-in-law was executed in this same incident. And Mr. President, \nmany incidences of rape and sexual abuse go unreported. For many women \nin towns and villages all over Chechnya the shame is simply too great--\nthey won't come forward to report these horrible crimes. Chechnya's \nculture and national traditions make it difficult to document case of \nrape and sexual abuse--unmarried women who are raped are unlikely to be \nable to get married, and married women who are raped are likely to be \ndivorced by their husbands. The effects of these rapes on Chechen \nsociety will be profound and long lasting. I remind the Russian \nleadership that rape is war crime.\n  Two weeks ago I sent a letter to acting President Putin expressing my \ndeep concern over the deteriorating situation in Chechnya and the \nRussian government's response to the humanitarian tragedy there. I urge \nthe Russian government to move quickly to resolve this situation in a \nmanner consistent with Russia's obligations to the international \ncommunity and urge the Russian leadership to begin now to investigate \nand prosecute those responsible for human rights abuses in Chechnya--it \npromised to do this after the last Chechen war but failed to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to communicate their own concerns to the \nAdministration and the Russian government in whatever manner you think \nbest. We cannot remain silent. We must fully condemn the use of \nindiscriminate force against the civilians in Chechnya and denial of \nhumanitarian relief to Chechen civilians. We must remind the Russian \nleadership that the world is watching.\n  This congress and this administration must express to the Russian \ngovernment that it should devote every effort to achieve a peaceful \nresolution of the conflict in Chechnya, allow into Chechnya an \ninternational monitoring force to monitor and report on the situations \nthere.\n  That is what this resolution I have submitted to the Senate, on which \nI hope we will have a vote, calls for. We must call for allowing \ninternational humanitarian agencies immediate, full, and unimpeded \naccess to Chechen civilians in order to provide humanitarian relief.\n  This resolution, on which I hope we will have an up-or-down vote or \nit will be unanimously accepted by the Senate, calls for several \nthings. It calls for the Russian Federation to devote every effort to a \npeaceful resolution, to allow into Chechnya an international monitoring \nmission to monitor and report on the situation, and to allow \ninternational humanitarian agencies immediate and full access to \nChechen civilians. The people of Chechnya deserve no less.\n  I have no illusions. I do not think adopting a resolution \nautomatically turns the situation around, but I do believe the Senate \nshould not be silent, that we must support this resolution, and we must \nsend this message. We must stand up for human rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, every time we have a recess and \nthere is an occasion to go home, invariably we all learn something of \nsignificance that helps us in our service in the Senate. I thought I \nwould take to the floor of the Senate today and speak about something I \nlearned, something I experienced which I wanted to highlight. Right \nnow, it is an issue that is sort of a low light in this body.\n  Earlier in this Congress, Senator Bob Graham of Florida and I \nintroduced a bill to fix our H-2A guest worker program that affects \nagriculture. Preceding that, Senators Graham and Wyden and I met with \nthe Secretary of Labor and pleaded for the administration to come \nforward with some sort of fix to relieve the pressure on the farm labor \nsystem. There are enough workers, but you have to settle for an illegal \nsystem to conclude that there are enough workers. The Secretary assured\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\nus that something would be forthcoming, but nothing has been.\n  In the meantime, I have gone forward with this fix of our farm guest \nworker program in the hopes of getting something through in this \nCongress that could win the support of the administration and begin to \nrelieve a problem I have now seen in a very human way.\n  I had scheduled two meetings last Thursday, one in Woodburn, OR, and \nthe other in Gresham, OR. The subject was farm labor. I invited people \nto come and talk about my bill. I was overwhelmed by what occurred. We \nmet first in an armory in Woodburn. When I arrived, it was already \nfilled to capacity. There were 1,200 people, most of them illegal, in \nthe armory waiting for me to come. They had been there, I was told, for \nan hour or more ahead of time, hoping to get a seat to hear what was \ngoing to be shared. There were so many people in the armory, they had \nto put a speaker on the outside grounds so that those who could not get \nin could hear. Some in the media estimated there were 2,000 people in \ntotal.\n  I looked into their faces and saw those who live in our society, \nthose who live in the shadows of our society, those who fill jobs in \nour society, those who keep our shelves full at home and in our grocery \nstores, but those who are victimized in the most inhumane way because \nwe have an unworkable law.\n  I heard all kinds of opinions about my bill. I granted to them that \nit probably wasn't a perfect bill, but at least I was trying--one of \nthe few who are--to resolve this situation. I thank Senator Graham of \nFlorida for his willingness to step into this issue. One gets lots of \narrows in the back when they try to tackle an immigration issue.\n  What motivates me to do this is almost weekly reports of migrant \nworkers dying in the American deserts of the Southwest, trying to make \ntheir way to jobs. These are people who are victimized by human \ncoyotes. They are raped. They are robbed. They are bribed. They are \npillaged in ways that are unthinkable, and ought to be unthinkable, in \nthis country. It happens because they have no safe and legal way to \ncome here and to go home, to work a job, to earn their way, and to \nshare the American dream, which is really just a human dream. That was \nthe motive upon which I tackled this issue.\n  The law we have regarding our guest worker system doesn't work. There \nare estimates of 2 million illegal aliens in this country working in \nagriculture. There are estimates of 6 million illegal aliens in the \nUnited States. I was trying to focus on agriculture. Let me tell you \nwhy this system doesn't work.\n  First of all, it is economically beyond the pale of most of those in \nthe farm communities who would like to hire them. This is the \napplication. There are hundreds of pages a farmer has to comply with to \nhire one worker. Conversely, I applied for a job in the Senate, I had \nto fill out a two-page document. This is what a farmer has to fill out \njust to get a worker in a system that is untimely as the crops go \nunharvested.\n  We have a broken system. I believe it is estimated about 30,000 in \ntotal in this country use this system out of probably 2 million illegal \naliens in agriculture. I think it is a given, a manifest failure. We \nneed to make our guest worker law workable. That is a long-term \nsolution. I think we need to do this.\n  What made my meetings, frankly, more productive and very helpful was \na press release from the AFL-CIO, in which they called not for help to \nfarmers and farm workers alone, they called for a general amnesty of \nall illegal aliens in this country. A general amnesty is something we \nhave done in this country periodically; every few decades we seem to do \nthis. The question now is whether it is appropriate to do that now.\n\n  There have been lots of editorial comments about this recently in the \nWashington Post. There was a very interesting article on this whole \nissue of farm labor and illegality. The Post said:\n\n       Congress has responded sympathetically to the pleas of the \n     high-tech industry to hire more skilled workers from abroad, \n     but it has yet to do anything for employers of those at the \n     bottom end of the labor market--the end where U.S. citizens \n     don't want to work. Now, with a record number of illegal \n     immigrants living in the United States, an estimated 6 \n     million, with most of them working, some even paying taxes \n     and joining unions, it is time to bring our immigration \n     policies in line with what is actually happening in the labor \n     market. It is time to recognize that we need the immigrants \n     as much as they need us.\n\n  See, I know in Congress there are a lot of people who make an \nacademic argument that we don't want to reward illegal behavior with a \nlegal document. I understand that, but it doesn't fix the problem. It \ndoesn't deal with reality. These people aren't coming; they are here \nand they live among us. They live in our shadows and they are \nvictimized on a daily basis in a whole range of ways--bureaucratically, \neven criminally. It is a shame upon this country that we don't resolve \nthis--short-term and long-term.\n  I was pleased that in the recent testimony of Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan he gave support to what I am talking about. \nSaid the Chairman:\n\n       It is clear that under existing circumstances, not only in \n     the high-tech and in the farm area, but indeed throughout the \n     country, aggregate demand is putting very significant \n     pressures on an ever-decreasing available supply of \n     unemployed labor. The one obvious means that one can use to \n     offset that is expanding the number of people we allow in, \n     either generally or in specifically focused areas. And I do \n     not think that an appraisal of our immigration policies in \n     this regard is really clearly on the table.\n\n  I think we need to put it clearly on the table as a priority of this \nCongress to do something about it. It need not be partisan. Regarding \nthe position the AFL-CIO has just taken, I hope they will let me help \nthem. I would like to help them to get a general amnesty. But I think \nthat we also need to fix our broken farm labor system.\n  For those who say we should not do anything, I don't know what their \nmotive is. I fear too often, though, that it is just anti-immigrant. We \nrightfully criticize, for example, Joerg Haider, of Austria for his \nanti-immigrant statement, which recalls a bygone era and a great \ntragedy. But what is the difference when we have politicians among us \nwho make comments not unlike that about even legal immigration? They \ndon't want anymore of it.\n  We have the Chairman of the Federal Reserve saying we need workers \nbecause we have good employment, but it is predicated on an illegal \nsystem. We need these jobs to be filled and we need crops harvested. \nRight now, we are victimizing farm workers and farmers because farm \nworkers have to live like fugitives among us, and farmers are made out \nto be felons. We owe the United States something better. But, more, we \nowe the people at the bottom rung something better. They contribute to \nour society and they are victimized too often by our society when they \nmake a significant contribution to the abundance that we enjoy as \nAmericans.\n  So I call on our congressional leadership to bring us together, to \nfix our H-2A program, but also to pursue the amnesty that has been \nsuggested by the AFL-CIO in this two-pronged approach. We can find a \nsolution and we can treat these people more fairly, like human beings, \nwith the dignity of law and the protection of law and a process that is \nsafe and humane.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

Mr. President, I rise in support this morning of S. 2087, \nthe Military Health Care Improvement Act of 2000. This is bipartisan \nlegislation. It will begin to fulfill a promise of lifetime health care \nfor our military men and women who sacrifice so much for our freedom.\n  This bill begins a multiyear process to identify and correct the \nbroken promise of lifetime health care to our\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\nmilitary retirees and veterans. I want to emphasize that this is a \nreasonable and a prudent first step. It is not the end by any means. It \nis only the beginning of an effort to rejuvenate our defense health \ncare system.\n  I met an hour or so ago with the Commandant of the Marine Corps. He \nconfirmed that this is an important part of the triad of things that we \nmust do to reinstate the morale and recruitment and retention that we \nneed for our military.\n  Last year, with S. 4, we addressed two components of that triad: Pay \nand pension benefits. But this year defense health care is critical. \nThe chiefs have stepped up to this issue and included in the budget \nwhat was submitted by the President significant improvements, \nparticularly for health care for our active-duty personnel. But more \nneeds to be done, both for the active-duty personnel, but especially \nfor our retired military personnel.\n  I am pleased that the Commandant and the chiefs are trying to help us \nin this effort, and it is going to be one of the most important things \nwe can do this year for the military.\n  It helps the men and women currently serving in the Armed Forces \nwhile also keeping promises to the heroes of America's storied \nyesterdays without which our prosperous and promising future would have \nnever been possible.\n  Last year, I was proud to see our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and both sides of the Capitol join in significantly improving \ntwo-thirds of the triad that I referred to. I was honored to join my \ndistinguished colleagues on the defense authorization committee in \npassing the largest pay hike for our uniformed military personnel since \n1981.\n  I remember very well in 1981 when President Reagan came in and said \nit is unconscionable that we are not paying our military personnel \nenough to live on. We had that period where they were having to go on \nfood stamps and become qualified for welfare. The significant pay \nincrease they received affected morale and helped us get our military \ninto the position of great strength throughout the rest of the 1980s. \nBut we have lost ground since then.\n  With the 4.8-percent raise for our men and women in uniform last \nyear, we narrowed the pay differential between military and the private \nsector, making our All Voluntary Force more attractive to America's \nbest young people and a more viable option for quality men and women \nwho wish to remain in uniform.\n  Occasionally, I run across people who say, well, how is our All \nVolunteer Force working? Are they really able to do the jobs? We are \ngetting the best? Sometimes I wonder. And then I have an occasion to go \nto a military installation to see men and women on Air Force bases--the \nLittle Rock Air Force Base or Keesler Air Force Base, or Meridian Naval \nAir Station, or other military installations from South Carolina, North \nCarolina, Georgia, and all across this country--to California.\n  I am invariably impressed with the caliber of young men and women I \nsee, the knowledge they have, the sophistication of what they have to \ndeal with in aircraft, ships, and in weapons systems. We are doing \nwell, but morale has suffered because of the pay and retention problem, \nand now health care needs that they depend on for their families. They \nhave this additional problem now of long assignments in areas such as \nHaiti, Kosovo, Bosnia, South Korea, and around the world. They are away \nfrom their families.\n  We run the risk of seeing our military begin to erode internally by \nlosing these young men and women because of family needs and because of \nhealth care needs. We run the risk of not being able to retain our \npilots and keep our chiefs, master sergeants, and the sergeant majors. \nYes, these generals are fantastic, but who runs the Marine Corps? The \nsergeant major is the guy who does the work, or the woman who does the \nwork that allows the Marines to do what they need to do.\n  This legislation is so important. It would substantially improve the \nhealth care benefits of our service personnel.\n  The military medical and dental care systems still do not provide \nbenefits to all that have earned them. And it is possibly the single \nmost important remaining item that addresses and affects the quality of \nlife of our service members, their families, and our retirees.\n  Today there are the same number of potential beneficiaries, \napproximately 8 million, as when we began the downsizing almost 10 \nyears ago. However, the resources allocated to military health care \nhave decreased dramatically. We can no longer squeeze blood from this \nstone. It is empty. Our service men and women, their families, and our \nretirees deserve better.\n  The Military Health Care Improvement Act will complete the pay, \nbenefits, and medical triad. The bill is composed of five primary \ncomponents:\n  First, it extends existing demonstration programs for the over-65 \nretirees until the year 2005, including programs such as the Medicare \nSubvention and Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan.\n  It also expands the Defense Department's national mail order pharmacy \nprogram to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, with $150 deductible.\n  It requires the expansion of the TriCare Remote program in the \ncontinental United States for active-duty family members in the Prime \nRemote program and eliminates copays for TriCare Prime for active-duty \nfamily members. It also improves the business practices used in \nadministering the TriCare program.\n  Fourth, it expands the Department of Defense and Veterans' \nAdministration cooperative programs, directing DOD and the VA to \ndevelop a common set of patient safety indicators for centralized \ntracking, and it will improve pharmaceutical safety.\n  Finally, it will initiate two studies to access the feasibility and \ndesirability of financing the military health care program for retirees \non an accrual basis.\n  This bill is only a start, but it is a very sure start. As with last \nyear's efforts to improve the pay and retirement part of the quality of \nlife triad for our military personnel, I am pleased this measure has \nsuch a broad bipartisan base of support in the Senate, particularly \nfrom my distinguished colleagues on the Senate's defense committees.\n  Unlike several other bills that are being touted on the Hill, this \nbill will be fully funded in the Senate's budget resolution of fiscal \nyear 2001. Every year, thousands of bills that would spend millions, \neven billions, of dollars are introduced in the Congress--and for good \npurpose, I am sure, almost all of them. However, at the end of the \nyear, few of the new massive programs are passed in view of all the \nother needs for defense, Medicare, Social Security, education, and \ntransportation.\n  The key to success is ensuring that funding is included in the budget \nfor the desired program. That is how the pay and retirement provisions \nof S. 4 were ultimately signed into law. That is how I hope to have the \nprovisions of this bill signed into law. When S. 4 came up at the \nbeginning of last year, some said: This costs too much; we will never \nget it done. But it was not a massive jump, it was achievable. Moving \nS. 4 aggressively with the authorization early in the year led to it \nultimately being funded.\n  While I support the ultimate goal of the other bills, I don't know \nwhat their final cost may be. We have had estimate ranges of $8 billion \nto $20 billion per year. I believe our Nation should keep its promise \nof lifetime health care for our military personnel. But I also believe \nwe owe it to all America's taxpayers to ensure we know how we can best \nmeet this commitment, and if we can. As I said earlier, this process \nwill take a year or two or more.\n  Many in Congress are committed to finding a way to fulfill our \nNation's promise to our military members, their families, our military \nretirees, and veterans. What our military community doesn't need is \nmore empty promises and unrealistic expectations; we need results. That \nis what this bill, S. 2087, is designed to do. It will give tangible \nand measurable results.\n  The broken promise of lifetime health care for our veterans has been \na haunting specter in the Halls of Congress for a number of years, and \nrightly so. I have been hearing concerns about this throughout my \ncareer in Congress, both the House and Senate. Of course, the problem \ngoes back to the 1950s when changes were made that led to the problem \nwe have now. It is time we\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\nkeep that promise. This calls for concrete, bipartisan legislation that \ntakes a discernible step forward. Our Nation's veterans deserve nothing \nless. They deserve health care, especially as so many World War II, \nKorea, and Vietnam era veterans depend on the promise of the Government \nof the people that they fought so hard to protect.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at this legislation. I thank \nSenator Warner for the work he and his staff have done on this bill, as \nwell as my staff who have worked on the Military Health Care \nImprovement Act of 2000.\n  I am thankful we have a bipartisan group of Senators who have \ncosponsored it. I think this is achievable legislation this year. It is \nthe beginning of keeping our promise.\n  I commend this legislation to my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I inform our colleagues that the managers on this \nlegislation, the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking \nmember, Senator Moynihan, will be available at 2 o'clock and we will \nbegin the process to consider the education savings account bill. I \ncertainly support this legislation. It has broad support across the \ncountry. We did pass it a couple of years ago. It was vetoed by the \nPresident. But it is a bill whose time has come.\n  People should be able to save for the education of their children, \nfor their needs in education--whether kindergarten, 4th grade, 10th \ngrade, or 12th grade. We need to allow parents who can and want to, to \nsave for their needs, whether it is a computer for their child, whether \ntutoring, remedial assistance in reading, or whatever it may be. It is \nunconscionable that we can do that for a child's higher education but \nnot for their education needs in the fourth grade.\n  Some say it will benefit middle-income people and upper-income people \nwho can afford to save for their children's needs. That is fine. The \nimportant thing is to help our children, all of our children, at the \nlowest economic level, but also to encourage savings across the board \nfor education in general.\n  I am glad we will have this full debate.

Mr. President, if Americans knew that every time they \nwalked through their local shopping mall or wandered through the \nshopping district of their hometown their movements were being tracked, \nevery purchase was being recorded, and every conversation was being \nmonitored, they would be outraged. Americans would consider this level \nof surveillance a violation of their most basic constitutional right. \nYet that very expectation of privacy we expect in our traditional \nshopping in the local mall, or our visiting with friends, or searching \nfor information in our hometown is exactly what is not happening in the \nshopping center of the 21st century in cyberspace.\n  Whenever a citizen ventures online to pay a bill, seeks medical \nadvice, purchases a product, checks the latest news, or engages in a \nconversation on the Internet, there is a chance that someone is \ngathering information about us, recording their information, and then \nselling it, or giving it to others. It is a very disturbing new look at \na very exciting new technology.\n  Indeed, there are companies now being formed for the specific purpose \nof monitoring our travels through cyberspace and recording this very \ninformation.\n  The situation, while unsettling, does not need to necessarily be \nmenacing. Marketing both online and offline is very common in our daily \nlives. By collecting some of this information, businesses, indeed, can \nbenefit, if they know the kind of products we want, what our tastes \nmight be, our sizes, and our preferences in what we want to read and \nwant to purchase. The question is whether consumers can control that \ninformation because, indeed, companies having access to this \ninformation can be more efficient and allow our time to be used more \nefficiently. I may want a retailer of clothing to know the kind of \nclothes I want to buy so that I receive the proper advertising. I may \nwant a book company to know the things that I like to read and my areas \nof study so I can receive products more properly.\n  That is having information used at its best. One can only imagine how \nit can be used at its worst.\n  This information about what I want to read in the wrong hands can \nreveal my most private political thoughts that I would rather have \nothers not know. It could reveal sexual orientation or party \naffiliation. Indeed, if I seek medical advice online for psychiatric \ncare or for a disease for myself or a child or a mate, it very well \nprobably would be information I wouldn't want generally available to \nother people for commercial purposes, political purposes, or worse.\n  Too often web sites underinform or misinform the public about how \nthey intend to use this information or have presented work to be used \nimproperly or where it can be misused. The fact is that over 90 percent \nof our most popular web sites do not reveal that they gather and share \nconsumer information with other businesses. And if the public knew that \n90 percent of these sites were sharing this information, we as \nconsumers and citizens would be more careful about what we reveal or \nwhat we purchase.\n  A 1999 Georgetown survey also concluded that only 36 percent of \nleading web sites that admit to gathering information fully explain how \nthey intend to utilize it. So the consumer, the citizens, are not able \nto make an informed decision about what information they are providing \nand what risks they might be taking.\n  Many consumers are now being informed through the popular media that \nwithout our consent or knowledge, programs known as ``cookies'' monitor \nand collect information regarding our web site browsing habits.\n  Personal data is also routinely extracted directly by web sites \nwhenever we transmit the information required to purchase a product or \nsurf the net for a specific topic.\n  In both cases, our actions are monitored and our information will be \nshared unless we specifically request that a company do not do so, a \nprocess known as opting out.\n  Opting out requires that a user directly contact a site to decline \ndisclosure. The problem with opting out is that the location on web \nsites where one clicks to opt out, to take your information out of \ncirculation, is often not prominently displayed and therefore is not \nknown by the consumer.\n  One leading marketing company that tracks 80 million online consumer \nprofiles has revealed it receives an average of only 12 opt out \nrequests per day; 80 million customers, 12 opt out per day.\n  It is unlikely that only 12 people are concerned about privacy of \ntheir purchases or other vital personal information. I suggest to the \nSenate it is much more likely that the opt out location\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\non the web page is obscured or in some form inadequate.\n  Privacy policies meant to inform users of both the scope and scale of \nthis information are very often inaccessible. A recent California \nHealthcare survey of 21 popular health care sites reveals many sites \nhave secretly shared personal health information with marketers despite \nthe fact that privacy policies were posted. Often the opt out sites are \nnot adequately displayed. They often are misleading. Sometimes, as this \nstudy by California Healthcare indicates, they are just plain \ndishonest.\n  There are, however, solutions. I believe these solutions are \nimportant to protect privacy. I remind those who are now marketing on \nthe Internet and share my enthusiasm for the potential of the Internet \nfor economic purposes that we have a common interest. If consumers do \nnot believe their interests are protected regarding safeguarding their \nmost vital personal information, the Internet will never reach its true \neconomic potential. This point bears repeating. This is vital for \nprivacy in our society and personal confidence in the Internet, but it \nis equally vital for the Internet in meeting its economic potential.\n  Great segments of this society are going to be reluctant to purchase \nbooks, health care products, seek information, and exchange ideas if \nthey do not know whether the information is safeguarded. It is no \ndifferent than citizens using the telephone to convey information, \nexchange political ideas, or purchase products, if citizens did not \nhave some idea that their every phone conversation wasn't being \nmonitored. It wouldn't be any different than citizens visiting the \nlocal shopping mall, meeting friends, engaging in conversations, going \nto restaurants, or purchasing products, if they knew that over their \nshoulder someone was recording everything they did and everywhere they \nwent. This is vital economically as well for the privacy of our \ncitizens if this new, wonderful technology is to meet its economic \npotential.\n  To deal with this problem, I have introduced S. 2063, the Secure \nOnline Communication Enforcement Act of 2000. This legislation is not a \nfinal product, I stress to privacy advocates and to the Internet \nindustries and online companies. It is not a final product. It is \nestablishing, I hope, a national dialog first to educate ourselves \nabout the privacy problem in cyberspace. It is a beginning document to \nwhich I invite comment and amendment. Its purpose is simply to begin \ncollecting ideas of how to enhance privacy. But it is built on the \nconcept of opting in versus opting out; that is, that the consumer, the \ncitizen, must make a choice about whether they want this information \nshared. So the consumer, the individual, holds the power.\n\n  If I believe a company can better market to me--and, indeed, I \nbelieve a company can better market to me if they know my taste in \nmusic, my taste in reading, my taste in clothing or automobiles--I can \ndecide that I want that information shared, given to other companies, \nand come back to me with good information. However, if I don't want \nsomething shared--perhaps I have gone online with a health care company \nand I prefer my health information not be shared--I do not opt in, I do \nnot give anybody the right to give that information.\n  A second vital part of this bill: I strongly believe government \noversight and regulation of the Internet should be kept to a minimum. \nThat is one reason I have opposed steadfastly a sales tax on Internet \npurchases. This is one area of American life where the government \nshould keep its presence to an absolute minimum in taxation and \nregulation. For that reason, this legislation is self-enforcing. No \ngovernment bureaucracy will be calling if there is a violation. If, \nindeed, a company violates a citizen's privacy, the right of action is \nwith the citizen, not the government. There is a legal right of action \nwhen sharing my personal information which I have said will not be \nshared. If I did not give anyone that right, then I as a citizen will \nhold them liable for doing so.\n  Those twin pillars are: As a citizen, I decide whether to share my \nprivate service; second pillar, as a citizen, I and not the government \nhave the right of action to enforce it.\n  I have introduced this new legislation to begin this dialog, S. 2063, \nthe Secure Online Communication and Enforcement Act of 2000. I hope it \nis helpful to my colleagues. I hope a good and worthwhile debate \nproceeds in the Senate, in our country, and, mostly, within this vital \nindustry. If we can get this right, we not only do service to our \npeople by protecting their privacy, as is our cultural and \nconstitutional tradition, we also do a great deal to reinforce public \nconfidence in the Internet, cyberspace, as a new arena of economic \ncommerce and competition. We can bring the Internet to reach its true \neconomic potential.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while legislation is not presently pending \nbefore the Senate, I understand that the leadership intends to soon \ncall up an education proposal by Senator Coverdell, a tax cut that \nwould allow families with an adjusted gross income of up to $95,000 for \nsingle filers, $150,000 for joint filers, to make contributions to \nindividual retirement accounts up to $2,000 per child for K-12 \neducation expenses, including private school tuition, during the tax \nperiods from the year 2000 to 2003. As I understand it, the revenue \nloss of this proposal is somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.3 billion. \nI believe I am correct in so characterizing this proposal.\n  First of all, I am somewhat surprised this legislation is coming up \nat this time. We are about a week away from the education committee of \nthe Senate reporting out, I hope, a bill on elementary and secondary \neducation. We are required under law to authorize the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act once every 5 years. That bell actually tolled \nlast year but obviously we are still in this Congress, so we have an \nobligation to report to our colleagues our thoughts and solutions on \nthe needs in elementary and secondary education in this country. The \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, of which I am a \nmember, has held something in the neighborhood of 20 to 25 hearings \nover the last year and a half on this legislation, and I have listened \nto literally dozens and dozens of witnesses about how we can do a \nbetter job improving the quality of education in this country.\n  I know in the last week or so, in surveys done by polling operations \nthat are both of the Democratic persuasion and the Republican \npersuasion, they have indicated what most of us knew already, that \neducation is the single most important issue the American public thinks \nwe need to address. I think the numbers were 38 percent of the American \npublic listed education as the lead priority issue that Congress ought \nto deal with, on which the American people would like to see us focus \nmore attention. Education placed higher than the public's concerns \nabout Social Security and Medicare by some three points, and health \ncare by seven points. Those were the top three responses: education, \nSocial Security, and Medicare, and health care generally, with \neducation surpassing those concerns with some 38 percent.\n  It is appropriate this Congress deal with education. What I am \nstunned by is that 1 week away from action by the major committee \ncharged with the responsibility of dealing with education issues, the \nleadership has decided to bring up the Coverdell bill rather than \nwaiting for the committee product to come out, after having waited now \na year and a half for it. So on one level I am disappointed that the \nleadership has decided to bring up this legislation prior to the \neducation committee's\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\nmarkup of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Further, I take particular issue with the legislation that will soon \nbe before us, the Coverdell proposal. I have a lot of respect for my \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, but he and I have \nsignificant disagreements on some issues, and on this one particularly. \nLet me inform my colleagues what this bill would do. Obviously, a tax \nbreak designed to help defray the costs of education for grades K-12 \nsounds very good. It is a lot of money, $1.3 billion. But let me \nexplain specifically how this legislation would actually impact \npeople's tax obligations.\n  According to a Joint Tax Committee report, which is an objective \ncommittee that is not supposed to take partisan issue with any \nparticular bill, the average benefit per child in public schools would \nbe $3 in the year 2001, $4.50 in the year 2002, and $6 in the year \n2003, reaching a high mark of $7 in the year 2004, or a total of $20.50 \nover 4 years. That is $1.3 billion in lost tax revenues to provide the \naverage taxpayer with $20.50 in tax relief. That is going to be the \nanswer to how we improve public education in this country, this \nlegislation purports.\n\n  No one is going to suggest that this Congress has a perfect record on \ntax cut proposals, but I noticed recently in a national survey that \nonly some 13 percent of the American public thought at this juncture a \ntax cut was necessary, that they would rather see us spend the surplus \nwe are accumulating, the non-Social Security surplus, on Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and educational needs in this country. While people \ncertainly like the idea of a tax cut, they like better the idea we are \nreducing our national debt. Shouldn't we be working to eliminate the \napproximately $220 billion in interest payments we pay each year on the \nnational debt? What greater gift could this generation give to future \ngenerations than ensuring their National Government would be free of \ndebt?\n  Almost without exception, Americans would rather we reduce our \nnational debt than receive $20.50 over 4 years for an educational tax \nbenefit proposal that is not going to do much at all. If your child is \nenrolled in a private school, $20.50 will provide very little \nassistance. The decision of whether or not to take $1.3 billion of \ntaxpayer's money and give people, on average, $20.50 as opposed to \npaying down the national debt or dealing with Medicare or dealing with \nbroader educational needs, I think is an easy one. I don't think we \nneed much persuasion--I hope--when these clear choices are before us.\n  Certainly with $20.50 we are not going to get smaller class sizes, \nwhich most Americans think is important. Certainly we are not going to \nget better qualified teachers, which most Americans think is important. \nThis legislation is not going to modernize crowded, old, and unsafe \nschool facilities. It is not going to wire these schools so students \nhave the advantage of the Internet and modern technology to better \nprepare them for their futures. It is certainly not going to help \nschool districts cope with the costs of special education.\n  There is an issue, however, that we do have the opportunity to do \nsomething about. If you want to take $1.3 billion and do something, and \nif paying down the national debt doesn't impress you, why not do \nsomething about special education costs? Why not take the $1.3 billion \nand apply that towards the Federal Government's commitment to local \ncommunities to help them meet their special education costs? Our \nrespective States know well the complaints of our mayors and our county \nexecutives, that the cost of special education is rising all of the \ntime. They also know the Federal Government made a commitment years ago \npledging 30 to 40 percent of the cost of special education services.\n  The Federal Government has never gotten above 13 percent of that \ncommitment. If we want to do something meaningful for our communities, \nbe they Colorado or Connecticut, if we want to spend this money on \neducation, why not return the money to our States and allow them to \nmeet the costs of special education? I promise you, there is not a \nmayor in this country, there is not a county executive in this country, \nthere is not a school board in this country that would not applaud a \ndecision by this body to provide some meaningful help on defraying the \ncosts of special education. Believe me, if the choice is one between \nhelping our local school districts or giving $20.50 over 4 years as a \ntax break to the people in their communities, they will take the \nspecial education option every time.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to the underlying bill. At the first \nopportunity, I am going to offer an amendment that will take the $1.3 \nbillion and apply it to special education and lets us do something \nmeaningful in our respective States.\n  Let me share with my colleagues the background on the special ed \nproposal.\n  In my view, it is a waste of fiscal resources to be spending $1.3 \nbillion on this minor tax break, $20.50 over 4 years. One cannot buy \nhamburgers for a family of four at MacDonald's or Burger King with this \namount of money. As I said earlier, however, these funds can make a \ndifference in the area of special education. Let's take a look at how \nmy proposal will make a difference.\n  It will strengthen public schools by assisting them with the very \nhigh cost of special education. Upon enactment of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act in 1975, the Federal Government committed to \nState and local school districts that it would contribute 40 percent of \nthe funds needed to provide special education services. Twenty-five \nyears ago we made that commitment.\n  Presently, the Federal contribution to special education is 12.7 \npercent of the total special education costs. The Federal Government \ntoday would need to boost its IDEA funding an estimated $15.7 billion \nto live up to its original commitment. I am not suggesting $1.3 billion \nis going to get us to the 40 percent level, but it would be a major \nstep in the right direction.\n  The amendment that I plan to offer will redirect the $1.3 billion \nover 4 years that the Coverdell amendment applies, to aid State and \nlocal school districts in providing the critically important special \neducation services that children with disabilities deserve. This \nproposal will truly do something for our communities, I suggest to my \ngood friend, the Presiding Officer, in his wonderful State of Colorado \nand my State of Connecticut. This will truly make a difference. This \nproposal will strengthen these local school districts.\n  I believe it is better for us to take this money, which the Coverdell \nlegislation will take out of general revenues of the Treasury, and \napply it to something for which our constituents and our communities \nwill be grateful. Mr. President, $20.50 does not put a dent in our real \neducation needs.\n  I emphasize, again--and this is the first point I made--I am somewhat \ndisappointed we are bringing up this proposal just days away from the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions reporting out its \nbill on the elementary and secondary education proposals, as we have \ndone historically over the years. But 5 or 6 days before the committee \nacts, after all the hearings the committee has held, all the time that \nhas been invested by Republicans and Democrats on the committee who \ncare about education and have listened to people from across the \ncountry offering their suggestions on how we can best improve the \nquality of education, it is a great pity, in my view, that we are going \nto disregard that exercise and come right to the floor with a tax-cut \nproposal that does little or nothing to improve the quality of \neducation in our country.\n  At the appropriate time, I will offer an amendment that will require \nthis $1.3 billion to go directly to our school districts, to our \ncommunities, to provide the financial support they can use, given the \nhigh cost of special education in communities all across the country, \nand help us get closer to fulfilling that commitment we made 25 years \nago of meeting 40 percent of the costs of special education.\n\n  I have offered this amendment in the past. This amendment has had \nbipartisan support. When I offered this amendment in 1994, the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, supported the amendment, as did Senators Gorton \nand Jeffords. However, eventually we came short of the majority \nnecessary to adopt the amendment.\n  In fact, the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, to his \ngreat credit, when he and I served together on\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\nthe Budget Committee years ago supported a similar amendment to the one \nI'm proposing today. When I offered an amendment in the Budget \nCommittee that would require that over a number of years we increase \nthe federal contribution to special education to 40-percent, it \nunfortunately fell on a tie vote.\n  As some people are aware, the Federal Government commits only 7 cents \non the dollar to fund elementary and secondary education services in \nthis country. Seven cents on the dollar is what we do; 93 cents on the \ndollar comes from the States and local governments, and most funding \nfor education comes from local taxation.\n  My proposal offers a way for the Federal Government to provide some \nreal tax relief at the local level for special education costs that \nthese communities must raise in order to meet their obligations under \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  I am hopeful that, while this amendment has not been adopted in the \npast, given the choice between a $20.50 tax break over 4 years and \ntaking $1.3 billion and sending it back to our communities to help them \nmeet their special education costs, this amendment may prevail this \ntime. Our children with disabilities and our communities deserve our \nsupport. I then hope we can move on to the real business of continuing \nour work on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S716-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hope when the Senate resumes the bill \ntomorrow, that all amendments will be relevant to the education savings \naccount issue. I intend to ask that our Democratic colleagues at a \nlater time agree to that. In the meantime, I expect vigorous discussion \ntoday about this very important education issue and how we can all have \nan opportunity to be helpful to our children in K through 12th grades.\n  In light of the agreement, there will be no votes during today's \nsession. I remind Members that a rollcall vote is scheduled to occur \ntomorrow at 11:30 a.m. on the Iran Nonproliferation Act. There is a \nlikelihood that there will be more votes Thursday afternoon, perhaps on \nExecutive Calendar items. We will notify Members of any nominations \nthat might be considered. If votes are required, then we will notify \nMembers on both sides of the aisle exactly what time that would occur.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We are very grateful that we have an opportunity to talk \nabout education. There are many things that we need to talk about as it \nrelates to education. Certainly, this is a step in the right direction.\n  I personally believe very strongly about the fact that in America we \nhave 3,000 children dropping out of high school every day--3,000 \nchildren who are going to be less than they could be. I think we need \nto do something about that.\n  On a number of occasions we have attempted to move legislation \nforward that would help create a dropout czar in the Department of \nEducation to adopt some of the educational programs that are working \naround the country.\n  We in Nevada are particularly concerned with the dropout rate. We \nhave the dubious distinction of leading the Nation in the rate of high \nschool dropouts. We really need to do something about that. This \nproblem is making our country less productive. It is making the State \nof Nevada less productive. For this reason alone, I think it is \nimportant that we start talking about education.\n  I do say that on the education savings account issue--of which there \nwill be some discussion today by the ranking member of the Education \nLabor Committee, who will talk in more detail about this--but as the \nSenator from Massachusetts knows, we could take all these programs, \nincluding education savings accounts, and lump them together, and very \nfew people would be helped. We need something to help public education \ngenerally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we have failed to \nobtain a unanimous consent agreement to limit amendments with respect \nto S. 1134, the Affordable Education Act. I hope that we will move \ntowards passage of this very significant bill. The importance of giving \nAmerican families the resources and means they need to educate their \nchildren must be above politics.\n  I will soon take a few minutes to walk through the various provisions \nof the bill. But before I get into the specifics, let me remind my \ncolleagues that all of the concepts in this bill should be very \nfamiliar.\n  This bill is an A+ for American education. Its concepts should be \nfamiliar because we have already endorsed them. The base provisions in \nthe bill--which include the increase in the maximum allowable \ncontribution to an education IRA, the use of the IRA for elementary and \nsecondary school expenses for public and private schools, the tax-free \ntreatment of State-sponsored prepaid tuition plans, and the extension \nof tax-free treatment for employer-provided educational assistance--all \nreceived bipartisan support from the Finance Committee in the Senate as \npart of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  Despite this Senate support, these provisions were dropped from the \nbill during conference negotiations. Because of opposition from the \nadministration, these particular elements failed to be included in the \nfinal version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  In addition, these proposals were included in legislation sent to the \nPresident in 1998. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that \nlegislation.\n  These bipartisan proposals were included in the Taxpayer Refund and \nRelief Act of 1999, which passed last year. Unfortunately, the \nPresident vetoed that legislation, as well.\n  But we must not lose heart. The cause of affordable education is too \nimportant. I hope this time we can succeed for the American people.\n  We are here today to show our commitment to affordable education and \nto enact what this body determines makes good sense for American \nfamilies.\n  It is important to note that this tax bill is not designed to answer \nall the education-related issues that face this country. Many issues \nare too varied and complicated to be addressed by the Federal \nGovernment. They need to be solved at the State and local level--by \nschools, by teachers, and by parents working together.\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\n  Instead, this bill is designed to build on the innovative concepts \nthat have been introduced in the last few years. Our goal is to fix the \nTax Code so that it provides the necessary incentives to help American \nfamilies help their children. These are much needed tools.\n  From 1992 through 1998, tuition at a 4-year college increased by 234 \npercent. During that period, the average student loan increased by 367 \npercent. In contrast, median household income rose only 82 percent \nduring that period and the Consumer Price Index rose only 74 \npercent. Our students, our families, need these resources to help them \nmeet the costs and realize the opportunities of a quality education. I \nhope my colleagues continue to recognize just how important they \nremain. The American people are counting on us.\n\n  Let me take a few minutes to describe the various provisions of the \nbill, to provide an overview, and to highlight some reasons these \nmeasures are so important.\n  As I already mentioned, the bill increases the maximum education IRA \ncontribution from $500 to $2,000. That increase is important on two \nlevels. First, with the well-documented increase in education costs, it \nis essential that we provide American families with the resources to \nmeet these costs.\n  I have long argued that it is essential to change the savings habits \nof the American people. There are few things more important than the \neducation of their children. Not only will saving in this way increase \nour investment capital, it will increase Americans' education capital \nas well. Anything that thwarts either of these objectives is \nshortsighted.\n  By using the Tax Code to encourage individual responsibility for \npaying for educational expenses, we all benefit. The expansion of the \neducation IRA will result in greater opportunities for individuals to \nsave for their children's education.\n  Besides being too low to give parents the necessary resources to pay \nfor the cost of education, the current $500 limit fails from another \npractical perspective. As we all know, any banker or broker who \nprovides an IRA account faces assorted administrative costs for each \naccount. To ensure they can adequately cover their administrative \ncosts, most brokers or banks impose a minimum account balance, and in \nmany cases the maximum balance has been set well higher than $500. That \nreality of the marketplace has the effect of limiting the availability \nof the educational IRA to American families.\n  Another reality is that confronted by a $500 limit. Many mutual fund \ncompanies find it is not worth their while to spend money on marketing \nthe educational IRA. It is a fact of life that regardless of what we \nsay or do in Congress, many families only know about the benefits of an \neducational IRA through the marketing efforts of their local mutual \nfund companies and banks. These businesses have been very successful in \nmarketing IRAs with the higher contribution limit. If we want to \nmaximize the involvement of American families in education IRAs, we \nneed to ensure that the accounts make economic sense from the \nperspective of the companies offering them.\n  The next major change this bill makes to education IRAs is that it \nallows withdrawals for education expenses for elementary and secondary \nschools and for both private and public schools.\n  As we recognized last year, it is a fundamental principle that a \nparent should have the right and the ability to make decisions about \nhis or her child's education, to decide basic questions such as how the \nchild shall be educated and where the child should attend school.\n  In 1997, for example, when Congress passed a variety of provisions \ntargeted to higher education, we made no distinction between private \nand public schools.\n  We did not say, for instance, that an education IRA or a HOPE \nscholarship would only be available if a student attended public \nschool. We did not say that a student who attended the University of \nMaryland would receive a tax benefit but a student who attended George \nWashington University would receive nothing.\n  This bill recognizes that, just as for higher education, we should \nnot establish a priority system where some elementary and secondary \nschools are favored over others. We should not forget that it is the \ntaxpayer who funds the educational IRA, that it is the parent who puts \nhis or her hard-earned money into the education IRA.\n\n  It seems a matter of common sense, therefore, that the parent should \nbe able to choose how to spend that money and the parent should be able \nto choose where to send their children to school.\n  Moreover, parents with students in elementary and secondary school \nneed our help to cope with the costs. It is simply not true that only \nrich kids attend private elementary or secondary schools. For instance, \nrecent data from the National Catholic Education Association indicate \nthat almost 70 percent of the families with children in Catholic \nschools have income below $35,000, and almost 90 percent of those \nfamilies have incomes below $50,000. Why should those children not have \naccess to these accounts?\n  Another provision in this bill makes State-sponsored prepaid tuition \nplans tax free, not simply tax deferred. This is a significant \ndistinction because it allows students to withdraw the savings that \naccumulate in their prepaid tuition accounts without paying any tax at \nall. That means more money for children's education. It also means \nparents have the incentive to put money away today, and their children \nhave the full benefit of that money without any tax tomorrow.\n  As I have already mentioned, at least 43 States have prepaid tuition \nplans in effect. This means most Members of the Senate have parents and \nstudents back home who either benefit from the plan right now or will \nbenefit from the plan soon. I am pleased to see my home State of \nDelaware has already acted in this area. Delaware parents can now save \nfor college on a tax-deferred basis. But if this bill becomes law, \nthese Delaware families will be able to save for a child's college \neducation on a tax-free basis.\n\n  The prepaid provision also covers networks of private college plans. \nThis will enable still more parents and more students to save for \ncollege.\n  The Finance Committee bill also extends tax-free treatment of \nemployer-provided educational assistance for graduates and \nundergraduates through June 30, 2004.\n  This particular program is a time-tested and widely used benefit for \nworking families. Over 1 million workers across America receive tax-\nfree employer-provided education. This allows them to stay on the \ncutting edge of their careers. It benefits not only them individually \nbut their employers and, of course, the economy as a whole. With the \nconstant innovation and advancing technology of our society, it is \nvitally important that we continue this program.\n  The Finance Committee hearings demonstrated the crushing debt burden \nfaced by students coming out of college. I can tell you about this debt \nburden from Delaware families. I am sure I am not alone. To this end, \nthe Finance Committee restores the student loan interest deduction in \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. This bill goes another step further \nand simplifies and expands the deduction for more students.\n  The Finance Committee does even more than address the cost of \nattending school. In response to concerns from Members on both sides of \nthe aisle, the Finance Committee agreed on some measures to provide \nrelief in the area of school construction.\n  The first provision is directed at innovative financing for school \ndistricts. It expands the tax-exempt bond rules for public-private \npartnerships set up for the construction, renovation, or restoration of \npublic school facilities in these districts. In general, it allows \nStates to issue tax-exempt bonds equal to $10 per State resident. Each \nState would be guaranteed a minimum allocation of at least $5 million \nof these tax-exempt bonds. In total, up to $600 million per year in new \ntax-exempt bonds would be issued for these innovative school \nconstruction projects.\n  This provision is important because it retains State and local \nflexibility. It does not impose a new bureaucracy on the States. It \ndoes not force the Federal Government to micromanage school \nconstruction.\n  The provision is also important because it promotes the use of \npublic-private partnerships. Many high growth school districts may be \ntoo poor or too\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\noverwhelmed to take on a school construction project itself. But with \nthese bonds, these districts can partner with a private entity and \nstill enjoy the benefits of tax-exempt financing.\n  It is worth noting that there already is a significant Federal \nsubsidy for school construction. Under current law, States and \nlocalities can issue debt that is exempt from Federal taxation. This \nbenefit allows them to finance school construction by issuing long-term \nbonds at a lower cost than they otherwise could.\n  Moreover, the evidence shows that States and localities are taking \nadvantage of this benefit. In the first 6 months of 1996, voters have \napproved $13.3 billion in school bonds, an increase of more than $4 \nbillion over the first 6 months of 1995. The bottom line is that many \nStates and localities are doing their homework, passing bonds, building \nand renovating schools, and enjoying favorable treatment under the \nexisting Tax Code. They are doing all this without significant Federal \ninvolvement.\n\n  I do not have to remind colleagues that school construction has \nalways been the province of State and local governments. President \nClinton himself stated in 1994 that the construction and renovation of \nschool facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of State \nand local governments, financed primarily by local taxpayers. In that \nrespect, I agree with the President.\n  Well, there is a second bond provision in this bill. That provision \nis designed to simplify the issue of bonds for school construction. \nUnder current law, arbitrage profits earned on investment unrelated to \nthe purpose of the borrowing must be rebated to the Federal Government. \nHowever, there is an exception, generally referred to as the small \nissuer exception, which allows governments to issue up to $5 million of \nbonds without being subject to the arbitrage rebate requirement. We \nrecently increased this limit to $10 million for governments that issue \nat least $5 million of public school bonds during the year.\n  The provision in the Finance Committee bill increases the small \nissuer exception to $15 million, provided that at least $10 million of \nthe bonds are issued to finance public schools. This measure will \nassist localities in meeting school construction needs by simplifying \ntheir use of tax-exempt financing. At the same time, it will not create \nincentives to issue such debt earlier or in larger amounts than is \nnecessary. That is a type of targeted provision that I believe makes \ngood sense.\n  Finally, as we all know, the Tax Code is too complex. As chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, simplification of the Tax Code is one of my top \npriorities. This Finance Committee bill provides for coordination \nbetween education IRAs, prepaid tuition plans, the HOPE scholarship, \nand lifetime learning credits. This provision will mean that parents \nwill not lose the benefit of the HOPE scholarship and lifetime learning \ncredits when they use an education IRA or a prepaid tuition plan.\n  It is clear that the Finance Committee bill contains numerous \nimportant provisions for the American family.\n  As I have already said, many of these measures are ones the Senate \npassed last year. Anyone--students or parents--who is on the front line \ndealing with the cost of a quality education must have been \ndisappointed in 1997, in 1998, and in 1999 when the President failed to \nagree to give any student or parent all the tools they needed.\n  American families understand the need for these measures. American \nfamilies have now been waiting for several years. Let us not disappoint \nthem any further. Let's not keep them waiting any longer. Let's move \nforward. Let's pass the Finance Committee bill now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is now Wednesday, the 23rd of \nFebruary. It is just about a week after the President of the United \nStates sent his budget to the Congress where he outlined his request of \nthe Congress for a very extensive education priority--more than $4.5 \nbillion measured just in financial terms over the previous years--\nspecifying in great detail, the priorities he placed in strengthening \nour education system.\n  I think any American who listened to the President's State of the \nUnion Address would have to conclude that the President spoke for all \nAmericans when he said the primary priority for all Americans was in \nthe area of education and also that we ought to try to find \npartnerships where the Federal Government can work with the States and \nlocal communities in order to strengthen our K through 12 education \nsystem. Both the President and all of us in this Congress understand \nthat we have some very important pieces of legislation before the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. We will \nreauthorize the ESEA, a composite of different pieces of legislation, \nthat is primarily targeted in terms of the most disadvantaged children \nand children in greatest need.\n  I, as ranking minority member of the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, want to take this time now to commend our \nchairman, Senator Jeffords, for the time he has taken to try to examine \nand bring that legislation as a priority item to the floor of the \nSenate so we can take action. Even though we are in the Senate for a \nrelatively short period of time, we are going to have the opportunity \nto debate that legislation, which primarily is $8 billion, which is \nfocused on the neediest schools and poorest children.\n  There are other funds in terms of school construction. There are \nother funds in terms of math and science programs. There are additional \nfunds in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That has really \nbeen the vehicle on which I think most of us thought we would begin the \ndebate in this Congress on the issue of central importance to the \nAmerican people--on education.\n  I can say, as someone who has served on the education committee now \nfor 38 years, that we have had a remarkable sense of bipartisanship in \nworking through education. It has only been in the last 10 years we \nhave even voted in the committee. We had votes on the floor of the \nSenate. But by and large, under the leadership of Bob Stafford, a \nRepublican from the State of Vermont, under the leadership of Claiborne \nPell, a Democrat from Rhode Island, and even back to the period of \nLister Hill in the early 1960s when many of these pieces of legislation \nwere initially passed, we didn't really have a great deal of \npartisanship. It was understood that education was something on which \nwe freed ourselves from involving partisan disputes. It has only been \nin the most recent times we have had that.\n  That doesn't mean a good debate and discussion on education policy is \nnot helpful in terms of trying to find out the most sensible and \nresponsible ways we would proceed. But it does come as some surprise to \nthe members of our committee, quite frankly, that we have had some 20 \ndays of hearings and we are in the process of attempting to mark up \nthis major piece of legislation and bring it to the floor so we can \nhave a full debate and discussion on the measure.\n  Just to put this tax legislation in some perspective, the President's \nbudget in terms of education will be about $40 billion this year, $4.5 \nbillion over last year. The measure which is being offered on the floor \nof the Senate as the principal Republican measure comes to \napproximately $225 million per year--$1.2 billion over 5 years.\n  Not that you can't do a good deal with $1.2 billion over 5 years, but \nwhen we are talking about the magnitude of our involvement in terms of \nwhat the parents of this country have said they want to have happen in \ntheir local schools and local communities across this country, I am \nsomewhat amazed. I am amazed that the Republican leadership would \nrecommend--as they did and as is their power to do--that we are now \nconsidering this legislation of $1.2 billion over 5 years, $225 million \na year, that will provide an average benefit of $7 per family, \naccording to the Joint Tax Committee, which is neither Republican nor \nDemocrat.\n\n  We are now 4 weeks into the session, I can't believe we have any more \nimportant priority for the Senate than the issue of education. We \nshould be debating real solutions to real problems, such as overcrowded \nclassrooms, crumbling facilities and unsafe school buildings, and the \nlack of qualified teachers\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\nin classrooms, accountability for results, and adequate after-school \nopportunities.\n  We certainly have been waiting to debate the issue of health care. I \nlook forward to our meetings as a member of the conference committee on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights for next week. But that was long past in \nthe Senate last year. We were just about getting to it.\n  We still have not been willing to address a minimum wage increase for \nthe hardest working members. We always hear from the Republican \nleadership that we haven't the time to debate a 50-cent-per-hour \nincrease for minimum wage this year and 50 cents next year. We haven't \nthe time to debate that, although we are committed this afternoon to no \nvotes. We are not able to debate an increase in the minimum wage for \nthe 12 million Americans--mostly women benefit, mostly children \nbenefit, mostly men and women whose skin is not white benefit. We don't \nhave time to debate that. No. We haven't the time in the Senate to do \nit the fourth week into the session. No. We are going to debate this \nissue which is valid at $225 million--which we ought to be about \ndebating as well.\n  I want to review this very quickly. As I say, if we ask parents back \nhome what they are most concerned about, what comes out on every single \nreview about things that the parents are most concerned about, it is \ndiscipline and safety in the schools.\n  It is no surprise that under the most recent studies in 1999, the top \nconcerns of parents are safety and discipline in the schools--safety \nand discipline in the schools.\n  With the relatively small amount of resources we provide to local \ncommunities, 7 or 8 cents out of every dollar, what can we do in the \nSenate to help local communities have greater safety and discipline in \nthe schools? That is what parents are concerned about. That is what we \nwant to debate. It is on that which we want to call the roll. But no, \nwe will debate whether there will be tax provisions that benefit some, \nto the tune of $225 million, an average of $7 per family.\n  It is a shame to mention the polls because it is self-evident what \nparents want is a well-trained teacher in every classroom for their \nchildren. We don't need a poll for that. They want teachers who know \nhow to teach, who know the importance of support, and teacher mentors \nwho help in the classrooms. They want smaller class sizes. That is the \nway to deal with discipline. That is the way for academic achievement \nand accomplishment.\n  We can debate what the records are with the STAR programs in \nTennessee and other States that show significant academic achievement. \nWhy are we not supporting those? Why do we not take programs that \nbenefit children and replicate them? No, no, we have to debate this \nother piece of legislation, the $1.2 billion over 5 years. We cannot \ndebate class size, we cannot debate improving the quality of education, \nwe cannot debate afterschool programs, we cannot debate modernizing \nschools, we cannot debate how to assist special needs children. No, we \ncannot do that.\n  What do the various important bipartisan studies show? On the \npriorities for parents, No. 7 is creating educational savings accounts \nto help parents pay for educational expenses for children. That is what \nwe are debating.\n  No. 6, modernizing and rebuilding schools and wiring all classrooms \nfor computers and Internet. That is a priority--the digital divide. \nMake sure every public school will be included on the Internet; make \nsure all the curriculum will be adequate in order to be able to teach \nthese children; and to make sure the teachers know how to use that \ntechnology.\n  No. 5, establish national academic standards and tests for students. \nMore and more of the States are doing so. Almost all of the States have \ndone it in certain classes, even this year.\n  No. 4, reduce class size to 18 students in grades 1 through 3.\n  No. 3, increasing the salaries of teachers. Are we debating that this \nafternoon? No, we are talking about the IRAs for parents that will be \nvalued at $7 per family. We are not allowed to have any of these \namendments or vote on them this afternoon.\n  No. 2, train teachers in technologies, computers, and Internet.\n  No. 1, establish national certification standards for teachers, \nmeaning we will have good teachers in every classroom.\n  That is what American parents want. That is what the Democratic Party \nwants. That is what we ought to be debating on the floor of the Senate \nthis afternoon. It is on that which we ought to call the roll.\n  But no, no, we are working on priority No. 7, to create educational \nsavings accounts to help parents cover those expenses for the children.\n  I think this is a great tragedy this afternoon. If we accept the \nCoverdell bill this afternoon, I will not vote for it. I believe if we \nare going to have the $1.2 billion, it can be better spent getting more \nqualified teachers, smaller class sizes, afterschool programs, \ncomputers, special needs children.\n  If we pass the $1.2 billion program, it will not mean a single better \ntrained teacher in any classroom in this country. None. It will not \nmean a single smaller class. It will not be an afterschool program. It \nwill not provide help and assistance to special education needs \nchildren. It does not help any of the older schools that are crumbling. \nIt does not provide a new computer in a classroom. It does not make a \nschool safer. It does not stop overcrowding. It does not move children \nout of some of the trailers and into the classroom. It does not respond \nto what the General Accounting Office pointed out is the $112 billion \nneeded to make the basic schools livable in our society. We do not add \na nickel to any of those priorities. It does very little in terms of \nproviding help and assistance to the children in the public schools.\n  What are the various groups saying? Not that we ought to be dictated \nto by the various groups; we do not find real support from the primary \ngroups interested in working with the Congress. We can find some \nsupport if this were to be used in terms of higher education, as an add \non, but we do not find support from teachers; we do not find support in \nterms of the Chief State Schools Officers, or the Council of the Great \nSchools; we do not find support in terms of any of the special \neducation programs; we do not find support with the parents; we do not \nfind support with the school boards; we do not find support with a \nnumber of groups--I have a list of over 75.\n  My regret is that we are being denied the opportunity to get into the \nmore substantive matters that are of central importance to parents \nwhose children are going to the public schools.\n  We ought to have a good, sound debate about what we are going to do \nto have better trained teachers. With scarce resources, who wants to \nput funding into teachers, including the recruitment of teachers, the \ntraining of teachers, the holding of teachers, teacher mentoring and \nsupport for upgrading the skill of teachers--the whole range of \ndifferent suggestions that have been made primarily by those who are in \nthe teaching profession? We ought to be listening to those who entered \nthe profession. We ought to be debating those issues.\n  Smaller class size, we had good debate on that. We had some division \nwithin the body on that--the first time the Murray amendment was \nactually accepted. Republicans were falling over themselves trying to \naccept credit for it, and then fought it the next year. I do not know \nwhere they will be this year. But it makes a good deal of sense, and \nthe more evidence we get the more that is demonstrated.\n  We need to do more to help schools and communities develop \nconstructive afterschool activities to keep students off the streets, \naway from drugs, and out of trouble. These programs have been endorsed \nfrom an education point of view and a law enforcement point of view. \nFunding has been significantly increased in the President's proposal. \nThat is a legitimate proposal and we ought to debate whether we want \nscarce resources focused that way.\n  What are we going to do to make sure the neediest children in our \ncountry, those who come from the poorest areas of our country, have \naccess to computers? That is a matter of national technology. Are we \ngoing to take new technology, and at the end of 10 years, those who \nwent to schools that had the best in technology and teachers are going \nto be light-years ahead of another group of students, whose skin is \nprobably not white, who are from underserved areas? We ought\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\nto be debating that. Is that before us on the floor of the Senate?\n  There are Republicans and Democrats who have good views on this. We \nought to be working together to find out the solutions to these \nproblems. But, oh, no, we are just going to be debating this afternoon. \nWe are just going to be debating what is No. 7 in all of the polls, \ncreating educational accounts, something that is valued at $225 \nmillion.\n  I know probably our colleagues say: That may not be a lot to you, \nSenator. We don't want to bother with that answer. We know we are \nspending $40 billion this year in a Federal budget and now we are \nengaged in our first education debate, which is how we are going to \nspend $225 million of it.\n  Does that say something about what the leadership wants for debate \nand discussion on issues of education? I think it does.\n  We are prepared to meet with the chairman of our committee and follow \nthe committee process and come to the floor of the Senate with \nresponsible recommendations and to debate those until we are able to \nhave a resolution of those. But that process has been short-circuited, \nevidently, by the leadership of the Republican Party. They are \nbasically saying no to its chairman, the chairman of the education \ncommittee--no, we are not going to do it that way; we are going to do \nit some other way.\n  We are going to have to deal with what we are faced with, and I think \nthere are many more important educational proposals we ought to be \ndebating. We ought to be debating them this afternoon. We ought to be \ntaking rollcalls on these issues. They are of central concern.\n  Then we ought to move on to many of these other issues that have been \neffectively side-tracked. We cannot get a bankruptcy conference \nappointed because I have every intention to try to instruct the \nMembers, when they go to the conference on bankruptcy, they are to \nchange the provisions that have been included in the bankruptcy bill to \nmake sure the neediest American workers are going to get a fair \nincrease in the minimum wage. The majority leader will not call that \nup. We cannot deal with that.\n  We are putting off the Patients' Bill of Rights. We cannot begin the \ndebate and discussions on the prescription drug bill.\n  We have been watching these debates that have been taking place, \nDemocrats and Republicans. Many even in this Chamber have been in \nStates where seniors have been gathering together, talking about the \nimportance of a prescription drug benefit. We are not even able to get \na good debate and discussion on these measures in the Senate.\n  Four weeks into the session and this is our record so far: we have \nthe Marianas immigration bill which was passed overwhelmingly; we have \na nuclear waste bill, which is legislation that is going to be vetoed; \nand we have a conference report on bankruptcy. We have had 11 votes, \nincluding 3 nominations. It is already the end of February.\n  You cannot get away from where responsibility lies to address \nAmerica's agenda. On this side of the aisle we want to address the \nissues of education. We want to address the issues of health care. We \nwant to address the issues of prescription drugs for our senior \ncitizens. We want to address the issues that are of central concern to \nworking families. We are being denied that opportunity now, and we are \ngoing to continue to point out as we go through this legislative \nprocess each and every time that we are being denied. We are going to \nwork feverishly to try to do the Nation's business and not be denied \nbringing these matters up on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to point out that what we have \nbefore us is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. \nAs I said in my opening remarks, this bill does not answer all problems \nof education. I am not one to try to base what I do on what a \nparticular poll shows today or tomorrow. I am trying to help satisfy \nsome of the pressing educational problems facing America.\n  When I go home to my little State of Delaware, a matter of real \nconcern to families, whether their children are teenagers, in secondary \nor in grammar school, is how the family can afford to send their \nchildren to quality colleges. This is a key problem facing the typical \nAmerican family. Make no mistake about it. I defy any one of you to go \nhome and talk to parents, talk to your neighbors who have children. \nTime and again they will tell you how difficult it is to have the funds \nnecessary to pay for college education.\n  So I do not apologize for bringing this kind of legislation before \nus. This is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. \nI might say, we have had this legislation reported out since last May. \nI am pleased and delighted we are having the chance to debate and vote \non it. Yes, it does not settle the problems of teachers' training, the \nsize of classes, or many of the other matters mentioned by my \ndistinguished colleague from Massachusetts. I do not deny those are \nimportant problems, but they are matters within the jurisdiction of \nother committees. What I seek to do today is to bring to the Senate \nlegislation that will be most helpful to the typical American family, \nmeeting part of that great American dream of sending their children on \nto higher education.\n  We have purposely tried to devise the kind of program that takes \nadvantage of the miracle of compound interest. The question is not how \nmuch it costs the Government. The question is how much does this \nlegislation help the typical American family? We all know the miracle \nof compound interest. If families will start when their children are \nsmall, saving in educational IRAs, up to $2,000, this will provide \nsignificant resources, tremendous amounts of money to help them send \ntheir children to school.\n  Yes, this legislation does not answer all problems of education, nor \nwas it intended to. That is not within the jurisdiction of my \ncommittee. But I do say it does seek and will address some of the most \nimportant problems facing the American family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I begin by congratulating the Senator from \nDelaware for bringing this bill forward again, and the Senator from \nGeorgia, who is presently in the Chair, for having been the original \nauthor of this bill.\n  This is a very strong piece of legislation which, as the Senator from \nDelaware has so effectively pointed out, is absolutely critical to the \nparents of this country as they try to assure the one thing that is \nmost important in most parents' lifestyles in dealing with their kids, \nbeyond giving their kids love and a sense of how to deal with reality \nand a sense of values, and that is the ability to get a good education. \nThe ability to get a good education, once you get out of the public \nschool system in our country today, is tied, to a great extent, to your \nability to pay for that education. Postsecondary school education, even \nunder public school systems, can be extraordinarily expensive.\n  These college savings IRA accounts give parents more flexibility. In \nfact, there was an ad I saw on TV last night which brought home the \nreality of this so effectively. It showed a baby being born. The theme \nof the ad was: The first image that comes across the parents' minds is \nthe wonder of the baby. The second image that comes across the parents' \nminds is, $210,000 is flashed up on the screen because that is what it \nis going to cost to educate that child, to have that child, who was \njust born, go to college. The theme of the ad is: What am I going to do \nto pay that?\n  One way to address it is to pass this bill which was passed and, \nregrettably, rejected by the Democratic side of the aisle and the \nPresident. It is before us again so we can give parents some relief.\n  Nobody is claiming this is the entire rug or the entire makeup of the \nissue of how we address education. No one is claiming that this is the \nwhole quilt. This is one block within the quilt, one item of the quilt \nin how we improve education in this country today. It is an important \nitem, and it is an important statement to make that we, as a Congress, \nare going to, once again, put forward this initiative which we put \nforward last year as part of our efforts.\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\n  A couple of Members from the other side of the aisle have come to the \nfloor today and said they would rather debate something else. I guess \nthey do not think college education is that important. They think \nsomething else is more important.\n  One Member came to the floor today, the Senator from Connecticut, and \nsaid we need to debate special ed; we need to put more money into \nspecial ed. We should not be putting more money into this program; we \nshould be putting more money into special ed.\n  That is an unusual argument to hear from the other side of the aisle \nbecause there is a certain inconsistency and hollowness to that \nargument. Let's go through the numbers as to special ed and this \nCongress since the Republicans have taken over and since we have had a \nDemocratic President.\n  In 1997, the President sent up a budget. How much of an increase did \nhe have for special ed? He had a 12-percent increase. The Republican \nSenate made a commitment. It said: That's not enough; we have to \naddress special ed. We are going to put more dollars into special ed.\n  As a result, the Republican Congress put forward a 34-percent \nincrease in special ed. Why was that? Because we see special ed as \nbeing the single largest unfunded mandate, outside the environmental \narea, this country has. Originally, the agreement was, the Federal \nGovernment was going to pay 40 percent of the cost of special ed. When \nthe Congress became Republican, the cost that was being paid by the \nFederal Government was 6 percent, and it had not been improved at all \nby the Democratic Congress or by a Democratic Presidency.\n\n  We made a commitment as a Republican Congress that we were going to \nget that spending up so more special ed dollars would flow back to the \nStates, so we could fulfill our obligations under special ed of paying \na larger percentage of that 40 percent, so local dollars could be freed \nup for the purposes of spending them on local priorities rather than \nhaving local dollars spent paying the Federal share of special ed.\n  As I said, in 1997 the Democratic leadership in this Congress, and \nthrough its President, proposed a 12-percent increase in special ed. We \nraised special ed spending by $783 million that year, or 34 percent. I \nam pointing this out because the Senator from Connecticut said we have \nto spend more money on special ed; we should not be talking about this \nprogram on the floor; more money should go to special ed. I think that \nrings hollow in light of these numbers.\n  In 1998, the President put forward a budget with a 4-percent increase \nin special ed funding. That is essentially enough to pay for all the \nsalaries of all the administrators they want to put on the books. The \nSenate increased special ed spending that year under a Republican \ninitiative by 22 percent, $698 million.\n  In 1999, it was the same story. The President sent us a budget \nsupported by the Democratic leadership. How much of an increase did \nthey ask for in special ed spending? This time they asked for a .03-\npercent increase in special ed funding.\n  The Republican majority said: No, that is not acceptable; we are \ngoing to increase special ed funding again. We increased it over the \nbaseline by 13 percent in 1999, $510 million.\n  Again, in the year 2000, this year, the President increased special \ned funding by what? Seven percent. We said: No, that is not acceptable; \nmore special ed dollars are needed to meet the obligation of the 40-\npercent commitment we made. So the Republican Senate, with a Republican \ninitiative of this Congress, increased special ed funding by $678 \nmillion last year for a 15.7-percent increase.\n  The total increase under the Republican leadership in this Congress \nin special ed funding has been over 100 percent since the year 1997. We \nhave gone from $2.6 billion up to over $5 billion we are projecting in \nthis coming year in special ed funding.\n  The proposals coming from the other side of the aisle--and we just \nheard this presentation that said we should be spending more on special \ned--were to increase special ed funding over that period by essentially \nnothing.\n  The Republican majority has taken the issue of special ed funding. We \nhave fulfilled an obligation. We are moving toward full funding of that \nobligation made by this Congress in 1976 when the special ed bill was \nfirst passed, and as a result we are doing what should be done, which \nis to fund special ed at an aggressive level, something which we have \nnot seen coming from the other side of the aisle or from the \nadministration.\n  When I hear folks come to this floor and say we should not be taking \nup this bill, we should be funding special ed, there is, I think, a \ncertain hollowness to that argument.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts argued we ought to be taking up this \nitem of education, that item of education, another item of education, \nand why haven't we taken up all these items of education; we have not \ndone anything in this Congress, including minimum wage.\n  I note, the bankruptcy bill did have minimum wage in it, which we \npassed, which the Senator, I guess, does not like, and that is why he \nconsiders we have not taken it up. The fact is, all the educational \nitems he has listed are presently moving through committee and will be \ndiscussed in committee and then will be brought to the floor, as the \nSenator knows.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is on the verge of being \nmarked up in committee. In fact, I think the Senator probably, as of \ntoday or maybe tomorrow, will be putting together his amendments and \nwill be getting ready for a major markup of that bill the first week in \nMarch, which will take up almost all the issues he outlined as not \nbeing addressed by this Congress.\n  Would he want us to skip the committee and just bring that bill to \nthe floor without any committee action? As a senior member on the \nDemocratic side of that committee, I seriously doubt that. That bill is \nnot being vetted in committee. I cannot imagine the Senator would want \nthose issues, which are very complex, very important, and involve \nsubstantive discussions of education policy, to be thrown out on the \nfloor without committee action. But that seems to be what he is \nsuggesting, that we should have just thrown the bill before the Senate \nrather than putting it through the proper committee procedure and \ntaking action on it, which is what he has proposed. He knows it is \ngoing to be taken up in committee and then brought before the Senate \nand worked on I suspect for a week or a week and a half, maybe 2 weeks.\n  Why is this bill being considered? Because this bill has gone through \nthe committee process. The chairman of the committee which has \njurisdiction over this piece of legislation is presenting the bill. \nThat is why it is here.\n  If the ESEA bill was ready, it could be brought to the floor, but the \nESEA bill isn't ready. It will be ready fairly soon. It is going to be \none heck of a good bill on which to debate education policy. I will not \ndeny that.\n  The differences between our side of the aisle and the other side of \nthe aisle on the issue of elementary and secondary education in this \ncountry are fairly significant. We happen to think after you have spent \n$100 billion on a program, and kids can be shown to have obtained \nabsolutely nothing from that money, that you have children essentially \nwho are still locked into failure, where low-income kids are still \ngetting the same terrible education children got 20 years ago.\n  Even though we have spent $100 billion on education, unfortunately, \nthe children with whom we started out 20 years ago in this program have \nended up coming through a system which has failed them. We are still \nsticking kids into that system. We are still running them through that \nsystem, the same way it has always been--counting bureaucrats instead \nof counting results; not focusing on the child but, rather, focusing on \nsystems. That is a failure; no question about it. We are going to get \nto discuss that failure at some length on this floor, as we will in \ncommittee. That is going to be a big issue.\n  But to simply bring the ESEA out here and throw it on the floor, as \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, the ranking member, seems to be \nimplying we should do before we take up this bill, abandons the \nlegislative process.\n  The legislative process relative to this bill has worked. It has gone \nthrough committee. It has actually gone through committee and through\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\nthe Senate and it has been vetoed. Now it is back on the floor. Having \ngone through the committee, it has come back to the floor to be heard \nagain. It makes sense that we should be taking up this bill.\n  I think the arguments by the Senator from Massachusetts, as much as I \nrespect his understanding of the legislative process--he is one of the \npeople in the Senate who knows the most about the legislative process \nand has been here the longest of anyone, I guess, other than Senator \nThurmond and Senator Byrd. He understands the legislative process, and \nI am a little surprised, I guess, that he would make the \nrepresentations he did relative to why this bill is on the floor versus \nthe other issues he outlined as being his preference for being \nconsidered on the floor.\n  We will get to those other issues. We will get to them aggressively. \nWe will have a full debate. It is going to be a very energized debate. \nThere will be a lot of differences of opinion. It will be good for this \ncountry because the education debate needs to be aired on this floor \nwith intensity and with a full hearing because it is such a critical \nissue for our Nation.\n  But as of right now, the bill on which we are ready to proceed is \nthis bill. In my opinion, we should not have a lot of ``straw dogs'' \nput up in the face of it. Let's pass this bill. It is good for parents, \nit is good for kids who want to go to college, and as a result it will \nbe good for the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to respond to my good friend from \nNew Hampshire, when we came back to the whole question of special \neducation, I listened carefully to his remarks. And his remarks have a \ncertain hollow echo, as well.\n  I remember when the Republicans offered their $780 billion tax break \na year ago. I offered an amendment that would have funded every special \neducation program for 10 years. It would have reduced the $780 \nRepublican tax reduction by a fifth. Every Member of the body on the \nother side of the aisle voted against it.\n  So with all due respect, that proposal made a good deal of sense. \nEvery Member on the Democratic side of the aisle said: It is more \nimportant to fund the special education needs of every special \neducation program across this country, over the next 10 years, than to \nhave a tax break. Every Republican voted against that. So with all due \nrespect, we ought to at least begin to remember our history on this \nparticular provision.\n  I listened to my friend from Delaware talk about the two different \nprovisions. He talked about the educational IRAs, which my remarks were \ndirected at, and then he talked about the section 127 provisions which \nprovide the education assistance for undergraduate and graduate \nstudies, and also about the prepaid tuition plans. Those are in the \nadministration's budget.\n  I see both my friend from Georgia as well as Senator Wellstone \nwaiting to speak. But if there had been more time, I was going to \nreview what has been done with regard to President Clinton and this \nCongress over the last 7 years in terms of offering educational \nopportunities. There has not been an administration in the last 30 \nyears that has done a better job in terms of opening up and being \nresponsive to the needs of students. It is a very proud record.\n  So those particular provisions of what they call the extenders of \nvarious tax provisions are going to be worthwhile to work out in a \nbipartisan way. Certainly there will be credit for all those who are \ngoing to be involved in it later on. But the principal proposal which \nhas been advanced, the education IRAs, which was discussed earlier as a \nvehicle for strengthening and improving public education, it does seem \nto me that the American people want a debate and discussion, in a \ncomprehensive way, about how we are going to strengthen public \neducation, and what the Federal Government is going to do, and what the \nStates are going to do, and what the local communities are going to do.\n  Whatever we do in the Congress, I think there are certain priorities \nwhich the public has. They want to know how we are going to ensure that \nthere will be a well-trained teacher in every classroom? They want \nsmaller class sizes, particularly in the earlier grades. They want to \nmake sure we have afterschool programs. They want to make sure we are \ngoing to have mentors and supporters for those teachers, particularly \nthose who serve in underserved areas. They want to make sure we have \nthe technology, and the curriculum with that technology, and well-\ntrained teachers to use that technology.\n  They want us to be sensitive to the digital divide so we do not use \ntechnology to open up a whole new spread between the haves and have-\nnots. They want to make sure there is parental involvement. They want \nto make sure there is access to continuing education through college \nand that there is continuing training programs which will be necessary \nfor the new jobs of the new century.\n  I believe they want us to give emphasis and focus in terms of early \neducation, including the expansion of the Head Start Program for \nchildren up to 3 years of age, on which this administration has placed \nemphasis, along with a number of Senators, in a bipartisan way, \nincluding Senators Stevens and Dodd.\n  They want us, at the end of the day when we pass the legislation, to \nbe able to answer the question: What did this legislation mean in terms \nof my son or my daughter? Whether it is a question of security in the \nclassroom or whether it is access to guns getting into the classrooms. \nThey want to have a comprehensive way of being able to say, look, there \nis some legislation. It isn't going to answer all of the problems. It \nisn't going to do everything, but at least it is something. We stand in \nsupport of those individuals who want to use scarce resources at the \nnational level to pump into this priority. Those are the people we want \nto see successful and we want to support. That is very reasonable.\n  With a budget of some $40 billion and a $225 million program dealing \nwith what will mean $7 per family to go to school, the idea that we are \ndoing anything meaningful for families in this country who are \ninterested and concerned about educating their kids is a disservice to \nthe American people and a disservice to this process. That is why I \nhave risen.\n  I see my colleague and friend from Georgia and Senator Wellstone. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia wants to \nspeak. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to follow the Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chair.\n  The good Senator from Massachusetts and I find ourselves, once again, \nin a prolonged discussion about tax policy that affects education. I \nhave several comments to make with regard to that. Before I outline the \nreach of the legislation, I will respond to several remarks made by the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  First, the Senator from Massachusetts indicated that the President's \nbudget had $4.5 billion in new funding for education and that we are \ndebating something that is worth some $200 million over 5 years. My \ndata does not match his. Actually, in 5 years this legislation would \nuse tax policy to relieve taxpayers, whether they are parents or \nemployers or people who are in a State tuition program. It would be \n$4.3 billion in the first 5 years and almost $8 billion over 10 years.\n  They really are apples and oranges. What we are debating is the \nrelief of tax policy on top of what will ultimately become an increase \nin the education budget. In fact, if you are going to do it that way, \nyou have to add these figures to what the President and the Congress \nultimately decide is going to be the increase in the education budget, \nremembering that last year the Congress' increase in education was \ngreater than the President's.\n  It is not accurate to refer to one section of the bill we are \ndebating. You have to refer to the entire section, A. And, B, they are \nnot comparable figures. One is a discussion about how much of an \nincrease you will have in the President's or the congressional budget \nfor education, in addition to\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\nwhich, this is a proposal to significantly leave tax dollars in the \nhands of parents, employers, and students to help them pay for \neducation, in addition to whatever the Federal Government is \ncontributing.\n  That is a major disparity in our presentation of the numbers.\n  This is the third time, in essence, we have debated this. We hear \nthis number, that this is only worth $7 to a family. When you leave it \nthere, you distort the picture. Remember, the Senator from \nMassachusetts complimented the administration and the Congress, and I \ndo as well, for the fact that we have already passed a $500-per-year \nsavings account for higher education. This one section of this bill \ntakes that proposal from $500 per year to $2,000, and it is for higher \neducation or elementary education.\n  My question to the Senator is this: Under that logic, if this \nproposal is only worth $7 per family, then the President's proposal is \nonly worth about $2.25 because what he and we have done so far is only \none-quarter of what we are proposing to do here. If it is \ninsignificant, why are we so tangled about it?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I answer the Senator?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Certainly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In my earlier address, I was using figures provided by \nthe committee. I will refer to them and include them now, the \nAffordable Education Act of 1999. I look over at the estimated budget \neffects of the Affordable Education Act of 1999, as approved by the \nSenate Committee on Finance, May 19, 1999. I read it out to the year \n2004, and it is $1.156 billion. That is what we are basically talking \nabout in terms of the IRAs.\n  As I indicated earlier, you have some extenders with regard to \ngraduate education which are in the President's program and \nundergraduate. If you want to add all of those programs in to get up \ncloser to your $4 billion figure, that is fine. My point is, you have \nyour $1.5 billion which comes to $225 million for the IRA, which comes \nto what I have talked about as $7 per family. I do think there is a \nbetter way of using the $1.5 billion than providing that kind of \nbenefit to families that, according to the Joint Tax Committee, is $7 a \nfamily.\n  The other provisions about which I should have been more precise are \nincluded in the broad scope mentioned by Senator Roth, which basically \nare a continuation of what they call tax extenders about which there is \nreally no debate. This debate, primarily on Coverdell, has been about \nthe creation of $1.2 billion, $230 million a year, effectively, for \nfamilies, which would amount to $7 per family, whether we think that is \nthe best way in terms of education policy. That is what I was getting \nat.\n\n  The pages are not numbered, but I will be glad to share those with my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate that. I think we are getting close to a \ncommon line. My point was that the legislation we are debating has a \nvalue of $4.3 billion. It is apart from the President's proposed budget \nor what the Congress is going to do. This is in addition to whatever \nthe Congress and the President decide, A. And, B, I don't think it is \nplausible to attack a $2,000-a-year savings account because of the $7 \nfigure, with which I take some exception. If you want to use it, that \nmeans what we have done is only worth $2.25 under the President's \nproposal, which is only $500 per year.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts alluded in his remarks to a partisan \ndebate. This is not a partisan debate on the proposal from the Finance \nCommittee. It was passed out with Republican and Democrat Members. The \nprincipal cosponsor of the legislation is Senator Robert Torricelli \nfrom New Jersey, the principal cosponsor and a member of the Democratic \nParty in good standing. In addition, there are some 8 to 10 other \nDemocrats who are on that side of the aisle in the Senate and are very \nsupportive of this legislation.\n\n  I was pleased by the Senator's remarks when he said the President has \nbecome interested in K through 12 because I really believe that is \nwhere the crisis in American education is. I am glad we are now talking \nabout the same target. The crisis is not in higher education; it is K \nthrough 12. It is, in fact, the 30 and 40 percent of our students who \nare coming out of high school and are not effective readers and can't \nwrite well.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts referred to polling data and listed \nsome seven items that this particular poll enumerated as important. At \none point, he said parents are not supportive of this. But in his own \npoll, the sixth or seventh most important desire on the part of parents \nwas this.\n  Many of the items in the poll that he cites are not in the \njurisdiction of the Federal Government. We can debate that, and we have \nbeen debating that, for some time. Some of us would find some of those \nproposals not in our purview; but tax policy is and that was No. 6.\n  I might also add that if you go down the list of items included in \nthe bill that are helping employers deal with continuing education, to \nwhich the Senator alluded, this is a very high item in the poll--school \nconstruction is a high item in the poll.\n  In other words, the items that are in this proposal react just as the \nSenator would have them to his poll. So I thought it was important \nthere be some clarification of these points that were alluded to early \non. Anybody watching this discussion needs to know that, in fact, this \nproposal augments the budgetary process.\n  Now, let's talk about the proposal in general. What does it do? I \nhave always been stunned by how little incentive it takes to cause \nAmericans to do huge things. The Senator is correct when he says the \nsavings account is not a particularly large form of tax relief. It is \nnot. It is about $1.2 billion over 5 years. Over 10 years, it is $2.4 \nbillion.\n  What happens is, because we say you can open a savings account and \nwe, the Federal Government, are not going to sock it to you by taxing \nthe interest on the account, we are going to help you make a \ncontribution to the work you do to educate your children--get these \nnumbers--14 million American families will open this kind of account. \nThey are the parents of 20 million children. That is almost half the \nelementary school population who will become involved in this concept. \nTheir parents, and others, will save $12 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  So in addition to all this funding the Senator from Massachusetts is \ntalking about, we are putting into the education arena $12 billion \nmore, and we didn't have to raise taxes one dime to do it, and the \nState didn't and the local communities didn't. This is voluntary. This \nis money given to education by loving parents.\n  In my judgment, the $12 billion is worth three to five times the \nmoney the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about. Why? Public \neducation money, we all know, is spread across a wide arena. A lot of \nit never sees a classroom. It doesn't know the name of a single \nstudent. It cannot get targeted to particular problems.\n  If we pass this legislation, 14 million families will have an account \nand once a month some saving institution is going to send a notice to \nthose parents that this is how much money they have in their account \nfor Johnny or Jane. That almost beats the PTA because every month this \nfamily is being reminded of this resource it is collecting for its \nchildren.\n  Now, I call these smart dollars. Why? Because it is like a laser \nbeam; this money will be invested directly on the child and directly on \nthe most pressing need the child has. You talk about the digital \ndivide--families who have these accounts can close them; they can buy \nhome computers; they can hire a tutor; they can deal with a special ed \nproblem, a health problem, a transportation problem, or whatever it is \nthe child specifically needs. This $12 billion--and I think it would be \nmore--goes right to the target.\n  These IRA accounts are entirely unique in one special way. Anybody \ncan deposit money into the account--the parents, of course, or it could \nbe the grandmother, sister, aunt, or it could be a next-door neighbor \nor a church; it could be a labor union; it could be a company. No one \nhas even begun to calculate what ideas will emerge to build up these \naccounts. One can easily see an employer matching his employees and \nencouraging them to open these kinds of accounts.\n  There is virtually zero downside to the accounts. Every segment of \neducation in America will be a winner--\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\npublic education, private education, home schooling, you name it. These \naccounts will all infuse new resources for which the Federal Government \nwill not have to appropriate a dime to get the job done: Fourteen \nmillion families, 20 million children, a resource that is available to \nthem from kindergarten through college, and thereafter if disabled. \nPublic education wins. Private, home schooling, and every form of \neducation wins. To me, it is mind-boggling that anybody would challenge \nthe concept.\n  The bill does more, as I was explaining to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. In States that have advanced tuition programs available, \nthose proceeds to students will no longer be taxed. I might add that \nthis suggestion came from the Democrat side of the aisle--a good idea.\n  It will help encourage States to have State tuition plans, and it \nwill encourage families to get in them because they don't eat it up in \ntaxes when they use them to go to college. It is estimated that 1 \nmillion college students will benefit from that plan.\n  Everybody knows today that education is no longer a box--you finish \nhigh school, you finish college, and that is it. In today's rapidly \nchanging world, it is an ongoing process.\n  The legislation--which I think I heard the Senator from Massachusetts \nsay the President agrees with--extends employer tax exemptions when \nthey spend money to train employees on advanced education, and even on \nundergraduate and graduate education. It is worth $5,200 a year. It is \nestimated--I think this figure is low--that 1 million American \nemployees will benefit from this legislation. It relieves students of \ntaxes on the interest of their student loans. Through the work of \nSenator Graham of Florida, it makes it easier for local governments to \nbuild new schools. It is a very important part of the legislation.\n  Again, if you take the list of the Senator from Massachusetts of what \nparents think is important, this legislation refers to almost every one \nof those arenas, and in the proper Federal way where we manage tax \npolicy. We should make that policy more friendly to people dealing with \neducation. It is not necessarily the Federal Government's role to \ndecide exactly how we are going to build a school in my home State of \nGeorgia.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is waiting. I will finish in a couple of \nminutes so he may speak. I may speak some more afterwards.\n  I want to relate that since we first debated this proposal and passed \nit in the Senate with 59 Senate votes--it would probably be higher \ntoday--a lot has been happening in America. The debate over the failure \nof kindergarten through high school is charging through the country.\n  In my State, the Governor is a Democrat. He is fighting for an \neducation revamp right now in the Georgia Legislature. It includes \noffering tenure. He is proposing for schools proven to certifiably fail \nthat parents have a right to leave those schools. What better tool to \nhelp a family deal with that predicament if it comes about--and it \nwill. We will have schools in a State that cannot cut it. And he is not \ngoing to force people to go to those kinds of schools.\n  The most unconscionable policy in America is forcing families and \nchildren to go to schools that we know are failing. This legislation \nhelps those families deal with that kind of problem, which is why, when \nyou ask parents if they want to do this or not, it gets between 60 and \n70 percent approval. They understand that it is an opportunity, a \nvoluntary opportunity--something important in America's government \ntoday--to help themselves, to help their families, to help their \nchildren. It allows everybody else in the country to help some kid \nsomewhere --one of your employee's children, one of your union member's \nchildren, your benevolent association's children, or a police officer \nwho goes down. A community could open this up and have $70,000 sitting \nthere when that kid wants to go to school. Think about it.\n  The Senator wonders why we are debating this. It affects half the \npopulation in elementary schools in the United States as it relates to \ntax policy. That is why.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I think under a previous unanimous \nconsent the floor will go to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's remarks. I \ndefinitely want to respond. Senator Schumer is on a tight timeline. He \nasked whether he could speak for 5 minutes. Then I would follow him. I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Schumer be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes and I be allowed to follow Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank both the Senator from \nGeorgia and the Senator from Minnesota who was gracious to yield time.\n  Mr. President, I do not profess to be an expert on the bill that my \ngood friend, the Senator from Georgia, has introduced. I came on the \nfloor because it seems to me that education is not only the No. 1 issue \nthat most Americans feel is important, but it is the No. 1 issue that \nis facing the future of our country.\n  We have a huge number of different problems in education. We have \novercrowded classrooms. My children attend the public schools in New \nYork City, I am proud to say. I am proud to say they are getting a good \neducation. When my daughter was in kindergarten, she had to share that \nkindergarten room with another class. We have a desperate shortage of \nclassrooms. We have a desperate shortage of teachers coming forward. \nThe average age of a teacher in America is 50 years or older. Every \nyear we are going to need more and more teachers in our schools.\n  We have a desperate shortage of standards. All too often people \ngraduate from course work and can't carry the load. In an economy where \neducation and knowledge seem to be so important, we don't have any good \nFederal ideas on what to do. There are some who might say we don't need \nFederal ideas. I don't question the right to debate this proposal, nor \ndo I doubt what the Senator from Georgia has said in that it will help \nlots of families. I am aware of the problem.\n  I introduced legislation, along with the Senator from Maine, to make \ncollege tuition up to $12,000 tax deductible because of the strain. It \nis another way to go. It might benefit some families more than the \nlegislation of the Senator from Georgia. It might benefit some families \nless. But it is along the same line.\n  But I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts. Why are we doing \nthis piece of legislation, worthy though it may be, when we have all \nthese issues out there? Why aren't we taking a month? It is certainly \nworth our Nation's future to take a month and debate all the \neducational issues, see where our priorities are, and see if this \nproposal from the Senator from Georgia, into which he has put a lot of \neffort and a lot of work, comes at the top, the middle, or the bottom \nof our priorities. Is it going to do more than spending the same amount \nof money on new classrooms or new teachers or mentor training? Is it \ngoing to do more than, say, raising teachers' salaries because it is \nawfully hard in large part in this country to get a qualified person to \nteach our young people math and science when the private sector pays \nthem double. Is it worth more than having our National Standards Board \ncome up with real national standards, and should we be debating that \nissue?\n  These are questions that I think are vital to the future of our \ncountry and to the future of this Chamber.\n  These are questions that get to the very heart of a fundamental \nprinciple with which I think most Americans agree. We want to stay the \nNo. 1 economic power in the year 2025.\n  In my judgment, to bring up one particular issue that stands in \nisolation and not be allowed to debate the whole panoply of educational \nissues and vote on them together as a package is not how a good \nbusiness would operate. It is not how a good volunteer organization \nwould set its priorities. A family sitting around the dinner table \nwould not say let's just discuss vacation in our budget and then not \ndiscuss what we have to pay for food, for shelter, and for \ntransportation.\n\n  Again, I respect my friend from Georgia. We have worked together on \nmany\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\npieces of legislation. He is sincere in this effort. I simply say to my \ncolleagues, this is no way to come up with a real and desperately \nneeded education policy in 21st century America.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota for yielding.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will only take a minute to respond to \nthe good Senator from New York.\n  The point is, the legislation had come out of the Finance Committee. \nNo one is suggesting this is the only education debate. This bill is \nready. This bill has been voted on by the Senate before; 59 Senators \nhave already supported this. This is vetted.\n  Some of the issues the Senator alluded to certainly are not vetted; \nfor example, the Federal Government taking on local teacher salaries. \nThe good Senator from New York knows that will be highly controversial.\n  This is ready. There is not an ulterior motive. The education bill \nhas not come out of the education committee; both Republicans and \nDemocrats are still trying to reach a consensus. I understand the \ndesire to move to other issues, but I do not see that as making this an \ninappropriate discussion for the Senate.\n  I might add that the neighbor of the Senator, Senator Robert \nTorricelli, is the principal cosponsor.\n  I have enjoyed, as well, working with the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of Senator \nSchumer and what Senator Coverdell had to say. Let me move away from \nprocedure and whether the bill should now be debated and go to \nsubstance.\n  First of all, the idea that up to $2,000 in savings can be put into \neducation, from my point of view from some of the most hard-pressed \npeople in Minnesota--Minnesota is divided, metro and then inner city, \nwhere a lot of people are struggling economically. Unfortunately, in \nMinnesota and I think around the country, we are moving to two \nAmericas. In rural America, people are not going to have the $2,000 \nsavings. They will not even get close. They do not have it to put in \nsavings.\n  Let me be clear in terms of which families will be able to benefit \nand which will not.\n  I ask the Senator from Georgia, is it a deduction people make?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No, it will not be shown as income.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Just from a tax progressivity point of view, those \nwith the highest liability with less income shown pay less. I don't see \nthe large part of this benefit going to the most hard-pressed families.\n  That is my first point. That is substance, not parliamentary, when \nthe bill is out on the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I point out two things. The scope of the families who \nare eligible for the account is identical to the President's criteria \nfor who is eligible for the account. That is one quarter the size we \nhave already passed. If there is no difference, it is identical to the \ncriteria of the President.\n  Somewhere along the line, we all have to determine what the criteria \nare, so it is means tested. I frankly have some resistance to that, but \nwe have accepted it.\n  No. 2, the account allows other parties to contribute. The community \ndescribed by the Senator is in all of our States. Certainly we have a \nlarge community such as that in Georgia, but an inner-city church, a \nlabor organization, an employer, other family members, can make these \naccounts real.\n  And last, from the very communities the Senator is talking about are \nthe loudest voices for Congress to do this.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator said, and \nI will be pleased to yield for other questions as well.\n  First, I point out to the Senator on whether or not this is, roughly \nspeaking, the same benefit as in the President's proposal, that does \nnot move me as a Senator as much. Having done a lot of community work \nwith low- and moderate-income people, I know for a fact that most of \nthe people will not have anywhere close to $2,000 to put into savings. \nIt is a reality. It is not even thinkable for most of them.\n  Second, yes, others in the community might be able to contribute and \nhelp them out, but that begs the question. The families who will be \nable to best take advantage of this are families who are on the higher \nincome end of the scale. That is a first point, regardless of a \ncomparison to the President's proposal.\n  In any case, I made this to be scrupulously nonpartisan or \nbipartisan, or whatever the right label is. For the President's HOPE \nscholarship program, I said if this is not a refundable tax credit, \nmost of the families with incomes under $28,000 don't have the tax \nliability and it will not help. I am being consistent in my argument.\n  On the whole question of low-income communities, the very people I am \ntalking about are the ones who are clamoring the most for this. Let me \nget to that point in a second.\n  First, another criticism. I want to be straight up in my disagreement \nwith my colleague from Georgia. I think there is a real question if it \nis through the Tax Code. We keep having a debate. It is tax \nexpenditure. We are spending money one way or the other. If we do it \nthrough the Tax Code, we are basically providing dollars that could be \ngoing to public education, and in this particular case it could go to \nprivate schools.\n  I am opposed to that. I view that as a voucher plan. That might be \nattractive to the Senator. There are some who believe that is a big \nmistake and believe we ought to use the public taxpayer dollars one way \nor another, whether it be through the direct expenditure or whether it \nbe through tax deductions and tax credits. We believe that ought to go \nto public education. That is a disagreement. If we brought this out \nnext year or brought it out here with a whole bunch of other proposals, \nI would still disagree.\n  On the whole question of who benefits and who does not and which \ncommunities are clamoring for this, now I get to the point: If on the \nwhole question of the savings account it ultimately gets to $7 per \nchild, I don't see that as a great benefit. I certainly don't see how \nit gets to many people. Even if you want them to get to the exclusive \nprivate schools, I don't think it helps much.\n  This is where I really disagree with my colleague. I am sure there \nare organizations and people who support this plan. I am sure they do \nit in good faith. The question is opportunity before the Senate. Either \nwe put this $1.2 billion here or we say there are better uses. I argue \nthere are better uses. I argue there are better uses for the money.\n  Now, we have talked about what proposals have been vetted or have not \nbeen vetted. My colleague from New Hampshire came out here with an \nargument that was interesting. I think he had every right to make it. \nHe said we will deal with this in the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  However, I will give some examples. We had a pretty long discussion \nabout title I. This is talking about low- and moderate-income families. \nThis is a place where the Federal Government is a real player. This is \nterribly important for kids who come from disadvantaged circumstances. \nIt is funded at about one-third the level it should be funded. So in a \nlot of urban Minnesota, once you get to schools with less than 65 \npercent low-income students, there is no money. The other schools are \nnot even eligible.\n\n  I would argue, if it is $1.3 billion or $4 billion or $5 billion, or \nwhatever amount of money you want to talk about, the opportunity cost \nof putting it into this plan is that you do not put it directly into a \nproven program that really benefits kids if given the funding and if \ngiven the accountability. I would rather put it there.\n  What have we talked about and what have we not talked about? It \nshould not have taken Columbine. But we have had this discussion about \nviolence. We have had this discussion about how does one get to these \nkids before they commit this kind of violent act. We have had this \ndiscussion about the need for support services for kids. We have had \nthis discussion about so many kids feeling anonymous in the schools. We \nhave talked about the need to have counselors.\n  Some of us have had amendments out on the floor to provide funding \nfor more counselors in our schools, to provide support services to \nkids, to students. That is an important education\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\nprogram. I doubt whether any Senator, if he or she is in a school--I \ntry to be in a school in Minnesota every 2 weeks--does not hear about \nthe need to have more counselors and more support services for \nstudents, many of whom, if they are not the top of their class and they \nare not a great athlete, feel lost. I argue we would be making a much \nbetter investment if we invested it in this program.\n  There is another issue we have had on the floor that is not new. You \ncannot argue we should not be out here talking about it because we \nnever talked about it before. I would be pleased to fault the \nadministration on this as well, I say to my colleague from Georgia. I \nbelieve someday we are going to do this. I think the place where the \nFederal Government can be a real player --in fact, if I was the one who \nwas writing this amendment, if I agreed with the concept, I would apply \nit to this area. I would apply it to early childhood development as \nwell. We should be a real player pre-kindergarten.\n  My colleague may say it does not give people enough time to work up \nthe savings for when they have children, if they are very young. But \nyou don't know. Maybe you would let grandparents be able to do it for \ntheir children's children. I don't know. But I will say this. It is \nabsolutely pathetic how little we have done by way of an investment in \nearly childhood development. It is pathetic. We have study after study, \nbook after book, documentary after documentary, White House \nconferences, we all love children, we are all committed to children, \nand we all know the medical evidence is irrefutable and irreducible \nthat you have to get it right for kids.\n  If I had $1.3 billion over the next 5 years, I would put it into \nearly childhood development. You can make a real difference for \nchildren and a real difference for families because, after all, what is \nmost important to families, or parents, is that their children do well \nin school.\n  The fact is, the reality is, that all too many young people, children \nin America, come to kindergarten behind. I think the big crisis in \neducation is the learning gap between those kids who have had the \nsupport at home, who have had parents who can afford the best by way of \ndevelopmental childcare, children who have been read to widely, are \nalready computer literate, who have been encouraged, they have that \nspark of learning, and they come to kindergarten and they are ready to \ngo. Many children come to kindergarten way behind. What in the world \nare we doing debating this piece of legislation as opposed to talking \nabout this amount of money--or much more, I would argue--by way of \ninvestment in early childhood development?\n\n  I say to my colleague from Georgia, I could talk about other issues \nas well, but I come to the floor to oppose this on the following \ngrounds: One, I believe it is a fantasy to think $2,000 in savings is \ngoing to mean much for most hard-pressed families in Minnesota. They \ndon't have that money for savings. Two, the way the tax benefit works, \nby definition, whatever money you are not liable for, if you are in a \nhigher tax liability, you get the biggest break, so it is going to \nbenefit more the people on the top. The third point I argue is that I \nam opposed to using public dollars when we do not even have enough \ndollars for public education right now, for private education, for what \nis essentially a voucher plan.\n  Someday in the future, if somebody can show me we have really made \nthe investment in public education--I heard my colleague from New \nHampshire talk about all the money we spent that hadn't worked. I would \nlike to talk about areas in which we have not invested. Then I might be \nwilling to talk about how we would use dollars and talk about vouchers. \nNot now. I do not believe this is the way to go. You would have to \npersuade me we have really made a commitment.\n  That is my fourth point; whether it be this amount of money, whether \nit be today, whether it be tomorrow, whether it be next week, if the \nSenate is really serious about children and education, here is where I \ndo join Senator Kennedy 100 percent--and this is not so much directed \nat my colleague from Georgia; he has his piece of legislation here; he \nbelieves in it--but honestly, we have done next to nothing. This has \nbeen ridiculous. I do not believe the way we have been spending our \ntime week after week after week. I am glad we are out here starting a \ndebate. I actually commend my colleague from Georgia for bringing out a \npiece of legislation that at least deals with education. But, honest to \ngoodness, we have done next to nothing. We have had hardly any votes, \nhardly any legislation, hardly any opportunities to introduce \namendments to bills.\n  I say to the majority leader and majority party, it is very \ndifficult. I think, frankly, it is difficult for all of us to represent \nour States well when we do not have a real legislative process going \non. I will get to the education part of it in a moment, but I will \nspeak about it in broader terms.\n  Take this last week. You go home. You meet with people and people are \nglad to meet with you. I think we all have had that experience. They \nare talking about their work; they are excited. You think you could \nmake a difference as a Senator--and you would not be in the Senate if \nyou didn't think you could make a difference. I had one meeting with \nparents talking about depression and suicide among kids--it is the \nsecond leading killer of our children, ages 18 to 25--and the lack of \nany kind of support and the lack of services. I could go on and on. I \ntalk to veterans. There are a whole set of unmet needs in the VA health \ncare system.\n\n  Then we come back here and we have quorum calls or no piece of \nlegislation and no opportunity for amendment. We do not have a \nlegislative process going on in the Senate in general. It is \nunbelievable. I say to the majority party, I don't think we can \nrepresent people back in our States very well unless we get real about \nthe concerns and circumstances of people's lives and what we are doing. \nI think this has been, to quote someone else, a do-nothing Senate; a \ndo-nothing Congress.\n  I would argue--not that the amendment of my colleague from Georgia is \na do-nothing amendment; it is not. He thinks it is the right step. But \nI say, frankly, as opposed to $7 per kid at best, as opposed to talking \nabout $2,000 in savings that most families I know in Minnesota can't \ncome close to saving, as opposed to a tax break that is going to \nbenefit people more on the upper end--I would say in my discussions, \nand I try to be in a school every 2 weeks, what people talk about--I \nthink this was Senator Kennedy's point earlier--is they say we need \ngood teachers. We need to have smaller classes.\n  Students talk about how they are sharing textbooks. They have these \npolitical science or government textbooks. Minnesota is a pretty small \neducation State, and the last President they talk about is Ronald \nReagan. It is way out of date. They don't have good textbooks. \nEverybody is talking about computers and technology, but the textbooks \nare hopelessly outdated.\n  They talk about the need to get it right for kids before \nkindergarten. I didn't say to the Presiding Officer that he would not \nthink Ronald Reagan wasn't one of the greatest Presidents. I am just \nsaying there have been other Presidents since Ronald Reagan. I see my \ncolleague, Senator Sessions, smiling. He can't say anything to me \nbecause he is the Presiding Officer, and I can give it to him right \nnow.\n  They talk about school construction. That sounds very abstract, but a \nlot of buildings are in disrepair and decrepit.\n  We do not tell our kids we care much about them when we do not do \nanything to rebuild crumbling schools. This is the discussion I hear.\n  They also talk about the question of digital divide and making sure \nwe have access to technology in our schools. I am OK with having this \namendment before us, but I disagree with the amendment for the reasons \nI have stated. The Senator from Georgia disagrees with my disagreement. \nThe larger issue is, frankly, I do not think to most people in the \ncountry and to most people I represent that this is really a piece of \nlegislation that deals with their needs or their children's needs or \ndeals with the challenges we have in education. My question is, When in \nthe world are we going to get real about this?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My colleague says it is in addition to other things. \nThe ``other'' is not anywhere near what we should be doing. Whatever it \nis subtracts from the other things we could\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\nbe doing. I do not buy his argument that there are other things we are \ndoing and this is just in addition because of the unmet needs.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am talking about the decisive areas in which we \nshould be making an investment. I do not think this is the way we \nshould go at all. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am convinced we have a pretty strong disagreement. \nThe Senator has made that point. But being a persistent individual, \nlet's go back to the point the Senator made about the savings account, \nwhich is only one part of this bill. Then he alluded to the amount of \nmoney that would not be collected. I signaled to him that it is about \n$1.2 billion over 5 years. The Senator from Minnesota said he thought \nthat could be put to a better use: We collect the money from the \npeople, bring it here, and put it to another use.\n  My question is this: How many Federal dollars can you think of that \nwe leverage to a 10-to-1 value? My point is this: For that amount of \nuncollected revenue, we cause 14 million families with 20 million \nkids--it is about half the population in elementary school--on their \nown, with their own dollars to augment that, and you end up with $12 \nbillion.\n  If we could do that with every dollar we have, we would not be in a \ndebate about any of these things. We could do any and everything. It is \nvery unique in that we get it back over 10 times.\n  I do not think you can call this a voucher. This is not--and I will \nstop here and let the Senator respond--a voucher. It is simply if a \nperson is in a private school, they can have a savings account. If they \nare in a public school, they can have a savings account. It is their \nmoney; it is not public money, and it is being used by them to decide \nhow they might best help their child.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will finish. I am a little \nfrustrated--not with my colleague. I am supposed to meet with the \nEgyptian Ambassador. I just received a note. I have been keeping him \nwaiting. Let me respond to my colleague from Georgia on a couple of \ndifferent counts.\n  First of all, as far as Federal programs, we can talk about that $1 \nleveraged many times over. I can give the Senator a couple of examples. \nOne great example is the Women, Infants, and Children Program. By the \nway, we have a real problem right now, with a booming economy, of \nhunger of children in America. The reports are very troubling.\n\n  Every single study I look at says if you get it right by an early \nchildhood investment, it pays for itself over and over. I cannot give a \nratio, a dollar amount, but I can tell you either you invest in \nchildren when they are young or you pay later with high rates of \ndropouts--I do not think my colleague disagrees--high rates of \nsubstance abuse, and high rates of violence.\n  There are clearly areas where you make investments on the front and \nit pays for itself over and over. Anything that is early childhood \ndevelopment fits the Senator's criteria.\n  I am saying that is where we should be putting the money, and that is \nwhere I would put this $1.3 billion and more. That is part of my \ndisagreement. It is a matter of priorities. A dollar spent is a dollar \nspent one way or the other.\n  I am attracted--I should not say this; I should be out here trying to \ndemolish the proposal of the Senator from Georgia, but it is presented \nin good faith and there is a vision to some of it that I understand. \nThe notion that this can encourage people to save and match money and \nhave responsibility and put it into education--all of that I like, but \nI again argue, frankly, for a lot of families, especially on the low-\nmoderate income end, it is not likely, even with the best intentions \nand the best commitment to children, they are going to be the ones who \ncan take the greatest advantage of this benefit. It is going to be much \nmore on the upper-income end. Therefore, I think it is a mistake. If \nthis is adopted, if it becomes law, and I am proven wrong, I will be \nglad to be proven wrong, but I do not think I will be.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Georgia for his \ncomments.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as always, I enjoy the opportunity to \nshare thoughts with the good Senator from Minnesota. I understand the \ndilemma he is in. It seems to happen to all of us all the time. I hope \nthe good Ambassador will understand his responsibilities in this \nChamber.\n  Even though the Senator from Minnesota has to leave, I am going to \nspend a few minutes responding to the remarks of the Senator from \nMinnesota. I see we have been joined by the Senator from Rhode Island, \nI assume, to speak on the legislation.\n  I want to go back to the point about not collecting--it is actually \nabout $2.4 billion over 10 years. We say: OK, we are going to leave \nthat in the checking accounts of the families who will open a savings \naccount in support of their children's education, and we will not tax \nthe interest. That is all this proposal does.\n  As I said earlier, it is amazing to me what little incentive it takes \nto cause Americans to do great big things. When we do that, the parents \nof 20 million children are going to open up 14 million accounts, and \nthey are going to save $12 billion, and I think it will be much more.\n  So all of us who are interested in education will have had a role in \ninfusing into every form of education--public, private, home; \nwhatever--billions of new dollars that go right to a child's most \nspecific need. Because there is no one who can guide or understand that \nneed more clearly than their parents, these dollars are worth far more \nthan some broad-based public education program.\n  The second point I make with regard to the Senator from Minnesota is \nthat he talks about programs and responsibilities that are clearly not \nFederal. Education in the United States is governed by, and will \ncontinue to be governed by, the States. That is why last year we passed \nthe Education Flexibility Act, which was called for by every Governor--\nevery Republican Governor, every Democrat Governor--to give them more \nflexibility. They said: Don't tell us in the States what we need to set \nas our priorities; we will do that. They are not interested in the \nSenators from Minnesota or Massachusetts or Georgia saying: This is \nwhat your priority is. They want to determine that themselves.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts was citing different polling data, but \none figure he did not mention that I will be glad to supply him with \nis: Do you want the Federal Government to manage local schools? The \nanswer is a resounding no.\n  What we are doing is augmenting, empowering parents and their local \ncommunities to do the things they perceive are important for their \nchild or their school system.\n  The Senator from Minnesota referred to school construction, but the \nproposal of the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, is in the bill we are \ndiscussing, which aids local communities in school construction.\n  Virtually everything I have heard the other side of the aisle talk \nabout, in one way or another, is being assisted by the various \ncomponents of the bill. We are helping in continuing education. We are \nhelping in school construction. We are helping students have personal \ncomputers. We are dealing with the digital divide. We are dealing with \nspecial education needs. We are dealing with all of it.\n  As I said, it remains somewhat mind boggling to me to understand why \nlegislation that is so positive for every segment of the population \nwould be opposed, particularly in light of the fact it has already \npassed the Senate with 59 votes. The Senate has ratified this proposal. \nThe Senate believes in this proposal. It was a bipartisan vote that \ncaused that.\n  I will not keep the Senator from Rhode Island from his remarks. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding the floor.\n  We are all--every Member of this Senate--vitally interested in the \nhealth and welfare of our educational system throughout the United \nStates. We are taking divergent roads to try to improve that system.\n  I rise today, though, in opposition to the Education Savings Account \nprovisions of this particular legislation. I think it is both bad tax \npolicy and bad\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\neducation policy. In fact, I think one of the great dividing lines \nbetween those who support this legislation and those who oppose it is \nwhether or not our primary responsibility is to enhance, support, \nindeed, to reform public education or to somehow, in general, provide \ndisbursed resources to parents.\n  Our primary goal should be to enhance and reform and provide better \npublic education. This legislative proposal, as well-intended and well-\nmeaning as it is, does not do that. As I said, it represents both bad \ntax policy and bad education policy.\n  In terms of the bad tax policy, it is a preferential distribution to \nwealthy Americans. If you look at the analysis by the Treasury \nDepartment, it shows that this legislation would disproportionately \nbenefit the wealthy and provide little or no benefit to low- and \nmiddle-income families.\n  Indeed, 70 percent of the tax benefits under this bill would go to \nfamilies in the top 20 percent of the income bracket. This is bad tax \npolicy because one of the problems we have today is the growing \ndivergence between low- and middle-income Americans--working \nAmericans--and upper-income Americans--not to suggest that upper-income \nAmericans do not work. But what I am suggesting is that over the last 7 \nto 9 years of unprecedented growth in the economy, with a huge bonanza \non Wall Street, we have seen the wealth and income of upper-income \nAmericans grow significantly. We have not seen the same kind of \neffect--although we are beginning to see it--for low- and middle-income \nAmericans.\n  When we go into the tax system and create a tax preference such as \nthe one proposed in this legislation, that remarkably benefits upper-\nincome Americans, we are exacerbating that bifurcation of benefits, \nthat bifurcation of wealth and income.\n  If we are talking about effective tax policy, we should think of \nways, rather than benefiting the well-to-do more, to try to provide \nthose low-income and middle-income Americans with more tax relief. This \nbill does not do that.\n  In fact, 7 percent of the families with children in private schools \nwould receive over half the tax benefits in this bill. I also suggest \nthat these families probably are not sending their children to private \nschools because they need assistance. They are sending them to private \nschools because they have the means to do it--and, in fact, many other \nreasons. They are not sending them, I think, in any conscious way, to \nimprove the public school system.\n  That is where there is this disconnectedness between tax policy \ndesigned to help private schools and the involved commitment of so many \nof the Members of the Senate who are trying to reform public education. \nI do not think there is a connection. I think parents who are sending \ntheir children to private schools today--and it is their prerogative--\nare doing so for reasons unrelated to the social advancement of other \nstudents or the social advancement of the community. They simply think \na particular school is the best school for their child. Today they can \npay for it. They will continue to pay for it--with or without this \nlegislation. That is their choice.\n  One of the good things about our educational system is, we do have \nchoices such as that. But the real question is, should we be \nsubsidizing that choice with our tax system at the expense of public \neducation? Should we subsidize education in a way in which the greatest \nsubsidy goes to the most affluent Americans? I think the answer is \nclearly no.\n\n  It has been estimated by the Joint Tax Committee that if you look at \nthe tax benefit for the average family--not the wealthier family, not \nthe lowest income family who might possibly avail themselves of this \nprovision--the average benefit is estimated to be little more than $20 \nover 4 years. Over one year the benefit translates into paying for 3 \nnotebooks, 14 erasers or 1 box of crayons for the 90 percent of \ntaxpayers who have children in public schools. We can, in fact, do \nsomething better, at least, for those in public education with this \nmoney. We should do that. So from a tax perspective, I think this bill \nis questionable.\n  Let me raise one other point, perhaps a technical point. These IRAs \nfor education were designed to help people receive higher education, to \nbe able to save for very significant tuitions. The presumption is that \nfamilies will begin to save, either when they are just starting out in \nmarried life or certainly when the first child comes along, but that it \ngives them at least 18 years to accumulate the principal in this IRA \naccount, and interest which is tax exempt, and then 18 years later, \nhaving a significant amount of principal and accumulated interest, they \ncould begin to draw from it.\n  I must confess, I am not a tax expert. But I wonder, just on a \ntechnical basis, whether elementary education is the most suitable \nmechanism, if you will, the most suitable objective for these types of \nIRAs, since at most you have 3 or 4 or 5 years before the child goes to \nfirst grade to begin to accumulate. If you have several children, these \nfunds might not be useful at all or be so disbursed. That is a \ntechnical point.\n\n  The basic point about the tax policy aspect is that essentially the \nbenefits go to very wealthy Americans. The benefits are not an \ninducement or incentive to go to private schools. They are going to \nprivate schools anyway. They will go to private schools without this. \nAnytime we take money away from public education, we are really taking \nit away from children who need us to stand by them and need us to put \nall of our efforts into reforming public education which should be free \nand excellent for all of our citizens.\n  That aspect of the tax policy is one reason one could object--and I \ndo object--to the legislation. The other aspect is the question of \neducation policy. We have heard all of our colleagues come to the floor \ntalking about education as a primary concern of the American public. \nThat is absolutely true. They want to have a good system of public \neducation.\n  As the Senator from Georgia pointed out, they don't want us to run it \nfrom Washington, DC. I agree with him on that. But they certainly want \nWashington, DC, to participate in the reform of American education. \nThey want Washington, DC, to be a force, not a dominant, controlling \nforce, but a catalyst for real reform at the State and local level. \nThey want specific needs addressed. They want better facilities for \ntheir children. That is why many of my colleagues on the Democratic \nside have proposed significant support for local initiatives to rebuild \nand renovate schools.\n  I don't know about my colleagues, but every time I go back to Rhode \nIsland, I have city council and school committee members come up to me \nand say: What we need is some money from Washington to help us with our \nschool construction and modernization programs. That is a real concern. \nFrankly, if we support this type of tax break or tax advantage, which \nwill flow primarily to private education, we won't have the resources \nto go in and help local communities rebuild and revitalize their \nschools.\n  Also, if we look at some of the other processes going on at the local \nlevel in terms of how do we make better schools, one critical issue \nthat has been identified in recent polling is the need for more \nparental involvement in public schools. I know that proponents of this \nproposal are talking, I think quite sincerely, about empowering \nparents.\n  But we have another challenge when it comes to parents--getting those \nparents into the life of the public school. It is getting those parents \nto be involved in the education of their children in public schools. We \ncan't do that simply by wishing for it. We have to provide support and \nresources. We have to provide training for teachers to be more adept, \nmore sensitive to the needs of a new type of parent.\n  Particularly when you go into low-income communities in this country, \nboth rural and urban, you find many times young parents who themselves \nhad a very difficult experience in school. They are not the most adept \nat or interested in going back into the schools and being part of their \nchild's education. We have to recognize that.\n  In my part of the country--frankly, in every part of the country \ntoday--we have many parents whose first language is not English. Again, \nif we really want to help our public schools--which I argue is our \nfirst and primary responsibility--we have to empower schools and \nteachers to deal with these types of parents. We can't do that if we \ntake resources away from public education and target it through tax \nbreaks\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nto private education. In fact, I argue--and I have submitted \nlegislation to this effect--we should provide resources for public \nschools to have much more effective outreach to parents, much more \neffective ways to involve them in the life of their children.\n  That might be a more fundamental and more significant form of \nparental involvement and real parental choice than is offered by this \ntax bill. It may for the first time give parents, particularly those of \nlow-income children, a real voice in their child's education in a \npublic school. That is something else, again, I believe we should do. \nBut if we take resources away from public education, we won't be able \nto do it.\n  We also have to ensure we have good, well-qualified teachers. \nFrankly, in many school systems we can't say that with confidence. I \nask the Senate: How does this legislation before us in any way help \npublic schools have better teachers? It doesn't. I think the logic and \nimplication here is that it will assist, encourage, subsidize parents \nto put their children in private education.\n  I believe rather than walking away from a problem--indeed, a problem \nwe should be dealing with directly--we should focus our attentions on \nthe problem and our resources. In the area of teacher preparation, we \ncould use the billions of dollars that would be involved in this \nprogram to enhance professional development, first, in the teacher \ncolleges where the new teachers should learn about the new classroom, \nnew technology, new techniques, and then, second, by integrating into \npublic education the kind of comprehensive teacher preparation that is \npart of the curriculum, teacher mentoring, allowing principals to have \nmore time to actually be education leaders. You can't do that for free. \nYou need resources. We can help, not by dictating to the States but by \nessentially giving them the chance to qualify for grants that will help \nthem do innovative things.\n  So for many reasons, a policy of simply telling parents you can leave \nthe public school system with a subsidy is bad education policy because \nit doesn't go to the core of what we should be about, which is making \nsure that every public school in this country provides excellent \neducation for all of the students.\n  Public education has always been the great leveler in this country. I \nwent to parochial school, but that was a choice of my parents. There \nwas always public education there for me, for them to choose. Perhaps \nthis is nostalgia at this point in my life, but it was always perceived \nto be excellent education, good, solid education, getting people ready \nfor the challenges of the last century. Now we have to get ready for \nthe challenges of this century, and still we need public education.\n  Again, I believe this proposal is motivated by the same desire that \nis motivating every Member of the Senate--finding a way to improve \neducational opportunities for Americans. My disagreement is that our \nfocus should be on public education, and this proposal does not focus \nin on public education. In fact, it draws resources away from it.\n  Also, I object because of the tax implications. Now is not the time \nto essentially provide tax incentives for people who already, and are \nlikely to continue to, do what we are trying to subsidize, particularly \nwhen the benefits are so overwhelmingly skewed to the very affluent in \nour country.\n  I object to the legislation. I hope we can come together again. We \ncan talk about some of the issues which I hear day in and day out from \nparents, from elected officials, from school superintendents back in my \nhome State: How do we fix up our schools so they are not remnants of \nthe last century and the 19th century? We have school buildings in \nRhode Island built in 1878 and 1876 that are still being used. We have \nothers that are almost as old. How do we deal with those issues? How do \nwe prepare better teachers? How do we reduce class size? because we \nknow from analyses and evaluations that smaller class sizes are \nbeneficial, particularly when it comes to minority children. How do we \ndo this in the context of public education?\n  That is where we should be focusing our attention. That is where I \nhope we can focus our attention. I urge this measure be put aside so we \ncan get on with what I think is our top priority: Reforming, \nreinvigorating public education so we can say with great confidence on \nthe floor of the Senate--and we cannot say it today--every school in \nthis country gives every child in this country the chance to develop \ntheir talents to the fullest. Every public school does that. Until we \ncan say that, I suggest we concentrate on improving public education, \nnot subsidizing private education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nGeorgia for his leadership and dedication to education reform. I also \nappreciate the comments of the Senator from Rhode Island. Really, we \nare sort of talking about two different games. Senator Reed is talking \nabout tennis and we are talking about baseball. We have, in the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, of which I am a member, a \ndedicated effort ongoing right now to reauthorize for 5 years the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. It contains issues dealing with \nteachers and poverty and disadvantaged children and how to get money \ndown to the teachers and the people who know our children's names. That \nwill come up later this spring, or as soon as we can possibly get it \nout. ESEA is where most of the issues that the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and his Democratic colleagues have raised should and will be \ndealt with.\n  I have been in probably 15 schools in Alabama since the first of this \nyear, and I am not hearing people say they want the Federal Government \nto take control. Rhode Island is one of the more wealthy States in the \nUnion, they might want school buildings, but in Alabama, they are not \ntelling me that. I have met with teachers, principals, and school board \nmembers, the head of the teachers union, and the State Superintendent \nof Education, talking to them about what the Federal Government can do \nto improve learning. What we are here for and what we want to do is \nfacilitate children learning. And for the record, that only occurs in \nthe classroom, where a teacher and a child come together at that magic \nmoment when good things happen. It doesn't happen in Washington, DC, or \nwith bureaucracies and policies like that.\n  Senator Wellstone wants to spend it on early childhood. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island wants new teachers. I might add, that we did hire \n100,000 new teachers last year. Twenty-five percent of that money can \nbe used for professional development of teachers. This Congress spent \nabout $300 million to $500 million more on education last year than the \nPresident asked for and more than the Democratic leadership asked for \nin their budget. So we are not chintzy on education. The question is, \nwhat do we do?\n  The bill in front of us deals with some inequities and problems with \nthe tax code which prevents people from going on and paying for their \neducation. Everybody has to do that, whether it is in public schools or \nprivate schools. For example, a big part of this legislation is a bill, \nS.13, which I offered; called the ``CLASS Act.'' That act is the \nCollegiate Learning Students Savings Act. What we found was that 39 \nStates in this country right now--and probably 42 or more by the end of \nthis year--have programs to encourage prepaid tuition savings. People \nwould prepay tuition for higher education; they set aside the money \ntoday for tuition tomorrow.\n  What we found out is that although the States make the interest on \nthose contributions tax free, the accumulation of that money in those \naccounts is still taxed by the Federal Government when it is withdrawn. \nNow, what is wrong with that? I say that is not good public policy. It \nis not good public policy at its most basic level because what we are \ndoing is taxing good behavior. We are taxing people who do the right \nthing and go about saving for higher education. At the same time, this \nCongress over the last number of years has enhanced steadily the \nsubsidies we give to people who borrow money to go to college. There \nare a lot of subsidies--interest deferments and other tax changes--that \nencourage people to borrow. In the last decade, we have had more debt \nincurred for college expenses than we did in the previous three \ndecades.\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\n  Good public policy ought to say that if you care enough to set aside \nmoney on a regular basis to pay for your child's education, the tax man \nought not to penalize you for it. As Senator Coverdell himself said \nearlier, we are getting such leverage from this money. We will probably \nsave, in my opinion, more on the back end by having less loans that we \nhave to pay and subsidize by this Congress than we would by allowing \nthe tax deduction to begin with.\n\n  I want to share some things about this idea that these tax changes \nare just for the rich. Of course, you never know how they define rich. \nYou may have a man and a woman who are both working hard and are making \n$75,000, $80,000, and some intend to call them rich. Those are people \ndoing what we hope every American is doing--working hard, making \n$30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year, and we burden them consistently with \ntaxes. They have to pay, pay, pay. The breaks always seem to go for \nsomebody else because people would say they are rich. I don't agree \nwith that.\n  Let's look at the numbers we have on who is taking advantage of \nprepaid tuition plans. We have quite a track record around the country \nof those. It is middle-income families that are taking advantage of \nthese plans, not the rich. In Florida, 71 percent of the participating \nfamilies in the Florida prepaid college program have annual incomes of \nunder $50,000, and 25 percent have incomes of less than $30,000. They \nare steadily putting money aside every year, every month, every week to \nhelp pay their children's education--a dream they have. Maybe they \ndidn't get an education. My parents didn't get to go to college. They \ndid everything they could to see that I could go to college. They \ndidn't have a lot of the things that you have today that would help.\n  Mr. President, 72 percent of the tuition contracts in the Alaska \nAdvance College Tuition Payment Plan--a similar plan--have been \npurchased by families with incomes of less than $47,500; 81 percent of \nthe contracts in Wyoming's plan have been purchased by families with \nannual incomes of less than $34,000; 62 percent of the contracts in the \nPennsylvania plan have been purchased by families with annual incomes \nof less than $35,000; 36 percent of the participating families in the \nTexas Tomorrow Fund Program have annual incomes of less than $50,000. \nThe average monthly contribution to a family's college savings account \nduring 1995 in Kentucky was $43 a month. Just $43 a month.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee's score, the cost of this bill \nis $174 million over 5 years. That is all it costs. But I promise you \nthat it will increase savings. In fact, not too long ago, I saw an \narticle in one of these financial advisory magazines that wondered \nwhether or not they considered it sort of a wash, whether it was a good \ninvestment to put your money in a college savings plan if they are \ngoing to tax the interest on it. I can see why this would be an \ninducement to make absolutely clear that it is a smart investment to \ninvest in savings accounts while your children are young.\n  Mr. President, I believe in education. I taught in a public school \nfor one year. I got to do something easy after that, I went to law \nschool. Anybody who hasn't taught doesn't know how difficult it is. My \nwife taught for a number of years in public schools. I have been there \nwhen she came home at night in tears over the frustrations and \ndifficulties of teaching. Teachers care about their kids. It is tough \nin those classrooms day after day. It is frustrating. So often what I \nam hearing when I talk to teachers is that Federal regulations are \nmaking their lives more difficult than they would be otherwise. They \nare telling me that if you would give us freedom to use some of the \nmoney you are giving, we could do more with it. You don't know in \nWashington. What do we know in Washington?\n  We can't write a law that can appropriately provide in a sensible way \nprecisely what is needed in schools that are different--schools in the \nNorthwest, schools in the big cities, schools in the small towns. Each \nState has different systems of education. Some are desperate for new \nteachers. Some need more buildings. Some need more computers. The \nSenator from Minnesota said Minnesota didn't have textbooks. Minnesota \nought to have textbooks. They have enough money to pay for textbooks. \nAlabama has textbooks.\n  Another thing we need to know and remember very clearly--I think it \nis so important--is we need to do everything we can in this Congress to \nimprove learning. We know, despite the fact we are second only I \nbelieve to Israel in per capita spending on education, that our test \nscores are not good. We finished 19th out of 21 industrial nations in \nmath and science test scores, and 21 out of 21 for physics test scores. \nSomehow something is not working in our educational programs.\n  I believe the answer to it--from my travels and from talking to \nteachers and close friends of mine who are teachers--is that we need to \nfocus our attention on the individual schools, even down to the \nindividual classrooms because that is where learning occurs. We need to \nempower the people who know our children's names. The Federal \nGovernment simply does not have the clout to tell schools how to run \ntheir systems. In case many of you may not know, the Federal Government \nprovides only 6 percent of the cost of education in America. \nHistorically, education has always been a State and local enterprise. \nWe have local school boards. We have local superintendents. We have \nprincipals who participate in the civic clubs of our community, who \nknow our parents, teachers who know our parents, and PTA associations. \nEducation is local.\n  One of the best speeches I have ever heard on this floor is the one \nSenator Byrd from West Virginia shared about the one-room schoolhouse \nhe went to. I didn't go to a one-room school. But it was a country \nschool. They brought water from the spring in a bucket and we drank \nfrom a single dipper. It seems he has done rather well. There is not a \nmore educated person in this Senate than Senator Byrd. There is little \ndoubt about that.\n  I believe we need to look at what we are doing. What is this \nlegislation about? This is not a cure-all to educational problems. This \nis simply a proposal to allow tax policy to encourage people to save \nfor education. What is wrong with that? The cost of it is \ninfinitesimally small compared to what we are spending in this Congress \non education. It is minute. But it would increase substantially \nparental involvement in making money available to educate children \naccording to the wishes of the parent. It is a good idea, I believe, \nand a healthy idea.\n  I wish to say again how much I appreciate Senator Coverdell's \nleadership with this effort. Senator Roth, who chairs the Finance \nCommittee, is committed to improving education, Senator Bob Graham from \nFlorida, who has been a steadfast supporter of making prepaid tuition \nplans tax-free, and my good friend Congressman Joe Scarborough of \nFlorida who has sponsored the House companion to the CLASS Act. I think \nthis is a solid first step toward encouraging people and affirming \npeople to care enough to save for the education of their children. Who \ncan be against that?\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S730-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S730-S731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SENATOR ROCKEFELLER'S FIRST GRANDCHILD\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate my \nesteemed colleague, Senator Rockefeller, and his wife, Sharon, on the \noccasion of the birth of their first grandchild. Laura Chandler \nRockefeller was born on Wednesday evening, February 16.\n  February, the second month of our calendar year, is from the Latin, \nfebruarius. It is a word of Sabine origin, signifying purification. The \nRoman festival of purification was held during this month. Nature, in \nthe midst of Winter, with its cold, yet cleansing air, is preparing for \nthe glorious blooms of Spring. And, in this or any season, what can \nmore exemplify the innocence and purity of life than a newborn baby?\n  Laura's proud parents are Senator and Mrs. Rockefeller's eldest son, \nJohn, and his lovely wife, Emily. Laura is in good hands. She is \nblessed with parents, and grandparents, who love her, and who love \nlearning. John is\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\ncompleting his doctoral studies in English Literature at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, and Emily is a teacher. The first, the most profound, \nteacher we have is our mother. When we first enter this world, in a \nblaze of light and confusion, in such frightening contrast to our \nearlier serenity, it is mother who comforts us. It is mother who \nsoothes our cries, who cradles us safely in her arms, and rocks us to \nsleep. This is the first, most precious gift of a caring mother.\n  I have no doubt that John and Emily will teach Laura the joy, the \nlifelong comfort, of the great books. The great, old man who raised me, \nmy uncle, was truly the most remarkable man I have ever been privileged \nto know. He was just an old coal miner. He was not educated in this \nworld's halls and universities. He was a wise man and a hard-working \ncoal miner who played his part in life with a stoic and dignified \ndetermination to do his best for his small family, for his country, and \nfor his God. He encouraged me to read, to learn, to develop my mind to \nthe best of my own abilities. As another great man wrote, ``The reading \nof all good books is like conversations with the finest men of past \ncenturies.''\n  Carl Sandburg once said that ``a baby is God's opinion that life \nshould go on.'' One of the greatest joys of our existence is to simply \nhold a newborn baby, especially if that baby is our own daughter, or \nson, or grandchild, or great grandchild--just to hold a newborn baby \nthat possesses all of the freshness and the newness and the promise of \nlife. We gaze in awe at this valiant little creature, so helpless, and \nyet so strong, as its tiny, perfect fingers grasp our own little finger \nwith eager curiosity and awareness and pull that finger about.\n\n     No flower-bells that expand and shrink\n     Gleam half so heavenly sweet\n     As shine on life's untrodden brink\n     A baby's feet.--Algernon Swinburne.\n\n  In my experience, parenthood is a challenging balance of love and \nresponsibility. It is a tapestry of the finest, and most delicate, \nweaving. We love and guide our children, and we try to always honor \nthis awesome commitment. And we see a pageant of hellos and goodbyes. \nChildren grow up. They go away to school. They go to work, marry, and \nhave children of their own. And then, there are greetings to new and \nwonderful additions into our midst. For a grandparent, this tapestry, \nin the glow of a family's history, becomes more elaborate, more richly \ncolored, and more easily observed. It has been one of the greatest \ndelights of my own life, and in Erma's life, to witness this amazing \nprocession of life following after life, seeing a new plateau rise, new \nplateau of immortality, a new taste. We wish Senator Rockefeller and \nSharon the same happiness that has been our experience.\n  Laura is the granddaughter of one Senator, and the great-\ngranddaughter of another, our greatly admired former colleague, Senator \nCharles Percy. In these fast paced times, more than ever, grandparents \nare an essential refuge of reflection and continuity between the \ngenerations. They are the living history of our shared past. In their \nreminiscences of earlier days, in their principles forged over a \nlifetime of experience and hard work, they offer a unique, valuable \nperspective of a complex and intricate world. I recall with \nconsiderable awe the birth of my great granddaughter, Carolyn Byrd \nFatemi, born on March 4 of last year. March 4 in the old days was when \nthe new Congress came into session, and a new President was sworn into \noffice March 4. Now that day is the birthday of Erma and my great \ngranddaughter, Carolyn Byrd Fatemi. It is a joyous, and humbling, \nrealization to truly see oneself as part of that intricate tapestry of \nsuccessive generations.\n  A new baby, so fragile, so tiny, so soft, so sweet, so delicate, and \nyet so determined to join this wonderful, maddening world, stirs our \nhearts and reminds us once more of our enduring link to the eternal. As \nWilliam Wordsworth wrote,\n\n     Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\n     The soul that rises with us, our life's star,\n     Hath had elsewhere its setting,\n     And cometh from afar;\n     Not in entire forgetfulness,\n     And not in utter nakedness,\n     But trailing clouds of glory do we come\n     From God, who is our home:\n     Heaven lies about us in our infancy!\n\n  Erma and I also congratulate Senator and Mrs. Rockefeller on the \nengagement of their daughter, Valerie, to Mr. James Douglas Carnegie. \nPerhaps the greatest transition in a person's life is when he makes \nthat great leap from ``I'' to ``We.'' It is the beginning of a journey \nwith a beloved partner, who will share life's joys, and ease its \ninevitable burdens. My own treasured wife, Erma, and I have been on \nthis wondrous journey for sixty-two years, and it will soon be 63, the \nLord willing. To Valerie and James, I would wish the benediction of \nMilton, ``Mutual love, the crown of all our bliss.''\n  Senator Rockefeller has worked tirelessly for the people of West \nVirginia for over thirty years. It has been my great privilege to work \nalongside him in this Chamber for the past fifteen years. He has been a \ntenacious champion of developing economic opportunities for West \nVirginia's workers, and a compassionate, determined voice for children, \nfor senior citizens, for our nation's veterans, and for our retired \ncoal miners. I could not wish for a more capable, diligent and \ncongenial colleague. I offer Senator Rockefeller my best wishes on \nthese happy occasions for his family, and also my sincere gratitude to \nhim for his intelligence, his strength of character, and his \nfriendship.\n  Congratulations again, 100 times, on the birth of this beautiful \nlittle granddaughter. How proud he has to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I say to Senator Byrd, that was a most \nenjoyable presentation. I am glad I was here to have an opportunity to \nhear it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Although there is no unanimous consent, we have been \nmoving back and forth on both sides. Under that scenario, Senator Grams \nis here and will make a presentation; Senator Kerry is the next \nspeaker.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I may ask, Mr. President, how long does the Senator \nfrom Minnesota plan to speak?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Four or five minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I have no objection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S731-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S731-S736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AFFORDABLE EDUCATION ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of S. \n1134. I would like to make a couple of brief remarks as we consider \nthis very important piece of legislation, the Affordable Education Act. \nThis is a bill that would expand the right for parents to save money \nfor their children's education without incurring a tax liability. Very \nsimply, allowing parents to put some money aside to help their \nchildren's education, and do it without incurring tax liability, is a \nwin-win situation.\n  The proposed new education savings account would allow families to \ncontribute up to $2,000 per year in a savings account for a variety of \npublic or private education-related expenses. Current law allows \nparents to save up to $500 per year for their children's college \neducation without penalty. However, the expanded education savings \naccounts would allow parents to save more tax-free, and the money could \nalso be used for children's kindergarten through 12th grade education \nexpenses as well as college. These education savings accounts help \nworking families, and deserve the support of this body.\n  I would like to provide a Minnesota perspective on this debate, \nbecause we can learn from what has happened in my home state with a \nsimilar education initiative. S. 1134 is similar to a tax break for \nworking families instituted in Minnesota by former Governor Arne \nCarlson.\n  Governor Carlson and grassroots organizations in Minnesota fought for \nand won an education tax credit, enacted in 1997, which, like Mr. \nCoverdell's bill, can be used by parents to offset the cost of certain \nexpenses made in the education of K-12 students in public, private or \nhome schools. Thanks to Governor Carlson's initiative, low and moderate \nincome families in Minnesota can receive up to a $1,000 per child tax \ncredit for qualifying expenses such as tutoring, after-school or summer \nacademic programs, music lessons, textbooks, and instructional \nmaterials--to allow the children these educational opportunities. \nFamilies with higher incomes are not eligible for the tax credit, but \ncan still claim a tax deduction for similar education expenses.\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\n  When the legislation was proposed, various polls rated support for \nthe tax credit and tax deduction package between 58 percent and 72 \npercent of the population of Minnesota. They supported this concept. \nSupport for the tax credit and deduction has remained. In 1999, the law \nwas expanded to raise the income threshold for eligibility for the tax \ncredit to permit even more families to participate. The 1999 bill to \nexpand the tax credit eligibility was passed with bipartisan support--\nin fact, you could even call it ``tripartisan'' support, since Governor \nVentura signed it into law. About 150,000 families are expected to take \nadvantage of the tax credit and deduction this year.\n  So in Minnesota, families have simultaneously been provided real tax \nrelief and real opportunities to expand the education opportunities for \nchildren. And 3 years after the initiative was passed into law, the sky \nhas not fallen in Minnesota, it is not a mortal wound to public \neducation--in fact it helps students in public schools as well as \nprivate schools--and again, it became popular enough that the \nlegislative subsequently expanded eligibility for the tax credit.\n  Today in the Senate, we have the opportunity to enact similar \nlegislation that helps parents help save money to ensure that their \nchildren will get a quality education. Parents should always be in the \ndriver's seat when it comes to education decisions, and this bill \nsimply empowers them to do more to help their kids get ahead. S. 1134 \ndeserves our support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there has been a long discussion here. I do \nnot know if I am the last in the course of the afternoon. If I am, I \napologize profusely to those who are enduring until we are released, \nbut I would like to share some thoughts regarding this bill, if I may. \nWe are not sure what the status will be tomorrow morning with respect \nto debate or opportunity to comment on it.\n  I just heard the Senator from Minnesota say the sky is not falling \nin. It is not the end of public education for the small amount of \nexperiments that have taken place in Minnesota. I am sure that is \nabsolutely true, looking at the amount of money involved, maybe $7 a \nyear to a family using it for K-12, because once they have put whatever \nmoney aside they could in order to take advantage of K-12, the amount \nof interest buildup is not that great. So obviously we are not talking \nabout the grandest sums of money. That is not what is really at stake.\n  In point of fact, the small amount of money is, in and of itself, an \nargument against doing what we are doing because it barely makes a \ndifference to most of these families--though our colleagues who are \nadvocating it argue that whatever difference it makes, it is worth \ntrying to make that difference. But that obscures what is really at \nstake here. It obscures the very significant, large issues about what \nthe Senate ought to be doing, about what the real priorities of \neducation in the country are, and about the inappropriateness of the \nunderlying principle on which this bill is based.\n  So it does not matter how much money, whether it is $10, $20, $30. It \nis a question of whether or not we are addressing the real concerns of \neducation; whether or not this is what the Senate ought to be doing as \nits first act of speaking on the issue of education in the year 2000. \nIt is astonishing to me that given the breadth of the education needs \nof the country, and given everybody's acceptance that education is \nperhaps the single most important issue to the Nation, here we are, \nwhen we could spend weeks on the critical issue of a broad-based \napproach to education, we have one little tidbit, one little piece of \nbait hanging out there as a statement of where our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle seem to want to come from with respect to the \nlarger issue of education itself.\n  What am I talking about? In the legislation, on page 5, where it \ntalks about a qualified elementary and secondary education expense, it \nsays specifically that this can go to anyone who is:\n\n       . . . an elementary or secondary school student at a \n     public, private or religious school. . . .\n\n  This is an enormous transition for the United States of America \nbecause what we are talking about is a first-time extension of a \nsignificant tax approach to secondary and elementary school, private, \nand religious education. We have historically always drawn a critical \nline between higher education and secondary and elementary education. \nWe do that for a lot of different reasons, not the least of which is \nthat the Federal Government has never assumed fundamental \nresponsibility as a national priority, if you will, for every person in \nAmerica going on to higher education. Though we hope it, we want it, we \nencourage it, we have Pell grants, we have student loans, we have all \nkinds of ways in which we encourage people to do that, but we do not \nhave the breadth of touch on the students because of the great breadth \nof educational opportunity that has grown up privately in the country.\n  That is not true in public education, which has been a commitment for \nsecondary and elementary schoolchildren since this country's founding \nwhen Thomas Jefferson first talked about the pillars of education; \nsince the days when we first made our commitment to a public education \nsystem that would help serve as the great melting pot/equalizer, if you \nwill, by which we help to bind the country together as a country. That \nwas going to happen, not through divisions of wealth but, rather, \nthrough people knowing that by every child in America sharing in the \nopportunities of public education we would build that kind of country.\n  All of us understand the educational system we have today is not \nperforming, in some places, in the way we desire. It is, I might add, \nperforming an awful lot better in a lot more places than many people \nwant to admit. The fact is, there are some stunningly capable, \nextraordinary public schools across this country. They are providing \nstudents for the best universities in the Nation.\n  What we need to talk about on the floor of the Senate is how we are \ngoing to empower every public school in the country to be able to \nreplicate the best practices that take place at those other \nextraordinary public schools, or, I might add, at a private school, or \nat a religious school. But we do not fund it, and that is what this \nlegislation seeks to do.\n  It is called the Affordable Education Act. I am not sure why it is \ncalled the Affordable Education Act because only those who can already \nafford to send their kids to a parochial or to a charter school or some \nother kind of school really are going to benefit from it. It is hardly \ngoing to be affordable to the families for whom the question of \naffordability is most important. It is certainly not going to be \naffordable even for those families who are already making savings \nbecause the amount of money they are allowed to put away hardly makes \nanything affordable. Finally, it really is not affordable because it \napplies to so few kids.\n  Ninety percent of the children in America go to school in public \nschools, and nothing in this act is going to alter that one iota. \nNinety percent of the kids in America go to school in public schools. \nWhat we really ought to call this act is the Alternative to Public \nEducation Act because that is really what it seeks to do. It seeks to \nestablish a new principle by which we can come back each year and begin \nto build up the amount of money that some will fight for to put into \nsavings accounts so that ultimately it will grow to a sufficient amount \nthat, indeed, will become the alternative to public education for those \nwho have the ability to make that choice or, for various reasons of \nabandonment of the public school system, are encouraged to do so as the \nonly way to send their kids, in their judgment, somewhere that will \nmake a difference.\n  What we ought to be talking about in this Chamber today--in fact, \nevery day until we complete the task--is how we are going to guarantee \nthat every school within the public school system has a fair \nopportunity to make of itself what schools in the richest communities \nmake or schools which are the beneficiaries of remarkable endowments or \nparents in various parts of the country who have enormous sums of money \nand, in some cases, schools which are not necessarily dependent on\n\n[[Page S733]]\n\na significant amount of money but which have a core group of parents \nand students which allows them to behave in a way that is different \nfrom some schools in the inner cities or in rural areas where it is \nmuch tougher to build that kind of support.\n  The question the Senate ought to be debating is why we are not here \nas our first act trying to guarantee the real promise of America, which \nis to make certain that all of our children have an opportunity to go \nto schools that will make a difference in their lives on the positive \nside of the ledger.\n  We have been around this sometime before in the Senate, and it grows \nincreasingly frustrating as we continually come back with these \nscatter-shot, little tidbit efforts. I know my colleague from Georgia \ndoes not view it as a tidbit. I know this is important to him \npersonally. I know it is important to some colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. But you cannot look me or anyone else in the eye and \nsuggest this can pretend to be a comprehensive approach to the \neducation needs of this country. If it is not, you cannot convince me \nthat this is where we ought to begin the debate about what we are going \nto do to fix the schools in the country.\n  I have come to the floor and said this to my colleague from Georgia. \nI do not understand it. I know no one is going to accuse me of not \nbeing here long enough to understand it. I think I have a pretty good \nsense of how the politics of these issues work, and I still am \nfrustrated and do not understand it because I do not think we are \nalways that far off. Yet we continually keep talking past each other.\n  I heard the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, argue that we \nought to have a very significant increase in the amount of money we put \ninto education. I am confident that when he was Governor, the Chair \nunderstood full well the difficulties of some of the urban centers of \nthe State he represents on how hard it is, based on a low tax base, to \nprovide for computers or provide for sports programs in the afternoons \nor for libraries that stay open or afterschool programs or remedial \nprograms for kids who are having trouble learning. These things do cost \nmoney.\n  The fact is, there are communities in our country that do not have a \ntax base to go to. Yet we have an agrarian-based structure that \nsuggests we still ought to have a school system working on those old \nhours as well as on the old funding mechanism.\n  Where does the money come from? The money comes from property taxes, \nexcept to the degree they get money from the State treasury in either \nsome form of education reform or other disbursement. For too many \ncommunities, they have zero ability.\n  In our State, we had the same tax revolution everybody else in the \ncountry had. We had a limit on the amount property taxes can be \nincreased--and properly so, I might add. There are a lot of families on \nfixed incomes. There are a lot of senior citizens who have paid for \ntheir homes who do not have the income stream to support an increase in \nrevenue. There are a lot of young families starting out who do not have \nthe ability to find the extra cash-flow to pay for the property tax \nincrease that might be necessary to adequately fund a really excellent \nschool system.\n  What do we do? We merrily go down the road ourselves ignoring this \nfundamental reality.\n  I am with my colleagues on the other side of the fence. I do not want \nto throw money down a dark hole. I do not want to give money to a \nschool system that is layered with politics, or has an inability to \nhold the teachers accountable, or does not have a structure that \ninvolves parents and has accountability of what kids are learning. I do \nnot think anybody in the Senate wants to do that.\n  So I am having difficulty understanding why it is we cannot find a \nformula by which we are prepared to put some money into the system \nrequiring those systems to embrace real reform, leaving up to those \nsystems--and this is important--the determination of how they will get \ntheir kids to the end goal of a superlative education.\n  I do not think the Federal Government ought to run that. I do not \nthink we ought to come trotting in with some new mandate and tell \npeople, if you do not do this--that is not what this is about. We are \nonly 7 percent of the budget of schools across this country.\n  Moreover, it is a steadfast principle that none of us wants to break \nthat somehow the Federal Government ought to be involved in running the \nschools. We do not want that. I do not want that. I believe in local \ncontrol, but local control has to mean also local empowerment, local \ncapacity, local ability to do some of these things.\n  None of our colleagues can ignore the fact that if you are a young \nlaw student getting out of law school, one of the better law schools in \nthe Nation, and you go to work in Boston or New York, you are going to \nstart out now at $140,000 with the top law firms. Right out of law \nschool, you can earn as much as a Senator, which may not be an \nappropriate measurement of anything, but that is what we are valuing.\n  A teacher comes out of college with $50,000 to $100,000 of loans, \nwhich they are required to start paying back the minute they go to \nwork. They are going to start at $22,000, $21,000, $23,000, maybe work \ntheir way into the thirties after they have 15 years and a master's \ndegree, and, depending on the school system, they can be at some school \nsystems where they can get into the sixties, but with most of them they \nare in the forties after almost a career of service.\n  How do we turn to any student saddled with those loans in college and \nsay: Ignore all those dot coms where you can earn 60,000 bucks almost \nright out of school, ignore the opportunities of the marketplace where \nthere is 4-percent unemployment and you have this extraordinary gap in \nall the technological fields where the greatest restraint on growth to \nour Nation is going to be the lack of an available skilled labor pool, \nand we are going to say to kids who are facing that kind of job market: \nCome teach and be a pauper; come teach, but forget the notion that you \ncan share in that cape cottage or buy that extra car or have a longer \nvacation; you are going to just eke it out, you are going to just make \nit, but we expect you to raise your family the same way everybody else \ndoes and to live by the rules, and so forth and so on.\n\n  Are we crazy? We have lost all sense of proportion if we are not \nwilling to try to recognize that if you are going to value teaching, \nyou have to value teaching. That means valuing it by putting a fair \nmarket value on the people you want to have teach.\n  Does that mean that in exchange for that fair market value, you had \nbetter get your return? You bet it does. Does that mean accountability? \nYes. Does that mean if you are not doing the job properly, you ought to \nbe able to be fired? Yes. Does that mean you may have to work longer \nhours in return for that? Yes, it does.\n  I do not understand why we cannot come to some kind of an agreement \nthat liberates every school system to go out and be the best it can be, \nand to let parents have choice, and have competition within the public \nschool system. I am all for that. That is the best form of \naccountability there is in America--competition.\n  I have seen this happen. I have gone to many blue ribbon schools and \nhave said: Why is this a blue ribbon school? What is it about this \nschool that makes it a place where parents are clamoring to put their \nkids, but you go 10 blocks away and there is a school nobody wants to \ngo to? You can very quickly pinpoint real, tangible reasons those \ndifferences exist.\n  Generally it begins with the principal. There is a great principal in \nevery blue ribbon school I have visited. One of the great deficits in \nAmerica today is our lack of capacity to attract, in some of the more \ncomplicated systems, the principals we really need in the context of \nmodern education. Once again, that is a reflection of the money \ninvolved. It is a reflection of the school system, the structure, and \nother kinds of things.\n  But we ought to be on the floor of the Senate with a comprehensive \napproach as to how we attract young corporate chieftains, who are able \nto retire today with extraordinary wealth, to perhaps come in and be \nthe principal of a school for a short period of time, lending their \nexpertise. Ex-military officers, who retire after 20, 25 years, and are \nstill young and have great talents in leadership, could help to manage.\n\n[[Page S734]]\n\n  I forget the name of the general out in Seattle who passed away a \nyear and a half to 2 years ago who did an extraordinary job of doing \njust that. He became beloved in the school system because of the \nleadership skills he brought to the task.\n  We should have a national effort geared to try to attract people and \npull them into these jobs. If we did that, we could begin to create \nenergy in our schools where they competed with each other. As the \nparents say: I want to go over to the Driscoll school. I think what has \nhappened over there at that Bartlett school is not working for my kid, \nbut over at the other school all the parents are raving about the \nschool system. The kids are doing better in their homework. They seem \nto have more discipline. All of a sudden, the schools are going to \nreverberate with parents making that kind of choice.\n  This isn't novel. There are a lot of places in the country where that \nis happening today. It is working. There are many other ways in which \nwe could have a greater level of accountability in our school system. \nAll of this underscores what the real debate ought to be.\n\n  I am also astonished that we are quick to come to the floor of the \nSenate to put more money into tougher sentencing. We will put people \naway for longer periods of time in jail. We will build more jails. We \nprovided more assistance in the crime bill to do that. All of those \nthings are important. But isn't it equally important to try to prevent \nsome of those kids from falling into those kinds of troubled lives when \nit makes a difference?\n  We know, to an absolute certainty, that the time when most of these \nkids get into trouble is in the afternoon when they are out of school, \nunsupervised, and they go back to apartments or houses where there is \nno adult until 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening.\n  I believe it was almost 8 or 9 years ago that the Carnegie Foundation \ndid an extensive study pinpointing most of the difficulties teenagers \nhad in the afterschool hours--unwanted pregnancies, drug \nexperimentation, trouble on the street corners. All of these things \nhave occurred because they were not in school and because schools did \nnot have the afterschool programs necessary to provide the value-\noriented structure they need.\n  Ask any child psychologist in the United States of America, ask any \npenologist in the United States of America, and they will tell you \nchildren need structure. When you release kids at 1:30 or 2 o'clock in \nthe afternoon to almost a half a day of no structure, you are inviting \nthe kinds of problems we have invited in the last years. It would be \nmuch cheaper to invest in long-term education, afterschool programs, \nearly childhood education, et cetera, than to build $50,000- to \n$75,000-a-year prison cells for the people we have allowed to slip \nthrough the cracks.\n  People say: Do we really allow them to slip through the cracks? Let \nme tell you, I have visited some schools where kids have dropped out. \nIn America, it used to be that you had a truancy system. If you dropped \nout or you left your school for a couple of days, teachers actually \ncared about it. They said: Wait a minute. Johnny is not here today. \nWhere is he? Somebody went after him to find out what was going on.\n  Today, in cities all across America, a kid may not show up for \nschool, and nobody does anything about it. Parents do not even know the \nkid did not show up. There is no money for truant officers? There is no \nmoney to track anybody? There is no way to do that? What do you mean? \nWe are the richest country on the face of this planet. We have created \nmore wealth in the last 10 years than at any time in American history. \nWe have 460-plus billionaires in America today. We have had a surplus \nnow for the second year in a row. We are sitting around toying with \nwhether or not we are going to give seven bucks a year to people who \nalready have money so they can send their kid to a religious school or \na private school. What are we doing?\n  This place is losing its relevancy to the real problems of America if \nwe cannot start at the beginning. The beginning is this broad-based \nproblem that exists with respect to education in America. It is \nrampant. We understand that. How can our colleagues not come to the \nfloor and say: It really does make a difference whether a teacher is \nbeing asked to teach 35 kids, 40 kids, 30 kids, 28 kids, or 18 kids.\n  I have talked to first-grade teachers who tell me they have kids \ncoming into the first grade today who cannot do the things kids used to \ndo when they went to the first grade. They cannot do simple shapes. \nThey cannot recognize colors. They cannot do early numbers. The teacher \nhas to take that kid and somehow mainstream that child while managing \nthe educational life of all the other kids in the classroom. I \nchallenge any of my colleagues to do that for a day or two and see how \nthey feel at the end of that effort. When you shortchange that teaching \ncapacity, you are shortchanging every kid in the classroom. It has \nlasting impact.\n\n  I will give you another example. Not so long ago, I visited the \nCastle Square Early Child Development Center in Boston. There are 67 \nkids--infants and toddlers--who are in the Early Child Development \nCenter. Of those 67 kids, I think 98 percent are the sons and daughters \nof single parents. That is a cycle we are trying to break. We do not \nwant to pass that on to the next generation. The best way not to pass \nit on to the next generation is to guarantee kids have the kind of \nstructure that makes a difference in their lives. But for the 67 kids \nwho were in the early child development center, there were 550 on the \nwaiting list. Maybe 5, maybe 10 of the 550 will be lucky enough to \ncross the threshold of that child development center before they have \nto report for the first grade.\n  Under the law of the land, you are supposed to report for the first \ngrade ready to learn. But as we are learning, too many of these kids \ncome to the first grade and are not ready to learn. So we have built a \ndeficit into the system before we even begin. Then we turn around and \nrespond by saying: The roof is falling in on the public education \nsystem of America. What are we going to do about it? Well, we are going \nto give kids an opportunity to go somewhere else. Where? To a private \nschool, to a parochial school, to a charter school?\n  Mr. President, there aren't enough places in private schools, in \nparochial schools or charter schools in this country to save a \ngeneration of American children. We can't build those schools fast \nenough. There aren't enough seats. So we can talk about that as an \nalternative all we want. It is no alternative.\n  The alternative is to fix the public school system where 90 percent \nof the kids in this country go to school. Again and again, I say it, 90 \npercent. If we had the most ambitious program my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle could design to have a voucher or to create \nsome alternative, we couldn't take care of 5 to 10 percent of America's \nchildren, let alone 90 percent. If we want to fill those high-tech \njobs, if we want America to match the increased focus of Asia, Europe, \nLatin America, and other countries on education as their primary need \nwith respect to the digital divide and the economies of the future, if \nwe are going to do that, we have to pay attention to the educational \nopportunities afforded to our youngest children at the earliest stages \nof life. It is incomprehensible to me that we can't find the capacity \nto make certain that those 550 kids can all get the kind of early input \nthey need so we can alleviate some of the crises in our school system \nby sending kids to school ready to learn.\n\n  All of this is part of a mosaic: early child education, early \nmaternal input. Whether a mother is able to properly provide nutrition \nfor a child affects a child's learning ability. All of these things do. \nIt is very fashionable by many in the Senate to say that is the \nresponsibility of parents. Yes, it is. It is the responsibility of \nparents. I agree. But what do you do when there aren't any parents? \nWhat do you do when there is only one parent who is working two to \nthree jobs in order to make ends meet because that is also what we want \nthem to do in America? They can't find the adequate child care. They \ndon't have grandma and grandpa living in the house anymore. That is \nanother change in America. People don't live that way anymore in the \nUnited States. So we don't have that great continuum that came down \nthrough generations that used to be the great teaching mechanism. But \nthat is gone now. We have empty households.\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\n  So what do we do? We can talk about family. We can talk about values. \nWe can also talk about the other great teachers. Religion is one of the \nother great teachers, absolutely. But without the parents, too many of \nthese kids don't have that either. If they are dropping out of school, \nthey don't have the other great teacher. So we have millions of kids, \nliterally, around the United States of America who don't have any of \nthe three great teachers in life. They don't have the family teacher, \nthey don't have the organized religious teacher, and they don't have \nthe teacher teacher in school because they are at risk in dropping out.\n  How do we fill the gap? We don't. We are debating whether or not to \nfill a nonexistent gap, to give some money to people who have already \nmade a choice to send their kids to these schools. That is who most \nbenefit by the legislation on the floor of the Senate. The people who \nbenefit by this legislation are people who can save that kind of money. \nThey are the people whose kids are probably already in a religious \nschool or a private school. They are the kids who are already availing \nthemselves of those benefits.\n  I am not saying to my colleague there is no value in providing relief \nfor one of those parents. That is why we voted for tax relief. That is \nwhy we provide student loans. We do lots of things to provide that kind \nof relief. I am all for that. But let us get our priorities straight.\n  It seems to me the first obligation of the Senate is to come here \nembracing an overall concept. I might add to my colleague from Georgia, \nhere we are being asked to spend $1-plus billion, $2 billion. It is as \nin a vacuum. I am being asked to give $2 billion to parents whose kids \nmay go to religious or private schools without even knowing that the \nrest of the budget is going to be for any of the other things I have \ntalked about. Are they going to be cut? Are we going to have less money \nfor after school? Are we going to have less money for chapter 1? How \nmuch money are we going to have in the School Lunch Program this year? \nHow much money will we have for Head Start? If I have to cut those or \ncan't have as much as we ought to have, would we then take this $2 \nbillion and put it elsewhere?\n  This is simply not timely. It is not appropriate. I hope it is not a \nstatement of the full measure of priority of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. I hope it is not.\n  There are other colleagues waiting to speak. I have gone on longer \nthan I had intended. I hope this year can be a year in which the Senate \ncan find its way to a comprehensive, across-the-aisle dialog, to bring \nourselves together in a spirit of compromise. So far the only \ncompromise I have seen with respect to the so-called Straight A's plan \nand the approach of our friends has been on our side of the fence. It \nis my hope we can have that real dialog.\n  I look forward to it and thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to try to confine my remarks \nto the proposal before the Senate. I will make a couple of comments \nregarding my good colleague from Massachusetts.\n  First of all, I say to him, this $7 routine is exceedingly \nmisleading. Two or three of his colleagues have used that. If $7 is all \nwe are talking about, then, A, why get worked up about it? And, B, if \n$7 per year is the only advantage out of this account, which is four \ntimes what the President proposed, then I guess the President's \nproposal was only worth $2.25.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for an answer?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Surely.\n  Mr. KERRY. I said in my comments that the amount of money is really \nnot the key. I said I throw away the $7 as not particularly moving. But \nthe $7 comes from the Joint Tax Committee estimate.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have seen that. But my point is, if that is the \ncase, it is worth four times the President's proposal.\n  Mr. KERRY. I don't agree with everything President Clinton does or \nhas done.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I understand. I will read you another comment, the \nremarks as prepared for delivery by Vice President Al Gore to the \nMinnesota Community Technical College, where he says:\n\n       Here is my idea: We should create new 401(k) accounts like \n     the 401(k) plans that help you save for retirement, but these \n     accounts will allow employers and employees to contribute up \n     to $2,500 for each working person to pay for college or job \n     training expenses, money that you can save and withdraw tax \n     free. You could use this account for yourself, your spouse, \n     even your child's college tuition.\n\n  That is identical to the proposal that is before us.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, may I respond?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Sure.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me underscore that distinction to my \nfriend. The Vice President, No. 1, laid out the most comprehensive plan \nset forward by anybody running for President of the United States. He \nset forward a plan that included $115 million for a trust fund over 10 \nyears. He set forward a plan to attract principals, to deal with \nteachers' pay, and with standards. It was a broad-based plan, and the \nsection that the Senator from Georgia refers to does not apply to \nprivate secondary and elementary schools. It is college and job \ntraining.\n  Historically--and I drew this distinction--the Congress of the United \nStates has always drawn a distinction between the higher education \nstructure and the secondary and elementary structure. The problems I \ncited are precisely the reason why you need to have a broad-based \napproach before you throw any piecemeal legislation out there.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me address that as well because the \nSenator has made much of this today, as have others. This is, of \ncourse, a piece of legislation from the Finance Committee. It has been \nvetted three times before the Senate. It has been passed by the Senate \nwith 59 votes. It is cosponsored by Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and \nabout 10 other Democrats. So it is bipartisan with broad support. It in \nno way suggests that there won't be a full debate occurring on the \nissue when the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act comes before us, which will be probably spring because \nthere is not consensus on that committee. I am not on that committee, \nand I don't know if the Senator is or not. This comes from the Finance \nCommittee and it is one component of what can be done. It is tax \npolicy. It is characterized as if some little piece is going to somehow \ncorrupt or become a hurdle in front of the broader discussion that will \ncome with this other legislation. I find that pretty difficult to \ncomprehend, particularly in light of the fact of previous Senate \nactions on the legislation.\n  I think it unfair to characterize this as a piece of legislation \ndesigned for private schools and that it somehow avoids public schools. \nThat is just not so. The same sources of information the Senator has \nbeen quoting would have us understand that the education savings \naccount will primarily benefit public schools but not just public \nschools. Seventy percent of the families who open these accounts--and I \nmight point this out; the Senator covered it, too. He doesn't consider \nthis the broad base and neither do I. But it does affect 14 million \nfamilies and 20 million children, which is right at half--5 million \nless than half--of the entire population--seventy percent of those \nfamilies' children are in public schools; 30 percent are in private \nschools. The division of the money is 50/50.\n  In other words, half the money that this generates flows to public \nschools and half to private or, I assume, home. That is not \ninsignificant. That is about $12 billion that we don't have to \nappropriate. It is voluntarily brought forward, involving those \nfamilies with their children and their needs. It is not appropriate to \ncharacterize that as a program designed for private schools. Will \nparents who have children in private schools use it? Yes, they will \nprobably tend to use it more, which is why half the money goes there. I \nthink, though, in terms of causing someone to change schools, there is \nan implication there will be no place for them to go. It is not meant \nto make people change.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate that my friend from Georgia is fairminded, \nand we always engage in good dialog. I appreciate that. First, we are \nsent here to\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\nmake choices about priorities for the country.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Right.\n  Mr. KERRY. Now, when I see chapter 1 unfunded, or I see urban centers \nwhere they don't have computers, and I see so many kids in so many \nparts of the country whose families can't afford any of the amenities \nthat make a difference, I find it very hard as a matter of choice to \nsuggest that even that 50 percent is appropriately spent.\n  Now, I am not arguing with the Senator. I am not suggesting to him or \nsaying that some family in public school may not benefit from this. I \nunderstand some public schools have uniform codes and a parent may be \nable to go buy a portion of the uniform. I don't know how much $7 a \nyear is going to do. If you are doing it K through 12, that is the \ninterest. The only benefit under the Finance Committee rule is the tax \nbenefit of the tax-free interest savings. So you can withdraw the money \nyou have put into the savings account, but all you are really getting \nthe benefit on is the tax-free component. Say you put $500 in there and \nyou have to draw it out in 2 years at 6 percent, or 5 percent, which is \nwhat they are earning nowadays--these things aren't even marketable; \nnone of the major houses are marketing them, so you are going to earn \nbase interest on it and you are not going to get much money as a \nconsequence of that. So when you have very few resources, I say to the \nSenator, what is the justification?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator makes my point. There is so little \ninvested on our part to cause them to do so much. I am stunned that \npeople would be concerned. For this type of investment, why would we \nnot want to produce the $12 billion in new resources that we don't have \nto appropriate? People do it on their own--not to mention the \nconnection that occurs between the parent and the student.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I say to my colleague--and he knows this \nfull well--there are Members of the Senate who basically have been \nfighting for years to create sort of a full-fledged support system, \nthrough the Federal Government, for education and/or for schools \noutside the public school structure. That has been a great fight in the \nSenate.\n  What I said is it is not the $7 that is critical here; it is the \nprinciple. If we adopt in the Senate a notion that we are going to now \nin the United States have a full-fledged support system for parochial \nschools and religious schools through the elementary and secondary \nlevel, that is new. Once we have made it $7, you are going to come \nback--or someone is--and say we haven't given them enough; we have to \ngive them $500 because that is more meaningful. Of course, if we were \nwilling to support either private or religious schools previously, what \nwould stop us from giving them more money now? That is what this fight \nis about; it is not about the $7. Although, as a matter of choice, I \ndon't see why it is we reward people who are already capable of sending \ntheir kids to these places and have made that choice versus the people \nwho are having the hardest time making ends meet.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, 70 percent of all these funds go to \nfamilies of middle income or lower income.\n  Mr. KERRY. As I have said, the real fight is the issue of this \nconcept.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I can accept it on those terms, but I don't believe \nthe fact we have not taxed that account to be an appropriation of the \nU.S. Treasury in support of a private or parochial school. We have just \nnot collected the tax; there has been no constitutional challenge or \ndiscussion about it. That just won't flow. If we have decided to grant \naccounts that people's own money goes into and have decided we are not \ngoing to tax the interest on it, there is no way in the world that \nanybody would find that that is a subsidy of parochial education.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my friend knows full well that the famous \nteacher Stanley Surrey, I think at Harvard Law, coined the phrase ``tax \nexpenditure.'' We make choices in the Senate that if you forego a tax \nyou expect to collect, it is an expenditure. Now, that is a well-known \nprinciple in terms of how we operate.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is also a fine line that does not in any way \nsuggest we are making an appropriation. I accept the fact that you \nmight argue, as Senator Wellstone did earlier, that it is money that \nwasn't sent to Washington and you prefer it be sent here so we can be \ninvolved with the distribution of it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe my friend will acknowledge, as he \nhas already--I think he said that a majority of this benefit will go to \nfamilies in private schools.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No, I didn't. I said that 70 percent of the families \nare in public schools. Then I said the distribution would be 50-50. The \nreason for that is parents who have children in the private schools are \npaying higher costs. They are paying, of course, the taxes for the \npublic schools as well, and will probably have an incentive to save \nmore. I think that is probably so. I sort of think that while 70 \npercent are in public schools, the distribution of 50-50 will probably \nbe the case.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I may again just quickly say the Joint \nTax Committee tells us that they arrive at an assessment where under \nthe legislation of the Senator from Georgia, 52 percent of the tax \nbenefit will go to taxpayers with children in private schools.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If the Senator is drawing the line of the 2-percent \ndifference and somehow that makes the point----\n  Mr. KERRY. Fifty percent.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will accept that argument.\n  Mr. KERRY. For the purposes of this, let us say it is 50 percent. I \ndon't understand the public policy rationale for 50 percent of this \nbenefit that we are going to grant going to private schools when 90 \npercent of America's children are in public schools, and of that 90 \npercent, the vast majority are poorer than those 52 percent who are \ngoing to get the benefit. It just doesn't make sense.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It makes sense to the majority of the Senate, and I \nhope it will be so again.\n  In that we are now waiting for the Senator from Oregon, if I might \nclose this out.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the dialog. It has \nbeen helpful. I always appreciate having it with him.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As I do.\n  Mr. President, this debate will continue tomorrow.\n  I want to reiterate that the tax savings account helps 14 million \nfamilies and 20 million children. It provides for employer incentives \nto educate their employees. One million employees will benefit. It \nhelps students who are in States with prepaid tuition plans because we \ndo not tax them. That will be 1 million students who will benefit from \nthe savings tuition provision. It adopts the proposal of Senator Graham \nof Florida and Senator Sessions of Alabama on State tuition and on \nschool construction.\n  Go across the face of education insofar as the Finance Committee is \nconcerned. It deals with tax policy. We are not the education \ncommittee. We are making the Tax Code friendlier to States, \ncommunities, parents, employers, employees, and students to get a \nbetter education, 70 percent which will go to families of middle income \nof $75,000 or less. It is the same means test the President used when \nhe created the HOPE scholarship along with the Congress. The only thing \nwe do is make it four times more powerful than the President's \nproposal.\n  As I said, I sort of reel from time to time when they try to make it \ninsignificant, but then it becomes a huge debate. They contradict \nthemselves. If this is only worth ``$7 a year'' and is \n``insignificant,'' then the President's proposal is only worth $2.25 \nbecause it is one-fourth the value of these accounts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S736-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S737]]\n\nand exemplary career of Marie Fabrizio Dickinson, Chief Clerk of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. Today, Marie achieves a notable and \nimportant career milestone: thirty years of continuous service with the \nSenate Committee on Armed Services.\n  ``Far and away the best prize that life offers,'' Teddy Roosevelt \nonce remarked, ``is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.'' \nDuring the past thirty years, Marie has tirelessly devoted her \nprofessional pursuits to work we all know to be certainly worth doing: \nsupporting the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  Marie began her career in 1970 as the sole staff assistant for the \nRepublican minority Committee staff. In 1987, Marie was promoted to \nAssistant Chief Clerk--serving eleven years in that assignment. When I \nbecame Chairman of the Committee in 1999, I was very fortunate to have \nMarie accept my request for her to serve as Chief Clerk of the \nCommittee.\n  During the last year, Marie has excelled as Chief Clerk. The Armed \nServices Committee has undertaken many initiatives and issues in the \n106th Congress--pay and benefits reform for our servicemembers, \nmilitary operations in the Balkans, and an end to the decade-plus \ndownward trend of defense spending. In each instance, at any hour of \nday, or night, under Marie's direction, Committee administrative \noperations have been flawless. The gains we have made in support of our \nservicemembers during the past year are due in no small part to the \nprofessional acumen and personal commitment of Marie Dickinson.\n  It is no small feat to attain the distinction achieved by Marie. Less \nthan one percent of the employees of the Senate serving today have \nthirty or more years of service. Having supported five consecutive \nChairmen prior to me--Senators Stennis, Goldwater, Tower, Nunn, and \nThurmond--and seven staff directors of the Armed Services Committee, \nMarie is only surpassed in her duration of service with the Committee \nby the venerable Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  Mr. President, I invite you and our Senate colleagues to join me and \noffer our sincere appreciation to Marie Dickinson for her outstanding \nand distinguished thirty years of services. I do so with the hope that \nMarie will continue her outstanding service as Chief Clerk of the \nCommittee on Armed Services for many more years.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join our Chairman, \nSenator Warner, in congratulating and thanking Marie Fabrizio Dickinson \non the occasion of her thirtieth anniversary on the staff of the \nCommittee on Armed Services. This is a remarkable milestone for Marie. \nThe Armed Services Committee and the Senate are very fortunate to \ncontinue to be the beneficiaries of her tremendous dedication and \ndevotion to duty. In our Committee's history, no other staff member has \never served longer. But this tribute is about much more than the number \nof her years in service.\n  A native Washingtonian, Marie was initially appointed to the \nCommittee as a clerical assistant by Senator John Stennis in 1970. In \n1986, she was named the Committee's Assistant Chief Clerk by Senator \nBarry Goldwater and in 1999 Senator Warner promoted her to Chief Clerk. \nWhether managing the myriad of details associated with military \nconstruction projects, editing the Committee's SALT II hearing \ntranscripts, or administering the complexities of thousands of military \nand civilian nominations, Marie has consistently given her best to our \nCommittee and performed with excellence.\n  One of the true hallmarks of Marie Dickinson's service on the \nCommittee has been her ability to achieve success by working with quiet \nyet steadfast determination. If you ever need a living reminder of the \ntimeless virtue of letting one work's speak for itself, look no further \nthan Marie Dickinson. Marie has earned the trust and respect of those \naround her not because of what she has said, but because of what she \nhas been able to accomplish in her loyalty, unselfishness, and \nattention to detail.\n  Those who know Marie know that throughout her career on the Armed \nServices Committee she has demonstrated a strong commitment to \nmaintaining the traditions of the Committee in general and in \npreserving the records of our Committee in particular. Many of us would \ncertainly agree with these goals, but very few of us would be able to \nactually take the steps necessary day-in-and-day-out to safeguard the \nrecords that comprise the Committee's history. Marie's Herculean \nefforts to archive, research, compile and protect our Committee's \nrecord will insure that our Committee's important work is chronicled \nand documented for the historians of the future.\n  Marie Dickinson has dedicated her entire professional career to the \nwork of the Armed Services Committee. It is very fitting that we take \ntime today, on this her thirtieth anniversary, to pay tribute to and \nthank her for the significant and lasting contributions she has made to \nour work on the Committee and to the United States Senate. I hope, as I \nknow Senator Warner does, and all the other Committee Members and the \nstaff do, that Marie will continue to serve with us for many more \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S737-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR DANIEL K. INOUYE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in my over 33 years' experience as a \nSenator with over 30 years on Defense Appropriations, I have worked \nwith a good eight to ten Chairmen of the Armed Services Committee and \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee and, of course, their numerous \ncounterparts from the House side. One constant thread of dedication and \nstability in our national defense has been Daniel Inouye from Hawaii. \nHis tremendous sacrifice for the security of this nation was recognized \nwith a Distinguished Service Cross. All of us engaged in World War II \nwill tell you that the citation deserves Medal of Honor recognition, \nbut it was not to be because he was a member of the Nisei fighters, the \nJapanese-American unit that had to fight the U.S. authorities first \nbefore it could fight the enemy. Now, in peacetime, Senator Inouye has \nbeen the stalwart for the strong defense of this nation.\n  This week, the Ambassador of Japan, Shunji Yanai, presented Senator \nInouye with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, one of the \nJapanese government's highest honors, citing in particular his work \nfostering good relations between the United States and Japan. I can \nthink of no one more deserving of this honor. Senator Inouye has \ndemonstrated the same courage, character and leadership here in \nWashington that he did as a soldier. I offer him my heartfelt \ncongratulations on this distinguished recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S737-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S737-S738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MILITARY HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, we begin a new effort to keep our \npromise of good health care for the nation's military retirees. We have \nan obligation to provide comprehensive health benefits to the men and \nwomen who put their lives on the line for our country. This bill is a \nsolid start. The Military Health Care Improvement Act of 2000 will make \na significant difference in the lives of our military retirees. Too \noften, today, those who have served our country with honor are left \nstruggling to obtain and pay for health care in their retirement. \nThat's not right.\n  The Act will extend existing medical demonstration programs to \nmilitary retirees who are over the age of 65. It will also extend the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Program Demonstration for Medicare-\neligible beneficiaries, and it will enable the Secretary of Defense to \nexpand the number of TRICARE Senior Prime sites.\n  The expansion of the National Mail Order Pharmacy Program will bring \nwelcome relief to eligible beneficiaries, and the Pharmacy Pilot \nProgram will reduce pharmacy enrollment fees and implement monthly or \nquarterly deductible payments. I hope that in addition, we will be able \nto expand this provision to include retail pharmacies as well.\n  The provisions for active duty family members are also an important \naspect of this bill. Expanding the availability of TRICARE Prime Remote \nto military families will eliminate their co-payments and make the \nprogram more accessible and affordable to many more. Improvement of the \nhealth care services provided through TRICARE will\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\nhelp address the concerns of many retirees regarding access, \navailability and scheduling of appointments, claims filing, processing \nand payment, and national enrollment.\n  This bill is an important first step toward achieving the goal we \nshare, and I look forward to working closely with my colleagues on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and in the Senate to enact it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S738-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to \n     increases in fuel prices; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 352\n\n       Whereas, The price of a barrel of oil is $30, up from just \n     $11 per barrel in December 1998; and\n       Whereas, According to the Consumer Price Index, gasoline \n     prices rose by 76.4% in 1999 and by 8.5% in December 1999 \n     alone; and\n       Whereas, Gasoline pump prices at $1.29 per gallon are at \n     their highest levels in ten years; and\n       Whereas, Based on information from the Energy Information \n     Administration, diesel fuel prices in the central Atlantic \n     region averaged more than $1.38 per gallon the week of \n     January 17, 2000, and heating oil prices averaged more than \n     $1.10 per gallon in Pennsylvania for the week ending January \n     17, 2000; and\n       Whereas, These record increases in oil prices, in some \n     cases surpassing those existing during the Persian Gulf War, \n     will have a direct, serious and substantial impact on both \n     the Pennsylvania and national economies; and\n       Whereas, These oil price hikes will result in potentially \n     devastating economic consequences for innumerable people \n     employed in the transportation industry in Pennsylvania, \n     including, among others, truckers, service station owners, \n     diesel truck stop and fleet center owners, heating oil \n     retailers and the airlines; and\n       Whereas, As a result, hundreds of thousands of homeowners \n     will see vast increase in their home heating costs; therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the Congress of the \n     United States to call upon its investigative arm, the General \n     Accounting Office, to conduct a comprehensive investigation \n     of whether the recent substantial increases in fuel prices \n     are the result of legitimate market fluctuations or, at least \n     in part, the result of collusion on antitrust violations \n     among and between oil companies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Department of Justice of the United \n     States is urged to immediately commence a comprehensive \n     investigation of whether the recent hike in fuel prices is \n     the result of legitimate market fluctuations or illegal \n     collaboration and anti-trust law violations occurring among \n     and between oil companies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That there be an immediate increase in LIHEAP \n     eligibility requirements from 110% of the poverty level to \n     135% of the poverty level and for the Commonwealth to provide \n     for a $50 increase in crisis funding from $250 to $300 per \n     household; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the Secretary of Energy, \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-413. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to \n     the released of funding for the Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Program, release of the United States Strategic \n     petroleum reserves additional oil reserves from non-OPEC, and \n     to negotiate release of additional reserves from non-OPEC \n     countries or negotiate with OPEC on additional supplies; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 344\n\n       Whereas, Fuel, in particular diesel fuel, and home heating \n     oil prices have skyrocketed to record highs in the first \n     weeks of 2000, threatening this Commonwealth's citizens' \n     well-being and safety to crisis proportions; and\n       Whereas, Retail prices of home heating fuel and diesel fuel \n     in some areas of this Commonwealth have reached $2 per \n     gallon, and level rack prices of diesel fuel are 106% higher \n     than they were in the first week of February 1999; and\n       Whereas, The impact of escalating oil prices on an industry \n     that is operating on narrow profit margins is being \n     compounded by driver shortages and other increased costs; and\n       Whereas, These increases dramatically affect prices for \n     essential utility and municipal services, and increases in \n     transportation costs threaten jobs and could cause major \n     disruption of vital supplies and other goods and services; \n     and\n       Whereas, Home heating oil supplies are extremely tight, \n     particularly in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, and \n     weather forecasts call for continued below-normal \n     temperatures; and\n       Whereas, Refineries in Pennsylvania and other states must \n     produce more home heating fuel, which may cause shortages of \n     other oil products such as gasoline, kerosene and undyed \n     diesel fuel, thereby driving up prices accordingly; and\n       Whereas, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \n     Countries (OPEC) has indicated its desire to extend existing \n     output cuts amounting to over 4 million barrels per day, \n     resulting in nearly triple prices in less than one year, \n     devastation to world economic growth and inflation; and\n       Whereas, According to the International Energy Agency, \n     global oil supplies could be as much as 3 million barrels per \n     day below demand in the first quarter of 2000, and as much as \n     1.5 million barrels per day below requirements in the second \n     quarter; and\n       Whereas, A mid-January snowstorm, which occurred in the \n     northeast region of the United States, triggered even faster \n     price increases in Pennsylvania, resulting in United States \n     light crude oil selling just 4 cents below the $30 per barrel \n     mark; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the President of the United \n     States and the Secretary of Energy to take immediate action \n     to release emergency funding to the State for the Low Income \n     Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and to release the \n     United States strategic petroleum reserves, negotiate release \n     of additional oil reserves from non-OPEC countries or \n     negotiate with OPEC on additional supplies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Secretary of Energy, the \n     presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-414. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to federally \n     funded research using stem cells harvested from human \n     embryos; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 119\n\n       Whereas, At the start of December 1999, the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) published proposed guidelines for \n     federally funded research projects using stem cells harvested \n     from human embryos. The NIH is seeking public comment on the \n     guidelines; and\n       Whereas, In 1996, Congress prohibited federally funded \n     research in which human embryos are harmed or destroyed; and\n       Whereas, Michigan is a state with a long legal and ethical \n     tradition of respecting life from its earliest stages. \n     Michigan law prohibits any research that destroys human \n     embryos. Michigan has also taken the strong step of becoming \n     the only state to prohibit cloning to create human embryos \n     for research. The proposed NIH guidelines would provide for \n     actions that violate our state law and are criminal activity; \n     and\n       Whereas, Standards of medical ethics historically have \n     rejected justifying research in the name of medical progress \n     when the research requires harming or destroying innocent \n     human life; and\n       Whereas, Numerous avenues for developing new medical \n     treatments from stem cells that do not require the \n     destruction of human embryos hold great clinical promise; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we strongly oppose the \n     proposed guidelines of the National Institutes of Health on \n     federally funded research using stem cells destructively \n     harvested from human embryos and call on the NIH to withdraw \n     the guidelines and redraft them to comply with federal law \n     prohibiting NIH involvement in research involving the \n     destruction of human embryos; and be it further\n        Resolved, That we urge the NIH to direct funding of stem \n     cell research to projects that do not use stem cells \n     destructively harvested from human embryos; and be it further\n        Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the National Institutes of\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\n     Health, the Secretary of the United States Department of \n     Health and Human Services, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the \n     members of the Michigan congressional delegation, and the \n     President of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-415. A resolution adopted by the House of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Indiana relative to reauthorization \n     of the Ryan White CARE Act; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, In Indiana as of January 1, 2000, more than 10,000 \n     cases of the expanding epidemic known as AIDS--Acquired \n     Immune Deficiency Syndrome--have been reported;\n       Whereas, The state of Indiana created a division of HIV/STD \n     within the state department of health to proactively address \n     issues relating to HIV/AIDS and which now directly \n     administers the expenditure of federal and state funds to \n     combat the disease;\n       Whereas, Due to advancements in pharmaceutical therapies \n     and an increasing focus on early intervention and treatment, \n     the number of individuals living with HIV has grown \n     significantly;\n       Whereas, For many, the progression from HIV to an AIDS \n     diagnosis has slowed considerably as a result of these \n     therapies;\n       Whereas, It is estimated that more than 6,000 residents of \n     Indiana are currently living with HIV;\n       Whereas, It is estimated that an additional 1,300, or 21 \n     percent, of Hoosiers with HIV are unaware of their condition, \n     and hundreds more have been diagnosed with HIV but remain \n     untreated;\n       Whereas, It is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention that there are 40,000 new HIV infections in \n     the United States each year;\n       Whereas, HIV/AIDS in Indiana disproportionately impacts \n     communities of color, gay and bisexual men, women, and \n     economically depressed and other underserved communities;\n       Whereas, In 1999, the rate of HIV disease among whites was \n     7 per 100,000, while the rate among Hispanics was 19.3 per \n     100,000, and the rate among African-Americans was 44 per \n     100,000;\n       Whereas, In 1999, the rate of HIV disease among white males \n     was 13 per 1000,000, while the rate among Hispanic males was \n     29.9 per 100,000, and the rate among African-American males \n     was 59.8 per 100,000;\n       Whereas, In 1999, the rate of HIV disease among white \n     females was 1.3 per 100,000 while the rate among Hispanic \n     females was 8.4 per 100,000, and the rate among African-\n     American females was 29.8 per 100,000;\n       Whereas, The rate among African-American females more than \n     doubled compared to the rate among white females from 1998 to \n     1999;\n       Whereas, As many as 16 percent of new HIV infections occur \n     in people under age 25; one in eight HIV infections occurs in \n     people under age 22;\n       Whereas, Young adults ages 20-29 represent 20 percent of \n     reported AIDS cases but represent 38 percent of newer cases \n     of HIV infection;\n       Whereas, Increasingly, some individuals have a dual \n     diagnosis: these individuals have been diagnosed with HIV and \n     have also been diagnosed with substances abuse or mental \n     illness, or both;\n       Whereas, Substance abuse is a factor in well over 50 \n     percent of HIV infections in some United States cities;\n       Whereas, Indiana looks to the federal government to assist \n     the state in meeting the expanding health care and social \n     service needs of people living with HIV;\n       Whereas, The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources \n     Emergency (CARE) Act was first adopted by Congress in 1990;\n       Whereas, The Ryan White CARE Act expires September 30, \n     2000;\n       Whereas, Since its inception, the Ryan White CARE Act has \n     ensured the delivery of vital medical care, treatment, and \n     essential support services to thousands of Hoosiers, \n     including medical examinations, laboratory procedures and \n     evaluations, pharmaceuticals, dental care, case management, \n     transportation, housing, legal assistance, benefits education \n     and assistance, treatment education and adherence, and mental \n     health counseling;\n       Whereas, In more recent years, the state has developed the \n     Health Insurance Assistance Program (HIAP) using a portion of \n     Ryan White CARE Act dollars to purchase comprehensive health \n     insurance policies for hundreds of Hoosiers through the \n     Indiana Comprehensive Health Insurance Association (ICHIA), \n     Indiana's high risk insurance pool, at roughly one-half of \n     the cost of providing medical and pharmaceutical services \n     under the state's Early Intervention Program (EIP) and AIDS \n     Drug Assistance Program (ADAP);\n       Whereas, Under federal law, the Ryan White CARE Act is \n     designated as the provider of last resort; therefore, it is \n     recognized as the critical safety net program for low income, \n     uninsured or underinsured individuals;\n       Whereas, The federal budget for fiscal year 2000 contains \n     increased funding for the Ryan White CARE Act and Indiana is \n     expected to receive $7,813,713 beginning April 1, 2000;\n       Whereas, Funding under Title II of the Ray White CARE Act \n     pays for care, treatment, and social services, over 80 \n     percent of which are for life extending and life saving \n     pharmaceuticals under the state's AIDS Drug Assistance \n     Program (ADAP), and for comprehensive health insurance \n     policies under the state's Health Insurance Assistance \n     Program (HIAP);\n       Whereas, Title III of the Ryan White CARE Act provides \n     funding to public and private nonprofit entities in Indiana \n     for outpatient early intervention and primary care services;\n       Whereas, The goal of the Ryan White CARE Act Special \n     Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Program (Part F) is \n     to advance knowledge about the care and treatment of persons \n     living with HIV/AIDS by providing time limited grants to \n     assess models for delivering health and support services; \n     SPNS projects have supported the development of innovative \n     service models for HIV care to provide legal, health, and \n     social services to communities of color, youth, hard to reach \n     populations, and those with dual diagnoses in Indiana; and\n       Whereas, The Midwest AIDS Training and Education Centers \n     (MATEC) is funded as part of Part F of the Ryan White CARE \n     Act; in Indiana, MATEC trains clinical health care providers, \n     provides consultation and technical assistance, and \n     disseminates current information for the effective management \n     of HIV disease: Therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the \n     General Assembly of the State of Indiana:\n       Section 1. That the Indiana General Assembly affirms its \n     support of the Ryan White CARE Act and urges the Congress of \n     the United States to expeditiously reauthorize the Act in \n     order to ensure that the expanding medical care and support \n     service needs of the individuals living with HIV are met.\n       Section 2.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve \naccess to benefits under the TRICARE program; to extend and improve \ncertain demonstration programs under the Defense Health Program; and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n           the military health care improvements act of 2000\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill with the \ncomplete support and, indeed, the leadership of our distinguished \nmajority leader, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott.\n  The Senate will recall that Senator Lott was one of the principal \npersons who enabled the pay and other benefits bill that was passed by \nthe Senate, and indeed adopted by the President, to be introduced last \nyear. He has exhibited leadership on this subject throughout. He is a \nformer member of our committee, a very valued member. He has kept quite \nactive on matters relating to not only personnel but the whole aspect \nof our national defense. I pay a special tribute to him and also to the\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\nother members of our committee. Indeed, it is a bipartisan effort at \nthis time in every respect to present to the Senate this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee who will follow me in addressing this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I will be chairing a committee meeting of the Armed \nServices Committee on the subjects of Kosovo and China, two very \ntroublesome situations in the world today, so I am briefly going to \nmake a few statements and then ask unanimous consent the remainder of \nmy statement be printed in the Record.\n  I rise to introduce a very critical piece of legislation entitled \n``The Military Medical Improvement Act of 2000.'' This legislation \nrepresents an important and much needed first step. I wish to carefully \nunderline this is a first step. It is a beginning in addressing the \nmany needed requirements to fulfill the commitments of the United \nStates of America through the years--beginning in World War II--to the \nmen and women who have proudly worn the uniform of our Armed Forces. It \nrelates, of course, to the military medical care system, which serves \nnot only those on active duty but their dependents and, indeed, those \nwho have retired.\n  I am particularly privileged to have had the opportunity to serve \nwith, and to continue to work on behalf of, the men and women of the \nArmed Forces for over a half century. I was privileged to have brief \ntours of active duty in World War II and Korea. Indeed, I myself was a \nbeneficiary of this care system. I did not remain in service long \nenough to get the entitlements that come with retirement, but \nnevertheless I know firsthand the value and superb medical treatment \nthat is offered to the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  What we are trying to ensure is that the same treatment and care is \nspread throughout the system. A particular part of this legislation is \nto go beyond the President's request and includes laying a larger \nfoundation, a larger beginning series of steps, for those in the \nretired community.\n  All of us, when we proudly raised our hand and took the oath of \noffice as military persons, were given certain assurances that we would \nbe cared for not only while on active duty but for those who went on in \na career--a career, I stress--type of situation, that they would get \nthat care along with their families for the balance of their lives. \nThat is the important thing that I address today.\n  These men and women depend, at various times in our Nation's history, \non the Congress. I repeat that--not necessarily criticism to the \nCommander in Chief, the President--it is not a political observation; \nit is simply a fact that the Congress, at various times in our history, \nhas had to step forward on its own initiative to provide the \nfulfillment of the commitments that have been made to the men and women \nof the Armed Forces.\n  This is one of those instances. The President put forth in his \npackage those measures which he believed began to address this problem. \nNow we come along, as a coequal branch of this Government, and lay \nbefore first the Senate and, indeed, the House will soon take it up \nsimilarly, our own proposals as to how to add to the President's \npackage so as to, in particular, have a bigger foundation, a greater \nbeginning, to care for those men and women of the Armed Forces, \nparticularly in their period of retirement.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I rise today to introduce a very critical \npiece of legislation, the Military Medical Improvement Act of 2000. \nThis legislation represents an important and much needed first step--a \nbeginning--in addressing the many complaints and concerns with the \nmilitary medical care system.\n  I am particularly privileged to have had the opportunity to serve \nwith, and to continue to work on behalf of, the men and women of the \narmed forces for over a half century. These men and women depend, at \nvarious times in our Nation's history, on the Congress to keep the \ncommitments that were made when they took the oath of office to serve \ntheir nation. In most cases our nation committed to provide health \ncare--for life--for military members, their families, and retirees and \ntheir families.\n  Quality military health care has been a lifelong priority for me. I \nwas dependent on the military health care system with brief tours as an \nactive duty sailor and U.S. Marine, and later, responsible for its \noversight as Secretary of the Navy. Today, I, along with the Majority \nLeader, Senator Lott, Senators Daschle, Levin, as well as others, \npropose legislation to meet our commitment to the brave men and women \nwho have so honorably served their country, through a full career and \nthose now serving, by taking initial steps to fulfill the obligation to \nprovide them with quality health care.\n  Last year, the Congress adopted significant enhancements to pay and \nbenefits for our military members and their families. Already, we are \nseeing the positive impact of last year's legislative actions on \nrecruiting and retention.\n  We must not stop there. Health care remains to be addressed and is a \nsignificant component of our military benefit package, as well as a \ncommitment our Nation made to our service members and their families.\n  Meeting our health care promise to our service members and their \nfamilies is not only a commitment and a moral obligation but it is also \nin our interest. Today it is a key factor in recruiting and retention. \nDelivery of quality health care and the assurance that the government \nmeets its obligations are key factors in the morale and retention of \nour troops.\n  I would like to acknowledge the efforts of Secretary Cohen, Chairman \nShelton, and the Joint Chiefs in highlighting the many problems in \nmeeting the health care commitment to our military retirees and \nimplementing a user-friendly medical program for all. The legislation I \nam introducing today includes the initiatives for active duty family \nmembers included in the President's budget request for fiscal year \n2001. However, these initiatives do not go far enough. The President's \nrequest stops short in addressing any initiatives for our military \nretirees. Military retiree healthcare needs cannot wait longer.\n  I am well aware of the promises of lifetime health care made to those \nservice members with whom I served. There is ample evidence that when \nyoung men and women joined the Armed Forces, they were promised health \ncare for themselves and their families, for the rest of their lives in \nreturn for career commitments. Often this was in writing. Now, upon \nreaching age 65, they are finding that this commitment is often not \nfulfilled.\n  My desire is to return a sense of fairness to the military health \ncare system by providing beneficiaries, including Medicare-eligible \nmilitary retirees, access to health care. Under the current system, \nmilitary retirees lose entitlement to military medical care at age 65 \nand must rely on Medicare for their healthcare needs.\n  In addition, base closure and realignment actions have had a \nsignificant impact on both active duty members and retirees by reducing \nthe medical infrastructure of our Armed Forces. Our military's hospital \nnetwork has decreased by approximately 30 percent since the mid-\neighties, while the military beneficiary population has grown and aged.\n  Those who have so honorably served their country believed they could \ndepend on health care provided by local base hospitals. The Department \nof Defense capacity has become limited. We must find other ways to meet \nour health care commitment.\n  For our active duty members and their families, implementation of \nTRICARE, the Department of Defense's managed care program, has created \nits own set of challenges for the Department of Defense. As General \nShelton stated before the Senate Armed Services Committee on February \n8, ``the program is not user friendly'' and ``we need to get it right \nand I know we will''.\n  The first section of the bill I am introducing today provides for \nhealth care delivery to the over-65, Medicare eligible retired military \npopulation. Over the past 2 years, Congress directed implementation of \nseveral demonstration programs, for over-65 military retirees, \nincluding Medicare subvention, the Federal Employee Health Benefits \nProgram, and a Medicare insurance supplement or ``medi-gap'' type \npolicy.\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\n  One of these programs is due to expire this year, some have just \nstarted, and other are due to start this spring. This legislation \nextends the demonstration programs to allow for continuity of care and \nassessment by the Department of Defense and the Congress to determine \nthe most appropriate long term health care solutions for these \nbeneficiaries.\n  In addition, the bill allows for the expansion of the ``Medicare \nsubvention'' or TRICARE Senior Prime Program to major medical centers \nthroughout the country, where the Department of Defense is reimbursed \nfor care provided to Medicare eligible beneficiaries through agreement \nbetween the Secretary of Defense and Health Care Financing \nAdministration. This authority will permit TRICARE Senior Prime to grow \nin these areas in which the program appears to be more promising.\n  Additionally, due to the low response to the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Program demonstration so far, the Secretary of Defense will be \nauthorized to expand the number of sites at which this option is \noffered. We want to allow a full and open evaluation of this program.\n  The second section of this bill recognizes and meets a major \nhealthcare need or our older military retirees by providing a pharmacy \nbenefit, which Medicare does not provide. The legislation expands the \nDepartment of Defense's mail order program to allow participation by \nall beneficiaries, including the over 65 population. Military retirees \nover the age of 65 would be asked to pay a modest deductible of $150 \nper year to participate in this new benefit. This responds to their \nurgent need for pharmaceuticals for our retirees--especially for those \nsuffering from chronic long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart \ndisease.\n  This bill recognizes the need to quickly implement improvements to \nthe Department of Defense's managed care program, TRICARE, especially \nfor active duty personnel and their family members. Chairman Shelton, \nand the Service Chiefs, have been extremely vocal in his desire to \ncreate equity in the TRICARE program for active duty personnel and \ntheir families. The Department has recognized that improvements in this \narea are crucial to recruiting and retention and have included two \nprovisions in the President's budget request.\n  Those provisions which are incorporated in this bill, include \nexpanding the TRICARE Prime Remote benefit to family members of those \nactive duty personnel stationed in remote locations and elimination of \nco-pays for TRICARE Prime family member who use care outside of the \nmilitary medical facilities.\n  Defense Authorization Acts over the past several years have included \nvarious legislative direction pertaining to improving access, \navailability and scheduling of appointments, claims filing and payment, \nand a single nationwide enrollment program. This bill reinforces the \nprevious actions of the Congress and requires the Secretary of Defense \nto accelerate implementation of these improvements to the TRICARE \nprogram by October 2001.\n  In this time of decreasing resources, increasing costs and increasing \ndemand for health care services, cooperation among the federal agencies \nis critical. The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs have a long standing, cooperative, and productive relationship. \nThis legislation authorizes additional initiatives between DOD and the \nVA in the area of patient safety, reducing medical errors and \npharmaceutical safety.\n  Finally, much discussion has taken place about how to finance the \nmilitary health care program over the long term. Specifically, the \nJoint Chiefs have suggested the accrual financing of military retiree \nhealth care might be the most appropriate option. This legislation \ndirects the Department of Defense to conduct two studies to assess the \nfeasibility and desirability of financing the military health care \nprogram for military retirees on an accrual basis.\n  Our men and women in uniform have answered the call of their country \nwithout hesitation or equivocation. Commitments were made to them in \nreturn for their service. We must fulfill those commitments. This \nlegislation begins, I repeat begins, the process of satisfying the \nhealth care needs of all beneficiaries in a more comprehensive, uniform \nand fair manner. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Warner, the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, for his outstanding leadership on \nthis critically important issue. I am glad to join the majority leader, \nalong with Chairman Warner, and Senators Levin and Cleland, in the \nintroduction of this legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  I am confident we will have a majority of the Senate eventually as \ncosponsors on this legislation. Indeed, there are other Senators who \nmay have ideas of their own, so we will work this piece of legislation. \nIt may be passed as a freestanding bill. It may well be that this \nlegislation will be incorporated in the annual authorization. That is a \ndecision that the distinguished majority leader, myself, and others \nwill make, together with the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee in \nthe course of the coming months.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It is, indeed, encouraging that this issue has been \ngiven such a high priority by the leadership of the Senate and that we \nhave a bill--whether it passes freestanding or whether it is \nincorporated in the authorization bill--that is eminently doable this \nyear. I think that is one of the hallmarks. There are others that have \ngrander schemes of what can be done, but this is very achievable this \nyear.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not certain that the Senator mentioned Senator \nDaschle as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think that underscores, once again, the bipartisan \nnature of this legislation. I appreciate the Senator pointing out that \nomission.\n  Like the rest of our country's health care system, the military \nhealth care delivery system is in great need of reform. Over the years, \nI have met with and heard from countless veterans, military retirees, \nand their families, who have informed me of the many and varied \nproblems of every aspect of the military medical care system--including \naccess to proper care, dissatisfaction with the current TriCare \nprogram, loss of coverage at age 65 when they become eligible for \nMedicare, and, especially, availability of needed pharmaceutical drugs.\n  Last month, in fact, I had the privilege of leading a congressional \ndelegation overseas to visit U.S. service men and women serving in \nJapan and South Korea. The most common complaints I heard, aside from \nthe high OPTEMPO that keeps families apart, were complaints about the \nmilitary health care system and how it treats dependents. Too many had \ntrouble scheduling appointments for dependents, and too many had \ntrouble being reimbursed for the cost of care provided to their loved \nones.\n  This is unacceptable. The men and women who choose to wear America's \nuniform have too many other important things to worry about than \ndependable health care for themselves and their families. Millions of \nAmericans made the sacrifice to defend our country with the \nunderstanding that health care would be available to them upon \nretirement if they served at least 20 years. Unfortunately, for too \nmany military retirees this commitment has simply not been honored.\n  Since the establishment of CHAMPUS, and its successor, TriCare, we \nhave seen that the idea of space-available health care at military \ntreatment facilities for military retirees is simply not adequate.\n  With base closures, military downsizing, and reduced services at \nmilitary treatment facilities, it is nearly impossible for military \nretirees to access quality health care without having to travel \nhundreds of miles.\n  It should come as no surprise that problems with military medicine \nare often cited by troops as a key reason for leaving the force. In \nfact, a GAO study found that access to medical and dental care in \nretirement was the No. 5 career dissatisfier among active-duty officers \nin retention-critical specialties.\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\n  One of the critical challenges now is how best to reconfigure \nmilitary health care delivery systems so that it might continue to meet \nits military readiness and peacetime obligations at a time when our \nbase and force structure is continually changing.\n  Let me briefly give a summary of legislative provisions in the bill \nthat we are introducing.\n  Section A deals with our over-65 retirees. It extends the \ndemonstration programs that have been in place. It allows expansion of \n``Medicare subvention,'' which is critically important as a funding \nstream for military retiree health care. It allows expansion of the \nFederal Employee Health Benefits Program Demonstration--a program that \nI believe will still work, though there have been too few enrolled in \nit. We need to adequately publicize it, adequately promote it, and \nallow it to be expanded. This bill does that.\n  It expands the National Mail Order Pharmacy Program to all \nbeneficiaries, including Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, with only a \n$150 deductible. Addressing of the needs of retirees for \npharmaceuticals is probably the most critical part of the entire bill \nand will provide great relief for our military retirees in the area of \nprescription drugs.\n  It directs modification to DOD's implementation of a legislatively \ndirected pharmacy pilot program by reducing participation fees and \nalternative payment methods.\n  Section C deals with TriCare Prime. It makes improvements to the \nTriCare program, especially for active duty and their family members. \nIt requires expansion of TriCare Prime Remote for active-duty family \nmembers of those members in remote locations. We hear many complaints \nfrom those who are serving in remote locations, and who are not near \nmilitary hospitals, and this would allow expansion of that Prime Remote \nfor those important service members.\n  It eliminates copays for TriCare Prime for active-duty family \nmembers, a very important provision. It directs improvement in business \npractices used in administering provision of health care services \nthrough the TriCare program to include access, availability, and \nscheduling of appointments; claims filing, processing, and payment; and \nnational enrollment. It continues and caps previous provisions related \nto custodial care.\n  Section D provides for further collaboration between the DOD and the \nVA in the cooperative programs that exist in the areas of patient \nsafety and pharmaceutical safety. All of these are critically important \nprovisions, and there are other provisions that are going to help our \nmilitary health care situation.\n  As we know, retirees especially have had problems with access to \nhealth care. These over-65 retirees and their families are seeing a \ncritical problem develop. These beneficiaries believe--and rightly so--\nthat a lifetime commitment was made and that lifetime commitment is not \nbeing honored. Service members thought they were assured free lifetime \nhealth care. This was promised by recruiters in recruiting materials as \nlate as the 1990s. We must honor that promise to our retirees.\n  Our active-duty service men and women find that access to care is \nvery often difficult. Young families find it especially difficult to \nnavigate the often cumbersome process of getting their young children \nto the care they need. Implementation of the managed care program \nappears inconsistent across the country. Families don't know what to \nexpect when they move to different regions of the country because \nadministration of the program appears to be handled differently at \ndifferent locations.\n  We must show these active-duty service men and women that we care. We \ncan do that by the passage of this bill. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see this legislation \nenacted. This is a very doable, very achievable first step in improving \nour military health care provision for our service men and women.\n  I thank the Chair for his willingness to serve a little extra today \nso I could make my comments regarding what I think is very important \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this military \nhealth care initiative--the Military Health Care Improvements Act of \n2000.\n  I am here today because the military health care system saved my \nlife.\n  Many distinguished members have preceded me in attempting to address \nthis issue of ensuring that our military members and their families are \nproperly cared for.\n  As I have stated many times--and devoted untold hours of thought, \nmeetings, and considerations to--military health care is the issue for \nthose who have served and for those who are serving, and especially \nthose who will serve in the military.\n  From my first day in the Senate, I have considered no issue more \nimportant in the maintenance of our military forces than the military \nhealth care system. I have addressed this issue in prior legislation.\n  As I arrived in Washington, the Tricare system of military health \ncare was taking hold in my State with poor performance I might add. Of \ncourse, much has been improved because of this body and the Congress as \na whole responding to our constituents, and ensuring we live up to our \nobligations to our military members.\n  In any scholar's opinion, our Nation's rise as a national power has \nbeen dependent on our military power--military power is the enabler to \neconomic power and well being of any country.\n  The underpinning to our military power has always been and always \nwill be our military service members. In fact, Time magazine recently \nvoted the American GI as the Person of the 20th Century.\n  We have obligations to these brave souls and their families who serve \nselflessly and proudly.\n  I believe that among many other quality of issues, the most important \nof these obligations is quality military health care. Service members \nserve with distinction, in places unknown, without question to orders, \nand without expectations. It is up to this Congress to act on \nlegislation, and to provide the most comprehensive health care for \nthose members--past, present, and future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill with conviction. Why? \nBecause it is more than the right thing to do--it must be done, if we \nare to fill the ranks of our services, and if we are to live up to the \nobligations of all those brave soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen \nthat have given their lives for this country so that we could enjoy \nthis country's bounty.\n  Our legislation would cover several main health care issues for \nmilitary personnel, their families, and military retirees, such as: \nexpanding health care coverage for Medicare Eligible Retirees by \nextending the demonstration projects already underway to 2005, \nexpanding the Tricare Senior Prime demonstration, and expanding the \nFederal Employees Health Care Benefits Program (FEHP), demonstration \nfor Medicare eligibles, that is also currently underway; expanding the \nmilitary pharmacy programs by expanding the national mail order \npharmacy program to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, reducing \nenrollment fees for the pharmacy pilot program and implementing \ndeductibles and quarterly/monthly payment schedules; eliminating copays \nfor Tricare Prime and expanding the Tricare remote program and improve \nTricare business practices; and grandfather those participating the \nDepartment of Defense home health care demonstration program; and \nadditionally, encourage the Department of Defense and Veterans \nAdministration Cooperative Programs already underway to address patient \nsafety and pharmaceutical safety, two key issues in health care today. \nSeveral other legislative initiatives have been introduced this year to \naddress health care for the military--active duty and retirees.\n  In the coming weeks, the Personnel Subcommittee of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, which Senator Hutchinson heads and of which I am \npleased to be the ranking Democrat, will address each bill that comes \nto us on the subject of military health care reform in the hopes of \nfinding the right combination of each of these bills to formulate the \nbest final product for the committee's markup. I look forward to \nreceiving testimony on each measure, and I look forward to working with \nSenator Hutchinson on these important health care initiatives. Since \nhis appointment to the Senate Armed\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\nServices Committee, I have truly enjoyed a wonderful working \nrelationship with him, and I am sure that will continue. I appreciate \nhis support and his interest in the issue of service men and women and \ntheir health care.\n  I have also been encouraged by the bipartisan support our measure has \nreceived, and I am happy to be working with the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Chairman Warner, Ranking Member Levin, Majority \nLeader Lott, and Minority Leader Daschle on addressing this critical \nissue. This legislation continues our work on addressing health care \nfor retirees and the active components. I am excited at the possibility \nof passage of this comprehensive legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 2088. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act and titles 23 and 49, \nUnited States Code, to provide for continued authorization of funding \nof transportation projects after a lapse in transportation conformity; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                     the road back to clean air act\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to \nintroduce the ``Road Back to Clean Air Act''. Georgia has one of the \nfastest growth rates in the nation, specifically in the Metropolitan \nAtlanta area. Although this growth is welcomed and encouraged as an \neconomic boom for the region, two of the results created by this growth \nhave been traffic congestion and air pollution. Unfortunately, as we \nembark into a new millennium with all of its great possibilities, what \nis most noted about Metro Atlanta is the severe transportation problems \nof the region. A recent survey found that Atlanta had the very worst \ntraffic congestion of any Southern city, and Metro Atlanta drivers have \nthe longest average vehicle miles traveled in the nation--an average of \n34 miles per day. All of this costs our economy $1.5 billion a year in \nwasted time and fuel. And, this congestion has been accompanied by \nsignificant environmental problems.\n\n  To make matters even worse for the State and Metro Atlanta, the \nability of the area to correct this problem is complicated and \nconstrained for two reasons. First, Metro Atlanta is designated a \n``serious'' non-attainment area under the Clean Air Act. Second, Metro \nAtlanta has been in a conformity lapse since January 17, 1998. Each of \nthese designations restricts the ability of the Metro area to implement \nnew transportation projects, thus hindering the economic growth and \nquality of life in the region.\n  In addition, in March of last year, the D.C. District Court of \nAppeals effectively ruled that Metro Atlanta's 61 ``grand-fathered'' \ntransportation projects were illegal because they were not in \nconformity with clean air requirements, thus calling into question some \n$1 billion worth of such construction projects. Fortunately, on June \n21, 1999, an out-of-court settlement was reached in Atlanta relating to \na similar lawsuit filed by The Georgia Conservancy, the Sierra Club, \nand Georgians for Transportation Choices. These groups indicated that \nthey did not file the suit to kill road projects, but rather to bring \nattention to the need for regional planning, air quality improvement, \nand transportation alternatives. The settlement allowed 17 of the 61 \nroad projects to move forward while declaring the remaining 44 \nineligible.\n  I must express my sincerest appreciation to Transportation Secretary \nSlater whose personal intervention and commitment made this settlement \nagreement possible. This was very positive news which has allowed Metro \nAtlanta to finally begin to move forward with its 17 approved projects \nand to re-direct its surplus funds toward transportation alternatives \nwhich will help reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. In \nfact, as a result of the settlement, Atlanta is soon expected to submit \nits Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) which not only embodies a new \nfocus on more regional planning and transportation alternatives, but \nalso includes most, if not all, of the grand-fathered projects which \nwere halted. The difference here of course is that these grand-fathered \nprojects are now incorporated into a more comprehensive long-range \ntransportation plan which takes into account Atlanta's clean air \nproblems. This is a win-win situation for Metro Atlanta.\n  However, this is a serious, serious problem and is in large measure a \nproduct of the very economic success which has made, year after year, \nMetro Atlanta one of the fastest growing areas of the country. Because \nthe problem has been building over many years, the planners in Metro \nAtlanta understand that a solution will not occur overnight. However, \nAtlanta's experience has highlighted the need for providing local \nplanners with additional flexibility during a conformity lapse. It is \nthis experience that has led me to introduce the Road Back to Clean Air \nAct.\n  The purpose of the Road Back to Clean Air Act is to assist \nmetropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, which are facing severe \ntransportation problems that are complicated by time-consuming, \ninflexible constraints.\n  First, the Road Back to Clean Air Act codifies the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) \nguidance put forward as a result of the D.C. District Court decision. \nThe Atlanta situation has demonstrated that these guidelines can allow \ntransportation projects to move forward while ensuring that local \nresidents are protected from the negative health effects of dirty air.\n  Second, the bill provides local planners with additional flexibility \nto obtain federal funding for beneficial transportation projects during \na conformity lapse. Among other projects which could move forward \nduring such a lapse would be public transit and high occupancy vehicle \nlanes.\n  The main benefit of this legislation is that it provides \ntransportation planners in cities across the country with additional \nflexibility in meeting their transportation goals while preserving the \nhealth benefits of clean air. Additionally, it has the endorsement of \nnumerous environmental groups, including the plaintiffs in the D.C. \nDistrict Court case. Therefore, costly litigation that can only delay \nAtlanta's, and other areas, good faith efforts to alleviate traffic \ncongestion and improve air quality will be avoided should this \nlegislation be enacted into law.\n  Beyond Atlanta, other metropolitan areas in the United States are \ncurrently or will in the future face the constraints of non-conformity \nand non-attainment as they attempt to develop and implement their \ntransportation plans. I believe the Road Back to Clean Air Act will \nprovide these cities with the flexibility to move forward with vital \ntransportation projects while at the same time maintaining the \nintegrity of the Clean Air Act.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and I urge your co-\nsponsorship of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

Mr. President, today in the Detroit Free Press, \nthere is a story about a potential nightmare in Michigan. The article \nalleges that Kevin Olender, a felon convicted of assault with a \ndangerous weapon was preparing an attack on his co-workers in \nFarmington Hills. According to the article, Olender was able to evade \nbackground checks required by the Brady law, by purchasing a gun in \nparts. Allegedly, Olender was only one part away from finishing the \nconstruction of his firearm, and that part was expected within days.\n  In the end, investigators prevented any shoot-out, but the article \nhighlights another loophole in federal firearm law that gives felons \naccess to firearms which would otherwise be forbidden. I urge my \ncolleagues to close this loophole and the many others in our federal \nlaw.\n  I ask that the Detroit Free Press article about this loophole be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Detroit Free Press, Feb. 23, 2000]\n\n Felon's Gun Charges Show Net Loophole--Police Say Suspect Was Able to \n                           Buy Parts On-line\n\n                  (By L.L. Brasier and Ruby L. Bailey)\n\n       With a credit card and the Internet, Kevin Olender had \n     everything he needed to find parts for an assault rifle.\n       It was no problem, even for a felon.\n       Four days after Christmas last year, Olender went shopping. \n     He ordered a $199.95 parts package for a military-style rifle \n     from Interordnance, an Internet gun dealer based in Monroe, \n     N.C. He bought another parts package from the firm Feb. 4.\n       Police and prosecutors say Olender, 40, of Wyandotte, was \n     preparing for an assault on co-workers at Compuware in \n     Farmington Hills. He only needed one more part, known as a \n     receiver, to finish building a working gun.\n       The part was on order, police say. But authorities raided \n     his home last Friday and arrested him.\n       ``He was ready to do it,'' Farmington Hills Police Chief \n     William Dwyer said Tuesday. ``I think we saved a lot of \n     lives.''\n       Dwyer said his investigators found evidence that Olender \n     had located the receiver, a palm-sized part that holds pieces \n     together and makes the gun fire, and expected it within days. \n     Dwyer would not say how investigators determined that.\n       A person with a felony background is prohibited from \n     possessing a gun or ammunition. But there's a loophole in \n     federal law. Though dealers cannot sell a gun without a \n     background check, they can sell gun parts, weapons experts \n     said.\n       Ulich Wiegand, owner of Interordnance, said he did not \n     check Olender's background when filling his order.\n       ``No, of course not,'' he said. ``We are not required to \n     because we weren't selling him a gun.''\n       Olender was convicted in 1996 in Detroit Recorder's Court \n     of a felony, assault with a dangerous weapon, court records \n     show. He received five years' probation.\n       Wiegand said he sells many parts packages, but declined to \n     say how many.\n       ``You have to understand, we did not send him guns,'' \n     Wiegand said. ``This is nothing but parts, and he could do \n     nothing with them without a receiver.''\n       Wiegand said his company sells fully assembled weapons only \n     to federally licensed firearm dealers.\n       But Dwyer said Olender's easy access to gun components on \n     the Internet points out the need for new laws.\n       ``It is like the old West, only with no sheriff in town,'' \n     Dwyer said. ``You've got sexual predators, violent people \n     buying guns. We need to come up with some safeguards.''\n       Olender is being held in the Wayne County Jail on a charge \n     of possessing a firearm as a felon, and using a firearm in a \n     felony.\n       Olender could face federal charges for possessing \n     ammunition as a felon. Agents for the federal Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are investigating what charges \n     may be filed, said Vera Fedorak, an agency spokeswoman.\n       During Friday's raid, authorities recovered \n     two disassembled rifles from Olender's basement, as well \n     as a manual for assembling the guns. They also found \n     hundreds of rounds of ammunition, including steel-nosed \n     bullets designed to penetrate bullet-proof vests.\n       Investigators found that he was missing receivers, also \n     known as frames, used to hold the gun pieces in place.\n       To purchase a receiver, Olender should have been subjected \n     to a background check, by law. Dwyer and others would not \n     comment further about the receiver.\n       Without the receiver, what Olender had was like ``a car \n     without a motor,'' said Victor Reid, co-owner of Midwest \n     Ordnance Gun Shop in Royal Oak.\n       A receiver would cost $300 to $400, he said. The part is \n     regulated by the federal government, has a serial number, and \n     cannot be sold without a license.\n       ``They are virtually impossible to get illegally,'' said \n     Reid, who said he does not sell gun kits at the store, or on \n     the company's Web site. ``It's not an item that you can just \n     go buy.''\n       The packages that Olender bought from the North Carolina \n     firm consisted of gun parts from military weapons dating to \n     the 1950s, and disassembled overseas. The packages are \n     popular among collectors and sportsmen, who acquire the \n     needed receivers through dealers, and reassemble the guns.\n       Police said they are investigating where Olender got the \n     ammunition.\n       Concerns about guns and the Internet have prompted federal \n     lawmakers to pursue legislation targeting Internet sales of \n     guns.\n       Hundreds of Internet sites advertise weapons for sale.\n       Many are dealers who comply with federal laws. But \n     individuals often don't, said Jim Kessler, policy director \n     for U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. Schumer has sponsored a \n     bill that would make it illegal for anyone except licensed \n     gun dealers to buy and sell guns over the Internet. The \n     measure is pending.\n       ``Nobody's watching,'' Kessler said. ``The Internet itself \n     presents a giant loophole in gun laws.''\n       When searching for guns over the Internet, buyers can't \n     legally make the purchase directly on-line, gun experts said.\n       Buyers scan Web sites where guns are advertised, then \n     contact a dealer and complete the purchase. The dealer must \n     ship the weapon to another gun dealer, who is required to \n     make sure that the buyer fills out the required forms and \n     undergoes a background check.\n       ``It's not like someone can put their credit card in a Web \n     site and get a gun,'' said Trish Hylton, spokeswoman for the \n     National Rifle Association.\n       She said the Internet ``is like a classified ad. The person \n     selling and the person purchasing have to abide by all the \n     laws that are in place.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S748-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S748-S749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETENTION OF MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer excerpts from \nthree very insightful, thought provoking articles recently published in \nthe U.S. Naval Institute magazine PROCEEDINGS. These articles were \nwritten by enlisted service members on the very important subject of \nretention of enlisted personnel in our Armed Forces. This is one of the \nmost critical issues facing our military services today and I am \nencouraged by the solutions our senior enlisted personnel have offered \nas it shows their deep concern for their people, their service and \ntheir country. Allow me to share with you some of these perceptive \nviews on this complex problem:\n  Senior Chief Navy Counselor Paul T. Pierce, USN writes, ``. . . what \nis the number-one reason that sailors--talented sailors, the ones we \nwant to keep--cite as their greatest dissatisfier? It is not pay or \neven family separation. Those issues always are near the top, but the \nnumber one reason sailors give for separating from the service is lack \nof advancement opportunity.'' He further states, ``The evidence is \nintuitive and irrefutable that we cannot build a force of professionals \nif we afford them virtually zero advancement opportunity. It is really \nthat simple. . . . The fact remains that today's sailors are smart \nenough to grasp that promises of better opportunity made through almost \nten years of draw down simply are not likely to materialize in any \nmeaningful way in a ``steady-state'' Navy. This generation of young \nsailors and junior officers believes it has stupendous opportunities \noutside the Navy. Real or imagined, that siren's call is beckoning to \nthem-imploring them to leave us. At the same time, many of them, \nparticularly our mid-grade, second-term enlisted technicians, have \nqualities that make them highly marketable on the outside. . . . If we \nwant to make real headway retaining sailors, then we must make the \nrestoration of advancement opportunity a readiness imperative.''\n  Master Chief Machinist's Mate James P. Russell, USN writes, \n``Recognizing what sailors need is not an easy task. Sailors will \nalways tell you they want more money. If we continue to chase the \nsailor's paycheck as the retention tool of choice, we will reach a \npoint where we no longer can afford the price. It is unreasonable to \nexpect that the Navy will be able to meet the perks and extras from our \ncompetition. It is the intangibles that will make the sailor stay for a \ncareer. We have things to\n\n[[Page S749]]\n\noffer that no company on earth can match: the opportunity to make a \ndifference; structured guidance and support throughout a career; \nresponsibility at a level unmatched anywhere; a retirement plan that is \nguaranteed to be there at the end of a career; respect recognized \nthroughout the world; the chance to grow and develop in an environment \nthat is tolerant of mistakes; camaraderie that cannot be matched by any \ncorporation; and an opportunity to experience all this in a global \nenvironment.\n  The person who needs to be able to transmit the knowledge of those \nperks to the sailor, and to make sure they are available, is that \nsailor's chief. Sailors are happiest when: they have a clearly defined \nmission; have ownership of their work environment; are held to fair, \nconsistent and sensible standards; their families live in a clean, \nsafe, and relatively comfortable location; and they receive recognition \nand pay that reflect the importance of what they do for their country. \nAs the Navy leadership focuses on the first and the last, the \nresponsibility of fighting for the rest lies squarely on the shoulders \nof the chief. The bottom line? Keep sailors happy and they will stick \naround.''\n  And finally, Master Sergeant Michael M. Green, USAF writes, ``Our \nmilitary and political leadership express serious concern for the ever-\ngrowing retention and recruiting problems facing the enlisted force, \nand have initiated moderate pay improvements to help resolve these \nproblems. Much more can and must be done, however, to address the real \nfinancial needs and expectations of our enlisted warriors. The chief \nshortfalls of the current pay structure are in basic pay, the basic \nallowance for subsistence (BAS) and education incentives.'' He \nconcludes, ``There are innumerable reasons why patriots choose and \ncontinue to serve in our nations military. There are significantly \nfewer reasons why they opt to leave. Financial compensation is the \nchief concern to both young recruits and old wardogs. Fashioning a more \nequitable pay and allowance structure will greatly entice tomorrow's \nwarriors into service as well as to keep today's enlisted force serving \nproudly. . . . Our enlisted force is not composed of second-class \ncitizens. It is a collection of the guardians of our nation and our \nnational interests. It is time they are compensated that way.''\n  These veterans have poignantly put forward their thoughts on a most \ndifficult issue in an honest and sincere fashion. Mr. President, I \nthank you for the opportunity to share their views with you and the \nNation they serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S749-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN HONOR OF JIMMY DON HUDSON\n\n Mr. BREAUX, Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Landrieu, I \nrise with great sorrow on the passing of Jimmy Don Hudson of Monroe, \nLouisiana. He was a friend to me, Senator Landrieu and all those who \nknew him.\n  It has been said that Jimmy Don had a gift that made everyone think \nthey were his best friend. A dedicated husband and father, Jimmy Don \nworked hard every day for the people of Monroe and the state of \nLouisiana.\n  A tireless public servant, Jimmy Don served on numerous boards and \ncommissions. He was president of the Tensas Basin Levee District. He \nalso held leadership roles on, to name a few, the Monroe Chamber of \nCommerce, the Governor's Commission on Higher Education, the Monroe \nDowntown Economic Development District, the West Monroe Boys and Girls \nClub, the United Way of Northeast Louisiana and the Ouachita Council on \nAging.\n  Jimmy Don also served his country in the Vietnam War. As a helicopter \npilot, he logged more than 1,000 hours of flight time while making sure \nboth wounded and able-bodied American soldiers were out of harm's way. \nAfter his tour of duty, Jimmy Don continued his military service in the \nArmy National Guard until 1996, logging an additional 2,800 hours of \nseat time.\n  Mr. President, some say the best people die at an early age. This is \ncertainly true in Jimmy Don's case. Although he only spent 52 years \nwith us on this earth, his legacy will live forever. Senator Landrieu \nand I extend our condolences to his wife Pam, and sons Brandon and \nGabe. Jimmy Don will be sorely missed.\n  I have attached an editorial written by Keith Prince of the Monroe \n(La.) News-Star that describes Jimmy Don well, and request it be \nincluded following my statement.\n\n                   [From the Monroe (La.) News-Star]\n\n                           (By Keith Prince)\n\n       Hudson Was Able To Make Everyone Feel Like His Best Friend\n\n       It's never easy to say goodbye.\n       It is even more difficult when it is someone in the prime \n     of life, at the very pinnacle of his professional and \n     personal life.\n       Jimmy Don Hudson fits that description perfectly.\n       Why his heart failed last Saturday night while in \n     Washington, D.C., attending Mardi Gras festivities is \n     unknown. An avid pilot, Hudson had passed a flight physical \n     exam just two weeks ago.\n       All we do know today is that countless friends feel a very \n     real loss and have his wife, Pam, and sons, Brandon and Gabe, \n     in their thoughts and prayers.\n       There's a lot of great qualities that we will all remember \n     about Jimmy Don, but the list should start with the \n     tremendous dedication he had for his family. He spent a lot \n     of time with his sons and it shows, said longtime friend \n     George Luffey.\n       The uniqueness of this man is his rare ability to easily \n     handle the boundary of business associate-friend that some \n     people never figure out.\n       Jimmy Don was capable of being both a very effective and \n     successful ambassador for BellSouth and at the same time make \n     everyone he knew feel special.\n       The comment Sunday by State Rep. Francis Thompson summed up \n     Jimmy Don perfectly. He had that gift of making everyone \n     think they were his best friend.\n       Personally, anytime we visited I walked away feeling \n     better. He was always positive, uplifting and you had no \n     doubt he was interested in you and what you had going on.\n       Very unassuming, Hudson had moved steadily up the ranks in \n     the corporate world of BellSouth, and I suspect that the \n     company long ago recognized the same qualities that all the \n     rest of us grew to appreciate in this man.\n       He began at what was then South Central Bell working \n     summers in the coin department while a student at Northeast \n     Louisiana State College.\n       Except for a highly decorated tour of duty with the Army \n     during the Vietnam War, Hudson never left the telephone \n     company and next month would have marked his 28th year there.\n       Linda Williams had worked with Jimmy Don in the public \n     relations office at BellSouth since he moved into that \n     department in 1985, and she doesn't remember a bad moment.\n       He was very kind-hearted and wonderful to work with. He was \n     always trying to help others and never sought out any \n     recognition for it. He loved life and I think he made a real \n     difference in the lives of many in our community.\n       Hudson also made a major difference for many wounded \n     American soldiers during the Vietnam War. After going through \n     ROTC at the college and graduating in 1969, he entered the \n     Army as a second lieutenant and later served as an aviation \n     platoon leader and helicopter pilot in Vietnam. One of his \n     assignments was to rescue U.S. soldiers downed in the field.\n       He wouldn't talk much about that, but I understand he had \n     over 1,000 combat hours and was one of the best helicopter \n     pilots over there, said Luffey.\n       Of course, it is impossible to characterize Jimmy Don \n     Hudson without recalling his sense of humor. He was the \n     master of come-backs, said Luffey. You might think you had \n     him pinned down with a comment but he was always able to get \n     in the last word.\n       One of Hudson's lifelong friendships began when, as a high \n     school student, he worked for Jackie Neal, then the director \n     of parks and recreation for the city of Monroe.\n       He did whatever we needed--mow grass, line off the fields, \n     umpire a little. He was something else.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor and \nacknowledgment of African American History Month, a great tradition \nhonoring and celebrating African Americans. This 74 year tradition, \nproposed by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a son of former slaves, seeks to \nbroaden our vision of the world, the legacy of African Americans in our \nnation's history, and their role in our nation's future.\n\n[[Page S750]]\n\n  When Dr. Woodson, the Father of Black History, was earning his \nbachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Chicago, this \ncountry had only the slightest respect for people of color. Dr. \nWilson's devotion to ensuring that Blacks would escape ``the awful fate \nof becoming a negligible factor in world thought'' was ridiculed and \nattacked. However, in the end he prevailed and pioneered the \ncelebration of Negro History Week, now Black History Month. The theme \nfor this year's celebration is ``Heritage and Horizons: The African \nAmerican Legacy and the Challenge of the 21st Century.''\n  The African American legacy in my home state of Illinois is great. \nIllinois is the birthplace of prominent African American writers such \nas Ellis Cose, Charles Johnson and Lorraine Hansberry. Illinois' native \nsons, James Cleveland and Miles Davis, are two of the world's greatest \nmusical composers who transcend racial lines. And beloved daughter of \nIllinois, Katherine Dunham, dancer and choreographer, continues to \nbring the tradition of great African dance to a wide audience.\n  In addition to a rich history in the arts, African American \nIllinoisans also have played a significant role in state, local and \nfederal government. Consider, for example, John Jones, the first \nAfrican American elected to any public office in Cook County; Floy \nClements, the first woman elected to the Illinois legislature; Harold \nWashington, former mayor of Chicago; and Carol Moseley-Braun, the first \nAfrican American woman elected to the United States Senate. These \nAfrican Americans, like those who have come before them, continue to \nshape our nation's history and inspire new generations of African \nAmericans.\n  Today's African Americans have made great strides and overcome a \nvariety of color barriers. The unemployment rate for African Americans \nhas fallen from 14.2% in 1992 to 8.3% in 1999, the lowest annual level \non record. The real wages of African Americans have risen rapidly, over \n5% in the past two years. Moreover, while the African American child \npoverty rate is still too high, it fell to 36.7% in 1998, the lowest \nlevel on record. However, as these data suggest, there is still more \nwork to be done.\n  The rate of firearm-related injuries is still unacceptably high. \nRacial profiling on our highways and in our airports and housing \ndevelopments continues to be a serious problem. The rising cost of \ntuition continues to place ethnic minorities at an academic and \neconomic disadvantage. The poor conditions and quality of too many of \nour schools keep children from low socioeconomic households from \nbreeching the digital divide. Racial disparities in mental health and \nhealth care are pervasive in our society. And in the Chicago \nmetropolitan area, after a two year decline, the number of reported \nAIDS cases has jumped 24 percent. Although African Americans represent \n13% of the US population, they account for more than half of new HIV \ninfections.\n  AIDS knows no boundaries. This month, as we examine and reflect on \nthe legacy and challenges of African Americans, we must not forget our \nbrothers and sisters in Africa. Approximately 23.3 million adults and \nchildren are infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, which has about \n10% of the world's population but nearly 70% of the world's infected \npeople. I recently witnessed the devastation of this deadly virus first \nhand--isolation, prejudice, and a multitude of new orphans. This month, \nas we celebrate the heritage and horizons of African Americans, we must \nask ourselves, what is on the horizon for our African brothers and \nsisters?\n  These are just some of the problems which require our attention if we \nare to fulfill the dreams of visionaries like Dr. Woodson, Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., and other African Americans who continue to serve as \nrole models for all Americans. Dr. Woodson believed in looking back in \norder to look forward. In this special month that seeks to learn from \nthe past and shape our future, we need to examine how to build on the \nlegacy of hope left to us from those who have gone before us.\n  As we move forward into this new millennium, let us extend Dr. \nWoodson's mission past the month of February and make it part of the \nfabric of our lives. Let us look to our forefathers, no matter what \ntheir race, creed, or color, and unite in our diversity to build one \nAmerica and to build a world where every child has hope for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S750-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA 90TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nBoy Scouts of America on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of its \nfounding.\n  From its beginning in 1911, the Boy Scouts has grown in size to more \nthan five million active members in 1999. In the 90 years since its \norigination, the Boy Scouts has influenced more than 100 million boys, \nyoung men, and women. Minnesota scouting officials estimate that in my \nhome state, more than 100,000 young people participate in the program \ntoday.\n  Using goal setting and team building, Boy Scouts develop skills to \novercome obstacles through trial and error. Whether earning their next \nmerit badge or learning how to properly interact with the environment, \nBoy Scouts are able to translate what they have learned through the \nprogram into their families, churches, and communities.\n  Let me also take a moment to commend the almost 500,000 adult \nvolunteers, including 24,000 Minnesotans, who serve as leaders for the \nBoy Scouts. Both men and women serve the Boy Scouts in various \ncapacities ranging from unit leaders to merit badge counselors. The Boy \nScouts of America would certainly not be possible if it were not for \nthe efforts of these stalwart volunteers.\n  Although times have changed, fads come and go, the Boy Scouts \ncontinue to be an effective tool in training our nation's youth. \nThrough the Scouts' core values of helping other people at all times \nand keeping themselves physically strong, mentally awake, and morally \nstraight, scouts impact our communities in many ways. Students who have \nbeen through the Boy Scout program and have adopted these values as \ntheir own are needed now more than ever before.\n  Over the years, the Boy Scouts have produced many of the country's \nmost respected civic, professional, and community leaders. Right here \nin the Senate, 66 of my fellow colleagues have served as a scout, a \nleader, or in some cases, both. With all that the Boy Scouts have done \nfor our country, I hope its next 90 years will be as productive as \nthese first 90 have been.\n  On this 90th anniversary of the founding of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, I wish my very best to the Boy Scouts, not only in Minnesota, \nbut to Scouts across our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S750-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S750-S751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICAN HEART MONTH\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize February \nas American Heart Month. As its sponsoring organization, the American \nHeart Association (AHA) plays a major role in advocacy at both the \nnational and local levels through activities to increase public \nawareness of health concerns. Their messages this month is ``Be an \nAmerican Heartsaver! Know the warning signs of heart attack. Call 9-1-\n1. Give CPR.''\n  These three simple steps are aimed at reducing the number of lives \nlost every day--nearly 700--because the victims were unable to reach a \nhospital in time. The harsh fact is that cardiovascular diseases are \nthe number one killer of men and women. In 1997, 34 percent of deaths \nfrom cardiovascular disease occurred prematurely, before the victims \nreached age 75. In total, more than 953,000 deaths were due to \ncardiovascular disease in 1997; 47 percent of those victims were women \nand 53 percent men.\n  During American Heart Month, thousands of AHA volunteers across the \ncountry canvass neighborhoods to raise funds and provide educational \ninformation about cardiovascular diseases and stroke. This is where the \nAHA makes its mark through its steadfast pursuit to reduce disability \nand death from cardiovascular diseases and stroke. By educating the \nAmerican public about the early warnings signs of heart attacks and \nstroke, the members and volunteers of the AHA know that individuals \nwill be better prepared to save themselves--and others around them.\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\n  The AHA has produced educational kits for Americans of all ages. \nAccordingly to the AHA, helping children understand the early warning \nsigns of heart problems can have a tremendous impact when their family \nis concerned. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation classes provide Americans, \nregardless of their age, with the tools to assist in cardiac \nemergencies.\n  With the many advances medical science has experienced, the list of \nmeasures we can take in prevention of cardiovascular disease continues \nto grow. Controlling high blood pressure and cholesterol, becoming \nactive through regular exercise, and stopping smoking are some of the \neasiest steps to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n  The AHA has emphasized these measures in the hopes of reducing \ncardiovascular disease, stroke, and the risk of these diseases by 25 \npercent over the next eight years. In addition, the AHA runs an Active \nPartnership program for cardiac patients to help them take \nresponsibility for reducing their cardiovascular risks in the future.\n  My state of Minnesota has long been on the frontline of health care \nand a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released last \nweek indicated Minnesota as having the lowest occurrence of \ncardiovascular disease among women nationwide. We must continue to \nreduce the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in Minnesota, but the \nstudy suggests we are already heading in the right direction.\n  As American Heart Month comes to a close, I commend the American \nHeart Association and its army of volunteers for putting their hearts \nto work to see that the hearts of others continue to beat a little bit \nlonger and a little bit stronger. They join a long list of health care-\nrelated organizations, professionals, and industries making Minnesota a \nhealthier place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S751-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL ENGINEERS WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to those \nmen and women who have made the world we live in a better place through \nadvances in engineering. Since 1951, the week that includes George \nWashington's birthday has been dedicated as National Engineers Week \n(EWeek) to increase public awareness and appreciation of the \nengineering profession and technology. Our first president began his \ncareer with agricultural, military, and land surveying skills leading \nto his later recognition as the nation's ``first engineer.''\n  Last year's EWeek summit on ``The Business of Diversity'' gathered \nmore than 100 business, government, and engineering leaders in \nWashington to find ways to increase the number of women and minorities \nin today's engineering workforce. This year, February 20-26 will be \nfiled with activities designed by engineers for future engineers. \nThrough national and local activities, students, women, and minorities \nare the focus of a campaign designed to interest them in a future in \nengineering.\n  ``Discover E'' is a program in which engineers visit K-12 classrooms \nto answer questions and interact with students in designing and \nbuilding small projects. The Future City Competition is for seventh and \neight grade students, and the National Engineering Design Challenge is \na high school program involving teams of students, teachers, and \nengineer mentors. All of these activities are geared toward introducing \nstudents in an interactive, hands-on way to engineering basics and open \ntheir eyes to the engineering inventions that are part of their daily \nlives.\n  Hundreds of 3M engineers in Minneapolis/St. Paul and throughout the \ncountry will visit local schools. In Minneapolis, 3M is organizing a \nreception involving some of the minority engineering student groups at \nthe University of Minnesota and other local colleges. There, 3M \nengineers will talk about career planning and other experiences. Also \nin Minneapolis, The Works, a museum for the entire family, makes \nlearning about technology interesting, understandable, and fun. The \nWorks was created in 1995 with many hands-on, minds-on exhibits about \ntechnology centered on kids ages 5-15.\n  Schools have traditionally focused their teachings on the body of \nscientific knowledge, oftentimes neglecting the process of discovery \nthat engineers use to help create new advances for our modern world. \nWith the support of sponsors like 3M and NASA, programs during EWeek \nintegrate this process of discovery and the use of technology into \nmathematics, science, language arts, and other topics. I am a strong \nsupporter of exposing our children to the world around them and hope \nthis awareness will get them involved and spark their interest in the \nfuture of engineering.\n  EWeek also recognizes the countless engineers who have influenced \nnearly every aspect of our lives as a result of their dedicated work \nand the numerous technological advances they inspired. These \ncontributions were honored at a luncheon in Washington on February 22 \nnaming the 20 Greatest Engineering Achievements of the 20th Century. \nThe winners were chosen for their impact on the quality of life in the \n20th Century, and range from the harnessing of electricity to computer, \ntelephones, and even air conditioning.\n  These are just a few of the many events planned across America this \nweek to urge today's youth from all backgrounds to consider a career in \nengineering. As someone who, early in my career, worked for an \nengineering firm, I appreciate this effort tremendously. I wish to send \nout my thanks to everyone who helps make the EWeek events possible, and \nthe field of engineering exciting and entertaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S751-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for many months now I and other Members of\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\nthe Senate have been coming to the floor of this body to talk about the \nneed for prescription drug coverage for our older people under \nMedicare.\n  We have been going through case histories of stories we have been \nhearing from our States. I have been describing the many older people I \nam hearing from in Oregon where after they are finished paying their \nprescription drug bill, they only have a couple hundred dollars for the \nrest of the month to live on.\n  I talked about instances where older people at home in Oregon are \nactually breaking their Lipitor pills. Lipitor is an important \ncholesterol-lowering drug. A lot of the seniors at home in Oregon can't \nafford to take these vital medicines, and they are actually having to \nbreak them in half in order to try to meet their health care needs. It \nis just outrageous to think that in a country as rich and as powerful \nand good as ours so many of our seniors walk on this economic \ntightrope.\n  I have come to the floor repeatedly over the last few months to talk \nabout the need for bipartisan legislation that would address the needs \nof older people and secure important Medicare coverage for them.\n  I believe there is now genuine interest in reconciling the several \nbills before the Senate on this issue and a real opportunity to enact \ngood legislation that can generate overwhelming support in this body \nand get the senior citizens of this country the help they need.\n  I have spoken, for example, with the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, several times this week on this subject. He is very interested \nin bringing Senators with varying approaches on this issue together so \nwe find the common ground to get help for older people.\n  I especially want to praise my colleague from Maine, our friend, \nSenator Snowe. She and I have worked together for 14 months now--for \nmore than a year starting with the budget resolution last year--to come \nup with a bipartisan plan to address this enormous need of older \npeople.\n  Before I describe some of the new cases we are getting from seniors \nacross the country, I will talk about some areas where I think there is \ncommon ground, the common ground I have heard Senator Daschle and \nothers talking about in recent days. For example, I think Senators \noverwhelmingly believe there ought to be a significant role for \nmarketplace forces in the delivery of this benefit. Certainly we differ \nabout the details. We recognize that. I will not have the last word on \nthis subject. I think virtually all Senators believe there ought to be \na significant role for marketplace forces on this issue.\n  Second, I think there is overwhelming support for the proposition \nthat this program ought to be a voluntary program. Senators and others \nhave learned the lesson from the catastrophic care bill when a lot of \nthe older people in this country said: This is something I am already \ngetting; I don't want it required; I think my money can be spent better \nelsewhere.\n  This time, I see Senators with varying political philosophies \ndesiring to make sure this benefit is voluntary.\n  I think Senators overwhelmingly are interested in making sure this \nprescription drug coverage for older people is consistent with long-\nterm Medicare reform. Many want to have comprehensive Medicare reform \nin this session of Congress. It may still be doable. I prefer going \nthat route. If it is not possible to have comprehensive Medicare \nreform, I can tell Members that Senator Snowe and I have teamed up over \nthe last several months in an effort to make sure the prescription drug \ncoverage program is consistent with long-term Medicare reform.\n  Finally, we want to make sure this benefit is adequately funded. In \nthe last session of Congress, 54 Members of the Senate voted for the \nSnowe-Wyden amendment with respect to funding. We brought together \nSenator Wellstone, Senator Abraham, Senator Kennedy, Senator Santorum, \nSenators of all political philosophies of both political parties. Mr. \nPresident, 54 voted for allocating dollars for a prescription drug \nprogram. There is an opportunity now to find the common ground.\n  I want to describe a few of the accounts I have heard from at home \nthat made it clear to me why it is so important that Senators come \ntogether and enact this program for the elderly. I heard recently from \nan elderly woman in Deschutes County in central Oregon. She is 83 years \nold; she lives at her sister's. She and her 79-year-old husband take 12 \ndrugs to cover diabetes, hypertension, and a variety of ailments. Their \nsole source of income is Social Security. They spend nearly 25 percent \nof their income now on prescription drugs.\n  In Clatsop County, a retired couple in their seventies from \nWarrenton, OR, is spending $450 a month on prescription drugs. If they \nhave another increase in their supplemental insurance--and we all know \nthe vast majority of seniors have these supplemental policies, and we \nall know in almost every instance they go up--this older couple has \ntold me they will have to stop taking their medication altogether.\n  An older woman in Coos County, aged 75, getting by on only $813 a \nmonth, is spending well over $200 of that $800 on prescription \nmedicine.\n  I could go on with these cases. I have done that on more than 20 \noccasions in the last few months on the floor of the Senate, trying \ncontinually to bring before the body 3 or 4 cases that highlight how \ngreat the need is and how important it is we address this issue.\n\n  I believe the President of the United States wants this issue \naddressed in a bipartisan way. I have talked with him about this \nsubject. He recognizes how urgent it is that seniors get this coverage. \nI think he made it clear in the State of the Union Address he wants to \nwork with Members of Congress of both political parties to get this \ndone.\n  We have accomplished a great deal in the last 14 months. Fourteen \nmonths ago when Senator Snowe and I brought this issue to the Budget \nCommittee, I think we were essentially looked at as well-meaning souls \nbut people who just did not have much of a prospect of seeing this go \nforward. Now we see the issue of prescription drug coverage as one of \nthe two or three most pressing domestic issues. The American people are \ndisgusted.\n  Our job now--and I commend Senator Daschle, but I know there are a \nnumber of colleagues on the other side of the aisle who feel the same \nway--is to reconcile these various bills. We want to make sure we build \non private health insurance.\n  There has been a lot of talk in the last few days about whether \nprivate health insurance companies would be interested in this program. \nHaving talked with them at home in Oregon, they are definitely going to \nbe interested in this program because what we envisage doing, what \nessentially all the bills envisage doing, is having the Government pick \nup the prescription drug portion of a senior's private health insurance \nprogram. That is what is going to go on here. We will not set up new \nbureaucracies and redtape. We will be looking at an effort to have this \nprogram pick up the prescription drug portion of a senior's private \nhealth insurance. We want to use marketplace forces to the greatest \npossible extent. We want older people to have bargaining power in the \nmarketplace.\n  Right now, Medicare does not cover prescriptions, but the older \nperson who walks into a pharmacy perhaps in Rhode Island, Oregon, or \nany other part of the country and does not have prescription drug \ncoverage, in effect, has to subsidize the big buyers of prescription \nmedicine. If, for example, you are a younger worker and have the good \nfortune of having a company health plan that covers prescription drugs, \nthat company plan can go out and negotiate a discount. The senior, \nwithout any coverage, walks into the pharmacy, doesn't get that same \nrate, and in effect has to actually subsidize those who do have the \ngood fortune of having a health plan where they can have some real \nbargaining power. That is not right. Vulnerable seniors deserve a fair \nshake. They deserve to be able to secure their medicine at an \naffordable price.\n  I believe the cases I brought to the floor of the Senate tonight \nagain show how urgent the need is for this benefit. I believe there are \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who want to reconcile the various \nbills that have been introduced on this issue. I have teamed up with \nSenator Snowe on this matter now for 14 months. We don't think we have \nthe last word on this issue. We want to work with colleagues to find \nthe common ground, to get the help to\n\n[[Page S753]]\n\nolder people that they deserve. Senator Daschle has told me a number of \ntimes recently that is what he wants to do. I believe colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle wish to do so as well.\n\n  The hour is late. I do not want to keep the Senate in any longer than \nnecessary, but I intend to keep coming back to the floor, bringing to \nthe Senate these truly poignant cases of how great the need is in this \ncountry to cover prescription drug costs of the Nation's older people.\n  I look forward to working with the Presiding Officer of the Senate, a \nnew Member of this body, and one from a very special family, in my \nopinion, because his father was so kind to me as a new Senator. I know \nhe shares many of the same concerns I have, that we address this issue \nin a bipartisan fashion.\n  I am going to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate talking \nabout why this is so important and why it is so important for the \nSenate to bring these various bills together.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/23/senate-section/article/S753-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11:30 A.M.
