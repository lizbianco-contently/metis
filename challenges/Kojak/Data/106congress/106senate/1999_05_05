Mr. President, let me read the resolving clause of the \nresolution on which we are about to vote.\n\n       (1) The Senate commends the Reverend Jesse Jackson for his \n     successful efforts in securing the release of Sergeant \n     Ramirez, Sergeant Stone, and Specialist Gonzales and for his \n     leadership and actions arising from his deep faith in God; \n     and\n       (2) The Senate joins the families of Sergeant Ramirez, \n     Sergeant Stone, and Specialist Gonzales in expressing relief \n     and joy of their safe release.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Two days ago, when that military \ntransport plane touched down at Andrews Air Force Base and we saw our \nthree American soldiers safe again at last, I said, instinctively, \n``thank you.''\n  ``Thank you, God, and thank you, Jesse Jackson, for bringing Steven \nGonzales, Andrew Ramirez and Christopher Stone safely home from their \ncaptivity in Serbia.'' Millions of people all across our country, I \nsuspect, said much the same thing. I am pleased today to repeat those \nwords here, in the United States Senate, and to support this resolution \nhonoring Reverend Jackson and the others in his delegation who played \nsuch a critical role in securing the release of our service men.\n  ``When I was in prison, you visited me.'' That was one of the ways \nJesus said we could recognize those who do his work. In daring to visit \nour soldiers in prison in Serbia, Reverend Jackson and the delegation \nof religious leaders who accompanied him surely were following Jesus's \nteachings as they understood them. Our nation owes them a debt of \ngratitude.\n  Some have questioned the wisdom of the delegation's trip. There has \nbeen speculation about what effect their going to Serbia could have on \npolitical or military tactics. Frankly, I don't want to get into that \ndebate. This was not a political or military mission. It was a \nhumanitarian mission.\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\n  Much praise rightly goes to Reverend Jackson, who organized the trip. \nI also want to acknowledge another member of the delegation: \nCongressman Rod Blagojevich, a second-term Congressman from Chicago's \nNorth Side, and the only Serbian-American in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  There are moments in history where a person emerges who seems almost \nto have been born to fulfill a critical role. On this mission, Rod \nBlagojevich was that person. Not only is he a man of significant \npolitical and moral courage, he is also the son of Yugoslav immigrants. \nHis father spent four years in a Nazi POW camp during World War II. He \nlearned to speak Serbo-Croation as a child, and still speaks it.\n  I remember when I first was elected to the House. I sought out \nseveral of my political heroes to ask them ``How can a young \nCongressman make a difference--a real difference--in people's lives?'' \nRod Blagojevich has found an answer to that question. Steven Gonzales, \nAndrew Ramirez and Christopher Stone are united today with their \nfamilies, in large measure because of the courage he, and Reverend \nJackson, and the other religious leaders in their delegation displayed \nin going to Serbia.\n  Today's Washington Post contains an interesting account of their \nmission, from the time it was first conceived by Reverend Jackson \nthrough their triumphant return home. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 5, 1999]\n\n  Mission Accomplished: The Congressman Who Pulled Strings for POWs' \n                                Release\n\n                           (By Kevin Merida)\n\n       The interview begins with a little shake-rattle-and-roll. \n     Rod Blagojevich doing Elvis Presley.\n       ``I'm all shook up, unh-hunh-hunh.''\n       Blagojevich is a huge fan of The King (``Do you think he's \n     still alive?''), and he's feeling loose. It's not often--\n     let's say never--that a second-term congressman from the \n     North Side of Chicago can thrust himself onto the \n     international stage, help rescue three Americans held captive \n     and claim a patch of glory. That would be the patch right \n     behind Jesse Jackson's. Meaning he's in all the brought-back-\n     our-boys camera shots, but not prominently placed. But he's \n     okay with that. Blagojevich is the boyish-looking dude with \n     the mop of brown hair combed to the left, a cross between \n     John Travolta and Henry Winkler. He sometimes takes his meals \n     at Ben's Chili Bowl on U Street. No one recognizes him there. \n     Maybe someone will recognize him now.\n       Without Rod Blagojevich (pronounced bla-GOYA-vich), there \n     might not have been a trip to Belgrade, no meeting with \n     President Slobodan Milosevic, no tearful family reunions this \n     week for U.S. soldiers Christopher Stone, Andrew Ramirez and \n     Steven Gonzales. Blagojevich was the arranger, working his \n     contacts in the Serbian American community when it looked \n     like the trip was dead. Those contacts ultimately cleared a \n     path to Milosevic himself.\n       Not that the whole country is applauding. Some \n     administration officials carped--anonymous carping is the \n     best fun of all--that the unofficial Jackson peace mission \n     only undercut the NATO bombing campaign and could potentially \n     fracture the allies. Not to mention that it might damage \n     President Clinton's credibility at home on the war. Pundits \n     spouted: PR props for the Serb-led Yugoslav government.\n       ``If Mother Teresa had been one of those prisoners and we \n     had gotten her out, we would have been criticized,'' \n     Blagojevich says. ``I guess if you're not being criticized, \n     you're not important. But it's thrilling to be in the mix. It \n     sure beats digging a ditch for a living.''\n       Blagojevich, 42, a Democrat, is the only House member of \n     Serbian descent, which is perhaps the key part of this story. \n     He grew up speaking both English and Serbo-Croatian. Still \n     does. His father, Rade, was an immigrant to this country. A \n     Yugoslavian army officer, Rade Blagojevich was captured by \n     the Nazis in World War II and spent four years in a German \n     POW camp. He eventually made his way to the United States and \n     married a Chicago-born woman whose parents had emigrated from \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n       Together they tried to raise Rod and his brother as \n     Americans, but as Americans with a rich understanding of \n     their ancestry. Often, their mother would pull in one \n     direction and their father would tug in the other.\n       It was one thing to play the tamburitza, a ukulele-like \n     instrument; it was another thing to sport the white-socks-\n     and-sandals look that his dad thought was authentically \n     Yugoslav.\n       ``I don't want to wear that,'' he told his father. ``I'm \n     going to get laughed out of the neighborhood if I wear that. \n     That's a bad look.''\n       Blagojevich parents have passed away, but it is with their \n     memory in mind and all that he has learned about Serb culture \n     over the years that he injected himself into this war. He \n     felt he had a unique perspective to offer. Ironically, some \n     in the Serbian community here have been disappointed in him \n     for not being more active in Serbain American affairs.\n       Shortly after the soldiers were captured on March 31, \n     Blagojevich telephoned national security adviser Samuel \n     ``Sandy'' Berger and White House chief of staff John Podesta \n     to offer his help. Nothing grew out of those calls. He then \n     read in the newspapers that Jackson wanted to take a \n     delegation of American religious leaders over to visit the \n     soldiers and try to win their release. Jackson was having \n     trouble getting guarantees from Milosevic that the delegation \n     could even see the GIs.\n       Blagojevich approached Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) on \n     the House floor and mentioned that he had some contacts who \n     might be able to help. The younger Jackson put Blagojevich in \n     contact with his father. Blagojevich got to work. Soon, he \n     was talking directly to Yugoslavian deputy premier Vuk \n     Draskovic. Things were working out. Draskovic had assured the \n     group's safety and a visit with the soldiers. The soldiers \n     would be allowed to talk to their families. He'd get it in \n     writing. The trip was back on. Except on the eve of \n     departure, the maverick Draskovic was axed.\n       Blagojevich recalls the Rev. Jackson's reaction to that \n     development as they were hashing out last-minute details for \n     the trip in Washington. He lapses into his Jackson \n     impersonation. ``Blagojevich, our boy just got fired. You got \n     any others out there?''\n       Actually, Blagojevich did.\n       Once in Belgrade, it was Jackson who set the agenda, \n     Jackson who commanded the spotlight. Blagojevich, as he put \n     it, ``worked the corridors'' and took advantage of his \n     ``cultural connection'' and ability to speak the language.\n       As Blagojevich explained his role in a conversation in his \n     office yesterday, he pulled out two business cards. Nebojsa \n     Vujovic, spokesman for the Federal Ministry of Foreign \n     Affairs, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. They had a common \n     friend in Chicago. Bogoljub Karic, minister without \n     portfolio, Republic of Serbia. He had met with this guy in \n     his congressional office two days before the bombing \n     campaign. He later saw the same man on TV emerging from a \n     Milosevic cabinet meeting.\n       While all the attention was focused on Jackson, Blagojevich \n     says, ``it was proper and part of the strategy to be working \n     these other guys. He and I were working different angles.''\n       Jackson and Blagojevich both were in the three-hour meeting \n     with Milosevic on Saturday morning that produced the release \n     of the American prisoners the next day. Jackson then met with \n     Milosevic privately.\n       The trip produced some light moments amid all the intensity \n     and emotion--Blogojevich, a member of the House Armed \n     Services Committee, greeted Sgt. Stone by promising him a \n     raise--but there were no light moments with Milosevic.\n       ``I detected absolutely no warmth toward me,'' Blagojevich \n     says. ``In fact, I detected a decided lack of warmth.''\n       A lack of warmth? Could it be that Milosevic remembered \n     that this Chicago congressman had pronounced him guilty of \n     ``ethnic cleansing'' and compared his tactics to those of \n     Nazi leaders?\n       Once back home, Jackson, Blagojevich and others met at the \n     White House Monday evening with Clinton. Secretary of State \n     Madeleine Albright was there. Berger was there. Vice \n     President Gore dropped by for a moment.\n       Jackson gave a detailed explanation and interpretation of \n     what the delegation heard and saw in Belgrade. He said that \n     Milosevic's gesture deserved to be matched. He talked of \n     other leaders who were so far apart, but had talked to each \n     other and had become closer over time. Sadat and Begin.\n       ``Then I was up,'' recalled Blagojevich, who told Clinton \n     that the Serbs weren't backing down. He pitched his proposal \n     for a partition of Kosovo, which would give Serbs control of \n     the northern region where most of the Orthodox cathedrals and \n     historic sites important to them are located. An autonomous \n     homeland would be created in the south for the ethnic \n     Albanians driven out by Milosevic's forces.\n       ``I like Clinton. I'm happy I voted to impeach him. I do \n     think he needs to step up to the plate and take charge of \n     this. With all due respect, I think Madeleine Albright and \n     Sandy Berger are running the show.''\n       Blagojevich says he is ``extremely skeptical'' that the \n     bombing campaign will be successful. The NATO allies have \n     underestimated the Serbs' resolve, he believes. ``Despite the \n     bombs, daily life goes on.'' The timing for a negotiated \n     solution is right, he thinks.\n       The administration apparently thinks not.\n       ``They were on a mission of peace and it was successful,'' \n     says National Security Council spokesman David Leavy of the \n     Jackson-led group, ``but the fundamental reality remains the \n     same. There are a million Kosovars who are not going home to \n     their families.''\n       However the war ends, the Jackson-Blagojevich bond has \n     strengthened.\n       ``I feel like I'm a second cousin now,'' Blagojevich says.\n       The younger Jackson puts the relationship in context: \n     Blagojevich's father-in-law, Alderman Dick Mell, is a \n     longtime Chicago machine boss. Blagojevich's district, 1 \n     percent black, is a bastion of white ethnic pride. For\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\n     many years, it was represented by Dan Rostenkowski. It is not \n     a district in which Jesse Jackson and Jesse Jackson Jr. are \n     exactly popular.\n       ``Us relating to Rod and Rod relating to us is something \n     taboo,'' Rep. Jackson explains, noting that although he and \n     Blagojevich and their wives have grown close personally, he \n     understands that the North Side member takes flak for the \n     association.\n       ``You being part of that Jackson thing is really going to \n     cost you your career,'' says Jackson Jr., imitating his \n     friend's critics. ``But after this trip, he is now officially \n     an honorary South Sider. Apparently, it was a great growing \n     experience for both him and Reverend Jackson.''\n       After his 15 minutes of fame at Jackson's side, \n     Blagojevich's only question is this: ``When do I take my seat \n     on the back bench again?''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will vote for this resolution because I \nshare in the happiness and relief that the families of Sergeant \nRamirez, Sergeant Stone, and Specialist Gonzales, and all Americans \nfeel now that these fine young men have been released from captivity. \nWe are all thankful that they are home, safe from harm.\n  I do not believe, however, that private diplomacy that is at odds \nwith our country's objectives in this war and public relations stunts \nby Mr. Milosevic deserve our praise. I cannot commend the participation \nof any American in his propaganda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4727-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Inhofe and myself, \nCongressmen J.C. Watts, Frank Lucas and Steve Largent, as well as the \nGovernor of Oklahoma, and James Lee Witt, Director of FEMA, toured the \nOklahoma tornado disaster.\n  I have been in the Senate, I guess, 19 years now, and I have looked \nat the damage of several tornadoes in the State for the last many \nyears. But I have never seen this type of devastation nor this level \nand this extent before. This may be the most devastating tornado that \nwe have had in total damages in our State history. It has certainly \nproduced one of the largest tornadoes, probably the largest number of \ntornadoes. I read one press account that said there were 45 tornadoes \nin the State of Oklahoma on Monday. One particular tornado was much \nlarger than the others. Many reports said it was a quarter of a mile \nwide, or maybe half a mile wide, and at some points it was maybe a mile \nwide and stayed on the ground for a long period of time--some people \nsaid maybe as much as 2 hours.\n  What we did see was a tremendous amount of damage--a devastating \namount of damage that destroyed, it was estimated, 1,500 or 2,000 \nhomes. We will find out. Unfortunately, it has taken 40-some lives. I \nsay unfortunately. I think Oklahoma is very fortunate. I think the \nfatality toll could have been in the hundreds if not thousands, because \nwe looked at homes that were just totally demolished as if a bomb had \ngone inside each one of those homes and absolutely exploded the homes. \nThere was nothing but just some elements of rubble. To think that \npeople survived in many of these homes is truly a blessing, truly a \nmiracle that I think we will find recounted day after day.\n  Needless to say, we are moved by the tragedy, and also by the \ncompassion that is being expressed by so many people from across the \ncountry.\n  We were there to say that we wanted to help, that our government \nwould help, that we will do everything that we can. Our government \nsteps in in times of tragedy and national disasters to help lend \nassistance. And we will do that.\n  I will also say that won't be enough. It will take a lot of support \nfrom individuals, from churches, from communities, from families and \nfriends to try to replace these homes and these families, and to make \nthem whole again. And they will. They will survive. They are very \nsolid.\n  One of the things I will never forget was seeing this area that is \ntotally demolished and one house which hardly had anything left \nstanding, and there was an American flag flying very high with people \nvery proud.\n  Mr. President, it makes me proud to be an Oklahoman. It makes me \nproud to be an American, and proud to represent the great people of \nOklahoma.\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, in Oklahoma we have gone through tragedies that are \nindescribable. The Murrah Federal Office Building was the most \nsignificant terrorist attack on domestic soil in the history of \nAmerica. It is one that you can't describe standing here on the Senate \nfloor. I have been there. And I remember so well the thundering march, \nthe cadence of the fire trucks as they were going to try to extract so \nmany people out of the building, and all types of volunteers.\n\n  We saw the same thing yesterday. It was indescribable. I note the \nstory of a horse that was picked up and taken a quarter of a mile in \nthe air, and dropped on top of a car, then a car on top of a house, and \nthe twisted ``I'' beams. The power, the indescribable power that was \nthere.\n  James Lee Witt--I am very complimentary of James Lee Witt, a man I \nhave known long before he was Director of FEMA. As chairman of the \ncommittee that has jurisdiction over FEMA, I work very closely with \nhim. And I tell you right now, he had his hands on there. He was \npersonally involved in it. He explained to us that this is the most \nsignificant tornado that he had seen in terms of the devastating damage \nand power that was there.\n  You always remember one or two things. I recall in the helicopter \nride going across a little town called Moore, OK. Everything was \ndevastated in that town, except right across the street from the most \ndevastating part of this tornado stood the First Baptist Church of \nMoore, OK. It had been untouched.\n  As my senior Senator from Oklahoma said, we are so appreciative of \neveryone coming together, for all of the comments of our colleagues \nsince we have been back, the prayers that we had this morning from the \nSenate Chaplain and others, and people like the Governor of Oklahoma, \nthe mayor of Oklahoma City throughout yesterday, the police departments \nand the fire departments, all of the volunteers, and certainly FEMA \nbringing this all together.\n  We are very thankful, and we in Oklahoma will be bound to that. We \nask for your continued prayers for the families, for those who lost \ntheir lives, and for the families of those who lost their lives.\n  I thank very much all of the government coming together to help us \nrebuild the damage that has been done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business for a period of up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4728-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4728-S4729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KANSAS TORNADOES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the State of Kansas was also hit by the \nsame system that hit Oklahoma which caused so much tragedy and damage. \nI would like to speak for a few minutes on that.\n  We had a number of families that had homes destroyed. We had five \npeople killed in Kansas, hundreds were injured, and thousands of people \nlost their homes and businesses. I know they are in the hearts and \nminds of all Americans today, and we will stand ready to assist in that \nin any way we can.\n  The devastation that these tornadoes left in their paths is just \nshocking.\n  I want to show you a picture of the aftermath. This was actually \ntaken of the damage that took place in Moore, OK. You can just see the \ndevastating power that is in one of these systems that can rise up so \nfast and cause so much destruction. In Wichita, the trail of \ndestruction was 15 miles long and 5 miles wide.\n\n  As I mentioned previously, five Kansans lost their lives, and more \nthan 70 people were injured from the fatal twisters.\n  More than 500 homes have been damaged or destroyed, leaving many \npeople homeless.\n  I have the second picture that I wanted to show people, a view of \nwhat has taken place. This is an aerial view of the Lake Shore Trailer \nPark in South Wichita. You can see where the path of the tornado was, \nwhere it was the most intense going through with just absolute \ndestruction in the wake of that path of where it went through.\n  More than 50,000 people have been left without power.\n  Sedgwick County, KS, where Wichita is located, has reported that over \n1,100 structures were destroyed, and more than 7,100 structures were \ndamaged.\n  In the town of Haysville, right next to Wichita, 27 businesses have \nbeen wiped out, and virtually eliminating the business district of this \nWichita suburb.\n  The father of one of my staffers--the person who is actually my \nscheduler--is the principal of Chisolm Life Skills Center in Wichita. \nHis entire school was demolished by this tornado.\n  We are very proud of the rapid response of people who have reached \nout to help us through this terrible tragedy--the State and local \nauthorities in Kansas, the rescue personnel, the Kansas National Guard, \nFEMA, and citizens of the Wichita area. They have really reached out in \nthat typical Midwestern tradition of helping others when they are \nhaving difficulty.\n  I am also pleased to report that the President has responded quickly \nto the situation in both Kansas and Oklahoma by ordering Federal relief \nto those counties hit by these devastating tornadoes. The American Red \nCross and the Salvation Army have provided 800 numbers for those \nwishing to help victims of these disasters.\n  I have pictures of a couple of victims. This apartment complex was \ndestroyed in the wake of the path of the tornado. This is a picture of \nSuzie Dooley and her daughter, Sarah, who is 13, and their family dog, \nWilma, trying to gather themselves after losing their mobile home near \n55th Street, South, in Wichita. Their faces show the destruction they \nhave been through, but also the hope and thanks they are alive and were \nnot injured in the process.\n  The Red Cross and Salvation Army are offering shelter for people in \nWichita who need help. The Red Cross has an 800 number, 800-HELP-NOW, \nto contact to provide help. We can provide a local phone number. They \nare on the Internet at www.DisasterRelief.org. Funds can be sent to the \nAmerican Red Cross in Wichita. The Salvation Army has an 800 number as \nwell.\n  I know the nature of Kansans and Americans is to help one another in \na time of need. I will work with Federal and State authorities to \nprovide fast and effective relief to families and communities harmed by \nthis natural disaster.\n  I know I speak for my Senate colleague, my fellow Senator from \nKansas, Senator Pat Roberts, in saying we will continue to keep the \nvictims and their families in our actions, thoughts, and prayers as we \nhope much of the rest of the country will in this very difficult time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am sure all of our colleagues express \nour deep sympathy to the Senators from Oklahoma and Kansas and the \ncommunities that were so devastated by these storms.\n  We have all seen these disasters happen, and then the inspiration \nthat Senator Nickles alluded to, with everyone coming together. \nClearly, this takes a lot of effort and a long time to dig out.\n  Our prayers will be with these Senators and these citizens of the \nfine States of Oklahoma and Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I add my words to those who talked about \nthe tragedy in Oklahoma this morning. I remember watching television \nlast night and seeing the power and the destructive might of those \nstorms that swept across Oklahoma and parts of Kansas as well.\n  I have a feeling for what the people are going through, as a result \nof the disasters that hit North Dakota in 1997. We had the worst flood \nin 500 years in Grand Forks, ND, and we had 95 percent of the town \nevacuated, the largest mass evacuation of a city in the United States \nsince the Civil War. I know the trauma those people are facing, and I \nknow the difficulty of recovery.\n\n[[Page S4729]]\n\n  Our hearts go out to the people in Oklahoma and Kansas who have been \nso affected. I hope they know that we are prepared to respond and to \nhelp. We in North Dakota remember very well how people reached out a \nhelping hand to our State, so many people from around the country who \nactually came to North Dakota to help us rebuild--the Red Cross, the \nother organizations, the Salvation Army. We had a woman from California \nwho came to town and gave $2,000 to every family that had been \naffected, a gift of tens of millions of dollars.\n  We remember very well the Federal Government's rapid response, the \nagencies of the Federal Government that moved to assist the people who \nwere affected. FEMA did an absolutely superb job under the leadership \nof James Lee Witt. We will never forget it. The Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, under the leadership of Secretary Cuomo, did a \nsuperb job, and we will never forget their help. The SBA was quick to \nmove in to help businesses. We know all of those agencies will be ready \nto respond in Oklahoma and Kansas as well.\n  I hope that we see the Congress respond. I believe the people in \nOklahoma and Kansas deserve the same kind of rapid and full response \nthat we received in North Dakota. Frankly, I hope they don't face some \nof the delays we faced in trying to get a congressional response, \nbecause when people are devastated, they should not have to wait for \nhelp. This Government is big enough and strong enough and this country \nis generous enough to move to help immediately.\n  Mr. President, again, our hearts go out to the people in Oklahoma and \nKansas who have lived through this trauma; and to those who have lost \nrelatives and loved ones, we share their deep sorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4729-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4729-S4733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this week is Teacher Appreciation Week. \nYesterday was National Teacher Day.\n  For a number of our colleagues, education is such a core subject--\nboth of the 105th Congress and now in the 106th Congress--Members want \nto express themselves on this subject.\n  I am joined today by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi with \nsome opening remarks about Teacher Appreciation Week.\n  I yield up to 4 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me congratulate my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia, for organizing this special order \nand allowing this opportunity to speak on the subject of Teacher \nAppreciation Week.\n\n\n      Tribute to Tina Scholtes, Mississippi's Teacher of the Year\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Senate \nResolution proclaiming this week Teacher Appreciation Week.\n  This week, in every state, students and parents are taking time to \nthank the school teachers, and we should too. They are the true heroes \nin our nation's effort to enrich the lives of all our citizens through \neducation.\n  I want to pay tribute today to a special Mississippi teacher. She is \nMississippi Teacher of the Year, Mrs. Tina Fisher Scholtes, of Sudduth \nElementary School in Starkville, Mississippi. Tina has been an \nelementary school teacher for sixteen years. She has spent the past \nfourteen years teaching first grade in Starkville.\n  First grade lays the foundation for formal education. Every parent \nhopes their child will begin school with an excellent teacher. Tina \nScholtes is without a doubt an excellent teacher. Being an excellent \nteacher requires hard work, along with respect for children and an \nunderstanding of the learning process. Tina has those attributes and \nmore. She also cares about outcomes. She wants all her students to \nsucceed.\n  Beyond the Masters Degree she earned at Mississippi State University, \nTina has completed professional development for teaching reading and \nmathematics; the special needs of teaching deaf students; National \nBoard Certification; and training other teachers. Her resume is \nevidence of her capacity for gaining knowledge and sharing it with \nothers. While continuing her first grade teaching, she has returned to \nMississippi State University where as a clinical instructor she directs \nthe activities of student teachers.\n  Tina has brought new teaching techniques into the schools where she \nhas taught. She serves as a mentor to new teachers and has developed \nschool wide curriculum reforms. She also has used local television \nprograms to provide early childhood education lessons to parents.\n  Another indication that she is a dedicated teacher is her \nparticipation in the Parent Teacher Association where she served as \nPresident while teaching at Emerson Elementary School. Tina recognizes \nthe importance of teachers participating in the community and is active \nin her church, and in other community activities.\n  I was very pleased that Tina Scholtes took time to visit my office \nwhen she was in Washington recently for the National Teacher of the \nYear recognition events.\n  I congratulate her on all her successes. The first graders in \nStarkville, Mississippi are lucky, indeed, to begin their lives as \nstudents with Tina Scholtes, and we are all grateful to her for being \nsuch a good example for other teachers to follow.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield up to 4 minutes to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Labor-Education Committee, Senator \nJeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Jeffords is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to participate in \nhonoring our teachers in National Teacher Appreciation Week.\n  I think we all remember those early years of our lives when we \nstarted school. I still remember the first day of first grade. I \nremember going to school in my father's hand and fearing what was going \nto happen to me. I remember Mrs. Anderson who greeted us all \nindividually at the door and how immediately I warmed up to her. It was \nthen I realized this really wasn't going to be as bad as I thought. I \ncan even remember where my seat was that year.\n  Ms. Maughn, in second grade, was another wonderful person. The \nteacher I remember more was Viola Burns, my third grade teacher. That \nwas the beginning of World War II. She realized I needed a little \nfurther work so she had me read Time magazine and come back to her to \ntalk about it. I also had her in the sixth grade. She was an incredible \nindividual who helped shape my life.\n  Then fourth grade was ``teacher unappreciation year''--I don't want \nto remember that. We rebelled. We ran through five teachers before we \nsettled down. I wiped that from my memory. I feel sorry for those five \nteachers.\n  I think everyone has memories and understands what an incredible help \na teacher can be in our lives.\n  My mother was a music and art teacher; my sister, a third grade \nteacher; my niece is a teacher; the man across the street was the \nprincipal of our high school.\n  Those schools are gone. My former elementary school is now a private \nschool, a Christian church school; middle school is the fire station; \nmy high school is now the middle school.\n  I still remember the teachers. It is not brick and mortar but the \nteachers that make a difference. Dindo Rivera goes around the country \ntalking about the changes in education and how important it is. If an \noffice worker had fallen asleep 20 years ago, woke up and walked \nthrough a modern office, they would be in incredible despair. They \nwouldn't know what to do. They wouldn't know how to answer the phone.\n  But he goes on to say that if a teacher had the same experience of \nfalling asleep and waking up now, that teacher would walk into the \nclassroom and find that not much had changed. But the world has changed \nand our teachers cannot be made the scapegoats. We should not indicate \nthat it is their problem. We, as a nation, have to recognize the \nteachers need help and we have to give it to them. That means we have \nto develop professional training. We have to be sure our colleges are \nproducing teachers who are well qualified. At the same time, we have to \nrecognize that our Nation will not prosper if we do not realize it is \nthe teachers who make the difference. We are increasing standards and \ndoing all these things to envelop them with modern technology\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\nwhich is difficult to understand, especially if you don't have more \nthan 10 minutes in a day to even think about those things.\n  I think it is incredibly important we all remember the teachers, \nespecially this year, since the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nis up for reauthorization. This is our moment, at a critical time in \nour history, when we must take a look at the problems and the demands \nand the difficulties that are presented to our teachers and devise the \nmeans to help them help us become the Nation we all want to be.\n  Let's think about our teachers today, remember what they did for us, \nand think about what we can do for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I want to personally thank you for \narranging for us to take this time out of our busy schedules to \nrecognize teachers during Teacher Appreciation Week.\n  Providing the brightest future for our nation's children is one of \nthe most important things we will do here on the floor of the Senate. \nAfter parents and families, America's teachers play the leading role in \nhelping our children reach their potential. Therefore, it gives me \ngreat pleasure to join in tribute to our nation's outstanding educators \nand recognize a few of the top teachers in my home state of Idaho.\n  We all know the impact of teachers. Five days a week, for 9 months of \nevery year, nearly 3 million teachers in this country help mold our \nchildren's future. I believe in the quality education our teachers, \nadministrators, and others provide in Idaho. That is why my children \ncontinue to reside in the great State of Idaho. My wife Susan and I \nmade the decision nearly 7 years ago when I was first elected to \nCongress that she and our children would remain in Idaho. We wanted our \nchildren to continue to receive the quality education they now \nexperience in Idaho's public school system.\n  That quality education takes many faces. I want to show you one of \nthem this morning. Judy Bieze lives in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and teaches \nfirst grade at Hayden Meadows Elementary in nearby Hayden Lake.\n  Mrs. Bieze was honored this year by the State of Idaho as Teacher of \nthe Year. But she is more than that; she is also a local softball coach \nand a Sunday school teacher, so I guess that makes her a teacher 7 days \na week.\n  During each school year Mrs. Bieze gives individual attention to her \nstudents by profiling each one as the ``Special and Unique'' person of \nthe week. She also encourages parents to volunteer in the classroom and \nto take an active role in their child's learning.\n  It is the ability to give of herself that makes Mrs. Bieze special. \nHer superintendent says she ``exemplifies the initiative and dedication \nwe seek in our educators.'' Mrs. Bieze characteristically deflects that \npraise and credits her students. She says she--in her words--is ``truly \nblessed'' as ``the recipient of their unrestrained love, curiosity and \nenthusiasm for six hours each day.'' If only we could be holding more \nspeeches on the floor of this Senate that deal with issues like love, \ncuriosity and enthusiasm. Mrs. Bieze, we salute you.\n  I would be remiss in not mentioning some of Idaho's other outstanding \nteachers. Just last week, Idaho's PTA honored Jeff Durner, a fifth-\ngrade teacher at Jefferson Elementary in Boise. The PTA credits Mr. \nDurner for helping children ``become the best they can be.''\n  The Idaho Education Association credits a sixth-grade teacher from my \nhometown of Idaho Falls as being worthy of special recognition. Zoe Ann \nJorgenson has helped develop a special program in her district that \ngroups children based on their needs, not on their age. She says many \nparents have chosen to keep their children in public schools, rather \nthan move them to private classrooms, based on this innovative and \nunique program.\n  Mrs. Jorgenson believes the system should be made to fit the \nchildren, not that children be forced to fit the system. She says that \nparents are looking for choices within the structure of the public \nschool system, and she wants to offer them those choices.\n  Finally, Idaho Parents Unlimited says a special education teacher \nformerly from Blackfoot, and now from Meridian, ID deserves credit for \ntrail-blazing programs for students that are sometimes forgotten in our \nschool systems.\n  Barbara Jones earned the title of Special Education Consulting \nTeacher. One parent in Blackfoot described her as ``a true gift to my \nson as well as myself.'' Ms. Jones is now helping both fellow teachers \nand students learn how special needs can offer special rewards.\n  We all have a stake in this process, because our children's success \nin education depends on the support they receive at home, and the \nfuture of our nation depends on the leaders we are raising today.\n  Some define leadership as what we do with our opportunities. I am \nproud to praise these fine Idaho educators who have moved the bar \nhigher--for our children.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize teachers across \nAmerica for the vital work they do. I come from a family of educators, \nso I have seen firsthand the grueling work teachers go through every \nday--not for their own gain, but because they care about each and every \none of our children. Teachers are not the highest paid people, they are \nnot in the most glamorous profession--but they are, and should be, \namong the most respected people in our country. That is why it was so \nimportant that we declared this week as the 14th Annual Teacher \nAppreciation Week and that we recognized May 4, 1999, as National \nTeacher Day.\n  Mr. President, the resolution that we passed yesterday states that \neducation is key to the very foundation of American freedom and \ndemocracy we all enjoy, that teachers have a profound impact on the \ndevelopment of our children, and that much of the success we enjoy here \nin the United States can be attributed to our teachers. The resolution \nalso states that while ``many people spend their lives building \ncareers, teachers spend their careers building lives.''\n  Mr. President, I want to take a couple of minutes to recognize a \nteacher from my home state of Idaho who has truly spent her career \nbuilding lives. Judy Bieze teaches first grade in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. \nJudy got her start with a bachelor's degree in elementary education \nfrom Illinois State University, began teaching elementary students in \n1971, and hasn't stopped since. For the past 14 years, she has blessed \nthe children of Idaho.\n  She is an active member of the National Council of Teachers of \nMathematics, the International Reading Association, the Panhandle \nReading Council, and the Association for Supervision and Curriculum \nDevelopment. She is a lead teacher in her school and has received \nnumerous grants to do everything from providing books for parents and \nchildren to check out and read to underwriting a district-wide \ninservice training in spelling.\n  Somewhere amongst all of this, Judy finds time to teach some of \nIdaho's children. In fact, Judy humbly reflects that her greatest \naccomplishments come in 6- and 7-year-old bodies.\n  It is no wonder. Judy practices some techniques in her classes which \nsome may call innovative, while others call them back to the basics. \nFor instance, during the course of the year she takes time to recognize \neach child in her class as the ``Special and Unique'' person and works \neach day to recognize each child's accomplishments. Furthermore, she \nbelieves that parents must be actively involved in their child's \neducation. From encouraging parents to be involved in classroom \nactivities to weekly letters home to detail what their child has been \ndoing in school, Judy recognizes that parents are first and foremost in \na child's education.\n  Judy has stated that each day she is ``rewarded by the large and \nsmall accomplishments of the children entrusted to my care.'' Last \nyear, Judy's peers recognized these accomplishments and her commitment \nto the education of our children by choosing Judy Bieze as the Idaho \nState Teacher of the year for 1998-1999.\n  Judy believes that each child is a unique, unrepeatable miracle. On \nbehalf of the great state of Idaho, I am glad that Judy chose to come \nto Idaho and work her miracles with our children. I am proud of the \nwork she does, and am pleased that I have the opportunity to recognize \nher accomplishments today. It is my hope that other\n\n[[Page S4731]]\n\nteachers will see what she has done, see how she cares for our \nchildren, and strive to follow her lead. With teachers like Judy \nleading the pack, I have great confidence in the future of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we get 4 \nadditional minutes on this side as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is expected the Senate will soon \nconsider a resolution that highlights the week of May 2 to 8 as \nNational Teacher Appreciation Week. We have had a wonderful 2 weeks in \nthis Nation's Capital. Last week the President signed the Ed-Flex bill \nwhich returned much of the control--local accountability, local \nflexibility--to local schools and school districts. This week we honor \nour teachers.\n  I rise today to honor the many outstanding teachers across the Nation \nand especially in my home State of Tennessee. In particular, I would \nlike to highlight the achievements of Ms. Delise Teague, the 1999 \nTennessee Teacher of the Year, whom I had the honor to meet, as you can \nsee in this photo, just several weeks ago. This is Delise in the \npicture.\n  First, I would like to cite some of the research which paints a clear \npicture about the quality of a teacher being so critical to the future \nof our children and their education. Tennessee is one of the few States \nwith data systems in place which make it possible to link teacher \nperformance to student achievement. Researchers have the capability of \nexamining the impact teachers have in terms of their effectiveness, how \nwell they are teaching, and what students actually learn. Data from \nthese studies show the least effective teachers produce gains of \napproximately 14 percentile points for low-achieving students. However, \nthe most effective teachers produce gains that average 53 percentile \npoints.\n  The data also reveal that these effects are cumulative over time. In \nfact, students with three quality teachers in a row, scored over twice \nas high on math tests as those students with teachers who are less \nqualified. Thus, we have anecdotal evidence and scientific evidence \nthat a quality teacher has a tremendous impact on students.\n  One such outstanding teacher is Delise Teague, shown here in this \nportrait, who teaches English at McNairy Central High School in Selmer, \nTN. She knows firsthand the impact a quality teacher can have on a \nstudent. Using her words, she notes, ``I cannot take personal credit \nfor my success as a classroom teacher. Great teachers shared the light \nwith me. I am simply passing it on.''\n  She adds it was her first Sunday School teacher whose influence \n``served to fan the flame of learning that had been sparked at home by \nloving parents and an abundance of books.'' She will further tell you \nthat she had several teachers in the public school system who played a \nkey role in her own education and in her decision to pursue a career in \nteaching. The teachers who motivated Delise in her education were the \nones who saw her untapped potential and challenged her. This is a \nlesson that Delise applies in her own classroom. She challenges her \nstudents and believes in their potential to succeed.\n  In fact, Courtney Carroll, a student at McNairy Central High School, \nwrote, ``Miss Teague is loved and respected by her students because she \ntruly wants each person who enters her classroom to be successful.''\n  Delise coaches the varsity softball team and freshman basketball \nteam. She has served on the Technology Literacy Grant Committee, the \nNational Honor Society Selection Committee, and as a student teacher \nsupervisor/mentor. She is active in her community and takes on projects \nsuch as distributing fruit baskets for the elderly and providing gifts \nthrough the project Angel Tree for underprivileged children and \ncontributing to Saint Jude's Children's Hospital through fundraising \nefforts.\n  She is just one wonderful example of the many dedicated teachers in \nour Nation's schools. In my own past I think of June Bowen, who taught \nme seventh grade English, and Mary Helen Lowry, who passed away this \nyear, who taught me English through high school. I am so pleased to be \nable to participate in this effort to honor our Nation's teachers by \npromoting National Teacher Appreciation Week.\n  As parents and community members, we should all take a few minutes to \ncelebrate this great cause for our children's future. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues honoring \nNational Teacher Day and Teacher Appreciation Week. I appreciate very \nmuch the work Senator Frist has done on behalf of reform in education.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today to recognize \nMay 2-8, 1999, as the 14th Annual Teacher Appreciation Week, and to \ncommend thousands of dedicated teachers across the nation for their \ndetermined efforts to shape the intellect of our children.\n  The foundation of American freedom and democracy is a strong, \neffective system of education where every child has the opportunity to \nlearn in a safe and nurturing environment.\n  America's first rate education system depends on a partnership \nbetween parents, principals, teachers and children. The success of our \nnation for much of the 20th century--is the result of the hard work and \ndedication of teachers across the land.\n  While many people spend their lives building careers, teachers spend \ntheir careers building lives. Our nation's teachers serve our children \nbeyond the call of duty as coaches, mentors, and advisors without \nregard to fame or fortune. Across the land nearly 3 million men and \nwomen experience the joys of teaching young minds the virtues of \nreading, writing and arithmetic.\n  As part of the 14th Annual Teacher Appreciation Week, I'd like to pay \nspecial tribute to Andrew Baumgartner of Augusta, Georgia--who was \nrecently named the 1999 National Teacher of the Year.\n  Mr. Baumgartner, who teaches kindergarten at A. Brian Merry \nElementary School in Augusta, has been a teacher for 23 years. His \nmotivation and source of inspiration comes in part from the belief that \nit was his duty to give something back to society, and he has done so \nthrough his teaching.\n  To achieve his goal of getting kids to learn, Mr. Baumgartner creates \na sense of adventure in his classroom. He has used his creativity and \nimagination to bring the magic of reading and learning to the minds of \nhis kids.\n  The award, sponsored by the Council of Chief State School Officers \nand Scholastic, Inc., will send Mr. Baumgartner on a promotional tour \nas 1999 National Teacher of the Year, where he will share his \ninnovative ideas with other teachers around the nation. I wish Mr. \nBaumgartner the best of luck during this tour and am confident that he \nwill inspire other teachers with his creativity and willingness to do \nwhatever it takes to get kids to learn.\n  In closing Mr. President, I call on all my colleagues--on both sides \nof the aisle--to take a moment this week to give a special thanks to \nthe nearly 3 million important American men and women--like Andy--who \nhave contributed to the emotional and intellectual development of \nchildren across the land.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of Teacher \nAppreciation Week. During this week we have a special opportunity to \nthank the dedicated professionals who open our children's eyes to the \nworld of discovery and learning, the world that will open the door to a \nbrighter future for them and for all of Michigan.\n  Five days a week, for nine months out of every year, America's 2.7 \nmillion teachers help to mold our children's future, the future of \nMichigan, and the future of America. Across Michigan and across the \nUnited States, tomorrow's business leaders, inventors, doctors, and \neven teachers are building the\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\nfoundation of learning and experience that will shape their lives and \ncareers.\n  This week, Mr. President, Michiganites like all Americans are taking \ntime to pay tribute to our teachers, some of the most important people \nin our children's lives. After parents and families, teachers pay the \nmost important role in helping our children reach their potential. No \nteacher can take the place of loving and attentive families, but the \nschool experience plays a crucial role in shaping our children's \ncharacter.\n  After the tragic events in Colorado, I hope all of us will take the \ntime to think about the difficult job our teachers have, in these \ntroubled times, giving children the structure and habits as well as the \nknowledge they need to become good citizens and productive adults.\n  I have always supported calls for better computer technology in our \nclassrooms. And it is true that our children need to learn to use tools \nthat will expand their access to information. But a qualified, highly \ntrained teacher remains the most important education tool in any \nclassroom. Today's technological innovations can help teachers capture \nour children's attention and bring the world to their eyes and \nfingertips. But no machine can take the place of a dedicated teacher \nwho genuinely cares about a child's future. With the rapid advance of \neducation technology, we must ensure that our teachers are trained in \nthe most effective educational use of this technology, and that none of \nus are distracted from the basics of a good education by glittering \nmachines.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, there are disturbing statistics about \nhow well our teachers are prepared to enter the classroom. More than 25 \npercent of new teachers nationwide enter school without adequate \nteaching skills or without training in their subject according to the \nNational Commission on Teaching and America's Future. One in seven \nteachers has not fully met State standards.\n  We must do more to ensure that our teachers are fully prepared to \nmeet the increasing challenges of their profession. We must take \nadvantage of every opportunity to provide today's teachers with access \nto proven training programs while simultaneously recruiting and \ntraining qualified and dedicated young people to become tomorrow's \ngreat educators.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, we must applaud and show our \nappreciation to the teachers who go that extra mile for our kids, \ncapturing their attention, helping them gain the knowledge and skills \nthey need, and providing examples of dedication and skill that should \ninspire us all.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to salute one of our \nnation's most precious resources, our teachers and in particular New \nMexico's teacher of the year, Stan Johnston of Los Alamos High School.\n  I would submit, teachers are the key to America's future. Christa \nMcAuliffe, the teacher and astronaut put it in perfect perspective. She \nsaid, ``I touch the future, I teach.''\n  Building upon her statement I would say: it is a simple fact that the \nfuture is prejudiced in favor of those who can read, write, and do \nmath. A good education is a ticket to the secure economic future of the \nmiddle class. As the earning gap between brains and brawn grows ever \nlarger almost no one doubts the link between education and an \nindividual's prospects.\n  And today the Senate is acknowledging those on the front lines with \nour students, the unsung heroes, their teachers. Somewhere in this \ngreat country of ours a teacher has a future leader of the United \nStates in his classroom. Who knows; it could be one of the students in \nStan Johnston's English and Study Skills class at Los Alamos High \nSchool in New Mexico.\n  My point is simple, after parents and families, teachers play an \nimportant role in helping our children reach their potential. After our \nchildren leave home each morning, it becomes the responsibility of \nAmerica's almost 3 million teachers to ensure our children are prepared \nfor the future because in our nation's classrooms resides the future.\n  Hopefully, the future doctors who will find the cure for cancer, \nmental illness, and heart disease are right now in our classrooms. But, \nmost importantly we have the next generation of our country now \nattending classes throughout our schools.\n  In conclusion, I would like to thank you and a job well done to all \nof our teachers and in particular, Stan Johnston of Los Alamos High \nSchool. Again, thank you and please continue the superb work you are \ndoing on behalf of our country.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, of all the occupations in America, teachers \nmay deserve their own ``appreciation day'' the most. And, perhaps no \noccupation influences the future of our country more. I am delighted to \njoin my colleagues today in paying tribute to those teachers all over \nAmerica who have made a real difference.\n  One special teacher who made a real difference in my life was Mr. \nMcElroy.\n  When I was a young boy, I played my violin in the school orchestra. \nOn the day of one of our most important performances, the student who \nwas supposed to play a solo on the bass got sick and was unable to \nperform. My music director, Mr. McElroy came to me and convinced me \nthat, even though I had never played the bass, I could perform the \nsolo.\n  I had terrible doubts about my ability to step in and do the job. But \nMr. McElroy had confidence in me, even if I didn't. And he worked with \nme and encouraged me and coached me for most of that afternoon. That \nnight I was able to play the solo without making a mistake.\n  As I think back on it, this was one experience that taught me that if \nI applied myself I could meet a challenge. When, in 1976, everyone \nbelieved I was a long-shot to win the nomination and, indeed, the \nelection to become Utah's senator, I should have told them about Mr. \nMcElroy.\n  I know that right now, in a classroom in Utah--maybe in the room of \nDiane Crim, who teaches math at Salt Lake's Clayton Intermediate School \nand is Utah's 1998 Teacher of the Year--another young student is \nlearning these important lessons thanks to a dedicated and caring \nteacher.\n  Teaching is not just a job, it's a calling. It is a calling to impart \nknowledge, to mete out discipline, to inspire, to motivate.\n  Last week, our entire nation mourned the loss of a devoted teacher, \nDave Sanders. The testimony of his students to his caring, whether in \nthe classroom or on the basketball court, is a tribute better than any \nwe here in the Senate could pay. I hope that the students he taught at \nColumbine High School will go on to practice the lessons he taught and \nbe the kind of citizens in the community that he hoped they would be.\n  Mr. President, Mr. McElroy, Diane Crim, and Dave Sanders all \nrepresent the best of the teaching profession. There are thousands of \nothers we could mention here today who have helped our children learn \nthe keys for living such as reading, math, science, and history. But, \nmore than that, they have helped reinforce essential values like hard \nwork, perseverance, team work, and integrity. I am pleased to join in \nhonoring these teachers today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I also want to comment on the National \nTeacher Appreciation Week, because I think all of us can look back in \nour own backgrounds and remember what a difference teachers made in our \nlives.\n  I can remember very well the teachers who made a contribution to my \nlife, to my growing up: Mrs. Goplin, who taught American history and \nwho really shared a great love for understanding the Constitution of \nthe United States, always told us that this is one of the greatest \ndocuments in human history. I will never forget those words of Mrs. \nGoplin.\n  She was exactly right. Our Constitution is one of the greatest \ndocuments in human history, and how lucky we are to live in a country \nthat has constitutional guarantees of freedom for the American people \nand says to each and every American, you have certain rights, rights \nthat protect you from the overreach of government, because our \nforefathers had known in Europe that government can become oppressive \nand that government can make demands on its citizenry that are not \nfair, that are not reasonable. We are so lucky to have these \nprotections.\n  I remember other teachers: My third grade teacher, Mrs. Offerdahl, \nwho is still alive in a nursing home in North Dakota, what a great \nwoman. She\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\ncame every morning to that class with a sparkle in her eye and a love \nfor learning and a love for teaching. She made a difference not only in \nmy life but in the lives of hundreds and hundreds of students whom she \ntaught over a very long career in the Bismarck, ND, school system--Mrs. \nOfferdahl.\n  And Mrs. Senzek, who was my fifth grade teacher, a highly intelligent \nwoman, somebody who was absolutely committed to improving the \neducational standards of the kids in Bismarck, ND. My sixth grade \nteacher, Miss Barbie, who was a very sophisticated woman, somebody who \nloved reading and imparted that love to students.\n  I think back to how fortunate we were to have people of that quality \nand that caring who provided education to us and at great sacrifice to \nthemselves. I can say every one of these women whom I have mentioned \ncould have made much more money doing something else, but they were \ndedicated to teaching young people, and they made enormous financial \nsacrifices to do it.\n  There are so many other teachers along the way whom I remember. Mrs. \nHook was my second grade teacher. She was a woman of real majesty, \nreally almost a regal person, very tall, very erect, very dignified, \nsomebody who commanded respect.\n  These are people who made an impression that has lasted a lifetime, \nlasted a lifetime for me, but I know lasted a lifetime for other \nstudents in the Bismarck public school system as well.\n  Mr. President, I add our words of praise to all the teachers across \nthis country who make a difference in the lives of kids. Other than \nfamily members, other than parents, perhaps there is no more important \nrelationship than what teachers do in terms of training our kids. So, \ntoday, we say thank you, thank you for everything you have done. You \nhave made a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4733-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4733-S4734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CRISIS IN AMERICAN AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to talk about another crisis that \nis occurring in this country. It is not receiving the attention as are \nthe storms in Oklahoma, the tornadoes, and the tremendous damage that \nhas been wreaked in those States by this set of storms, but it is a \ncrisis nonetheless. It is almost a stealth crisis. It is a crisis in \nAmerican agriculture, and I can tell you, it is causing trauma, too.\n  In my State, we have just seen a series of headlines in the major \nnewspapers that tell the story. I thought I would bring them to the \nattention of my colleagues today so hopefully we can reflect not only \non the tragedy in Oklahoma and Kansas, but we can reflect on the \ntragedy that is happening in central America, and I mean the central \nAmerica of North Dakota and South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, and \nKansas--States that have been hard hit by a virtual depression in \nagriculture.\n  It is causing real trauma, Mr. President. These headlines tell the \nstory. This headline sums it up: ``The rural depression.'' There is a \nreal depression in the heartland of America. Prices, the lowest we have \nseen in 50 years, are causing literally thousands of farmers to exit \nagriculture.\n  Here is another headline which recently ran in papers back home: \n``Farm prices, farm numbers both fall.''\n  And this headline that says: ``Another farm dies; does Washington \nreally care?'' That is the question we are going to be asking today and \nwe are going to continue to ask as we see this crisis grow and develop \naffecting more and more farm families and starting to affect the small \ntowns of our State as well. In fact, this headline says it well: ``AG \nCrisis Is Bigger Than N.D.'' This is an editorial from the largest \npaper in our State pointing out that not only is North Dakota affected \nbut other farm States as well.\n\n  This is a headline which ran recently: ``State Loses Farmers.'' And \none headline which ran, again, in the biggest paper in our State: \n``Crop Prices Are the Problem.'' And indeed they are. ``Crop Prices Are \nthe Problem.'' This article says, ``Crop prices, that's the big thing \nwrong with the region's farm picture this year.'' And they are exactly \nright.\n  When I mentioned the crisis has moved from the farmstead to the \nstreets of North Dakota, this headline tells that story: ``Farm \nDownturn Leaves Main Street Reeling. Three family-run businesses in \nMichigan, North Dakota closed, with little hope of reopening.''\n  There is the crisis that is receiving enormous attention in Oklahoma \nand Kansas--and it should have enormous attention. Those people deserve \nfor others to understand what is happening and the suffering they are \nexperiencing.\n  There is another crisis as well, and that is the crisis in farm \ncountry. Those people are suffering. And they deserve attention as \nwell.\n  Let me just show another chart which goes right to the heart of the \nproblem we are facing. This shows what has happened to farm prices from \n1946 to 1998 for wheat and barley. You can see from the prices--this is \n1998--it has even gotten worse. We go out to 1999, and these prices \ncontinue to decline in real terms. We have the lowest prices now for \nthese commodities in 52 years. This is a crisis by any definition.\n  I just want to conclude by going back to what one of the articles \nsaid in the papers back home. This says: ``Banks' Survey Shows Farm \nIncome Dwindling.'' In this article they say, ``The vice is tightening \non farm borrowers in the Upper Great Plains. The outlook for farm \nincome is grim unless commodity prices increase.''\n  Mr. President, that is exactly the case. We face a tightening noose \naround the necks of literally thousands of farm families, and it is \ntime for a response from the Federal Government. We need to pass the \ndisaster supplemental. We need to make the last disaster program we \npassed whole, because we now know it will cost $1.5 billion more to \nkeep the promise which was made in that disaster program. We need to \nonce again shore up the transition payments that are promised farmers \nunder the new farm bill at this time of price collapse.\n  Those are steps we can take, we need to take, we must take. In \naddition, we should reform crop insurance, because we know that program \ndoes not work when you have multiple years of disaster.\n  I just close by saying once again, I hope America is listening and \nunderstands that there are tragedies occurring across the United \nStates. We have a tragedy in Oklahoma, a tragedy in Kansas, and we \nought to respond.\n  There are also tragedies that are occurring below the radar screen. \nThey are not getting the attention of the national press. They are a \ncrisis nonetheless, and we ought to respond to them as well.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague from Montana is waiting to speak.\n  I inquire of the Parliamentarian, how much time do we have remaining \non our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 15 seconds are remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just ask my colleague from the State of Montana if he \nwould like that additional 5 minutes. I would be happy to yield to him \nat this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Montana----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, may I hear the request \nagain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The inquiry was whether the Senator from \nMontana desires time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the inquiry of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. I would, but I want to accommodate the manager of \nthe bill, too. I would like, at some time in the next hour or two, to \nspeak for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. To accommodate the Senator, why don't we just take 5 \nminutes off each side. We are going to have the vote at noon, so we \nwill have less time. Senator Sarbanes and I had an opportunity to plow \nthis ground in some depth, so why don't we yield to the distinguished \nSenator 10 minutes now, and then we will begin the debate on the \nfinancial services modernization bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might try once more for 15.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield the Senator another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. So the Record is clear, the Senator from \nMontana will have 15 minutes--10 minutes\n\n[[Page S4734]]\n\nfrom the Democratic side, 5 minutes from the majority side.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank very much not only my good friend \nfrom North Dakota but my good friend from Texas, Senator Gramm, and my \ngood friend from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4734-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4734-S4735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHINA'S WTO ACCESSION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to offer some thoughts \non the negotiations towards China's WTO accession, in the aftermath of \nPremier Zhu Rongji's visit to the United States.\n  This, I submit, is a question of fundamental importance to America's \ntrade interests. China is now our fourth largest trading partner--after \nCanada, Japan, and Mexico--a major market, and the source of our most \nunbalanced trade relationship in the world. And it is perhaps still \nmore important to America's strategic interests in Asia. Today, I would \nlike to review the progress thus far and its implications for these \ninterests.\n  Let me begin, however, with some context about WTO accessions and the \ncommitments they require.\n  The WTO really began with the creation of the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade, otherwise known as the GATT, in 1948. At that time, \n23 nations were members. Each of them agreed to a set of tariff cuts \nand agreed to apply the new tariffs to all other GATT members. This is \nthe famous, or infamous, principle of ``MFN,'' or ``Most Favored \nNation.''\n  Since then, since 1948, 111 other economies--membership is no longer \nrestricted to countries, as Hong Kong and the European Union are now \nmembers--have joined to make up today's 134-member WTO.\n  The original tariff agreements are also joined by agreements on \nsanitary and phytosanitary standards--that is, health standards--\nintellectual property, technical barriers to trade, and other issues. \nAnd 30 more economies have applied to join, the largest being China.\n  As these economies join, they must also lower their trade barriers, \nlive up to WTO's intellectual property and agricultural inspection \ncommitments, and so forth. For existing members, however, the only \nrequirement is the one they adopted back in 1948: that we apply MFN--or \ntoday normal trade relations--tariffs to the new members. That is the \nonly commitment that current members have to make.\n  So as we consider the commitments China has and will make to be a WTO \nmember, we must also remember that these are fundamentally one-way \nconcessions. Let me repeat, to enter the WTO, China has committed to a \nset of one-way concessions.\n  Nothing in any WTO accession will mean American concessions on market \naccess; the use of our trade laws to address dumping, subsidies, or \nimport surges; or controls on American technology exports. Likewise, if \nwe should choose to tighten export controls at some point in the \nfuture, nothing in the WTO accession would prevent us from doing so.\n  Let me now turn to the commitments China has made and to the issues \nwhich remain.\n  To enter the WTO, China and the existing members must do two things: \ndraft a ``Protocol'' covering a set of fair trade policies, and agree \non a set of market access concessions.\n  These are the issues which the American negotiating team addressed in \nthe months and weeks before Premier Zhu's visit. And the results are \nstriking. China has made a significant set of concessions in both \nareas. The work is not done, but let me review for the Senate some of \nthe major elements.\n\n  Under the protocol, China has made the following commitments: It will \nend the practice of requiring technology transfer as a condition for \ninvestment. That is very big. This includes refusing to enforce tech \ntransfer provisions of existing contracts. The United States is \nguaranteed the right to continue using nonmarket economy methods for \nfighting dumping and unfair subsidies.\n  China will end investment practices intended to take jobs from other \ncountries, for example, local content requirements which stop auto \nplants from importing U.S. parts; export performance clauses requiring \nproduction to be exported rather than sold on the Chinese market, and \nso on. And China has agreed to a product-specific safeguard which will \nstrengthen our ability to fight sudden import surges.\n  It is important in the weeks and months ahead to ensure that these \nprovisions have acceptable duration. But it is also clear both that we \nwill be able to use the WTO to strengthen our guarantees of fair trade, \nand also that we will be able to use our own domestic trade laws for \nthe same purpose. These are fundamental parts of any successful WTO \naccession.\n  The American negotiators have also won an impressive set of \ncommitments in market access. Let me offer a few examples: In \nagriculture, China has already begun by lifting its infamous ban on \nPacific Northwest wheat, American beef, and also on citrus products. \nAnd when it enters the WTO, it will accompany this by major tariff \ncuts. For example, beef tariffs will fall from 45 percent to 12 \npercent, and adoption of tariff-rate quotas in bulk commodities; that \nis, minimum guarantees of imports into China.\n  The wheat tariff-rate quota, for example, has the potential to lift \nChina's imports from 2.4 million metric tons a day to 7.3 tons for the \nfirst year China is in the WTO and more afterwards. China will also \ngive up any rights to export subsidies, a far cry from, say, Europe \nwhich has massive export subsidies; China going much, much further than \nEurope is today.\n  In industrial goods, China will grant full distribution rights, \nretailing, repair, warehousing, trucking and more in almost all \nproducts over 3 years. And it will allow American companies to import \nand export freely. These are concessions that will fundamentally \ntransform an economy which now operates by requiring both Americans and \nChinese to use Chinese Government middlemen in these areas. It will \nmake large tariff cuts to an average of 7.1 percent, and it will give \nup the quota policies at the heart of several industrial policy \nventures.\n  Another concession of special interest to my State of Montana is deep \ncuts in wood products, from levels reaching 18 percent today down to 5 \nand 7 percent after WTO membership. And in services, China has made \ncommitments in every sector. They are especially strong, as I noted, in \ndistribution, but also extend to telecommunications, to finance, to \naudiovisual, environmental services, law, franchising, direct sales and \nmore. These are very significant concessions which go most of the way \nto creating a commercially meaningful agreement.\n  The U.S. negotiators deserve immense credit for their tremendous \nachievements of the past months, absolutely amazing, perhaps even more \nfor their willingness to refuse bad offers in the past years and remain \nfirm in the commitment to strong accession in all areas.\n  Several issues, however, remain unresolved. I am especially and very \nstrongly concerned that we are not accepting any rapid phaseout of \nnonmarket economy dumping rules or import surge provisions. We can also \nimprove on the market access commitments in several of the service \nsectors. However, we should also understand that there is a point at \nwhich we should say yes. We should not set a goal of transforming \nChina's trade regime into Hong Kong's by next New Year's Day. Rather, \nwe should expect a good, commercially meaningful accession, and we are \nalmost there now.\n  Finally, let me say a few words about the broader interests involved. \nA WTO accession is a set of unilateral trade concessions; in this case, \nmade by China. As such, it is in our economic and our commercial \ninterest. It will create opportunities while making trade fairer for \nour working people and farmers. But it is also a piece of a larger \nstrategy designed to create a more stable, a more prosperous and more \npeaceful Asia-Pacific region.\n  China's economic integration into the Pacific region since the \nopening under President Nixon in 1972 has been immensely important to \nour long-term national interests. We can see that very clearly in the \nAsian financial crisis, for example.\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\n  When I came to Congress, China was a revolutionary power, which would \nhave used this recent currency crisis to spread disorder, spread \nrevolution throughout Southeast Asia and the Korean peninsula. But \ntoday it is a beneficiary of Thai, Singapore, Korean and Malay \ninvestment, and these countries are also China's markets. China has \nresponded to the crisis by contributing to their recovery through \ncurrency stability and several billion dollars in contributions to IMF \nrecovery packages.\n\n  The WTO accession will deepen and strengthen this process. At the \nsame time, it will move China toward the rule of law, give Chinese \nworking people, students and families more frequent, more open contact \nwith foreigners and, thus, contribute to our work toward a China which \nhas more respect of the law and more respect for human rights.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. negotiators thus far have done an excellent \njob. They have already offered American farmers a ray of hope during a \nvery difficult year. We are very close to accessions that will make \ntrade with China fundamentally more fair for our country. It will then \nbe up to the Senate, to our colleagues, to take the final step by \nmaking the normal trade relations we now offer to China permanent.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4735-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 900, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 900) to enhance competition in the financial \n     services industry by providing a prudential framework for the \n     affiliation of banks, securities firms, insurance companies, \n     and other financial service providers, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Sarbanes (for Daschle/Sarbanes) amendment No. 302, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 12 noon shall be divided \nbetween the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Maryland, with 23 \nminutes for Senator Gramm and 17 minutes for Senator Sarbanes.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm for yielding me the time. I have \na comment or two with respect to the process that we have gone through \nin putting this legislation together.\n  I commend Senator Gramm. I can't think of a time in my now 17 years \nin the Congress where I have had a chairman of a committee that has \nspent as much time with the other members of the committee, walking \nthrough a particular piece of legislation, each aspect of it, making \nsure that each of us was prepared and educated on the various issues. \nThere are some difficult issues that face us--the whole issue of CRA, \nunitary thrifts, the mixing of banking and commerce, the issue of \noperating subsidiaries versus affiliates, all of them complicated.\n  I can remember not too many years ago when there was this sense in \nAmerica that the model which should be followed was the Japanese \nbanking system that people looked at and said, we ought to look at \nJapan, the dynamic economy they were producing in the late 1980s. I \nthink about how much things have changed in those 10 years.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point very briefly?\n  Mr. MACK. I will be glad to yield for a moment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I remember people would say that the Japanese had all \nthe largest banks in the world and they were saying, look. And now look \nat the situation.\n  Mr. MACK. It is a dramatic change, and here we are. We have been \ntalking about this legislation for all those years and we haven't made \nthe modifications we needed to make. I hope we will be successful this \ntime.\n  I rise in support of the underlying bill and in opposition to the \nSarbanes substitute. We all know that legislation to overhaul the bank \nregulatory structure is long overdue, and I join many of my colleagues \nin thanking the chairman for his hard work in writing this bill and \nbringing it to the floor.\n  I will begin by quoting the words of the Senate Banking Committee \nreport, which I believe presents a strong case for financial \nmodernization. It states:\n\n       The argument for legislation to rationalize our financial \n     structure is strong. Regulatory and court decisions have \n     eliminated many of the barriers between commercial and \n     investment banking. The barriers separating commercial banks \n     from investment banks have been perforated in both \n     directions. Finally, changes in the technology and practice \n     of financial intermediation have rendered the restrictions of \n     Glass-Steagall increasingly ineffective and obsolete.\n\n  There is nothing particularly remarkable about that language, Mr. \nPresident. In fact, those same arguments will be made by many of my \ncolleagues here today. But what is remarkable about the statement I \njust read is that it comes from a committee report on banking \nlegislation in 1991. Just as I believed those words to be significant 8 \nyears ago, I believe them to be even more so today. Unfortunately, \nthere was no overhaul of our banking system in 1991. And despite much \nhard work and a clear need for action, there has been none since. We \nare long overdue for this debate and I am pleased the Senate is \naddressing this important issue.\n  Freedom and free enterprise have allowed our corporate and financial \ninstitutions to respond to changing times and to adapt to a changing \nfinancial environment. But this ability has reached its limits within \nthe confines of present law. For our financial institutions to continue \nto grow, to compete, and to evolve, we must give them a new legislative \nclimate in which to operate. That is the purpose of the bill before us \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, our banking system is truly a model for the world. \nEmerging economies from Asia to Africa to Central Europe look to the \nUnited States for the blueprint and technical expertise to build an \neffective financial infrastructure. This is happening because we have \nfound a remarkable balance between community banks and global \ninstitutions, between the regulators and the regulated, between the \nStates and the Federal Government, and between ordinary people and the \nmoney they need to finance their hopes and dreams. In recent years, we \nhave witnessed a wave of high-profile mergers, as institutions across \nthe sectors hope to create ``synergy'' from offering a broad range of \nfinancial products to an expanding global customer base. For their \npart, many smaller, community-based institutions are using the new \nregulatory authorities to offer their customers one-stop shopping for \nindividual financial needs--from ordinary retail banking to insurance \nproducts and securities instruments.\n  All of this is very important to the continued financial well-being \nof our Nation and to the global competitiveness of our financial \nservices industry. However, the expansions I speak of are not taking \nplace with the approval of the Congress and are not occurring through \nany action on our part to change the law. Rather, these things are \nhappening because--as the 1991 report mentioned--court decisions and \nthe broadened interpretations of present law by the banking regulators \nhave allowed them to take place in an ad hoc manner. In order to access \nthe right to affiliate with other sectors, financial companies have to \njump over increasingly complicated regulatory hurdles in order to adapt \nand survive. It is high time Congress weighed in on this important \ntrend. It is high time we cleared the way for these affiliations and \nrepealed the underlying web of Depression-era restrictions on our \nbanking industry.\n  That is what we accomplish in the bill before us today, Mr. \nPresident. This legislation allows companies to diversify holdings by \nlifting the prohibitions on affiliations among banks, insurance \ncompanies, and securities firms, thus allowing them to compete fully in \na free-market environment. If Congress fails to act, we will once\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\nagain limit the potential of our financial sector and we will continue \nto impose needless and unnecessary regulatory burdens on individual \nfinancial institutions. The other body is moving with its own \nlegislation. The Senate needs to act now to ensure that our financial \nsector is on solid footing for the new century.\n  The bill before us repeals the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law \nprohibiting affiliations between commercial and investment banks. It \nallows banks and insurance companies to affiliate under the same \ncorporate umbrella. It contains provisions outlining the appropriate \nregulation of bank sales of insurance, and it allows banks with assets \nof less than $1 billion to engage in a broader range of financial \nservices through operating subsidiaries. Of course, Mr. President, the \nrelationships between these entities are carefully constructed to \nensure institutional safety and soundness and that the taxpayer-insured \ndeposits of retail banking institutions are protected.\n\n  The structure provided for in this legislation will end the ad hoc \nexpansion and administration of our banking sector and provide the \nindustry with a clear roadmap for the 21st century. In my view, it will \nlead to greater stability, enhanced safety and soundness, and improved \nchoices for customers and consumers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important bill and \ndefeat the Sarbanes substitute.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Texas and the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield myself time out of my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be brief because we have to get back \nto this Financial Services Modernization Act. I know the two managers \nmanaging this are working on it studiously, and we will be having votes \nlater today. It looks to me as if we can make good progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4736-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MARY BETH BOYER BLACK, MISSISSIPPI'S 1999 TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I join my other colleagues here today in \nrecognizing National Teacher Appreciation Week. I am the son of a \nschoolteacher. My mother taught school for 19 years, between first and \nthe sixth grade. She finally had to leave teaching because in those \ndays teachers basically could not make enough money to live on. She \nwound up in bookkeeping and broadcasting. I also worked for a \nuniversity for 3 years, and I have a very serious appreciation for our \nteachers and the jobs they do.\n  I have stayed in touch, over the years, with my second-, third-, and \nfourth-grade teachers at Duck Hill, MS. I don't know why, but I \nparticularly remember those three and have always appreciated them. I \nguess we remember the ones who teach us to write and do the basic \nreading. They were wonderful women and wonderful people, and they \ninspired me in many ways.\n  So in appreciation of this National Teacher Appreciation Week, I will \nquote from the Bible. It says:\n\n       Train up the child in the way he should go, and when he's \n     old, he will not depart from it.\n\n  Those were the words of Solomon. That is good advice from Solomon.\n  So today I want to pay particular attention to our Mississippi \nTeacher of the Year, Mary Beth Black. She teaches chemistry, physics, \nand advanced placement physics. I remember those courses. They are the \nreason I didn't go into pharmacy or med school. Biology, chemistry, \nphysics--I took all the college preparatory courses, and I look back \nnow and I know that I was wasting space. I was really never destined to \nmajor in the sciences. But it is so important that we have teachers who \ninspire students in that area. If we are going to be competitive in the \nfuture, in the next millennium, and participate in the world economy, \nwe are going to have to have students who are good in science, physics, \ncomputer sciences, and the sciences in general.\n  In order for them to learn what they need to know and to be inspired \nin that field, you need great teachers like this teacher, the ``Teacher \nof the Year'' in Mississippi, who teaches at Emory, MS, a wonderful \nlady with a wonderful record.\n  She points, interestingly enough, to her second-grade teacher who, \nshe noted, inspired her when she was 7 years old--that she knew when \nshe was 7 she could be anything she chose to be: She could be a brain \nsurgeon, she could drive a fire truck, or go to the Moon. But this \nsecond-grade teacher inspired her to want to be a teacher. She always \nwanted to be a teacher--and to be more than just a teacher, to be an \ninspiration to young people.\n  She said:\n\n       Second grade can be challenging. My problem was cursive \n     writing or ``real writing'' as we second graders called it. \n     No matter how hard I tried, my loops and swoops and tilts \n     were never as good as my peers.\n\n  ``Until now,'' she said, ``school had been great.'' But in this \ninstance it got to be a problem and a challenge. But her second-grade \nteacher, Mrs. Hurt, worked with her and taught her and then became an \ninspiration to her.\n  So today I give thanks and appreciation to all of our teachers across \nour great country, and in my State of Mississippi to the ``Mrs. Hurts'' \nwho taught in those small, sometimes one- and two-classroom buildings \nas my mother did, who not only taught the course but inspired a \ngeneration of more teachers such as Mary Beth Black, Mississippi's \nTeacher of the Year.\n  An 18th-century American historian, Henry Brooks Adams, said: ``A \nteacher affects eternity; (she) can never tell where (her) influence \nstops.''\n  So our teachers influence our young people, and they affect the \nfuture of our country and the world. Thanks to all of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4736-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4736-S4788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield such time as the minority leader \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member, \nthe Senator from Maryland. I thank him and the Democratic members of \nthe Banking Committee for the tremendous leadership and patience that, \nin particular, Senator Sarbanes has demonstrated in getting us to this \npoint.\n  I also want to acknowledge the efforts of all my colleagues on the \nSenate Banking Committee, and especially the fellow Democrats of the \nBanking Committee, who have put so much effort and energy and diligence \ninto bringing us to this very important debate, and ultimately this \nvote which we will shortly have.\n  I might add, as I know the distinguished Senator from Maryland has \nalready noted, that every Democratic member of the Senate Banking \nCommittee is a cosponsor of the substitute we will be voting on \nshortly. Together, my colleagues on the committee have produced a \nproposal to give financial service companies new freedoms and new \nflexibility--without risking the financial well-being of our economy or \nof individuals. It is a balanced, responsible proposal--one the \nPresident can sign--and, on behalf of the entire Democratic caucus, I \nthank them for producing it.\n  Let me be very clear, Mr. President. Senate Democrats support \nfinancial services modernization. We want to see a bill passed. There \nis no good reason that can't happen this year--in fact, this week.\n  This should not be a partisan issue. Historically, it has not been \none.\n  Our substitute is based on last year's H.R. 10. The Senate Banking \nCommittee passed H.R. 10 on a vote of 16 to 2--16 to 2. Republicans on \nthe Senate Banking Committee supported H.R. 10 last year. So did \nvirtually every major financial services industry group.\n  In the House, the House Banking Committee passed a very similar bill \nthis year. Again, the vote was overwhelmingly bipartisan--51 to 8.\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\n  Until recently, Democrats and Republicans have agreed overwhelmingly \nthat the path laid out in our substitute was the right path. That has \nall changed. Reform has suffered a major setback this year. In the \nSenate Banking Committee, the majority forced through a new, harshly \npartisan bill on a party line vote of 11 to 9. This new bill shattered \nthe consensus that so many people worked so long and so hard to create.\n  In place of the broad support enjoyed by H.R. 10, the committee bill \nis opposed now by every Democrat on the Banking Committee. It is also \nopposed by every civil rights group. It is opposed by community groups, \ncommunity organizations, and local governmental officials.\n  Instead of a clear path to enactment--which is what we would have had \nhad we stayed with the bipartisan approach to H.R. 10--financial \nservices reform is now on two tracks. There is the veto track. And make \nno mistake, S. 900 is on this track. It will be vetoed if the President \nreceives it in its current form. Then there is the enactment track. \nThat is the track our substitute and the bipartisan House Banking bill \nare on.\n  We are not saying, ``It is our way, or no way.'' Neither side should \never issue such an ultimatum. That is not the way of the Senate. We \nhave discussed with the majority leader our desire to find a bipartisan \nway to get the financial services modernization bill back on the \nenactment track. We have agreed to a floor procedure which will enable \nus to finish this bill in an expeditious manner.\n  We do not want to delay this bill any longer. That has already \nhappened. It has already been delayed. As I said, we want to pass \nfinancial services modernization this year, and perhaps even this week. \nSo the choice for the Senate is clear. It is partisan brinkmanship, or \nbipartisan accomplishment.\n  We stand ready on this side of the aisle to deliver a bill that the \nPresident can sign. He has cited four serious flaws in S. 900 which he \nhas said will force him to veto the bill. Our substitute corrects all \nfour flaws.\n  First and foremost, our substitute does not gut CRA--the Community \nReinvestment Act--as S. 900 does. The CRA has proven a huge success in \nexpanding access to credit and investment in low- and moderate-income \ncommunities. Investment capital is the lifeblood of these communities. \nThat capital must continue to be available to qualified borrowers in \nall communities. We cannot draw red lines around the American dream. \nDemocrats will not support a bill that undermines the effectiveness of \nthe CRA.\n  The second major difference between our substitute and the underlying \nbill is the way the two proposals deal with the separation of banking \nand commerce.\n  For nearly 70 years, since the collapse of the banking industry \nduring the Great Depression, U.S. law has separated banking from other \ncommercial activities. An army of experts--from Chairman Greenspan to \nSecretary Rubin to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker--\nbelieve that separation must be maintained.\n  But you don't have to look in the history books to understand why \nmixing banking and other commercial activities is risky business. Look \nat the recent currency crisis that started in Asia and spread to some \nof our Latin American neighbors. If anything, the globalization of our \neconomy makes a reasonable separation between banking and other \ncommercial activities even more important now than it was when those \nlaws were first enacted.\n  Unfortunately, as the distinguished Senator from Maryland has \nobserved, the underlying bill weakens the separation of banking and \ncommerce in a number of ways. Our alternative does not. It reflects the \ncareful compromises developed last year. It preserves the separation \nbetween banks and other commercial activities without in any way \nlimiting the flexibility financial service companies need in today's \neconomy. It strikes the right balance between opportunity and \nresponsibility.\n  Let me interject here that, should our substitute fail, my colleague \nfrom South Dakota, Senator Johnson, intends to offer a related \namendment. It would close a loophole which commercial companies \ncurrently use to mix banking and commerce by acquiring existing unitary \nthrift holding companies. I will strongly support his effort.\n  A third difference between our substitute and S. 900 has to do with \nconsumer protection. H.R. 10--the bill the Banking Committee passed out \nlast year with overwhelming support--included a number of consumer \nprotections having to do with such things as risk disclosure and \nlicensing of personnel. Those protections were essential for its \npassage last year. They remain essential to the American people. They \nhave all been stripped out of the underlying bill--every one of them. \nThey are all included in the Democratic alternative. They must be \nincluded in any financial services bill this Congress passes, or the \nPresident will veto it.\n\n  There is a fourth way in which our bill differs from both the \ncommittee bill and from last year's bill. It involves what financial \nactivities can take place in subsidiaries of banks, and under what \nconditions.\n  As the legislative process has progressed, the Treasury Department \nhas agreed to significant additional safeguards regarding the financial \nactivities of banks' operating subsidiaries. Our alternative \nincorporates these safeguards. At the same time, it would permit banks \nto structure certain new activities in these so-called ``op-subs'' as \nthey see fit. Again, it balances opportunity and responsibility.\n  Mr. President, that is where we stand--the juncture of two tracks: \nThe veto track, and the enactment track.\n  S. 900--as it is currently written--will put us on the veto track. We \nknow that:\n  It undermines the Community Reinvestment Act.\n  It breaches the separation of banking and commerce.\n  It ignores consumer protection.\n  And, it fails to strike a responsible balance on the question of bank \noperating subsidiaries.\n  The failure to proceed on a bipartisan track has placed this bill at \nrisk. Unless we negotiate with each other once again in good faith, I \nmust say this bill will be vetoed.\n  If that happens, it would represent a serious failure on the part of \nthis Senate.\n  More important, it would deprive American businesses, and the \nAmerican people, of important tools and safeguards they need in this \nnew global economy.\n  We appeal to our colleagues: Let's get this bill back on track. Let's \nadopt this alternative. Let's pass financial services modernization. \nThis year. This week. We can do it. I hope we will.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democrat leader \nfor the effort he has made to get the Senate to this point. Obviously, \nwhen we have votes on contentious issues, ultimately Members come to \nthe floor and vote. Somebody wins and somebody loses. I think on many \nof the votes we are going to have, neither of us knows what the outcome \nwill be.\n  We are beginning a process that will go through conference. We have a \nbill in the House that is very different. I think we all want to write \na bill that the White House can sign.\n  Yesterday, the President came out with six conditions for signing the \nbill, two of which your substitute does not comply with. Obviously, we \nare going to have to work with the White House on a continuing basis.\n  I want to assure you, Mr. Leader, I will also sit down, roll up my \nsleeves, and try to work. Maybe we can't solve these problems, but if \nit is possible to solve them, I want to do it.\n  I thank the Senator for his help.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 11 minutes, and the \nSenator from Maryland has 7 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee. I thank him for the time. I also thank him for the \nleadership and direction and focus he has had on this issue and his \nwillingness to talk to others about the issues.\n  I rise to oppose the substitute amendment offered by the ranking \nmember of the Banking Committee. Most of the reasons for my opposition\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\nlie within the great expansion of the Community Reinvestment Act, or \nCRA.\n  For example, the amendment would allow the Federal banking agencies \nto take actions, including divestiture, forcing people to sell off \nparts of their business if an institution fails to maintain a \nsatisfactory or better CRA rating. Currently, the enforcement action \nauthorized for the banking agencies is the ability to deny the \nnoncompliant banks' application to acquire another facility.\n  The substitute would expand the reach of CRA to noninsured \ninstitutions or wholesale financial institutions, and they don't even \ndeal with consumers. Previously it had been argued that banks and \nthrifts convey an economic benefit as a result of deposit insurance, \nand thus the CRA is justifiably imposed on those institutions. But now, \nfor the first time, this amendment would expand CRA to the non-FDIC-\ninsured institutions.\n  It would allow a Federal banking agency to take enforcement action, \nsuch as the cease and desist order, civil monetary penalties, or even \ncriminal sanctions, all for not complying with the CRA. That is an \nexpansion. These penalties could even be extended to an officer or \ndirector of the holding company or bank.\n  In addition to extraordinary CRA expansion, I found several other \nproblems with the substitute amendment. First, it reduces the authority \nof State insurance commissioners and creates the National Association \nof Registered Agents and Brokers, NARAB. The insurance agents in \nWyoming oppose the NARAB provision because they believe it is the \nprecursor to Federal regulation of insurance and Federal bureaucracy.\n  The substitute amendment also reduces the ability of the bank to \nengage in trust and fiduciary activities. On the other hand, S. 900 \nallows a bank to engage in traditional trust and fiduciary activities, \njust as they have done for so many years.\n\n  Additionally, it is apparent that there is not consensus in the \nsubstitute bill, and it differs from the product of last year. I voted \nfor H.R. 10 last year. I will not vote for this substitute. It is not \nthe same bill. The most significant difference lies in the operating \nsubsidiary provisions. Last year, H.R. 10 only passed the House by one \nvote. Just last week the House Commerce Committee held a hearing on \nH.R. 10, which is nearly identical to the substitute amendment, and the \nMembers on both sides of the aisle were very critical of the bill.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose the substitute \namendment. It does not represent a consensus, and it is certainly more \nburdensome and expansive on the affected industries. It is not the \nproduct of compromise.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas controls 7 minutes 37 \nseconds, and the Senator from Maryland has 7 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the substitute \namendment, which is the provisions contained in S. 753, introduced by \nSenator Daschle and all of the Democratic members of the Senate \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.\n  We have been at this for a long time--those on the committee and \nother Members who have been interested in the issue of financial \nservices modernization. We have been seeking to find a way to pass a \nbill to protect safety and soundness, to protect consumers, to ensure \nthat CRA not be undercut or eroded; and that permits financial service \ninstitutions within the realm of financial services, in effect, to \nenter into new arrangements in terms of affiliations and the activities \nthey can conduct.\n  This is something that has been urged on us. Those in the industry \nthink it would be helpful to them. Some of this has been taking place \nwithout statute, but it is uncertain, unsure. It happens through \nregulation; it happens through court decision. I think most people \nthink if we could arrive at a statutory framework in which to place \nthese developments that that would be a desirable objective.\n  That is why we introduced S. 753. That is why we are offering it as a \nsubstitute amendment to the committee bill. It essentially tracks the \nlanguage of the bill that was reported last year on a vote of 16-2 from \nthe committee with one exception with respect to operating \nsubsidiaries. This substitute permits banks to conduct some activities \nin an operating subsidiary--not all of the activities they can now \nengage in--and that reflects, in part, an effort by Secretary Rubin to \ntry to reach an accommodation to ensure that some of the concerns that \nwere raised are addressed.\n  There is a conflict, a difference of view here, a very strong \ndifference of view here between Secretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan, \nboth of whom are saying to have a bill we have to have a good bill, and \ntheir definition of a good bill, each of them, is one that corresponds \nto their views, particularly on this important issue of the op-sub \nversus the affiliate, as far as carrying on activities.\n  In this regard, I point out as we listen to Secretary Rubin that we \nare also listening, of course, to the possibilities of a Presidential \nveto. We can't get a bill into law without the President's signature--\nthat is obvious and clear--and the President has taken a very strong \nposition on this legislation. In fact, he has sent a letter to the \ncommittee stating in the clearest possible terms that he would veto the \ncommittee bill if it was presented to him in its current form. That is \nwhen we began the markup in the committee. The committee has issued a \nstatement of administration policy in which they say:\n\n       Nevertheless, because of crucial flaws in the bill, the \n     President has stated that if the bill were presented to him \n     in its current form, he would veto it.\n\n  We have had extended debate on the differences between the committee \nbill and the substitute amendment. Senator Gramm and I and others are \nparticipating in that. I am frank to say I thought the minority leader, \nSenator Daschle, just laid out a very clear, concise, extremely well-\nstated position with respect to the differences between these \napproaches.\n  We differ in banking and commerce. The substitute seeks to, in \neffect, reaffirm, make clearer, the division between banking and \ncommerce. We differ, as I indicated, with respect to the operating \nsubsidiary issue, which of course involves the sharp difference between \nthe Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. \nWe differ very strongly on CRA. It is asserted that the substitute \nexpands CRA. In fact, what the substitute seeks to do is to ensure that \nif banks move into securities and insurance, that those banks should \nhave a satisfactory CRA rating before they can undertake such a merger \nor affiliation.\n  It requires the banks to be in compliance with CRA. It in effect says \nthat a bank with an unsatisfactory CRA rating is not going to be able \nto use this additional power now being given to them to move into \nsecurities and to move into insurance. At the moment, they do a limited \namount of that activity. But if they are going to actually go into it \nin a full-scale way, which is what this legislation offers--which both \npieces of legislation offer to the banks, we do not differ on that \nproposition; both as a part of the financial services modernization \napproach are prepared to permit that--but we feel very strongly that \nthey should be in compliance, the banks should be in compliance with \nCRA, if they intend to do that.\n  A number of very important groups in the community support the \nsubstitute. I will have printed in the Record letters from civil rights \norganizations--from Hispanic organizations, which have been very strong \nin perceiving that CRA has made a big, big difference in their \ncommunity in terms of home ownership and in terms of investment, and \nthat there has been very significant benefit for Native American \norganizations that report on what has happened on the Indian \nreservations, from farm and rural groups, and from over 200 mayors, all \nof whom prefer the substitute amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent those letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                               on Civil Rights\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: We are writing to express our deep \n     concern over your public mischaracterizations of the \n     Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), and over the treatment of \n     CRA in the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 as \n     reported out of the Senate Banking Committee on March 4.\n       The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights is the nation's \n     oldest, largest, and most diverse coalition of organizations \n     committed to the protection of civil rights in the United \n     States. As leaders of the civil rights community, we take \n     strong issue with your description of CRA as a vehicle for \n     ``fraud and extortion'' \\1\\ and to your characterization of \n     CRA as ``perhaps the greatest national scandal in America.'' \n     \\2\\ To the contrary, we agree with President Clinton that the \n     Community Reinvestment Act is ``a law that has helped to \n     build homes, create jobs, and restore hope in communities \n     across America.'' \\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       CRA has proven to be an effective means of encouraging \n     federally insured financial institutions to extend prudent \n     and profitable loans in underserved urban and rural \n     communities. CRA has been credited with the dramatic increase \n     in homeownership rates among minority, and low- and moderate-\n     income individuals. Since 1993, the number of home mortgage \n     loans extended to African-Americans has increased by 58%, to \n     Hispanics by 62%, and to low- and moderate-income borrowers \n     by 38%.\\4\\ CRA has similarly served as the impetus for \n     revitalizing distressed rural and urban communities through \n     small business and small farm lending and community \n     development investments.\n       Data from federal bank regulators reveal that the CRA has \n     not been used arbitrarily to block or delay bank applications \n     to the regulators. Community groups and others rarely file \n     adverse comments to bank applications based on CRA. Less than \n     1% of bank applications have received adverse comments.\\5\\ \n     Moreover, assertions that banks provide commitments to \n     community groups and others because they are afraid that \n     regulators will deny or substantially delay the processing of \n     their application is not supported by the record. Bank \n     applications that receive adverse comments are denied only 1% \n     of the time.\\6\\ In addition, few applications are \n     substantially delayed due to an adverse CRA comment.\n       Despite the strong record of CRA success and the lack of \n     evidence of abuse, the bill that was reported out of the \n     Senate Banking Committee seriously weakens CRA in three ways. \n     First, it does not require that all banks in a bank holding \n     company have a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating to exercise the \n     new powers provided by the legislation. This would \n     substantially roll back CRA by permitting banks that are not \n     meeting the credit needs of their communities to benefit from \n     the expanded powers to affiliate with securities and \n     insurance firms.\n       Second, the bill would provide a ``safe harbor'' from \n     public comment on CRA performance for banks with a \n     ``satisfactory'' CRA rating. Under the bill, an institution \n     receiving at least a satisfactory CRA rating during the \n     previous 36-month period would be deemed in compliance with \n     CRA and immune from public comment unless individuals present \n     ``substantial verifiable information'' to the contrary \n     arising since the last examination. Since over 95% of banks \n     receive a satisfactory rating, the provision would \n     fundamentally undercut the right of community groups and \n     others to comment on a bank's CRA performance.\\7\\ Community \n     group participation in the CRA process has been critical to \n     the success of CRA. Public comment on other aspects of a \n     bank's performance, such as management or financial \n     resources, would not face similar limitations on the scope of \n     information that may be introduced nor be subject to the same \n     burden of proof.\n       Third, the bill exempts banks with less than $100 million \n     in assets from CRA. This represents 63% of all banks.\\8\\ If \n     enacted the provision will have devastating consequences for \n     rural communities because small banks are often the only \n     source of credit in rural areas. Despite claims that small \n     banks by their nature serve the credit needs of local \n     communities, data from regulators reveal that these \n     institutions have disproportionately poor CRA records.\n       We would note that the financial services bill reported out \n     of the House Banking Committee last week on a bipartisan vote \n     of 51-8 did not contain any of these shortcomings in regard \n     to CRA. This is in sharp contrast to the 11-9 party line vote \n     by which the Senate Banking Committee reported out its bill, \n     in significant measure because of the controversial CRA \n     provisions.\n       Fair access to credit, which is the purpose of CRA, is a \n     critical civil rights issue. As the President has said, ``CRA \n     is working, and we must preserve its vitality as we write the \n     financial constitution for the 21st century.'' \\9\\ As \n     reported out of the Senate Banking Committee, the Financial \n     Services Act of 1999 would drastically weaken CRA. Unless \n     this shortcoming is addressed, we would urge strong \n     opposition to this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Dr. Dorothy I.

Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The undersigned organizations write \n     to express strong opposition to the Financial Services \n     Modernization Act of 1999 as reported out of the Senate \n     Banking Committee on March 4th. The Act would restructure the \n     financial services industry in the United States by allowing \n     broad affiliations among banks, insurance companies, and \n     security firms. Currently, the law strictly limits ownership \n     among different financial entities and between financial \n     companies and commercial corporations. The Act seeks to ease \n     these restrictions, without commensurate expansion of the \n     Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to cover insurance \n     companies, securities firms, mortgage companies, and other \n     financial entities allowed to affiliate with banks. The Act \n     would undermine one of the most effective revitalization \n     vehicles for underserved low-income and minority communities, \n     including Hispanic American communities across the country.\n       We have found, and research confirms, that all too often \n     the credit and financial needs of these communities are \n     severely underserved. Historically, many financial \n     institutions have avoided investing in these communities due \n     to their perceived higher level of risk. Unfortunately, \n     ``perceived higher level of risk'' is often code for ``low-\n     income'' or ``minority.'' But the facts show that low-income \n     and minority communities are not inherently riskier than \n     other communities. In fact, most financial institutions find \n     them to be quite profitable, once they begin investing in \n     them. Unfortunately, without the CRA, many financial \n     institutions have not and would not be encouraged to do so.\n       As the data show, Hispanics are the fastest-growing \n     population in the United States. We are a growing force in \n     the expansion of homeownership and small business \n     development, two leading indicators of the economic well-\n     being of this country. For example, between 1987 and 1992, \n     Hispanic-owned business grew by 76%, compared to 26% for U.S. \n     businesses overall. According to a 1997 Harvard study, ``the \n     number of Hispanic homeowners has shown the most spectacular \n     rise'' in recent years compared to that of Whites and of \n     other minority groups. Population projections forecast \n     Hispanics to be the largest minority group in the U.S. by the \n     year 2005, causing the U.S. economy to be increasingly \n     dependent on the continued prosperity of the Hispanic \n     American community. Without the CRA, this growth may be \n     impeded.\n       As reported out of the Senate Banking Committee, the \n     Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 would hinder \n     that growth by weakening the CRA in the following three ways. \n     First, a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating is not required in order \n     for financial institutions to enjoy the new powers afforded \n     to them by the legislation, thereby allowing banks to \n     exercise their privilege, even if they are not meeting the \n     credit needs of the communities where they do business.\n       Second, banks receiving a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating would \n     be given a ``safe harbor'' from public comment on CRA \n     performance. Since over 95% of banks receive a \n     ``satisfactory'' rating, this would undermine the \n     effectiveness of the law by restricting a community's right \n     to voice its experience with banks. While a ``satisfactory'' \n     rating provides a helpful guide to a bank's overall \n     performance, it may not provide an accurate picture at the \n     neighborhood level.\n       Third, the Act proposes to exempt all small rural banks \n     (those with less than $100 million in assets) from CRA, \n     thereby releasing 76% of all rural banks from their CRA \n     obligations. As with the safe harbor provision, this \n     undermines the spirit and the effectiveness of the law by \n     exempting most rural banks. This would have particularly \n     adverse consequences in low-income rural communities where \n     often the only source of\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\n     credit is a small bank. Moreover, researchers have found that \n     small banks have disproportionately poor CRA records compared \n     to larger banks, thereby highlighting the need for CRA in \n     rural communities and small towns.\n       CRA is one of the strongest incentives to encourage \n     investment in low-income and minority communities. Over the \n     last twenty-two years, neighborhoods across the country have \n     benefited from CRA-encouraged investments. This has resulted \n     in increases in homeownership and business development, \n     leading to the rebirth of many American neighborhoods. \n     However, many communities remain underserved by capital and \n     investment vehicles. For this reason, reinforcement, not \n     weakening, of CRA is critically needed. We urge you to \n     support the continued strengthening of America's communities \n     by vigorously opposing the Financial Services Modernization \n     Act of 1999 as reported out of Committee, and supporting \n     amendments that would strengthen the Bill's CRA protections. \n     Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n         Rick Dovalina, National President, League of United Latin \n           American Citizens; Arturo Vargas, Executive Director, \n           NALEO Educational Fund; Ruth Pagani, Executive \n           Director, National Hispanic Housing Council (NHHC); \n           Juan Figueroa, President and General Counsel, Puerto \n           Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund (PRLDEF); \n           Antonia Hernandez, President and General Counsel; \n           MALDEF; Raul Uzaguirre, President and Chief Executive \n           Officer, National Council of La Raza (NCLR); Manual \n           Mirabal, President and Chief Executive Officer, \n           National Puerto Rican Coalition (NPRC).\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Congress of\n\n\n                                             American Indians,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: On behalf of the National Congress of \n     American Indians (``NCAI''), we are writing to express our \n     serious concern over the treatment of the Community \n     Reinvestment Act (``CRA'') in the Financial Services \n     Modernization Act of 1999. NCAI is the oldest, largest and \n     most representative national Indian organization devoted to \n     promoting and protecting the rights of tribal governments and \n     their citizens.\n       The CFA has proven to be an effective means of encouraging \n     federally insured financial institutions to extend prudent \n     and profitable loans in traditionally underserved areas \n     including Indian Country. Specifically, the CRA has helped \n     focus attention to the challenges of extending credit to \n     reservations under current law and has acted as a catalyst to \n     reservation based economic development. Since the \n     implementation of the CRA, Native American groups and banks \n     have negotiated agreements for lending more than $155 million \n     within Indian Country.\n       In its current form, we believe the Financial Services \n     Modernization Act of 1999 would seriously erode the \n     effectiveness of the CRA, a law that has certainly helped to \n     build homes, create jobs and restore hope in many of our \n     communities. We are particularly concerned that the bill \n     reported by your committee would exempt small rural banks \n     from coverage by the CRA and would create a ``safe harbor'' \n     under CRA for banks with satisfactory or better ratings thus \n     making it much more difficult for the public to comment on \n     problems with a bank's CRA performance in conjunction with an \n     expansion application filed by a bank. We are also concerned \n     that your bill does not require that all banks in a bank \n     holding company have a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating to \n     exercise the new powers provided by the legislation. This \n     would substantially roll back the CRA by permitting banks \n     that are not meeting the credit needs of communities to \n     benefit from the expanded powers to affiliate with securities \n     and insurance firms.\n       We strongly urge you to reconsider these provisions of the \n     bill. As reported out of the Senate Banking Committee, the \n     Financial Services Act of 1999 drastically weakens the CRA \n     and unless this shortcoming is addressed, we would urge \n     strong opposition to the legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     W. Ron Allen,\n                                                        President.\n       (Also signed by 17 representatives of tribes and tribal \n     organizations.)\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 The United States\n\n\n                                          Conference of Mayors\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) has \n     played a critical role in encouraging federally insured \n     financial institutions to invest in the cities of our \n     country. Legislation reported out of the Senate Banking \n     Committee on March 4, the Financial Modernization Act of \n     1999, would dramatically weaken CRA. We strongly urge you to \n     oppose this legislation unless CRA is preserved and \n     strengthened.\n       The United States Conference of Mayors is the nation's \n     largest nonpartisan organization dedicated to ensuring the \n     economic stability of the nation's largest cities. As mayors, \n     we recognize that CRA has been an essential tool in \n     revitalizing cities around this nation. In fact, there is now \n     increasing recognition that the strength and economic health \n     of whole regions require strong and vibrant cities. Creating \n     new economic activity--new businesses, new jobs, new \n     homeowners--is key to the revival of urban areas and their \n     surrounding regions, CRA has been a key component to creating \n     this new economic activity.\n       Private sector investment encouraged under CRA has helped \n     to stabilize communities suffering from economic decline. CRA \n     has similarly helped to spur bank and thrift investment in \n     multi-family rental housing development and rehabilitation, \n     small business expansion, and community economic development. \n     CRA is a crucial complement to FHA Insurance, The HOME \n     program, Community Development Block Grants, and the low-\n     income housing tax credit. These programs, which have built \n     or financed the purchase of millions of units of affordable \n     rental and ownership homes, work so effectively because they \n     leverage tens of millions of private dollars.\n       In light of the success of CRA and our experiences with \n     community revitalization efforts, we are very troubled by \n     allegations that have been made that CRA has ``since been \n     corrupted into a system of legalized extortion.'' In contrast \n     to the description of community based organizations as \n     ``racketeers'' and ``thugs'' many of us have participated in \n     successful partnerships with private institutions and members \n     of the community. These relationships have resulted in a \n     tremendous infusion of capital into underserved communities \n     as well as increased banking services.\n       The bill that was reported out of the Senate Banking \n     Committee would have dire consequences for the nation's \n     cities if it were enacted. First, the failure to require that \n     banks seeking to affiliate with securities and insurance \n     firms have a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating would permit banks \n     to ignore the credit needs of their communities and benefit \n     from the powers provided in the legislation. This is a \n     substantial rollback of CRA and would most certainly reduce \n     the flow of capital in these areas--returning us to a time \n     when banks and thrifts redlined communities with credit \n     worthy borrowers.\n       In addition, the bill provides a ``safe harbor'' from \n     public comment on CRA performance to banks with a \n     ``satisfactory'' or better CRA rating. This provision \n     effectively eliminates public comment on a bank's CRA \n     performance. As you are undoubtedly aware, the opportunity to \n     comment on a bank's performance is a right given to every \n     member of the public. Public comment participation in the CRA \n     process is considered a critical component of the law's \n     success. The public often raises community investment issues \n     which have been overlooked by regulators. This provision \n     singles out CRA comments for unfair treatment. Unlike CRA \n     comments, individuals seeking to comment on other aspects of \n     a bank's performance would not face limitations on the scope \n     of information that they may introduce or be required to \n     carry a burden of proof. Moreover, data from regulators \n     indicated that the comment process has not been abused.\n       Finally, the bill exempts small banks in rural areas \n     (assets less than $100 million in assets) from CRA \n     obligations. These institutions represent 76% of banks and \n     thrifts in rural communities. This provision would seriously \n     compromise the capital needs of rural residents who depend \n     almost exclusively on small banks and thrifts to meet their \n     credit needs. Residents in these communities rely on CRA to \n     encourage banks to make mortgage, small farm, and small \n     business loans.\n       Prior to the enactment of CRA, banks, and thrifts routinely \n     redlined low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in our \n     nation's cities. The modest requirement in CRA that financial \n     institutions meet the credit needs of their communities has \n     lead to the successful channeling of billions of dollars into \n     localities.\n       As reported out of the Senate Banking Committee, the \n     Financial Services Act of 1999 would severely weaken CRA and \n     our nation's cities.

We are very concerned that the bill substantially \n     undercuts the existing Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and \n     totally ignores the need to modernize CRA to meet the \n     dramatic changes in financial services across the country.\n       Rural America remains in desperate need of affordable \n     credit. CRA has been a law that has significantly expanded \n     access to credit in rural areas of our country. Despite this \n     increased access, there remain widening gaps and unmet needs \n     in ensuring credit access to all rural residents. A recent \n     Small Business Administration (SBA) report analyzing the June \n     1998 Federal Reserve Data shows a 4.6% decline in the number \n     of small farm loans. The value of total farm loans was $74.5 \n     billion. Of great concern is the statistic that reveals a \n     troubling trend; the value of very large farm loans (over $1 \n     million) increased by 25% while ``small'' farm loans (under \n     $250,000) increased a mere 3.9%. Larger loans are going to \n     fewer operations.\n       Rural areas continue to suffer from a serious shortage of \n     affordable housing. Farmers are facing the worst financial \n     conditions in more than a decade due to declining commodity \n     prices. Rural Americans continue to need the tools of the CRA \n     to ensure accountability of their local lending institutions. \n     CRA helps to meet the credit demand of millions of family \n     farmers, rural residents, and local businesses.\n       We strongly oppose three provisions in the Senate Banking \n     Committee reported bill which would have particularly \n     negative consequences for our communities.\n       First, the bill contains a ``safe harbor'' for banks that \n     have achieved a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating in each of its \n     examinations in the prior 36-month period. This provision \n     would make banks and thrifts immune to public comment during \n     pending expansion applications unless individuals or groups \n     are able to provide ``substantial verifiable information'' \n     that the bank is not in compliance with CRA. This provision \n     would essentially eliminate the public's opportunity to \n     comment on a bank's performance in meeting the credit needs \n     of its communities. More than 95% of banks consistently \n     receive `satisfactory' or higher ratings. Rural residents \n     play an important role in bringing CRA performance issues to \n     the attention of regulators and making banks responsive to \n     community needs. This provision would deny citizens and \n     community based organizations the opportunity to comment on \n     the credit needs of their community.\n       Two, the bill exempts from CRA banks and thrifts with less \n     than $100 million in assets located in non-metropolitan \n     areas. These institutions represent 76% of banks and thrifts \n     in rural communities. This provision would seriously \n     compromise the capital needs of rural residents who depend \n     almost exclusively on small banks and thrifts to meet their \n     credit needs. Banks and thrifts in rural areas face little \n     competition from other financial services institutions.\n       In addition, despite assertions from the industry, many \n     small banks do not by their nature serve the credit needs of \n     their communities. In fact, data from the regulators show \n     that small banks do not invest more in their communities, on \n     average than larger banks. In addition, small banks have a \n     disproportionately high share of less than satisfactory CRA \n     ratings. A Congressional Research Service study of data from \n     1997 to mid-1998, found that banks with less than $100 \n     million in assets received 70% of the below ``satisfactory'' \n     CRA ratings.\n       In addition, arguments that CRA subjects small banks to \n     intrusive and time consuming compliance requirements are \n     unfounded. The CRA regulations were revised in 1995 in part \n     to reduce compliance burdens on small banks. The new rules \n     provide for a streamlined examination for banks with less \n     than $250 million in assets including an exemption from data \n     collection and reporting requirements. Small bank ratings now \n     focus exclusively on lending and lending related activities. \n     The need to reduce an already minimal regulatory burden on \n     small banks should not outweigh the credit needs of residents \n     of rural communities.\n       Third, unlike last year's H.R. 10 voted out of the Senate \n     Banking Committee and this year's House Banking Committee \n     version of financial modernization, the Senate Banking \n     Committee reported bill fails to require that banks have a \n     ``satisfactory'' CRA rating in order to affiliate with \n     securities and insurance firms. In the absence of this \n     requirement, a bank could ignore the credit needs of its \n     communities and still benefit from the new affiliations and \n     powers provided under this legislation.\n       The Small Business Administration (SBA) report on bank \n     holding company lending in rural communities reaffirms this \n     concern. While the 57 largest bank holding companies held \n     68.6 percent of all domestic bank assets in June 1998, they \n     made just 10.7% or 160,000 of all the outstanding farm loans. \n     These loans totaled just .18 percent of total assets in these \n     bank holding companies. This increasing concentration and \n     consolidation in\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\n     financial services comes at a time when the community role in \n     determining whether this expansion is appropriate is being \n     reduced.\n       In closing, CRA has been a valuable tool for over twenty \n     years to encourage financial institutions to help meet the \n     credit needs of rural communities across this nation. Access \n     to affordable capital is important to restoring economic \n     prosperity in our nation's rural areas. In its current form, \n     the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 permits \n     banks to ignore the needs of our communities and remove one \n     of the few tools that has resulted in a level of \n     accountability. We urge you to vote against the Financial \n     Services Modernization Act of 1999 unless these objections \n     are addressed. Please contact (202) 543-5675 with any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Corn Growers Association\n     Center for Rural Affairs\n     Federation of Southern Cooperatives\n     Intertribal Agriculture Council\n     Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement\n     Land Loss Prevention Project (NC)\n     Missouri Rural Crisis Center\n     National Black Caucus of State Legislators\n     National Catholic Rural Life Conference\n     National Family Farm Coalition\n     National Farmers Union\n     National Neighborhood Housing Network\n     National Rural Housing Coalition\n     North American Farm Alliance\n     Presbyterian Church (USA), Washington office\n     Rural Coalition\n     Sin Fronteras Organizing Project\n     United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and Society\n     Wisconsin Rural Development Center\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Finally, let me simply say, as the Democratic leader \nindicated, unless we can get the substitute in place, we are on a veto \ntrack with S. 900. The substitute will eliminate the veto problem. So, \nfor those who want legislation, who want to see financial services \nmodernization enacted into law, I urge them to vote for the substitute.\n  I assume the chairman will probably make a motion to table.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Therefore, I urge Members to vote against the motion to \ntable the substitute, thereby giving us the opportunity to then go \nforward and adopt the substitute.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by noting that not one single \norganization which represents anyone who makes a living in any industry \ndirectly affected by this bill supports the Sarbanes substitute. The \nSarbanes substitute is opposed by insurance companies, by those who \nrepresent the companies; it is opposed by the American Bankers \nAssociation, by the Bankers Roundtable, and by the Independent Bankers \nof America. It is opposed by every organization that represents any \nfacet of the securities industry. This substitute is literally a \nsubstitute which has no support by anyone who is going to be directly \naffected by these laws.\n  What are the major problems with it? There are more problems than I \ncan possibly outline in 6 minutes, so let me just take a couple of \nthem. We all know Alan Greenspan. We know he is the most respected \nperson in America on economic matters. We all know if there is anybody \non this planet who can lay any legitimate claim to the current level of \nprosperity in America, it is Alan Greenspan, because of his banking and \nmonetary policies.\n  We also know that Alan Greenspan is not someone who goes out looking \nfor a fight. If he has to say something that anybody does not want to \nhear, he tends to go all around the barn before he says it. You need to \nknow those things to understand how strongly Chairman Greenspan feels \nin his opposition to the Sarbanes substitute. In fact, he has said, ``I \nand my colleagues''--and by ``colleagues'' he means every member of the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve, most of whom were appointed \nby Bill Clinton--``are firmly of the view that the long-term stability \nof the U.S. financial markets and the interests of the American \ntaxpayer would be better served by no financial modernization bill \nrather than one that allows the proposed new activities to be conducted \nby the bank. . ..''\n  Alan Greenspan says in the strongest way possible, in the most \npassionate terms that he has ever spoken on any issue in his public \nlife: You would be better not to pass a bill than to pass the Sarbanes \nsubstitute.\n  Why? Because the Sarbanes substitute lets banks engage in these \nexpanded financial services within the bank, thereby putting at risk \nthe taxpayer through FDIC insurance. By performing these services in \nbanks, they get an implicit subsidy from FDIC insurance, from the \ndiscount window, from the Federal wire, that will make banks able--not \nbecause they are more efficient, but because of this subsidy--\nultimately able to dominate the securities industry and all other \nindustries which would be affected. We would end up with a banking \nsystem that looks very much like the Japanese banking system, totally \ndominating our financial markets. Alan Greenspan is opposed to that. It \nis very dangerous for the American economy. It is dangerous for the \ntaxpayer. I urge my colleagues to reject this substitute.\n  A second issue I want to talk about is CRA. The current bill \npreserves CRA. The current bill makes two modest changes. One, it says \nthat if a bank has a long-term history of compliance --has been in \ncompliance three years in a row and is currently in compliance--that if \na protest group or individual wants to inject themselves into the \nprocess, they can do it. They can say whatever they want to say. But \nthe regulator can't hold up the bank's action in the name of CRA, given \ntheir long history of compliance and given that they are currently in \ncompliance, unless the protester has more than a scintilla of evidence; \nunless the protester can present such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support the claim; unless the \nprotester has real, material--not seeming or imaginary--evidence. In \nother words, if you are going to stop a bank from doing something that \nit has been found qualified to do, you have to present some evidence--\nhardly, a demanding constraint.\n  Second, we exempt very small rural banks from CRA. Why? We exempt \nvery small rural banks from CRA for a very simple reason:\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sarbanes \nsubstitute amendment to the Financial Services Modernization Act. I \nsalute him for his leadership in seeking financial services reform that \nprepares us for the new century.\n  I agree that we should reform our financial services. There is no \ndoubt that changes in law have lagged behind changes in our banking and \nfinancial services industries.\n  This amendment is a great improvement over the underlying bill. It \nwould provide greater protections for consumers. It would also maintain \nthe Community Reinvestment Act--which is so important in enabling low \nincome communities to help themselves.\n  However, I would like to raise a number of what I call ``flashing \nyellow lights'' or warning signals that we should be aware of before \nenacting financial services modernization. We should proceed with \ncaution to avoid irrevocable changes when the savings of hard working \nfamilies and the viability of our communities could be put in jeopardy.\n  For example, financial services reform would make it easier for \nbanks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge into \noligopolies. The savings of many would be controlled by a few. \nAmericans will know less about where their deposits are kept and how \nthey are used.\n  What would be the effect of these mergers on consumers? I am \nconcerned that these mega institutions could lead to higher fees and \nfewer choices for consumers.\n  Marylanders used to have savings accounts with local banks where the \nteller knew their name and their family. We have already seen the trend \ntoward mega-mergers, accompanied by higher fees, a decline in service, \nand the loss of neighborhood financial institutions. This legislation \naccelerates that trend.\n  In addition, what would be the affect of this legislation on the \nalarming increase in foreign takeovers of US banks? I support increased \nglobalization, but what will happen when home town banks are taken over \nby companies that have no roots or commitments to the community?\n  With a globalization of financial resources, the local bank could be \nbought by a holding company based outside the United States. Instead of \nthe friendly neighborhood teller, consumers would be contacting a \ncomputer operator in a country half-way around the globe through an 800 \nnumber. Their account could be subject to\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\nrisks that have nothing to do with their job, their community or even \nthe economy of the United States. I know that impersonalized \nglobalization is not what banking customers want when they talk about \nmodernization of financial services.\n  So I will support the Sarbanes amendment. It goes further in \nanswering my concerns. But I hope we will be able to address these \nconcerns more fully as we move forward with this legislation. they \ngenerally do not have a city to serve, much less an inner city.\n\n  Third, in the last 9 years, Federal regulators have performed 16,380 \nCRA evaluations of these banks--evaluating them annually. These banks \nreport that it costs them between $60,000 and $80,000 a year to comply \nwith CRA. Yet, at the end of 9 years and 16,380 evaluations, just three \nsmall rural banks have been found to be substantially out of \ncompliance. One million--excuse me, one trillion. Excuse me, let me be \nsure I have my figure here. At the end of this process, with small \nbanks having spent perhaps $1,310,400,000,000 complying with paperwork \nin the name of evaluating community lending, we have found just three \nbanks out of compliance. Not only does the substitute eliminate this \nprovision that ends this senseless wasting of small bank resources that \ncost local communities and deny them access to credit, but it imposes \nconfiscatory penalties that would make a bank, if it fell out of \ncompliance with CRA, potentially subject to a $1 million fine, not just \non the bank but on the bank officer or on the bank director.\n  We have two letters here, one from the Independent Bankers and one \nfrom the ABA, raising the point that one of the toughest things to do \nnow in this period of massive lawsuit liability is to get good people \nto serve on a bank board. Both the Independent Bankers of America and \nthe ABA have written urging us not to adopt a provision that would make \nit virtually impossible for small banks, especially, to get qualified \nofficers and board members because of the liability costs. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12 noon \nhaving arrived, the Senator from Texas is recognized to make a motion \nto table.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute so I can pose a \nquestion to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want 1 minute to respond.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How does the Senator get this $1 trillion figure?\n  Mr. GRAMM. We have had 16,380 examinations of small, rural \ninstitutions since 1990. Those small, rural institutions report to us \nthat it costs them about $80,000 a year to keep the records to comply \nwith these examinations, and that is where the number came from.\n  Mr. SARBANES. My arithmetic--first of all, I do not concede the \nfigures. In any event, even if I accept them, it is 1 billion, not 1 \ntrillion.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If it is a billion or a trillion, it is a lot of money.\n  Mr. SARBANES. A lot of money, but there is a big difference between a \nbillion and a trillion. That is one of the problems with this debate, I \nunderscore.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have my trusty calculator, and I will make the \ncalculation again. But lest my colleague be correct, let me just \nrestate it in his terms. The term is, does it make sense to make little \nbanks spend $1.3 billion to comply with keeping paperwork when in 9 \nyears, only three banks out of 16,000 audits have been substantially \nout of compliance? Is that not overkill? Is that not bankrupting every \nsmall bank in America? The answer is yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to table the pending substitute, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, Members \nshould be aware that votes will occur today on the CRA issue and \npossibly other banking issues. If debate is completed before the 7 \no'clock hour, there are other amendments that could be considered. \nThere will certainly be one at 7 o'clock on this CRA issue.\n  If the Senate is able to complete this banking bill by the close of \nbusiness on Thursday, then I would be prepared to announce at that time \nthat there would be no votes on Friday. So if we can get this work \ncompleted--and it looks as if we may be able to; the managers are \nworking together. And we have a couple of issues that will have to be \ndebated and considered carefully, plus there are other amendments that \nwon't take as long to be debated. This could be completed by Thursday \nnight. If that is the case, we will not have any votes on Friday. If we \nare not able to finish it Thursday night, we may have to go over until \nFriday and complete it. I wanted Members to be aware of that \npossibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Mr. President, we are about ready to debate an important \nissue dealing with the Community Reinvestment Act. Let me say that I \nthink there has been considerably more heat than light generated in the \ndebate surrounding this issue. I thought it might be helpful to my \ncolleagues to explain how the provisions of this act work, what is \ninvolved, what is not involved, the provisions that currently exist in \nthe bill we are debating, and the contents of the amendment.\n  The Community Reinvestment Act has been in operation now for 21 \nyears. The act itself is triggered in either of two circumstances--one, \nas part of a periodic review, and that depends upon the size of the \ninstitution. It applies only to insured depository institutions, so we \nare talking about banks and thrifts. It also is triggered when a \ndepository institution files an application for a charter conversion, \nfor merger, acquisition, or requesting authority for additional \nbranches.\n  Those applications, then, are reviewed by the appropriate bank \nregulator, or the thrift regulator, whether that be the OCC, the \nFederal Reserve, or the OTC. Notice is then given, and the community \ngroups have an opportunity to comment on the application. So you have a \nperiodic review, which may be annually or a longer period of time, or \nyou have the circumstances in which an insured depository institution \nseeks either a charter conversion, a merger, an acquisition, or \nadditional branches.\n  Notice is given. Now, 97 percent of all depository institutions--\nbanks or thrifts--get a satisfactory CRA rating. The penalties that can \nbe provided are that, No. 1, an application could be denied, an \napplication could be accepted subject to certain conditions, or the \napplication can be approved without conditions. I think it is important \nto understand who is making the decision here. It is not the community \ngroups that have a veto power. These are decisions that are essentially \nmade by bank regulators--regulators that have traditionally evinced no \nhostility to the banking industry. And even an institution which gets \nthe lowest rating--substantial noncompliance is the lowest rating you \ncan get--may still have its application approved. So nothing in the \nlanguage of CRA compels a regulator to disapprove an application, even \nif the financial institution that is applying for the relief sought \ngets the lowest evaluation possible.\n  What is the history in the last 21 years of the act? There have been \nsome 86,000 applications filed over the last 21 years and, of those, \nonly 660 have received adverse comments. So less than 1 percent of all \nof the applications relating to CRA that have been received have been \nsubject to objections or adverse comments by any of the regulating \ngroups over a period of 21 years.\n  What has CRA accomplished? Well, it has accomplished a great deal. In \npoint of fact, the CRA, over the years, has resulted in a substantial \nincrease in lending and other financial activity within the inner-city \nand minority groups in America. CRA encourages banks to meet the credit \nneeds of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income \nareas.\n  Over the last 21 years, the CRA has been one of the strongest \nincentives to encourage investment in low-income and minority \ncommunities.\n  Under the law, federally insured financial institutions have made \nbillions of dollars in profitable market rate loans and investments in \nunderserved urban and rural areas. And it has done so without creating \na large Federal bureaucracy, or jeopardizing the safety and soundness \nof any financial institution.\n  CRA has been an important tool in improving access to credit for \nminority and low- to moderate-income Americans.\n  The dramatic increase in home ownership rates for minorities is \nattributable in large part to increased focus on banks' CRA \nperformance. Between 1993 and 1997, the number of conventional home \nmortgage loans extended increased for African Americans by 72 percent; \nfor Hispanics, 45 percent; for Asian Americans, 31 percent; for Native \nAmericans, 30 percent; for low- and moderate-income census tracks by 45 \npercent.\n  Small business owners in low- and moderate-income communities have \nseen a substantial increase in their access to credit under the law.\n  Under the emphasis of CRA, banks have made loans to African \nAmericans, Native Americans, Hispanic and Asian Americans, and, \naccording to the Small Business Administration, loans to African-\nAmerican-owned firms increased by 145 percent between 1992 and 1997. In \n1997 alone, banks made more than $34 billion in loans to entrepreneurs \nlocated in low- and moderate-income areas.\n  These loans have financed businesses which have been critical to \nrevitalizing the distressed communities.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that has a desirable result for every \nmayor of every major community in America struggling to revitalize the \ninner core of his or her State. That is the experience in my own State. \nThat is the experience, I suggest, of every State.\n  As a result of CRA, we are seeing more money being invested and \nloaned in inner cities with minority businesses.\n  That, it seems to me, makes sense, and good public policy.\n  Who, then, objects to CRA?\n  We are dealing with a piece of legislation that will substantially \ntransform the way in which modern financial institutions will be \nregulated--banking, securities and insurance.\n  Mr. President, those groups are in support of CRA, and they are in \nsupport of the amendment which I have offered.\n  Indeed, in the last session of the Congress, H.R. 10, which contains \nCRA provisions virtually identical to the ones that are contained in \nthe Bryan amendment, were passed by the House of Representatives, and \nemerged from a Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 16 to 2--broad \nbipartisan support.\n  In this Congress, the financial institution restructuring bill that \nis making its way through the other body was approved by a vote of 51 \nto 8--51 to 8--and the CRA provisions contained in that piece of \nlegislation are essentially identical to the provisions that the Bryan \namendment addresses.\n  Banks are supportive, the insurance industry is supportive, and the \nsecurities industry--the major players are supportive. Moreover, banks \nhave found not only that it is good public policy, but it makes sense \nfinancially.\n  The National Association of Home Builders, which has participated in \nan enormous growth in the rate of new housing starts, and has seen a \nremarkable increase in the percentage of home\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\nownership in America, has this to say about CRA.\n\n  The National Association of Home Builders:\n\n       Therefore, the NAHB, the National Association of Home \n     Builders, supports any amendments offered to remove or \n     replace the provisions in S. 900--\n\n  That is the bill that we are debating--\n\n     that deals with a much more restrictive and a roll-back \n     provision of CRA.\n\n  The Home Builders go on to say:\n\n       While the CRA may not be the perfect solution to ensuring \n     housing credit is available to all communities, financial \n     institutions of all sizes, through their compliance with CRA, \n     have provided crucial community development loans and \n     affordable housing production loans that have benefited \n     millions of people across the United States. We see no public \n     good served by a weakening or a reduction in the CRA \n     requirements.\n\n  I will explain shortly how S. 900, the bill before us, would \nsubstantially weaken the CRA provisions, and the position taken by the \nHome Builders, and others, is to support the amendment which is \npresently before the body.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the committee and I have \na difference of opinion. And he will have an opportunity, I am sure, to \narticulate his point of view. The chairman--it is entirely appropriate \nfor him to do so--sent out letters to various groups to get their \ncomments.\n  A letter from a small banker dated March 26 of this year responds to \nthat--a copy of which was made available to those of us who serve on \nthe committee--a letter addressed to:\n\n       Dear Senator Gramm: I received a copy of your letter to \n     Scott Jones--\n\n  Mr. Jones is the President of the American Banking Association--\n\n     regarding the proposed exemption from CRA requirements for \n     small banks. While I appreciate your efforts on our behalf, I \n     have to say that this exemption ``Don't mean jack to me.''\n\n  That is a quote. That is his language.\n\n       We have two bank charters, and have always received an \n     outstanding rating. The burden is not onerous, especially \n     under the revised requirements now in effect for the past two \n     or three years. The information I gather to determine in-area \n     versus out-of-area loans is useful to me outside of the CRA \n     requirements. I probably spend less than 5 hours a year on \n     the issue. I don't think it is worth squandering any \n     political capital you have to eliminate the CRA.\n\n  That is the essential text of the letter that our distinguished \nchairman received. That small banker made reference to some provisions \nin CRA that were changed in 1996.\n  Mr. President, recognizing that a small bank has a much smaller staff \nto deal with compliance issues, substantial changes were made in the \nCRA requirements for small banks. Essentially, we are talking about \ninstitutions under $250 million.\n  No. 1, with respect to CRA, those small banks have no CRA reporting \nrequirements.\n  Let me reemphasize that. They have no CRA reporting requirements.\n  And the standards which are applied to larger banks that are involved \nin a lending, a service, and an investment criteria are not applicable \nto small banks. Indeed, small banks do not have to compile any data. \nThey don't have to submit any reports.\n\n  They have to have records available so that when the bank examiner \ncomes in pursuant to this periodic request, or if a small bank requests \nsome activity which triggers the application of CRA, they simply say to \nthe bank examiner, ``Our records are contained in the file cabinet over \nthere.'' There is no reporting requirement and no affirmative burden on \ntheir part other than to have the records which, as the small banker \nwho wrote the letter to our distinguished chairman pointed out, a bank \nwould want to have for itself independent and separate and apart from \nthe CRA requirements.\n  So, indeed, there has been an acknowledgment and an attempt to \nstreamline the requirements that small bankers are subject to. And that \nhas been acknowledged by the correspondent who wrote to our \ndistinguished chairman.\n  What do we have in the current bill? The current bill does a couple \nof things which, in my view, roll back the provisions of CRA.\n  It says, in effect, that if a financial institution has a CRA rating \nof satisfactory or above for a period of 36 months, 3 years, it would \nbe deemed in compliance for purposes of CRA, and for any one of the \napplications for either a merger, an acquisition, or grant of \nextension, there would be no opportunity for community groups to \ncomment.\n  That would roll back the provisions.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I know the Senator, and I know he would not want to state \nsomething that is incorrect. I will be brief.\n  The amendment says if a bank has a long history of compliance, they \nhave been in compliance for 3 years in a row, they are currently in \ncompliance, in order for the regulator to prevent them from taking the \naction that they are allowed to take by being in compliance, that a \nperson who protests has to present some substantial evidence.\n  ``Substantial evidence'' is defined in the law as more than a \nscintilla. It does not in any way say they are deemed to be in \ncompliance, other than that they are innocent until proven guilty if \nthey have a good record. Anybody can protest, anybody can file a \ncomplaint, but the regulator can't stop the process or delay it unless \nthe challenging party presents some ``substantial evidence.''\n  This isn't for everybody. It is only for the banks that have a long \nhistory of compliance.\n  I didn't want to have any confusion. That is exactly what it says.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the chairman.\n  The chairman states correctly the contents of the bill. However, let \nme say in response to the Senator's position, we have in effect a 97-\npercent compliance rate. Mr. President, 97 percent of the financial \ninstitutions in the country receive satisfactory or better. In the \nentire history of the Community Reinvestment Act, with some 86,000 \napplications, we have had fewer than 1 percent of those protested in \nany way.\n  In terms of balance, to give community groups an opportunity not only \nto comment but to register concerns, it strikes me that the Senator's \nprovisions impose limitations that do not currently exist in the law. I \nknow the able chairman well understands, even if there were a finding \nunder current law that the particular financial institution has the \nlowest possible rating--substantial noncompliance--that does not \npreclude the bank regulator from approving the application.\n  CRA is not an onerous burden. Under the current law, which would \nremain in place with the Bryan amendment, a bank that seeks a merger \napproval or charter provision change or a new branch, even if that bank \nhad a substantial noncompliance, the lowest rating possible in the CRA, \nunder the law, nothing precludes the bank regulator from approving that \napplication.\n  I understand the concern of the Senator from Texas in terms of \nbalancing the equities here. It strikes me that we ought not to put \nthat additional burden of proof on community groups who may want to \nfile some legitimate concerns they have about a proposed merger, \nacquisition, or a branch extension.\n  I think the record reflects, of 86,000 applications, we have had \nfewer than 1 percent, 660, that have availed themselves of this. I \nrespectfully submit, in response to the comments of my friend from \nTexas, that is not, in my judgment, unduly burdensome.\n\n  The Senator also provides in his version of S. 900 a small bank \nexemption. The effect of that would be to eliminate about 37 percent of \nall of the banks in the country from the current provisions of CRA. \nAgain, I think it is a balance. It is not the purpose of the Senator \nfrom Nevada nor of those who support the Bryan amendment to want to \nimpose an onerous, unreasonable, unfair burden upon a financial \ninstitution. However, I must say, I think the track record would \nindicate that is not the case.\n  Responding to a legitimate concern of small banks, as I pointed out, \nin 1996 the rules were changed so that small banks do not have a \nreporting requirement. All they must do is maintain records so that the \nbank examiner who comes in periodically to review, or whenever the \napplication is filed that triggers the CRA review to look at the \nrecords, can make sure in effect that the bank is lending in the \ncommunity. It strikes me that is good public policy. Indeed, banks have \nprofited from that activity.\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\n  Those are the two provisions that the Senator's version of S. 900 \nwould contain. Also, it would eliminate CRA from the new activities \nwhich would be permitted under the provisions of this law.\n  The thrust of this legislation is to provide a regulatory framework \nthat deals with the reality of the marketplace. Many of those who do \nnot serve on the Banking Committee have heard Glass-Steagall mentioned \nfrequently in the course of financial modernization discussions. This \nis a Depression-era piece of legislation. I like it. It neatly \ncompartmentalizes banking regulation, insurance regulation, and \nsecurity regulation. It makes a lot of sense. In the aftermath of the \nfinancial collapse of the 1920s and the Great Depression that followed, \na number of abuses were pointed out. This legislation was in response \nto those abuses. It served the Nation effectively for many decades.\n  As a result of court decisions and actions taken by bank regulators, \ntoday much of Glass-Steagall has been effectively emasculated and the \nmarketplace is dictating new products that involve combinations of \ninsurance, securities, and banking functions. I agree with the \ndistinguished chairman that we need a piece of legislation which \neffectively deals with that. In effect, what we are doing is \nestablishing that modern framework. We have established essentially a \nsystem of functional regulation.\n  It appears from the testimony we have received from the Banking \nCommittee and others who have offered comment that the new financial \nworld will deal not so much in terms of mergers and acquisitions but \nwill seek to avail itself of the new financial services that banks will \nbe able to participate in under the provisions of S. 900, the financial \nrestructuring bill we are debating. Those services involve, \nessentially, securities and insurance functions.\n  This is testimony offered before the House Banking Committee by \nTreasury Secretary Rubin. I think he makes a point far more effectively \nthan I.\n\n       Banking industry experts agree that most of the \n     consolidations within the banking community have occurred and \n     that the new frontier will involve mergers among banks, \n     securities and insurance firms.\n\n  As a side point, that is the kind of activity which the S. 900 \nrestructuring bill will authorize.\n  According to Treasury Secretary Rubin, if we wish to preserve the \nrelevance of CRA at a time when the relative importance of bank mergers \nmay decline and the establishment of nonbank financial services will \nbecome increasingly important, the authority to engage in newly \nauthorized activities should be connected to a satisfactory CRA rating.\n  That is the philosophical underpinning. We will be dealing with a new \nworld, a new financial structure, and that, we believe, is appropriate \nin light of the changes in market conditions.\n  What are the requirements that would be imposed upon a depository \ninstitution under the provisions of this amendment which would seek to \navail itself of these new activities--insurance and securities? No. 1, \nas a condition precedent, a depository institution would have to have a \nsatisfactory rating. That is not, it seems to me, an unreasonable \nprovision.\n  What kind of action must the regulator consider? If the institution \nhas a satisfactory CRA rating and all other regulatory issues \nnonrelated to CRA are in place, that application could be approved, it \ncould be subjected to certain conditions, or it could be denied. An \nagreement could be entered into between the financial institution and \nthe regulator if, indeed, there were some concerns about maintaining \nthe CRA, and the regulator would have the ability to do several things \nif there were a noncompliance with the agreement entered into.\n  On balance, what we are talking about is preserving the relevance of \nCRA in this new financial world we are talking about that will deal \nwith mergers and acquisitions involving brokerage and insurance type of \nservices which are not currently authorized under the regulatory \nframework.\n  So I think, just by way of concluding, what we are talking about is \nnot a bold or reckless expansion of CRA. We are really talking about, \nNo. 1, maintaining the status quo with respect to CRA and its \ntraditional functions as it deals with the mergers and the acquisition \nand charter changes and the new branch request, which is the current \npart of the law. And we are simply saying, with respect to these new \nservices, these new opportunities which financial institutions will be \nallowed to participate in, which as Secretary Rubin points out is where \nthe action is going to be, that is where the field of play is. To say \nthat with respect to those new activities no CRA would be applicable, \nno requirement would be in place, is, in effect, to roll back the \napplication of CRA to the range of financial services that banks are \ncurrently allowed to participate in.\n  In my judgment, this is a reasonable and fair amendment. Bankers \nsupport it. Securities firms support it. Insurance companies support \nit. It enjoys a broad range of support.\n  Let me emphasize to my colleagues that, unlike some issues which have \ntended to divide us in terms of partisan differences, the House of \nRepresentatives, in considering banking legislation and financial \nrestructuring--the same type of legislation we are debating here \ntoday--in a vote of 51 to 8 approved CRA provisions which essentially \ntrack the Bryan amendment. In the last Congress, when we came within a \ngnat's eyelash of getting financial restructuring legislation enacted, \nit was approved by a bipartisan majority in the House and it cleared \nthe Senate Banking Committee on a vote of 16\nto 2.\n  So this should not be, and I hope it will not be, a partisan vote.\n  In the 21 years that CRA has been around, 86,000 applications have \nbeen received that were triggered by the provisions of the existing \nlaw. And in fewer than 1 percent--fewer than 1 percent--have objections \nor adverse comments been made.\n  I think the amendment is fair. It strikes a middle ground. It \nacknowledges the concerns of small banks with the changes that were \nmade in 1996. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nsupport this legislation.\n  I see the Senator from Maryland----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. First of all, I commend the able Senator from Nevada \nfor an extremely fine statement in support of this amendment which I \nvery strongly back.\n  The Senator made reference--I think it is an extremely important \npoint--to the fact that the decisions with respect to complying with \nCRA are made by the regulators. As I understand it, community groups or \nanyone else can come in and make comments when some of these steps are \nto be taken for which an institution would have to meet CRA muster, and \nsome of those comments, I assume, can be right on point, others may \nwander about. But whatever the case, it is not the people who comment \nwho make the judgment; it is the regulators who make the judgment. So \nthey can take it into account, give it some weight, give it no weight--\nisn't that correct?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. It is the \nregulators, whether it is the OTS, or Federal Reserve, or the OCC.\n\n  As the Senator from Maryland knows, because of his longstanding \nmembership on the committee, much can be said about bank regulators. I \ndo not believe anybody would indicate or suggest the record would \nindicate that there is a hostility by the regulators to the \ninstitutions they regulate. In effect, the regulators have the \nopportunity to consider the CRA issues presented among a range of other \nissues--capital adequacy, a whole host of things that may be unrelated.\n  As the Senator from Maryland knows--and I think this is something \nthat needs to be pointed out--even if the institution which has the \napplication has the lowest possible rating--substantial noncompliance, \nwhich, in effect, means they have done virtually nothing--the regulator \ncan still approve the application. They can still approve it. So there \nis no requirement under the existing law with respect to the kinds of \nmergers, acquisitions, charter changes, and branch expansions that \nrequires a financial institution to even have a satisfactory rate.\n  So this is hardly an onerous provision, I say to my friend from \nMaryland.\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from Texas interrupted the Senator to make \nthe point on this ``comments'' question, the safe harbor issue, that if \nwe previously had a satisfactory rating or better, they could not take \ninto account people's comments, unless they had substantial, verifying \ninformation, and then we are being told that a lot of cases were read \nthat indicated that ``substantial'' means a scintilla of evidence.\n  The Senator was a distinguished attorney general for the State of \nNevada for a number of years before he became the Governor. Wouldn't he \nread the phrase ``substantial, verifiable information'' as a more \nexacting standard than ``scintilla'' of evidence?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Maryland makes a good point. I think any \nfair reading, in terms of the standards of proof, is that a \n``substantial'' standard is much higher than a scintilla.\n  In effect, what this provision would do is raise the bar \nsubstantially, I say to my friend from Maryland, for community \ninvestment groups being able to, in effect, make their case for the \nconsideration--the consideration of the regulator.\n  I come back to the point. Even if they make their case that, indeed, \nthe bank has not been responsible, has not done what it ought to do \nunder CRA, the regulator may disregard that and still grant that \napproval. So it strikes me that by posing a standard before they even \nget into the ball game of ``substantial,'' you indeed cut off access to \nmuch of the input the community groups ought to have before a regulator \nmakes a decision.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is interesting. The current system I think is seen \nby most people as working fairly well. In fact, many fine financial \ninstitutions do not complain about it. They are prepared to continue to \nwork under the current system, and many of them have even said they see \nstrong positive value in it. So it seems to me this is an effort to \ninstitute an important change that would really cut off open comment.\n  You see, none of this is done, as I understand it, in the committee \nbill with respect to management or capital or any of the other issues \nthe regulators look at when they undertake to consider one of these \nmergers or affiliations. It is being applied only to CRA. I mean CRA is \nbeing singled out for the application of this kind of prescreening, as \nit were, of people's ability to come in and make their comments.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator makes a good point. That is absolutely \ncorrect. As the Senator knows, as a practical matter, although CRA is \ntriggered generically in two circumstances--one, part of a periodic \nreview; the other, when applications are made for charter changes or \nnew branches or mergers or acquisitions--as a practical matter, the \nonly opportunity community groups have is in this application process \nwhich the Senator has described.\n  That is the only opportunity. So if you foreclose them by a standard \nthat is unreasonable and difficult to meet, you have, for all intents \nand purposes, foreclosed community groups from registering any \neffective concerns that they have.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think that is an extremely important point. The \nchairman has said they have court opinions. I have not seen these cases \nthat interpret ``substantial'' to mean ``a scintilla of evidence.''\n  Mr. GRAMM. More than a scintilla.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The chairman corrects me and says ``more than a \nscintilla.'' I don't know how much more, but more than a scintilla.\n  In any event, isn't it the case that no full hearings have been held \non CRA? We come to the floor, and we get all of these assertions about \nabuses of one sort or another, sort of radical changes in a program \nthat is seen as having been the lifeblood, enabling communities to \nrenew themselves. To my knowledge, we have not had within the committee \nany sort of comprehensive hearings to examine those questions; is that \nthe Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is the understanding of the Senator from Nevada, we \nhave had no hearings at all.\n  I must tell the Senator from Maryland that the financial institutions \nin my State are supportive of CRA. If we want to take anecdotal \nevidence, I have to say financial institutions in my State have \nindicated, one, it is good public policy, and, two, they have \nfinancially benefited. But there is no record before us, based upon any \nhearings or testimony--and I must say I think that there is opportunity \nfor hearings to be held. When we are dealing with some other regulatory \nrelief issues in the Banking Committee, that might be an appropriate \ntime to bring people in so we can build a record.\n  My understanding is that we have had nothing to that effect and, \nindeed, this Senator has been on the committee now for 11 years. \nFinancial institutions in my own State are very supportive of the \nprovisions.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Isn't it also the case, I ask the Senator, that in the \nmid-1990s, when a number of banks were complaining about the regulatory \nburden associated with CRA, Secretary Rubin undertook a major effort to \naddress the question of regulatory burden and made very substantial \nchanges in the requirements, which were greeted by the various banking \nassociations at the time as being very forthcoming in dealing with this \nquestion of overregulation?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Maryland is correct. Recognizing that \nsmall banks are in a different situation than larger banks in terms of \nstaff capability, the Secretary did precisely that. In January 1996, \nthese new provisions went into effect, and they are appropriate, in my \njudgment, and they are dramatic.\n  No small bank under the size of $250 million has to report CRA. There \nis no reporting requirement for CRA that is incumbent upon a small \nbank, as defined in the provisions.\n  The responsibility of the small bank is simply to make available to \nthe bank examiner, when he or she comes in periodically or when the \nexaminer is reviewing the records for an application, the fact that the \nbank is serving the community.\n  Moreover, the standards which are required for a larger bank dealing \nwith a lending standard, a service standard and investment standard are \ninapplicable to small banks.\n\n  In trying to balance the inequities here, as I know the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland is interested in doing and all of us share in a \nvery bipartisan way, dealing with the very special concerns of small \nbanks has been addressed, we have eliminated the reporting requirement \nand have simply said, if I might respond to my friend from Maryland, \nthat when the bank examiner comes in, the only obligation on the part \nof the financial institution is to direct the bank examiner to the file \ndrawer and say, ``Those are our records.'' The bank examiner examines \nthose records, and that is the burden that is imposed.\n  I must say, in terms of the balance, as the Senator from Maryland \nknows, coming from a State which has major metropolitan areas that \nfight urban decay, as does every major community in America, CRA is one \nof the most effective redevelopment tools for the inner cities in \nAmerica that we have. It has poured hundreds of millions of dollars of \nnew investments into the inner cities. That benefits not just the inner \ncities, but that benefits all of us.\n  The tragedy that occurred in Littleton, CO, 2 weeks ago occurred in a \nsuburban area, but I think it is increasingly apparent to America, \nwhether you live in the inner city or live in the suburbs, the problems \nthat our inner cities have in America spread like a contagion. So it is \nin the best interest of every American, wherever he or she lives, that \nthose inner cities which face all the problems of urban decay, crime, \nand drugs, that what we can do to help to build those inner cities and \nstrengthen the hands of mayors, Democrats, Republicans, nonpartisan, is \nimportant public policy, and CRA has done the job. That is why the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, as the distinguished ranking member knows, has \nbeen so strongly supportive of the provisions in the Bryan amendment \nthat we offer today.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator has been very patient. Will he indulge me \nfor one further question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada is happy to do so.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator's amendment, I think, has an extremely \nimportant provision which says that if a banking institution wishes to \ngo into securities or into insurance, which would be permitted in a \ncomprehensive way for the first time by this legislation, that banking \ninstitution must\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\npass the CRA test in order to do that. It is asserted that this is a, I \nthink the language was used by my colleague, the chairman, a massive \nexpansion of CRA.\n  I take a very different view of that. It seems to me it is only \nkeeping CRA abreast of the developments that are taking place with \nrespect to financial modernization, because heretofore banks could not \nreach out and do--they did some of those activities within the bank of \na very limited nature that had been permitted either by regulation or \nby court opinion but which were highly controversial and contested, and \none of the things this bill is intended to do is to resolve those \nquestions in terms of the structure of the financial services industry. \nBoth the Senator and I are supportive of trying to do that.\n  It seems to me that if the bank is now going to be permitted to move \nout to do these other activities, it is not some massive expansion of \nCRA. That CRA requirement would be placed upon the bank before they \ncould move to do those other activities. Otherwise, it seems to me, \nover time, you will erode CRA, as institutions begin to shift their \nassets out from under the banking activity into the securities and the \ninsurance activities.\n\n  This amendment, the proposal the Senator has, does not extend CRA to \nthe securities and insurance affiliates; am I correct on that point?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Which in fact has been strongly urged by a number of \nthe community groups that are supportive of CRA. They in effect want to \nextend it out. If that were to be done, I would recognize that as an \nexpansion, and we could fight that issue, as it were. But that is not \nwhat is in this amendment.\n  This amendment puts the requirement only on the bank, if it seeks to \ngo out and do those activities. That seems to me to be perfectly \nreasonable. In fact, it seems to me failure to do that is really a \nsetback or an erosion of CRA.\n  I ask the Senator his view on that question.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I share the observation and the conclusion reached by the \ndistinguished ranking member. That is precisely the case. As the \nSenator from Maryland knows, we are dealing with a changing dynamic in \nthe financial marketplace. That really is the catalyst that brings us \ninto this financial restructuring debate.\n  The Senator may have been off the floor when I shared the observation \nthat the Treasury Secretary made, which reflects the view that the \nSenator has expounded upon. He says, in effect:\n\n       [I]f we wish to preserve the relevance of CRA at a time \n     when the relative importance of bank mergers may decline and \n     the establishment of non-bank financial [services] will \n     become increasingly important, the authority to engage in \n     newly authorized activities should be connected to. . .CRA.\n\n  He is saying that much better than I. He is saying, in effect: Look, \nthis marketplace is shifting, it is moving. From what we have seen \nhistorically, since CRA has been in effect, with the traditional \nconsolidation and mergers of one bank with another, that is not likely \nto be where the dynamic is in the marketplace in the future. We have \nalready seen it.\n  What we are going to see are consolidations and mergers with other \naspects of the financial services community--insurance and securities. \nAnd if you say that CRA has no reference or application to those \napplications, in effect you are relegating CRA to the dustbin of \nhistory; by and large, it is no longer as relevant as it is currently.\n  So, in effect, what we are trying to do is simply keep CRA as \nrelevant in the new financial world as we have in the old financial \nworld. I do not view this as an extension of CRA. It simply reflects a \nchange in the marketplace that we are likely to see with respect to the \nway the financial services are provided to Americans.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In fact, unless we do this, you could have a bank in \nsubstantial noncompliance with respect to the CRA test which would then \nbe able to reach out and exercise these additional powers?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is precisely the case.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator. I thank him very much for his \nstrong opening statement on this important amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator for his comments, which I think helped \nelucidate a number of comments which are going to be important in this \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor. I note that the Senator from Minnesota may wish to \nspeak.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to take time today to first outline my support \nfor the bill overall, and then also to talk a little bit about the \ncurrent pending business, and that is the question concerning CRA.\n  As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I rise in strong support \nof S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, and urge \nmy colleagues to take the committee's recommendation to pass this very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  The Glass-Steagall Act--which prohibits commercial banks from \naffiliating with companies predominantly engaged in the securities \nbusines--was passed at a different point in time and in a dramatically \ndifferent economy. In response to the numerous commercial bank failures \nduring the depression, the Glass-Steagall Act was enacted as part of \nPresident Roosevelt's economic recovery package. One premise leading to \nthe law which has since been proven incorrect, by the way--was that \ncommercial banks which were involved in securities underwriting failed \nat a higher rate than other banks due to losses in their securities \nbusiness when Wall Street collapsed. Subsequent studies have proven \nthat these very same banks actually fared better than other banks which \nhad not diversified by offering broad securities products. \nUnfortunately, as with most of the flawed legislation on our books, the \nlaw was not sunset and has hindered America's financial institutions--\nbanks and securities firms alike--since its enactment in the 1930s.\n  Although commercial banks in recent years have been able to conduct \nlimited securities underwriting activities through Section 20 \naffiliates, S. 900 appropriately repeals the Glass-Steagall \nprohibitions on common ownership of commercial banks and securities \nfirms and will allow these activities to be conducted without the \narbitrary restrictions which govern these activities currently.\n  The Bank Holding Company Act also includes similar restrictions in \nSection 4(c)(8) which have prevented safe, sound, and well managed \ncommercial banks from affiliating with insurance companies. Although \ninsurance is unquestionably a financial product, banks have been \nprohibited from underwriting insurance, and insurance companies have \nbeen restricted from fully entering the business of banking. This bill \nremoves the Bank Holding Company Act restrictions and it preempts State \nlaws which prohibit these affiliations.\n  Although there always seems to be broad agreement that the time for \nreform is now, every recent effort has failed because the devil has \nbeen in the details of how to regulate the new entities. S. 900 \nsuccessfully incorporates a wide array of negotiated agreements between \nthe interested industries to provide functional regulation--meaning \nregulation by product and not by the entity offering it. Under the \nbill's regulatory structure, banking products will be regulated by bank \nregulators, securities activities will be regulated by the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, and insurance will continue to be regulated by \nState insurance commissioners. This system will ensure that the experts \nin each area will oversee the activities to protect the consumer and to \nensure that all parties are playing on a level playing field.\n  As part of this system of functional regulation, the bill retains the \ncurrent system of State regulation of insurance. While I strongly \nsupport State regulation of insurance, I believe there is a role for \nsome Federal oversight. I believe that because Congress delegates the \nauthority to regulate the insurance activities of national banks, it \nalso has the responsibility to ensure that State regulation does not \nresult in bloated, burdensome, and unresponsive regulation. Also, I \nwill be holding hearings this year in the Securities Subcommittee to \nexplore where any flaws exist and will work hard to address them with \nall of the interested parties.\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\n  Another major area of functional regulation contained in S. 900 is \nthe regulation of securities activities. The bill provides a workable \ncompromise which eliminates the bank's existing broker-dealer exemption \nand substitutes a system of targeted exemptions which protect \ntraditional banking products while requiring other securities \nactivities to be offered by a broker-dealer. Also, the bill requires \nthe SEC and the Federal Reserve Board to work together to determine how \nfuture products will be regulated.\n  There has been some talk around Washington that an amendment may be \noffered to delete these bank exemptions and give the SEC complete \nauthority to determine how future products will be regulated.\n  Let me be clear that if this amendment is offered, it is done so for \nonly one reason--and that would be to kill the bill. If the bank \nexemptions are eliminated and traditional activities, such as trust \nactivities, are not statutorily protected, the entire banking industry \nwill unite against this bill. Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose any \namendments which significantly alter the bill's securities provisions.\n  When repealing current law affiliation restrictions, the question is \nalso raised about what activities the new broader bank holding \ncompanies will be able to conduct. The bill contains a standard--\nfinancial in nature--by which all activities of a bank holding company \nmust comply. This provision maintains the current separation of banking \nand commercial activities, while providing appropriate flexibility, \nagain, subject to Federal Reserve Board oversight. Some have criticized \neven the narrow flexibility which is provided in this bill. However, \nwithout this flexibility many financial companies will not be able to \ntake advantage of the new structure contained in the bill and will \ncontinue to expand their activities outside of the bank holding company \nmodel and, thus, outside the oversight that the structure would ensure. \nAlso, while on the topic of banking and commerce, I want to briefly \ntouch on the unitary thrift holding company. There are three thrift \nrelated provisions either in S. 900 or which are expected to be \nconsidered as floor amendments. First, as reported by the Committee, \nthe bill prevents the formation of any new unitary thrift holding \ncompanies after February 28, 1999. This provision will protect any \napplications which were ``in the pipeline'' at that time, on the date \nthe bill was unveiled but will prevent any new unitary charters, thus \nproviding a finite universe of unitary charters.\n  Mr. President, another provision which is included in the base text \nof the bill extends the assessment differential between banks and \nthrifts on the payment of interest on bonds that were issued by the \nFinancing Corporation as part of the savings and loan crisis. In 1996, \nCongress enacted legislation requiring thrifts to make a one-time \nassessment into the Saving Association Insurance Fund or better known \nas SAIF, to fully capitalize the then-undercapitalized fund. This \nassessment was included predominantly because it was scored as a \nrevenue gain under budget rules, and it could be used as the offset \nthat Congress needed to grant the President added spending that he was \ndemanding in return for his support of the balanced budget plan.\n  In order to lighten the blow to thrifts and to ensure that the FICO \nbond interests payments were made in a timely and also in a dependable \nmanner, Congress for the first time spread the assessment for FICO \ninterest to the commercial banks. Under that legislation, banks were to \nbe assessed at a rate one-fifth of that which thrifts are assessed \nuntil January 1, 2000, at which time all institutions would be assessed \nat the same rate.\n  The bill before us today extends for 3 years the period during which \nthere will be an assessment differential. Not surprisingly, the thrift \nindustry adamantly opposed this provision. It is expected that Senator \nJohnson will be offering an amendment, which I intend to support, which \nstrikes the FICO assessment extension and eliminates the thrifts' \nability to affiliate with nonfinancial firms.\n  Although this amendment presents an unpopular choice for thrifts, I \nbelieve that it is in the best interest of the thrifts in my State \nbecause it will positively impact their bottom line while only slightly \nimpacting their ability to affiliate.\n  I should note that if the Johnson amendment were approved outside of \nthe underlying modernization bill, it would be much more burdensome, \nbecause thrifts would then be limited to selling only to banks or to \nother thrifts. However, the bill's expansion of the ability of bank \nholding companies to affiliate with insurance companies and securities \nfirms passes through to thrifts and will now permit nonunitary thrifts \nto also sell to banks, sell to securities firms, or insurance \ncompanies.\n  Now I want to take a moment to discuss the issue which will likely be \nthe most contentious during the debate on this bill. That is the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act or CRA. During consideration of this bill, \nthe Banking Committee approved two balanced amendments designed to \nbring rationality to a law which has ventured far from what I believe \nwas its original purpose. CRA was enacted in 1977 to encourage \nfinancial institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local \ncommunities in which they were chartered. Although noble sounding, CRA \nhas drifted far afield from that original purpose. S. 900 includes a \nsmall bank exemption, approved on a bipartisan vote of the committee, \nwhich exempts banks with assets of under $100 million and which are \noutside of a metropolitan statistical area for the CRA.\n  Although I have received a number of calls of opposition from \nconstituents in urban areas in my State, which will not be affected by \nthis exemption, I do think it is important to listen to what some of \nthe bankers in rural Minnesota are also saying. I am sure this is true \nnot only in Minnesota but in rural banks across the country.\n  Although these bankers are often vilified, I believe that they play a \nvery crucial role in ensuring that affordable financial services are \nwidely available in the rural America.\n\n  Just take, for example, the comments of John Schmid of the Security \nState Bank in Sebeka, MN. John writes:\n\n       We are a small rural Minnesota bank with assets of $21 \n     million--$21 million, this is not a large money center bank--\n     and our town population is 680 souls. We could not exist if \n     we did not support and reinvest as much as we could in our \n     town and surrounding area.\n\n  Gregory Morgan of First National Bank of Montgomery, MN, also tells a \nsimilar story. He writes:\n\n       Our bank is 36 years old, founded on the idea of serving \n     the entire community of Montgomery and as such, we have been \n     successful. Our efforts of living and breathing community \n     reinvestment are not driven by having to be in compliance \n     with some law written in Washington but rather by listening \n     and serving our friends and neighbors throughout the \n     Montgomery area.\n\n  Yet another constituent committed to his hometown is Romane Dold, of \nCurrie State Bank. Romane writes:\n\n       We are a small community bank located in a town of 300 \n     people. Our assets are $17 million. Our bank has always \n     adhered to the regulations of CRA and, in fact, received an \n     ``Outstanding'' rating in our most recent exam. The problem \n     that we have with the regulations is that it just is not \n     necessary. Our bank has been in this town since 1931 and \n     quite honestly, if we hadn't been reinvesting in this \n     community for over 60 years we wouldn't be here. CRA has just \n     been another ``little burden'' that we have to contend with \n     to appease some regulator.\n\n  Finally, the message Kieth Eitreim of Jasper State Bank in Jasper, \nMN, shared also proved that CRA is a bottom-line issue, costing small \nrural communities precious dollars, a lot of money. His bank is\n\n       . . .an $18 million bank located in a town of 600 people in \n     southwestern Minnesota. CRA is a requirement that does \n     absolutely nothing to protect the people of my community \n     except to cost them money. The last exam we had lasted 3 days \n     and proved what we already knew. We service our community. If \n     we did not, we would not be in business.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am quite prepared to concede that there are a lot of \nsmall banks that do, in fact, service their community, as the Senator \nhas indicated by the quotes. We have never held extended hearings on \nthis issue, but the material from the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation says that 57 percent of small banks and thrifts have a \nloan-to-deposit ratio below 70 percent and that 17 percent of those \nhave levels less than 50 percent. Conceding that there are small banks \nwho\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\nreally pay attention to their community, it is obvious that there are \nalso small banks which are not doing that.\n  In fact, the Madison Wisconsin Capital Times, in an editorial a \ncouple of years ago, said:\n\n       Many rural banks establish a very different pattern than \n     reinvesting in their communities where local lending takes a \n     lower priority than making more assured investment like \n     Federal Government securities. Thus, such banks drain local \n     resources of the very localities that support them, making it \n     much harder for local citizens to get credit.\n\n  I do not gainsay the examples that the Senator cited. But clearly, \nthere are examples on the other side. And CRA, of course, is directed \nto get not at the good or the best actors, but the ones that are not \naddressing needs. The statistics from the regulators seem to indicate, \nand this editorial that we have--and we have other comments to the same \neffect--seems to indicate that there is a problem.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. I understand the concern, and I know those numbers have \nbeen raised in the questions.\n  I also know, if you look at the other side of the story, I have \ntalked to some of these small bankers who say they live in a town or \nwork in a town of 300 people. And if you look out in the rural parts of \nthe country today, most of the population in these small towns is \ngrowing in age. So his concern was, although we make all these loans \navailable, there are not many home mortgages being sought. There are \nnot many automobiles being bought. There are not many washers and \ndryers for which loans are being asked. There isn't the demand for the \nloan.\n  You have to expect that these bankers are going to have to put the \nmoney to some use, if there is nobody out there asking for the loan. \nThe question I have for the Senator is, how many of those loans have \nbeen asked for and then denied?\n  The story I have--and I don't have this information in front of me--\nis that he said it is awfully hard to loan money to my community when \nthere is no request for loans. What do I do, let the money sit in the \nsafe overnight? No, he has to invest it, maybe in some of these other \ngovernment or other financial institutions or financial mechanisms.\n  I think there are two sides of that story. It is not that these banks \nare turning down loans. In many cases, in these small communities in \nrural parts of the country, there is no demand for these loans. The \nbank is a good, safe place to keep it, but not always to be able to use \nthe bank's facilities.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is a reasonable point. It ought to be examined in \na set of careful hearings, because, in fact, the particular institution \nmay confront that problem, although it may be overlooking loan \npossibilities, which has frequently been the case and is certainly the \ncase in many instances in which areas people were neglected in terms of \nthe availability of credit. We have never done those kinds of hearings. \nWe have never really looked at this problem in some sort of objective, \ncomprehensive way.\n  And we hear all these kinds of ad hoc stories, as it were. But, you \nknow, there are counter-ad hoc stories. I am frank to say I don't think \nwe ought to be making the kind of significant changes in the CRA that \nare in the committee bill without having gone through the sort of \nprocess I am talking about.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, by putting a face on the businesspeople \nworking day in and day out trying to help America's rural communities \nstrive and survive, I hope we can eliminate the vilification which is \ncast upon them. We are talking about banks under $100 million. As the \ngentleman from Sebeka said: 680 people is not a major financial center, \nand we have done the best we can to meet the requirements. We would not \nbe in existence and would not be able to survive in our community if we \ndidn't reinvest and if we had turned down these loans.\n  There is a commonsense way to look at it. According to the stories we \nhave heard and the bankers we have talked to, a lot of times these are \nbanks with three or four employees. Many times they are asked to have a \nfull-time employee just to work on government regulations, which takes \na lot of money that could be used for loans, et cetera, out of the \nbank, and, as one banker said, it does absolutely nothing for his \ncommunity. That is where we have to look at some of this. This is \ncommon sense.\n  By using their words to show that they are meeting their communities' \nneeds, not because Washington tells them to do so or says they have to, \nbut, again, because it is in their best interest and it is in the best \ninterest of their community and their town, it proves the need for the \nsmall bank exemption.\n  The Committee also included a provision which has mistakenly been \ndeemed a ``safe harbor.'' Unlike a safe harbor, which gives an \ninstitution a free ride, the rebuttable presumption included in S. 900 \nsimply gives meaning to the work of the regulators during CRA exams. \nCRA's stated purpose is to require each appropriate federal banking \nregulator to use its authority when examining financial institutions to \nencourage such institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local \ncommunities. By providing a rebuttable presumption, the bill gives the \nregulator the benefit of the doubt that they are meeting the \nrequirements of CRA by encouraging action by the institution during the \nexam. However, the bill provides a safety that if someone feels that \nthe regulator has not properly assessed the institution, provided the \nindividual can prove the regulators failure, it can still protest an \naction. Thus, this amendment simply protects federal banking regulators \nagainst harassment by individuals who simply want to criticize their \nwork.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I regret to have to include a negative \ncomment in this statement about an otherwise outstanding bill. However, \nI believe that the operating subsidiary provisions included in S. 900 \nare inadequate and should be amended. As the Senator who worked on a \nbipartisan basis last year with Senator Reed of Rhode Island to draft a \ncompromise operating subsidiary amendment, I have vested a great deal \nof time studying the pluses and minuses of this option. I have come to \nthe conclusion that it is appropriate for national banks to conduct \nfull financial activities, with the exception of insurance underwriting \nand real estate development. I enthusiastically support the op sub \namendment of Senator Shelby which will be offered to this bill. It is \nidentical to the amendment I authored last year and again this year in \nCommittee. The amendment provides adequate safeguards to ensure that \nthe sub poses no greater risk to the bank than a holding company \naffiliate. Another benefit of this amendment is to provide competition \namong regulators. A recent conversation I had with a banking lawyer \nconvinced me that this amendment is prudent public policy. The attorney \nshared with me that in his dealings with the Federal Reserve Board and \nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the agencies have \nbeen cooperative in helping his client work through issues and find \ncreative ways to deal with their problems while the other has done \nnothing to help. If we were to eliminate the competition, regulators \nwould have no incentive to be responsive to the institutions they \nregulate and American banks would have no where to turn if they are \nunhappy with their treatment.\n  Mr. President, in closing I again urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation so that we can move the bill through conference \nand to the President for his signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the bill which is before the Senate, S. 900, is known \nin the shorthand form as the Financial Modernization Act. It is a 150-\npage bill which has been the subject of debate and deliberation on \nCapitol Hill for almost 10 years--a 10-year effort by the House and the \nSenate to try to modernize the laws and regulations in Washington \nrelative to banks and financial services. Of course, anyone who has \npaid any attention understands that while we have been debating, there \nhas been a revolution taking place.\n  I am reminded that just a few years ago we passed major reform in the \narea of telecommunications--years of hearings, extraordinary testimony \nfrom expert witnesses, the best staff work, the best lawyers, the best \nefforts by the\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\nMembers of the House and Senate--and we delivered the \nTelecommunications Act modernizing regulation when it came to this \nindustry.\n  Now, a few years later, we take a look at that work product. I was \namused to find someone who came to my office and reported to me that \nthey had found in that 1,000-page bill only two references to the \nInternet. Think of that. We modernized our telecommunications law and \nalmost overlooked the most amazing phenomena that is taking place in \ntelecommunications.\n  I hope we don't make the same mistake here. I hope in our effort to \nmodernize financial institutions that we are thoughtful, that we \nmodernize them in a way that is good for everyone--consumers and \nfamilies in America as well as the owners of those institutions.\n  Twenty-two years ago we took a look at banking in America. We decided \nthat we had some interest as a nation in making certain that the banks \nserved the communities where they were located. That is not a radical \nnotion, is it--to say if you have a bank in a town that is holding the \nsavings and checking accounts of individuals and families and \nbusinesses, that when that bank does business it should do business in \nthat same community where the people live, where the businesses are \nlocated, where the farmers have their farms, and where the ranchers \nhave their ranches.\n  We found that some banks were, in effect, in a parasitic capacity. \nThey were drawing out the resources of communities and regions and not \nputting the money back in. In its worse situation, you would find in \nsome of the urban areas redlining, where banks would take the money out \nof a community and refuse to write mortgages for the people who wanted \nto build homes, or to modernize their homes. They wouldn't put money \ninto the small businesses in the same communities where they were \ndrawing the money.\n  In 1977, we decided there was a need for legislation called the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. It speaks for itself--that the banks \nreinvest in the communities where they are located. It is not a radical \nconcept. In fact, I think it is a rational concept. It is one that, \nfrankly, has served us very well for 22 years. Now, as part of Senate \nbill 900, there is an effort to radically change community \nreinvestment.\n  I don't know what the experience of other Senators might be. But I \ncan tell you what my experience has been in my hometown of Springfield, \nIL. I have lived in that town for about 30 years, practiced law there, \nand raised a family. There was a time when I not only knew the name of \nevery bank downtown, but I knew the bank presidents. I might not have \nsocialized with them, but I sure knew where they were. I knew where \nthey lived, and I knew who their families were. I had a feeling that \nthose banks were going to be around for a long time. You could just \ntick them off: The First National Bank, the Illinois National Bank, The \nSpringfield Marine Bank.\n\n  But over a span of 10 or 15 years a dramatic change has taken place. \nI think a lot of Americans find themselves in the same situation that I \nam in. I struggle to remember the latest names of these latest banks. \nWhich one is the First National Bank? Which one is the Planters and \nGrowers Bank? I can't keep up with it. It seems every 6 or 12 months \nthere is a change, and not just a change in name, there is a change in \nownership. The bank that used to be run downtown in Springfield may be \nrun out of someplace in Ohio, New York, or Europe.\n  If Members ask whether or not we need this law of 1977, this \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, to make certain that as these changes are \ntaking place in the banking industry--whoever owns them, wherever their \nhome might be--that they still serve the communities where they draw \ntheir money from, I think is still a very sound concept.\n  Yet this bill, S. 900, suggests it is a concept that should be \nlargely abandoned, because in three specific areas there are changes in \nthe law.\n  First, it eliminates the requirement that all banks within a holding \ncompany have and maintain satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act \nratings as a condition for exercising new financial powers. To put it \nin common English, if you want to take your bank and holding company \nand expand it in some direction, we are going to take a look to see if \nyou have been good citizens in the communities where you are located.\n  I think that is a reasonable suggestion. That is the law. But this \nbill changes it. This bill removes that requirement and says you can't \ntake a look at their records and see if they have been helping local \nfarmers and businesspeople, families, with mortgages.\n  Does that make sense, at a time when bank ownership is becoming \nfurther and further removed from the people who bank, that we are going \nto somehow absolve them of responsibility to the neighborhoods, the \ncommunities, the towns, the counties around them? I don't think that \nmakes any sense at all.\n  The second thing, the so-called safe harbor provision. If an \ninstitution had a good conduct ribbon for 36 months under the Community \nReinvestment Act, this bill basically says leave those banks alone, \ndon't ask any more questions.\n  I don't think that makes sense either.\n  The Community Reinvestment Act examinations take place about once \nevery 18 to 24 months. In fact, for the smaller institutions, they have \nbeen streamlined more dramatically. I don't think we ought to say that \nafter some 3 years of good conduct we are no longer going to ask basic \nquestions as to whether or not you are making an investment in your \ncommunity.\n  The final provision, which the previous speaker, the Senator from \nMinnesota, addressed from his point of view, was whether or not a \nbank--rural bank in this instance--with less than $100 million in \nassets should be required to meet the requirements of the Community \nReinvestment Act. An argument can be made, and has been made by some, \nthat these are smaller institutions and, as such, should not be \nburdened by regulators and paperwork, let them do their business, they \nare good neighbors, and things will work out.\n  Yet in the report filed with this bill, we find the statistics do not \nbear out that point of view. Let me read:\n\n       Over 76 percent of rural U.S. banks and thrifts have assets \n     less than $100 million.\n\n  We are talking about more than three-fourths of the bank and thrift \ninstitutions in the smalltown areas.\n\n       It is asserted these small rural banks by their nature \n     serve the credit needs of their local neighbors. However, \n     small banks have historically received the lowest Community \n     Reinvestment Act ratings. Institutions with less than $100 \n     million in assets accounted for 92 percent of institutions \n     receiving noncompliance ratings under the CRA.\n\n  What many do is take the money from the community and then do not \nlend it back into the communities. They turn around and buy government \nsecurities instead of lending it to the businesses and families that \nneed those assets to make investments in the communities.\n  I don't think the small bank exemption is the way to go. I think the \nprovision in the CRA change relating to that overlooks the fact that \njust a few years ago we put in new regulations to streamline CRA \ninvestigations in smaller banks, banks of less than $250 million in \nassets. We exempted many small banks from reporting requirements and \neliminated a lot of documentation and paperwork. We need to continue to \nfocus on banks of all sizes to make sure they are doing the right \nthing.\n  After 22 years of the Community Reinvestment Act, what do we have to \nshow for it? Has it worked? I think, quite honestly, it has worked very \nwell. My State of Illinois is very diverse, with a large city like \nChicago and many small towns. In the Chicago area, thanks to a strong \neconomy and CRA, the number of home loans to low-income borrowers \nalmost doubled between 1990 and 1996, enabling 30,000 families to \nbecome homeowners. Is it of value to those families that those banks \nput the money back into the community? I think it obviously is.\n  I want to take a look at some of the other areas of my State. Voice \nof the People, in the Chicago Uptown area, has provided quality, \naffordable housing for low-income families. The racially and \neconomically diverse community of Uptown Chicago, on the far north side \nof town, partnered with the\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\nUptown National Bank of Chicago and completed the International Homes \nproject, a development of 28 town homes constructed on five vacant lots \nwithin a four-square-block area in Uptown. This made homeownership \npossible for 28 lower-income minority and immigrant families. Half of \nthese first-time homeowners are families earning under 50 percent of \nmedian income.\n\n  At the same time, down in my old hometown of East St. Louis is \nWinstanley/Industry Park Neighborhood Organization, a new nonprofit \ncorporation representing 8,000 people. For those not familiar with it, \nmy old hometown has had a tough time for the last 20 or 25 years. They \nstruggled to keep the community together and to survive. The \nWinstanley/Industry Park Neighborhood Organization has been a plus. It \nis a mixed-use area comprised of residential, commercial, and abandoned \nindustrial sites. What they have tried to do is to work with Magna Bank \nof Illinois to change the area. They have created a farmers market, \ncommunity owned and operated, which was developed by this organization. \nWhat makes the market particularly unique is 14 of the 16 vendors are \nlocal residents.\n  If your bank were located somewhere in Europe and you came into the \nbranch in your hometown and said, ``We have some people here who are \nstruggling to make a living; they are low income and they want a chance \nto start a farmers market,'' is it more likely that you are going to \nget a sympathetic response from someone who knows the community, has a \nresponsibility to the community, rather than someone who is just \nhammering away at the bottom line? I think the answer is obvious.\n  A residential loan counseling program of the same organization has \nlaunched a response to the victimization of over 1,400 lower-income \nfamilies who were being misled by unscrupulous realtors into home \npurchase agreements known as bond-for-deed. The realtors who engaged in \nthis often held the title to the properties throughout the length of \nthe contract without recording the transaction and without hazard \ninsurance for the purchaser. Most of these agreements contain no terms \nand have open-end type mortgage balances. This organization counseling \nprogram helped these same residents, lower-income families, refinance \nwith conventional mortgages on their own homes.\n  Finally, West Humboldt Park is a low-income, predominantly minority \nneighborhood on Chicago's west side. It is plagued by poverty, \nilliteracy, welfare dependence, street and domestic violence, alcohol \nand substance abuse, and a lack of job opportunity. In 1989, Orr High \nSchool and the 12 neighborhood elementary schools formed a partnership \nwith Bank of America--then Continental Bank--establishing a community \nnetwork of schools in West Humboldt. The partnership has grown to \ninclude over 25 programs providing education and social services. They \ninclude Boys and Girls Clubs, the creation of the BUILD project, which \nis a group of parents who are really trying to keep the streets safe \nfor their kids.\n  It amazes me that in our efforts to modernize the laws involving \nbanks and thrift institutions, one of the first casualties proposed in \nthe Republican majority bill before the Senate is to eliminate the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. A party which dedicates itself to the \npremise that local control is best is virtually ready to give it away. \nTo say that when it comes to local control of banking assets so \ncritical for building and rebuilding a community, it will no longer \nhold them responsible, I think that is shortsighted.\n  For 22 years, the Community Reinvestment Act has worked. I hope we \ndefeat this provision if we can muster a direct vote on it. If not, \ndefeat the bill if it continues to push the things which are not in the \nbest interests of consumers and families across America.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to respond to the amendment that has \nbeen offered. I apologize if anybody has the idea, listening to this \ndebate, that there is not another side to the argument. We had several \npeople who had time constraints and wanted to speak. Senator Sarbanes \nand I are being held hostage here, in managing the bill. So as a \ncourtesy to others, we have let them speak first. But I now want to \ngive a comprehensive response to this issue. Let me begin.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How long would the Senator expect to go?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think it is going to take me probably a minimum of about \n30 minutes to go through the entire group of issues.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Could we then put Senator Bayh and Senator Edwards in \nline to speak after you finish?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not know that any Republican has spoken on this \nissue. Did Senator Enzi speak?\n  To this point, if I might say, the distinguished Senator from Nevada \nspoke at length. You engaged in a lengthy colloquy with him. We then \nhad a nonrelevant speaker.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Senator Grams spoke for you.\n  Mr. GRAMM. By nonrelevant I do not mean the Senator was irrelevant on \nthe issue. It had no relevance to this issue. It was about another \nissue completely. Senator Grams really talked about the bill itself.\n  So it is my turn to speak. I intend to speak and answer the points \nthat have been raised. Then I would like to continue going side to \nside. We only have one other person here. I do not know if he is going \nto speak at any great length.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Then I guess our colleagues know in about 30 minutes \nthey could hope to get recognition to speak.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think it is important for people to step \nback and look at what is being proposed. I have to break the discussion \ndown into two parts. No. 1, what it is that Senator Sarbanes would do \nwith his amendment, and, second, what it is he would undo with his \namendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Senator Bryan.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So let me explain what he would do with his amendment, \nthen explain what he would undo, and then explain why both what he \nwould do and what he would undo is bad.\n  First of all, let me begin with current law in CRA, then what I am \ngoing to do is go through what the Senator's amendment would do. I am \nthen going to talk about the history of CRA and within that history I \nam going to try to explain the problems that we are trying to fix in \nthe underlying bill. Then I want to talk at some length about those \nproblems and about the underlying bill. I think I will have covered the \nwhole waterfront.\n  Let me remind our colleagues the current Community Reinvestment Act \nbasically has two provisions. The first provision is that bank \nregulators have to consider how a bank has been meeting local credit \nneeds only when a bank applies to open a new bank, branch or to merge. \nSecond, bank regulators may deny application based on a CRA record. So \nbasically, in terms of the existing CRA law, the way it was written, \nthere is no violation for simply failing to comply. The enforcement \nmechanism is that if you apply to open a new branch or open a bank or \nto merge, then the bank regulator--whichever one you are subject to, \nbased on your charter--looks to see if you are meeting the needs of \nyour community. And community reinvestment, I would like to remind our \ncolleagues, is focused on lending. The primary focus of community \nreinvestment is lending in the communities where you take deposits.\n  A bank regulator can deny an application based on your CRA record. \nThere is no penalty involved other than the denial of the application. \nThat is current law in CRA. What the substitute that has been offered \nby Senator Bryan would do--I have ``The Sarbanes Substitute,'' because \nSenator Sarbanes offered this in committee and we assumed he would \noffer it today, but it is the same provision--is this:\n\n  The Bryan substitute would add eight more requirements to CRA than \nthe are required under current law. In fact, this would be a good \nopportunity to ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter from Chairman Greenspan that outlines what the CRA provisions of \nthis substitute are, what the CRA provisions of the bill are, and \nexactly what they would do. Because, as I am sure all of\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\nour colleagues are aware, what tends to happen in these debates is \npeople set up straw men. In this case the straw man is that somehow the \nunderlying bill undoes CRA --that is straw man 1. Straw man 2 is that \nthe substitute virtually leaves CRA as it is.\n  The reality, as I will paint in some detail, is that the underlying \nbill tries to deal with two clear abuses in CRA: One, an integrity \nprovision; and, two, a relevancy provision. It in no way does violence \nto the basic idea of CRA. And the second reality as compared to the \nstraw man is that this substitute is the most massive expansion of CRA \nin its history and would literally impose a penalty structure that goes \nfar beyond anything ever contemplated in CRA when it was adopted in \n1977, or that has ever been discussed since. In fact, our colleague \nkeeps wondering where the hearings are concerning the two modest \nchanges that we have made in the underlying bill, without ever raising \nthe question: Where are the hearings on which these massive punitive \npenalties would be based? Where is the abuse that they seek to address? \nThe point is, the rhetoric of Senator Sarbanes applies more to his \nsubstitute than it does the underlying bill.\n  So let me ask unanimous consent that the letter from Alan Greenspan \nwith regard to the CRA provisions of the substitute and the CRA \nprovisions of the underlying bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Board of Governors of the\n\n\n                                       Federal Reserve System,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: You have asked for an analysis of how \n     the financial modernization bills recently passed by the \n     House Committee on Banking and Financial Services (H.R. 10) \n     and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs affect the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA). \n     Enclosed is a memorandum from the Board's General Counsel \n     discussing the impact of these bills on the CRA.\n       That memo indicates that H.R. 10 would affect the CRA in \n     three principal ways. It would require at least a \n     ``satisfactory'' CRA performance rating as a precondition for \n     engaging in the new financial activities, provide for the \n     enforcement of this requirement, including through penalties \n     and divestiture, and apply the CRA to uninsured wholesale \n     financial institutions. Currently, the CRA does not require \n     that an institution's CRA record be considered in connection \n     with proposals to engage in nonbanking activities, authorize \n     enforcement of the Act outside the applications process, or \n     apply to uninsured depository institutions.\n       The bill recently passed by the Senate Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs does not contain similar \n     provisions. The Senate bill, however, does contain two CRA-\n     related provisions not contained in H.R. 10: an exemption \n     from the CRA for small insured depository institutions that \n     are located outside metropolitan areas and a rebuttable \n     presumption regarding an institution's compliance with the \n     CRA.\n       I hope this information is helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan Greenspan,\n                                                         Chairman.\n       Enclosure.\n\nMemorandum Regarding the Effect of Recent Legislative Proposals on the \n                       Community Reinvestment Act\n\n       Chairman Phil Gramm has asked for an analysis of how H.R. \n     10, as passed by the House Committee on Banking and Financial \n     Services last month, and the bill passed by the Senate \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on March 4, \n     1999, would affect the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 \n     (``CRA'').\n       H.R. 10 would primarily impact the CRA in the following \n     three ways.\n       1. The CRA currently applies only to federally insured \n     depository institutions. H.R. 10 would subject the newly \n     established uninsured wholesale financial institutions to the \n     CRA.\n       2. The CRA currently requires that the Federal banking \n     agencies consider the CRA performance of an insured \n     depository institution in connection with proposals by the \n     institution, or the institution's holding company, to acquire \n     or establish a deposit-taking facility (e.g., open a branch \n     or acquire or merge with another insured depository \n     institution). It does not require that an institution's CRA \n     record of performance be considered in connection with \n     proposals to engage in, or acquire a company engaged in, \n     nonbanking activities. H.R. 10 would allow a financial \n     holding company to engage in new financial activities only if \n     all of the company's subsidiary depository institutions have \n     and maintain at least a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating. Thus, \n     H.R. 10 would link CRA performance to the ability of a \n     banking organization to engage in, or acquire a company \n     engaged in, a nonbanking activity. More than 95 percent of \n     the depository institutions examined for CRA compliance in \n     1997 received a ``satisfactory'' or better CRA rating.\n       3. Current law does not authorize a Federal banking agency \n     to take any type of enforcement action against an insured \n     depository institution that has a less than satisfactory CRA \n     rating, other than denying proposals by the institution (or \n     the institution's holding company) to establish or acquire a \n     deposit-taking facility. Thus, current law does not permit \n     the Federal banking agencies to take actions, including \n     enforcement actions or divestiture proceedings, outside the \n     applications process if an institution fails to maintain a \n     ``satisfactory'' CRA rating on an ongoing basis. See \n     Memorandum from Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General, \n     U.S. Department of Justice, to Eugene A. Ludwig, Comptroller \n     of the Currency, 18 U.S. Op. Office of Legal Counsel No. \n     39 (Dec. 15, 1994).\n       H.R. 10 would require that the subsidiary depository \n     institutions of a financial holding company maintain at least \n     a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating for the holding company to \n     continue to engage in the new financial activities. If a \n     subsidiary depository institution fails to maintain such a \n     rating, the financial holding company and subsidiary \n     depository institution must execute an agreement with the \n     appropriate Federal banking agencies to correct the \n     deficiency and such agencies could impose limitations on the \n     activities of the financial holding company or subsidiary \n     depository institution until the subsidiary's rating is \n     restored. The failure by a financial holding company or \n     subsidiary depository institution to comply with these \n     requirements would constitute a violation of the Bank Holding \n     Company Act. In such circumstances, the appropriate Federal \n     banking agency could take enforcement action (e.g., issue a \n     cease and desist order, assess civil monetary penalties or, \n     in the case of the Board, seek criminal sanctions) against \n     the financial holding company, the subsidiary depository \n     institution, or an individual participating in the violation \n     (such as an officer or director of the holding company or \n     depository institution). Finally, if the subsidiary \n     depository institution's CRA rating is not restored to at \n     least the ``satisfactory'' level by its next examination (or \n     such longer period as the Board determines to be \n     appropriate), H.R. 10 would authorize the Board to require \n     that the financial holding company divest the subsidiary \n     depository institution or, alternatively, cease engaging in \n     new financial activities.\n       Section 121 of H.R. 10 also would permit a national bank to \n     control an operating subsidiary engaged in financial \n     activities permissible for a financial holding company, but \n     only if the national bank and its depository institution \n     affiliates have and maintain at least a ``satisfactory'' CRA \n     rating.\\1\\ National banks and affiliated depository \n     institutions that did not maintain such a rating could be \n     subject to the same type of corrective measures as discussed \n     above for financial holding companies.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Part 5 of the OCC's regulations, which purports to allow \n     subsidiaries of national banks to engage in activities that \n     national banks are not permitted to conduct directly, \n     currently requires that a national bank have and maintain at \n     least a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating to control an operating \n     subsidiary engaged in principal activities that the bank \n     cannot conduct directly. See 12 C.F.R. \n     Sec. Sec. 5.34(f)(3)(iii), 5.3(g)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The bill passed by the Senate Banking Committee does not \n     contain provisions similar to those discussed above. The \n     Senate bill, however, would exempt from the CRA any insured \n     depository institution that has $100 million or less in total \n     assets and that is located outside a Metropolitan Statistical \n     Area. Data indicate that approximately 3,871 insured banks \n     and thrifts, representing approximately 37 percent of all \n     insured banks and thrifts and 2.7 percent of the assets of \n     all such institutions, would meet these criteria, as of \n     December 31, 1998. In addition, under the Senate bill, an \n     insured depository institution would be presumed to be in \n     compliance with the CRA until its next examination if the \n     institution received at least a ``satisfactory'' rating at \n     its most recent CRA performance examination and at each CRA \n     examination in the preceding three years. This presumption \n     would not attach if the appropriate Federal banking agency \n     receives substantial verifiable information, arising since \n     the date of the institution's most recent CRA examination, \n     that demonstrates the institution is not in compliance with \n     the CRA.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield? I understood the Greenspan \nletter compared the provisions in the House bill with the committee \nbill, not the provisions of the substitute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. They are virtually identical, but I stand corrected. In \nfact, let me yield to you to tell us the difference.\n  Mr. SARBANES. They are not identical. There are some significant \ndifferences between the two, and I will develop them after the Senator \nfinishes his presentation.\n  But as I understand it, your request to the Fed and their response \nwas to compare the House bill with the committee bill. Am I correct in \nthat?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think that is correct. I stand corrected. I would like \nit printed in the Record, but I would be happy\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\nto hear the distinguished Democratic ranking member of the committee \nexplain to us the differences. I assert that there are no significant \ndifferences, but I would like to hear them.\n  Let me go over basically what we have in terms of additions to CRA in \nthe pending amendment, if the Senate decided to adopt it.\n  No. 1, by making noncompliance with CRA or falling out of compliance \nwith CRA a violation of banking law, officers and directors of banks \nfor the first time could be fined up to $1 million a day for CRA \nnoncompliance. I will come back to this in a moment.\n  Under this substitute, banks can be fined up to $1 million a day for \nfalling out of compliance.\n  Under this substitute, cease and desist authority for CRA \nnoncompliance are brought into the system.\n  Bank regulators may place any restrictions on any banking activities \nfor CRA noncompliance.\n  Bank regulators may place any restrictions on any insurance \nactivities for CRA noncompliance.\n  Bank regulators may place any restrictions on any securities \nactivities for CRA noncompliance.\n  Bank regulators may place any restrictions on any other activities of \nthe holding company for CRA noncompliance.\n  Any violation by any one bank in the holding company can trigger \npenalties against any and all activities of the entire banking company.\n  Insurance sales of bank subsidiaries can be restricted for CRA \nnoncompliance.\n  Finally, the provision adds new expansions of CRA far beyond the \nexisting law. Under current law, banks sell insurance--small banks in \ncities of less than 5,000, other banks depending on their State \nregulation--and they do it without CRA approval.\n  The substitute would expand the decision of banks or ability of banks \nto sell insurance to require CRA approval. Some 20 banks now provide \nsome security services. They do it without being required to get CRA \napproval. The pending substitute would expand CRA approval to that \nactivity.\n  The first point I want to make is, contrary to the rhetoric being \nused, we are talking about the largest, most significant expansion of \nCRA in history--none of which is based on any assertion of any abuse--\nand we are talking about imposing confiscatory penalties that are \ndevastating to our banking industry.\n  I want to read pieces of two letters on this issue of the potential \nfor a million-dollar-a-day fine. One letter is from the Independent \nCommunity Bankers of America. This is a letter from an organization of \nvery, very small, generally community banks, often in rural areas that \nwould be affected by this. Let me read the paragraph:\n\n       We also have grave concerns about expanding CRA enforcement \n     authority to include the levying of heavy fines and penalties \n     against banks or their officers and directors. An ongoing \n     challenge for many community banks in small communities is \n     finding willing and qualified bank directors. Legislation \n     following the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s \n     greatly increased the amount of civil money penalties to \n     which bank officers and directors may be subject. Any \n     increase in the potential for fines and penalties could \n     provide further disincentive for service on a bank board.\n\n  Here is the point. If a small bank is going to hire somebody to be \npresident or be an officer or recruit somebody to be on a bank board, \nthey are going to have to buy liability insurance to protect that \nperson from this potential fine, which would literally put thousands of \nrural banks in America out of compliance.\n  If there is a problem here that needs to be fixed, if there is an \nabuse that should be dealt with, then one might say that perhaps this \nis justified. But here is the record: There have been some 16,380 \nexaminations of small, rural banks in America since 1990, and of those \n16,380 examinations, three banks and S have been found to be out of \ncompliance to a substantial degree.\n  Our ranking member of the committee would bring in the potential for \na million-dollar-a-day fine based on the fact that in 16,380 audits on \nCRA since 1990--9 years--there have been three banks substantially out \nof compliance. What is the justification for these massive punitive \nfines? There is no justification.\n  The justification basically is that this is seen as an opportunity to \nmassively expand CRA. That is what the justification is.\n  The second letter, on exactly the same subject, is from the American \nBankers Association. Here is what they say:\n\n       We would oppose amendments we understand may be offered \n     that would contain provisions not only eliminating the two \n     CRA provisions currently in the bill, but also adding \n     additional new CRA requirements. One strong concern the ABA \n     has is that the potential for such penalties could \n     discourage directors from serving on community bank boards \n     and increase the cost of officer and director liability \n     insurance coverage for banks. There has been no \n     justification given for inserting these new penalties into \n     CRA, particularly given the outstanding record the banking \n     industry has in serving communities across the country.\n\n  I remind my colleagues, this substitute seeks to impose these massive \npunitive penalties against small banks in America when in 16,380 exams, \nwhich cost those banks cumulatively $1,310,400,000 to keep the records \nand comply with the exam--$1,310,400,000; I have the decimal points \nright this time--after all that money, after all those exams, three \nsmall, rural banks or S were found substantially out of compliance.\n  If this is not regulatory overkill that drives working men and women \nin America crazy and that threatens little banks all over the State of \nKansas, the State of the Presiding Officer, and all over Indiana and \nall over Texas and all over America, that threatens their very \nexistence, I don't know what it is.\n  First of all, this is totally unjustified, makes absolutely no sense \nand, to quote my colleague from Maryland, never has a hearing been held \non this subject. Never has any justification been given whatsoever for \nimposing a million-dollar fine on bank board members and bank officers \nin the name of CRA. It is the most gross overkill and regulatory burden \nthat this Senator has seen in the entire time that I have been debating \nbanking legislation.\n  I remind my colleagues that I spent 12 years of my life teaching \nmoney and banking in college. I have spent too long of my life, 21 \nyears, in the House and Senate, and I have been serving on the Banking \nCommittee every day I have been in the Senate, and I have had the \nprivilege this year of serving as chairman. I have never seen such a \nmassive regulatory overkill as these proposed provisions, and I am \nconfident that they will be rejected.\n  (Mr. SANTORUM assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the chairman yield on this point?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am looking at a table from the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, from 1990 through 1998, that those 320 \ninstitutions were given a ``needs to improve'' rating which, of course, \nis below compliance, and 18 institutions were given ``substantial \nnoncompliance.''\n  The Senator is using this ``three'' figure, and I don't know where \nthat comes from.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I can tell you where it comes from. It comes from looking \nat the banks and S that meet two tests: One, they have less than \n$100 million of assets; and, two, they operate solely outside standard \nmetropolitan areas.\n  And my figure is, that those banks have been subjected, since 1990, \nto 16,380 examinations. And in those 16,380 examinations, the average \nof which has cost that little bank about $80,000, according to some 488 \nbanks which have written us on this subject, that these 16,380 \nexaminations--this is from the Federal Financial Institutions \nExamination Council--that in these 16,380 examinations, costing, on \naverage, $80,000 apiece--so this is $1.3 billion that has been taken \nout of these little bitty communities and out of their banks, where \npeople are paid higher interest rates and have gotten less credit--the \nresult of that has been that three of these banks, over a 9-year \nperiod, have been found to be in substantial noncompliance.\n  You do not have to have a Ph.D. in mathematics to figure out, if you \nhave done 16,380 exams on these small, rural banks, and only three of \nthem have been in substantial noncompliance, you\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\nare spending a tremendous amount of their money to find a very, very \nsmall number of bad actors--in fact, three one-hundredths of 1 percent.\n  What is even more astounding is that all of these little banks \ncombined make up only 2.8 percent of the capital of the banking system. \nThey are getting 44 percent of the examinations. They make up only 2.7 \npercent of the assets of the banking system, and out of 16,380 exams, \nonly three of them were out of compliance.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator----\n  Mr. GRAMM. What is wrong here? What does not make sense here?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, he simply stated the point \nall over again, but it hasn't squared the factual discrepancy.\n  According to our data from bank regulatory agencies, more than 70 \nsmall, rural banks and thrifts are currently deemed not in compliance; \nthat is, below a satisfactory rating with CRA this year alone.\n  Since 1990, 338 small, rural banks and thrifts received CRA ratings \nbelow satisfactory.\n  Sure, the Senator can make the same speech about those numbers, but I \njust want to get those on the Record, because those numbers are very \nsignificantly different from the numbers which the Senator is putting \nforward.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I might reclaim my time--and I think probably we would \nbe better off to let me go through and make my presentation and let the \nSenator do the same--let me go back and restate the facts.\n  What the Senator has done is basically taken a totally different \nclassification than I am talking about. I have been very clear in what \nI am saying. Here is what I am saying. And it is devastating, there is \nno question about that. I am glad I am not on the other side of this \nargument. I would be trying to change the subject, if I were. But here \nare the devastating facts.\n  The devastating facts are, that of the little banks in America--less \nthan $100 million in deposits; probably have 6 to 10 employees--that \nare outside standard metropolitan areas--so these are banks that do not \nhave a city to serve, much less an inner city.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Those are the banks we are talking about. Those are the \nfigures I am giving you.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Look, let me go ahead. I will explain the difference in \nwhat you are saying and what I am saying. OK. So let me start at the \ntop. I will go all the way down, make my point, and then I want to go \non and give my presentation. You all have had many opportunities to \ngive yours today. And I listened to them faithfully.\n  But here is the point, if you take every bank in America that has \nless than $100 million of deposits, and that is also outside a standard \nmetropolitan area, they make up 38 percent of the financial \ninstitutions in the country. They have 44 percent of the audits. In \nfact, they were audited for CRA 16,380 times from 1990 through 1998.\n\n  In those 16,380 audits, that cost, on average--cost the bank; I am \nnot talking about the Government regulator; but cost the bank to comply \nwith gathering all the information, spending the week in the audit, \nkeeping all the records, designating a CRA officer--and I will later in \nmy presentation read actual letters from the banks--these little banks \nand these little communities spent $1.3 billion of their money \ncomplying with this law.\n  Of these 16,380 examinations, only three banks, over a period of 9 \nyears, only three banks were found to be substantially out of \ncompliance.\n  Our colleague has taken a different definition, ``marginally out of \ncompliance,'' and the number was bigger, maybe 70 out of 16,380. The \npoint being, my statement is true, that only three banks, out of all of \nthese that are audited, have turned out to be substantially out of \ncompliance.\n  On the basis of that, our colleague would impose a $1 million-a-day \nfine on officers and board members. And I stand by my point that that \nis the biggest overkill I have seen.\n  I think I have dealt with the proposals made which would be added by \nthe amendment that is pending.\n  These proposals really boil down to punitive, crushing, regulatory \nburden and fines, imposing a $1 million-a-day fine on bank officers and \nbank board members, massively expanding CRA.\n  The justification in 1977 for CRA was, ``Well, you've got deposit \ninsurance. That's a good subsidy. We ought to be able to force these \ninstitutions to allocate capital for a public purpose.'' But for the \nfirst time, this substitute would expand CRA to a noninsured \ninstitution where there is no logic for its expansion. For the first \ntime, CRA approval would be necessary for selling insurance and selling \nsecurities within a bank or at an affiliate of a bank holding company.\n  These are massive expansions of regulatory burden. They are totally \nunjustified based on any facts, no matter how you read them. I cannot \nbelieve that a majority of the Senators would vote to do those things.\n  Let me talk about what we undo if we adopt the Senator's amendment. \nAnd I want to take some time to go through this. I have not done this \nat great length.\n  I want people to understand what is the problem with CRA that we are \ntrying to deal with in these two very modest amendments which the \nBanking Committee has written.\n  First of all, let me talk about what you can view as good news. In \n1977, there was a rider to a bill that was written by Senator Proxmire \nthat created what we today call CRA. It said that banks should lend in \nthe communities where they collect deposits. There was no enforcement \nmechanism. It was simply to be used when evaluating approval for bank \nmergers and branches.\n  A Democrat Senator raised an objection to the provision, worrying \nabout redtape and paperwork. Interestingly enough, the distinguished \nchairman at that time said, ``No problem. The redtape and paperwork \nwill be nominal. No big deal.'' We have all heard it millions of times \nwhen thousands of programs have become law. There was a vote in the \nBanking Committee to strip out this provision. And that vote failed on \na 7-7 tie.\n  We then had the bill come to the floor of the Senate. There was \nanother vote. And I do not have the total here, but I think it was 41-\n30. We had some huge number of Members of the Senate who were absent. \nSo the bill became law.\n  So here is the point I want to make. In 1977, we started out with a \nCRA requirement. And in that year--and these figures are all from the \nNational Community Reinvestment Coalition--in that year there were \nabout $50 million of CRA loans or cash payments or commitments to lend. \nAnd that number was relatively small, until 1992.\n  Now, what happened in 1992? Well, two things happened. One, we \nstarted having a rash of mergers, so that these very large banks and \nalso some small banks had to get CRA approval to merge. What happened \nis this number started to grow very rapidly. Last year, in loans, \ncommitments to lend, cash payments, the total was $694 billion.\n  Now, to put that in perspective, the loans, commitments to lend, and \ncash payments, and commitments to pay cash--and I am going to talk \nabout cash payments at some great length here in a moment--totaled $694 \nbillion last year. That is bigger than the Canadian economy. That is \nbigger than the combined assets of Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler. \nThat is bigger than the discretionary budget of the Federal Government. \nYet our colleagues, who will oppose these two very simple amendments, \nsay there is no need to look at a potential reform in CRA.\n  CRA is now bigger than General Motors. It has grown from virtually \nnothing to become larger than the discretionary budget of the Federal \nGovernment, and yet our Democrat colleagues refuse to admit the \npossibility--or many of them do--that we might need some degree of \neffort to deal with abuses which would naturally occur in a program \nthat grew in a very short time from $50 million to $694 billion.\n  Why do I think this is a relevant point? Well, let me give you one \nfact. According to the community groups, $9 billion has been paid or \ncommitted in cash. Had you gone to that committee hearing in 1977 and \nsaid to the then chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Proxmire, \n``Well, what about cash payments, what about people literally giving \ncommunity groups and individuals money not to testify against their \nmerger or not to oppose it or actually paying them to support it,'' \nwhat he would think about that? I can tell you: he would have said, \n``It is not possible.''\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\n  This bill in no way contemplates that cash payments would be made, \nbut the fact remains that as this program has exploded, $9 billion of \ncash payments and cash commitments have been made. This basically \nrepresents an abuse that needs to be dealt with. In fact, in the one \nhearing we had on this subject, the spokesman for these reinvestment \ncoalitions admitted there were abuses. He called it ``green mail,'' and \nhe said that it hurt the program. Most people would call it blackmail. \nThe point is, if these abuses exist--and no one disputes they do--why \nshouldn't we begin to try to do something about them?\n  Now, let me turn to a quote, and then I will get into some of these \nabuses.\n  This is a quote from a Cornell University law professor, Jonathan \nMacey, who specializes in banking law and is one of the most respected \nlawyers in banking law in the country. Here is what he said about CRA, \nas it exists in 1999:\n\n       You see really weird things when you look at the Code of \n     Federal Regulations . . . like Federal regulators are \n     encouraged to leave the room and allowing community groups to \n     negotiate ex parte with bankers in a community reinvestment \n     context . . . Giving jobs to the top five officials of these \n     communities or shake-down groups is generally high up on the \n     list (of demands).\n       So what we really have is a bit of old world Sicily brought \n     into the United States, but legitimized and given the patina \n     of government support.\n\n  It has never been stated more clearly than that.\n  Now, let me give you an example, if you would give me those \nagreements.\n  Part of our problem--and this will be discussed later, and I hope \npeople will listen to this point--part of our problem is that community \ngroups, in negotiating with banks, in virtually every case negotiate \nfor and insist on the confidentiality of these agreements. So one of \nthe problems in evaluating this $9 billion is, we do not have any of \nthe facts as to where this money goes, who it goes to, and what they do \nwith it when they get it.\n  One of the amendments that Senator Bennett or someone else will be \noffering later in the Senate's consideration of financial services \nmodernization is a sunshine amendment, which says that in the future \nthese agreements have to be made public, that they have to go to the \nregulator, that the regulator has to require that the information be \nprovided, and that they be made public. The logic of that is, nothing \ndisinfects like sunshine.\n  Now, it so happens that we have three of these agreements that we \nhave obtained on the condition that we not disclose the names of the \nbank or community group involved. We have redacted those names. I just \nwant to give you a flavor of what these agreements looks like, and I \nhave pieces of three of them here.\n  This is Bank A: Provide blank--and this is a community group--with a \ngrant of up to $20,000. Provide blank--another community group--with a \ngrant of up to $50,000. Provide blank with a grant of up to $25,000 to \npay reasonable and necessary ``soft costs'' to be incurred by blank. \nProvide blank with a grant of a reasonable amount. . . .\n  That is the quid; now the quo:\n  Blank agrees to withdraw on the date hereof the comment letter, dated \nblank 28, 19 blank, and any related materials collectively, the comment \nletter filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the \nFederal Reserve Bank, and the board. I don't have the second sheet.\n  The point is, the community groups gets all of these cash grants and \nthen agrees to withdraw the complaints they have filed, a classic quid \npro quo.\n  Now, what happened to these complaints? Were they not meritorious or \ndid the community groups suddenly no longer care about the people they \nwere protesting against? What did all of those cash grants do that \ninduced them to withdraw their comment?\n  Bank A, one more thing, blank and blank agree--this is the community \ngroup and the bank--agree not to disseminate or otherwise make \navailable to the public copies of this agreement.\n  So the community group gets these cash payments and in return agrees \nto withdraw their protests, and then the bank and group agree that they \nwill keep the agreement secret.\n  Now, let's look at Bank B: Blank will receive a fee of 2 and three-\nquarters percent of the face amount of each program loan made by blank. \nThis is an agreement whereby a community activist and their community \ngroup receive a rake-off of 2.75 percent of the face value of every \nloan made under this agreement.\n  Do you think people receiving that loan know that this individual and \nthis group will get 2.75 percent? In fact, they don't. And, as you will \nsee later, unless we open up this process, they never will. No one will \never know what is happening. Continuing with the Bank B's agreement:\n  Blank will receive a fee of $200,000 as reimbursement; according to \nblank, $100,000 is payable upon execution and delivery and $100,000 six \nmonths later.\n  We have the quid, now the quo.\n  The community group or the individual agrees to withdraw all pending \nprotests of blank regulatory applications and related materials and not \nto sponsor, either directly or indirectly, the protest or to supply \ninformation in connection with any protest relating to pending or \nfuture blank applications with regulators.\n  In other words, the community group is agreeing that in return for \nthis 2.75 percent of the face value of all loans that are made, not \nonly will they withdraw the complaint they have already filed, but they \nwill never make another one. They will never make another one, no \nmatter what.\n  At blank's request--listen to this one. Many of you wonder why you \nhave gotten letters from banks, and I got a letter from a big North \nCarolina bank, might I say, and I was shocked. Then I read the letter \nand it, in essence, said that they are required by a CRA agreement to \nsend me this letter saying they support CRA. I said, how is it possible \nthat somebody could be required to send me a letter? And this is a \ndifferent bank altogether and a different agreement. Here is how it \nhappens:\n  In addition, the bank agrees to send letters to customers of blank \npreviously contacted by blank--well, I will get to the point on the \nnext sheet. And then the community group agrees to purge their files \nand database of all information related to this bank's customers. In \nother words, they get this breakoff; they get these cash payments. They \nagree to withdraw their objection. They will never do another \nobjection. They are even going to destroy the computer database they \nused to do it.\n  Now I think we are getting to the thing I mentioned. The community \ngroup agrees to: immediately cease and desist all activities directed \nagainst blank; to maintain the confidentiality of this agreement, to \nmaintain the confidentiality of this agreement and any other \nagreements; to cooperate with them in getting agreements with other \nbanks. And then is the thing about sending letters. This is called \n``public policy partnership.''\n  In this public policy partnership: blank will work with the blank to \nestablish a clear written declaratory statement indicating support for \nthe Community Reinvestment Act and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, \nand the party's opposition to any attempts to weaken the law. Blank \nwill send the final copy of this statement to the blank, the American \nBankers Association, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency, the blank Congressional delegation, and \nall Members of the House and Senate banking committees.\n  So when you have letters from banks telling you what great things CRA \nis doing, many of those were dictated by commitments they made as part \nof contracts, secret agreements they signed with protesters in order to \nget them out of the way to do their work.\n  Now, I could go into a hundred other examples--someone who graduates \nfrom college, goes to graduate school, and goes to work for the Federal \nReserve in acquisitions and mergers, quits and goes into business, \nspends 4 years harassing a bank and bank presidents, and finally the \nbank craters and gives them $1.4 million, gives them $200,000 to set up \ntheir organization; they now have 20 offices, lending $3.5 billion, \ngetting 2.75 percent of every penny they lend right off the top, that \nnobody knows about, forcing people to participate in their program and \npay $50 a month for 5 years in order to get the loan, and the bank \nactually collects the money for them as if somehow it were part of the \nloan. I could go\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\non and on. But we are not here to debate dramatic reforms in CRA. We \nare only trying to do two things, and here they are; here is the \nconcern. You have heard the number.\n  Only in 1 percent of the cases is a protest filed. Well, remember \nthat in 90-some-odd percent of the cases, where somebody wants to open \nor close a branch, regulators generally get no comments. Where the \nprotests come are in the big mergers, and in some of the smaller ones \nthat get contentious. But what happens more often than not is that \nrather than filing a protest, the protest group simply goes to the bank \nand says: I am going to file a protest and I am going to say--to quote \none of the protesters in what they said about a bank in New England--I \nam going to say, A, you are a racist; and, B, you are a loan shark. \nThat is my charge. I am going to make that charge, and you can either \nreach an agreement with me, or I am going to do that.\n\n  Now, here is the problem, and I don't think it is that hard to \nvisualize. You have a bank and it has agreed to merge with another \nbank. And people don't know whether the merger is going to be approved \nor whether it is good or bad for the bank. So during that period, the \nstocks of these two banks are just fluttering. The bank literally has \nhundreds of millions--and sometimes billions with these big bank \nmergers--at risk. So it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see that \nwhen a protester shows up and says, ``Look, I am going to go to the \nComptroller of the Currency and tell him you are a racist and that you \nare a loan shark; I am going to file a complaint and I am going to hold \nup this merger,'' the bank is under immense pressure to act as quickly \nas possible. What is happening in America today is that banks that are \nrisking hundreds of millions, or billions, of dollars are settling \nthese threats with secret agreements that the public knows nothing \nabout, and they are often paying thousands, or hundreds of thousands, \nof dollars in cash payments.\n  Now, who ever said CRA had anything to do with cash? Yet, according \nto the CRA groups, $9 billion of cash payments have been made under \nCRA. I would like to ban cash payments, quite frankly. I don't think \nthey are what CRA is about. I don't think some protester getting a \nrake-off of interest or getting a cash payment is what community \nlending is about. I think it is wrong, but I don't have the votes to do \nit and I didn't try to do it.\n  So, here are the two modest changes in our bill. Number 1, consider a \nbank that has been consistently in compliance with CRA. In fact, in its \nlast 3 evaluations it has consistently been in compliance and is in \ncompliance now. What do we require that Senator Sarbanes and others so \nstrenuously object to? We require that if a bank has historically been \nin compliance, if it has been evaluated for meeting its community \nlending requirements by its Federal regulator three times in a row and \nwas found to be in compliance, and if it is currently in compliance, \nthen somebody can still protest. They can call the bank all the nasty \nnames they want to call them. In fact, the regulator is required to \nhold a hearing if they provide any complaint just saying ``I oppose \nit.'' There is a hearing.\n  None of that has changed. Anybody can say whatever they want to say. \nAll our amendment says, however, is that before you can stop the action \nfrom going forward in the normal timeframe, the objector has to present \nsubstantial evidence. In other words, a bank that is historically in \ncompliance, and is in compliance now, is deemed to still be innocent \nuntil proven guilty. And a protester can protest all they want to. But \nthe regulator can't stop or delay the process unless some substantial \nevidence is presented.\n  Now, I know we have some distinguished attorneys here, and I am not \ngoing to get into any kind of legal debate with distinguished \nattorneys. Number 1, I object to duels between armed and unarmed men, \nespecially when I am the unarmed man. Every once in a while, I have \nmercy on other types of issues where I am armed and others are not. I \ndon't shoot down unarmed men.\n  But I want to remind those who aren't legal experts that \n``substantial evidence'' is not a trivial phrase. It was chosen because \nit is not trivial. It is referred to 900 times in the United States \nCode. There have been over 400 instances in case law where the term \n``substantial evidence'' has been defined. Let me give you some \ndefinitions that came from the Supreme Court, and they are important \nbecause they give examples of the evidence that is required to be \nsubmitted by a protester in order to stop a bank from doing something \nthat they are qualified to do based on their record.\n  In other words, what do you have to have in order to say, ``This \nperson is not meeting the requirement of law and I want him stopped''? \nKnowing that it may cost them hundreds of millions of dollars, even \nbillions of dollars, what is the standard you have to meet? What does \n``substantial evidence'' mean?\n  Here is what it means. Here are four definitions from Supreme Court \nrulings. ``Substantial evidence'' is understood to mean:\n  No. 1, ``more than a mere scintilla.'' More than a mere scintilla.\n  No. 2, ``such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a claim.''\n  Not that they have to accept it. Notice that the Court said that \nsubstantial evidence is ``such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept.'' They might not accept it. But they might accept it as \nadequate to support a claim.\n  No. 3, ``real, material, not seeming imaginary.''\n  And, finally, ``considerable in amount, value and worth.''\n  I fail to understand why there is an objection when a protester wants \nto come into a bank which has been in compliance with the lending laws \nof this country for three evaluations in a row and is currently in \ncompliance, why anyone would object to saying that in order to stop the \nbank from exercising the right they have earned, the protester has to \nprovide some evidence. I cannot understand why anybody would object to \nthat. Why is it important?\n  I have spent a lot of time talking about why it is reasonable. But \nwhy is it important?\n  It is important because it eliminates the worst abuses where someone \ncomes in, they have no evidence, they have no facts, there is no abuse. \nThey simply say, ``I will go away if you can give me some money.'' In \nthis case, if they can't provide substantial evidence, they can't stop \nthe process. But it doesn't prevent the regulator from saying, ``You \nhave to do a new CRA review.''\n  Our colleague talked about what regulators could do. Nothing in our \namendment would prevent the regulator from saying, ``Every time you \nwant to merge, we have to have a new CRA evaluation.'' We don't stop \nthat. All we are trying to do is to require some substance--and require \nsomeone to have the evidence--before they can stop the application \nprocess and cost taxpayers and investors hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  It is a strange thing to say in America. But I am going to say it, \nbecause I believe it. I will never forget when the American Airline \npilots were getting ready to go on strike. I met with some Members of \nCongress to talk about what Congress could do because of the disruption \nthat might be caused by the strike. I finally said, ``Look. You know, \nit is no secret that most unions do not love me, but I believe in \nfreedom. And people have a right to strike, if they want to strike. And \nI am not voting for a bill that prevents them from striking.'' One \nMember of Congress, who will go unnamed, said, ``Well, wait a minute. \nThese pilots make $150,000 a year. I am not worried about their \nrights.''\n  Let me tell you why that is relevant. One of the reasons this is so \nhard to discuss is that everybody has the idea that these bankers are \nrich. So we are not worried about their rights.\n  When do our rights end based on how much money we have? I can \nunderstand and I accept that you ought not have more rights because you \nhave more money, but you ought not have less.\n  The idea that we would let someone or some group impose hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of costs on other citizens, many of whom are \nstockholders--my teacher retirement fund, I am sure, is invested in \nsome financial institution, or in a thrift. I don't know, because I \ndon't keep up with what they are invested in. But every teacher in \nAmerica is invested in stocks of some of these companies.\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\n  How is it right to let somebody literally deprive them of millions of \ndollars without providing any evidence?\n  So that is the substance of the first committee provision. I don't \nknow why it requires so much discussion, but it does. I don't mind \ndiscussing it, though, because it is something that I feel strongly \nabout.\n  This is about abuse. This is about a wrong that is going on in \nAmerica today, right now. The fact that there are many success stories \nin CRA, the fact that there are probably wonderful people in almost \nevery circumstance, does not justify looking the other way at the kind \nof abuses that are occurring. We are not trying to fix them here.\n  We are going to have a lot of hearings this summer. We are going to \nbring a lot of people in and put them under oath. We are going to have \na major GAO study. We are going to look at this thing in great detail.\n  We are just trying to deal with two little commonsense things that \nought to be done in the bill. I talked about the first. What is the \nsecond?\n  The second committee provision exempts little banks in rural areas \nfrom CRA. Why? Because the regulatory burden on these very small banks \nin very rural areas is oppressive.\n  First of all, these are banks that are not in standard metropolitan \nareas. They are by and large serving areas that do not have a city, \nmuch less an inner city to serve. So making them comply with these laws \nthat are really aimed at inner-city lending makes absolutely no sense.\n  Why is this provision important? Because these banks--as documented \nin the letters they have written to us--are spending $60,000 to $80,000 \na year complying with CRA.\n  I have used the figure before, but it fits here, and I want to use it \nagain. Since 1990, there have been 16,380 CRA examinations of these \nlittle banks in rural areas, and only three of them have been found to \nbe substantially noncompliant. But even though three bad actors have \nbeen found, $1.3 billion in compliance costs has been imposed on these \nlittle banks that have only between 6 and 10 employees. It is a very \nheavy regulatory burden.\n  Let me read just a couple of letters from the banks that are \naffected. Our colleague from Illinois was here. I am sorry he left. We \nprobably have more letters from Illinois than any other State. But he \nwon't get to hear it. But I am going read three of his letters, and \nthen the others.\n  This is a letter from Franklin Bank in Franklin, IL. I don't know how \nbig the bank is, but it is small. Their building looks like a house. \nHere is what he says:\n\n       Were it not for the time-consuming paperwork involved, we \n     in small banks in rural America would find CRA laughable. Our \n     community is our business. We wrote this book long before the \n     government did. Offering us exemption from the requirements \n     of the Community Reinvestment Act would not change the way we \n     do business, but it would relieve us of the mounting \n     paperwork from this examination for one day every other year.\n\n  In other words, relief by exempting them--they don't change their \nbusiness. They are just not going to have the examination to do and the \npaperwork and cost of about $80,000 involved in it.\n  This is from Security Bank of Hamilton, IL:\n\n       Our experience is that regulators struggle to fill out \n     their questionnaires when we are being examined as most \n     sections do not apply. Then we really have to stretch to \n     imagine our community of 3,000 having the same problem as \n     Chicago or Los Angeles as none of the demographic \n     stratifications fit.\n\n  This is the First National Bank of Nokomis, IL. It doesn't say how \nbig they are:\n\n       I truly believe we could free up one-half to one employee \n     in our banking operation to put in positive service thereby \n     expanding our service to the community we serve.\n\n  That is what they believe they could do if we could reduce the \nregulatory burden on them.\n  They don't say in their letter, but my guess is they don't have even \n10 employees. So when they are talking about freeing up one half of one \nemployee, they are talking about a tremendous reduction in their cost \nand their regulatory burden.\n  Let me read a couple of other letters. This is from the Cattle \nNational Bank in Seward, NE:\n\n       Since the origination of public disclosure of CRA \n     examinations, we have not had one person from our community \n     ever request the information.\n\n  I remind Members that CRA went into effect in 1977 and public \ndisclosure went into effect about a decade after that.\n  So for about 12 years nobody in this little community has ever raised \na CRA question. The only people who have raised those questions are \nbank consultants.\n  The next bank is Copiah Bank from Crystal Springs, MS:\n\n       Our compliance officer, Gerry Broome, and his assistant \n     have spent many research hours and reams of paper in their \n     efforts to comply with mandated requirement's paper work. We \n     have even had to outsource some of its checkpoints to a \n     compliance consultant from time to time.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       As an $83 million community bank, we feel an obligation to \n     help you in your efforts toward easing our paper work burden.\n\n  Lakeside State Bank, New Town, ND:\n\n       As a former bank examiner for the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, which included consumer compliance experience, \n     and as a banker for over 15 years I believe I have a good \n     understanding of the intent and the workings of the CRA.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Over the 47 years of our existence we have provided \n     financing to virtually every main street business in our \n     town, our customer base includes approximately 80 percent of \n     the area farmers and for the last several years over 50 \n     percent of our loans have been to American Indians.\n       The law [he means the CRA law] is a heavy burden because of \n     the expansiveness of the regulations and the paper \n     requirements of compliance. We spend hours documenting what \n     we have already done, rather than spending that time more \n     efficiently by doing more for our community.\n\n  The Farmers and Merchant Bank of Arnett, OK:\n\n       I am the CEO as well as the chief loan officer, compliance \n     officer and CRA officer. I have to wear so many hats because \n     we are small and have a staff of only 7 including myself. CRA \n     compliance, done correctly, takes a lot of time, which takes \n     me away from my primary responsibility of loaning money to my \n     community. It has almost gotten to the point that lending is \n     a secondary function. It seems like we have the choice of \n     lending to our community or writing up CRA plans showing how \n     we would loan to the community if we had time to make loans.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Large banks can hire full time CRA officers and other \n     compliance personnel to administer CRA programs but, small \n     banks cannot. . . .\n\n  Redlands Centennial Bank:\n\n       We spent approximately $80 thousand of our shareholders' \n     money last year supporting this ill-defined regulation. Even \n     the regulators who examined us were hard pressed to give us \n     specific definition on how we might better implement this \n     regulation.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I am urging you to get rid of the nonsensical CRA yoke. \n     Keep up the fight because there are a lot of us out here who \n     are too busy balancing, making a living with government \n     regulation in this crazy business.\n\n  Chemical Bank North is a bank of $74 million in Grayling, MI:\n\n       As it is, we must devote disproportionate resources to \n     creating and maintaining the ``paper trail'' that the current \n     CRA regulations require. Our board members must attend time \n     consuming CRA Committee meetings and our officers and staff \n     members spend significant valuable time preparing reports and \n     keeping records that serve no purpose other than to keep us \n     in compliance with a regulation that attempts to enforce from \n     a regulatory standpoint what we do everyday in the normal \n     course of our business. . . . I would estimate that we devote \n     the equivalent of a full time employee to all aspects of CRA \n     compliance.\n\n  The First National Bank of Wamego, KS--I mispronounced Wamego \nyesterday; the Presiding Officer was from Kansas and I appreciate him \ncorrecting me. This is a $65 million bank, which means this bank \nprobably has five or six employees.\n\n       Our bank was listed two years in a row as the ``best'' bank \n     in Kansas to obtain loans for small businesses. . . . [This \n     bank also was rated outstanding on CRA.]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       [O]ur outstanding grade did not make us a better bank. The \n     CRA did not make us make loans we wouldn't have made. The CRA \n     did take a lot of employees' time to document that we were an \n     outstanding bank.\n\n  This is from Nebraska National in Kearney, NE. This is a very small \nbank. In fact, I think this might be one of the smallest banks in \nAmerica that was not a recent start. This bank has $34 million in \nassets, so we are talking about probably four or five employees working \nin this bank:\n\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\n\n       We do not make foreign loans, we don't speculate in \n     derivatives, and we don't siphon deposits from this area to \n     fund loans elsewhere. Instead, like virtually all the banks \n     under $250 million in assets we provide home loans, business \n     loans, farm loans, and construction loans. We don't do this \n     because of the Community Reinvestment Act but because it \n     makes good business sense. . . . I bitterly resent every \n     minute of my time and that of my staff spent to comply with \n     this regulation because it takes time away from productive \n     duties.\n       I feel the regulation is now being used by consumer \n     activist groups to ``shakedown'' banks seeking regulatory \n     approval for expansion or merger.\n\n  Finally, from American State Bank, an independent bank, from \nPortland, OR:\n\n       As one of the oldest and most strongly capitalized African \n     American-owned banks west of the Mississippi River, Portland-\n     based American State Bank supports your position on CRA \n     exemption for non-metropolitan banks.\n       We also urge you to explore exempting from CRA requirements \n     minority-owned commercial banks. . . . Today, minority-owned \n     banks still maintain their focus on serving our nation's \n     minority communities and their citizens. It is redundant, at \n     best, to impose CRA requirements on banks whose sole purpose \n     is to serve minority citizens. At worst, it compels minority \n     banks to sustain burdensome expenses and administrative costs \n     and subjects banks to a bureaucracy largely unaware of the \n     realities of the inner-city marketplace.\n\n  I have covered a lot of territory. Let me sum up with the following \npoints. The Bryan amendment before us has two parts. It does a whole \nbunch of bad things, and it undoes two little good things. What are the \nwhole bunch of bad things it does? It is the largest expansion in the \nregulatory burden of CRA in American history; it would expand CRA to \nnoninsured institutions, violating the very logic of CRA, which is, \nbanks get deposit insurance that is partly subsidized by the \nGovernment, so it is reasonable for the Government to force them to do \nthings that have a community benefit.\n  The proposed substitute would expand CRA to institutions that are not \ninsured. It would expand CRA approval as being necessary to sell \ninsurance and securities in a bank, something that is not required \ntoday and it is occurring every day today without CRA approval.\n  The proposed amendment would impose a potential fine of $1-million-a-\nday on bank officers and bank board members without any evidence \nwhatsoever that abuses occur. In fact, as I pointed out over and over \nagain, with small banks in rural areas having 16,380 examinations at a \ncost of about $80,000 in annual compliance, where the banks had to pay \n$1.3 billion to comply with all this regulation, all this paperwork--\nall of these evaluations, 16,380 of them, found only three banks that \nwere substantially out of compliance. So, the regulatory overkill \nalready exists. Why you would want to come in and subject small banks \nand large banks, and their officers and board members, to a million-\ndollar-a-day for if their institution fell out of compliance with CRA, \nI cannot understand. In fact, I have never heard an explanation for \nthis draconian change in law.\n  I read earlier, and I will not read again, letters from the American \nBankers Association and the Independent Bankers Association saying how \nthe pending amendment will make it virtually impossible for them to get \nquality people who will serve on bank boards. They also talk about the \ncost of liability insurance, which will explode if you are going to \nimpose these new potential penalties on banks, their officers and \ndirectors, all in the name of abuses that apparently exist at the \nextreme level in .03 percent of all CRA examinations.\n  Those are all the bad things the substitute does. What are the good \nthings that it undoes? Is that a word, ``undoes''? I guess so. To try \nto curb some of the abuses--and the abuses are very similar to the \nstrike lawsuit that we dealt with 2 years ago, and again last year.\n  The abuse basically occurs during the critical moment when a bank is \ntrying to merge with another bank or sell or engage in some new \nactivity: it's at that moment the bank has a lot at stake and is most \nvulnerable. Under current law, any protester can come in and threaten \nto hold the whole thing up. This creates immense pressure on the bank \nto settle with that protester and either commit some bank action or pay \nthe protester cash in return for not filing a protest.\n  A lot of rhetoric has been used on this, and I am being redundant \nbecause when other people say something wrong, you have to say it right \ntwice to get people to get it straight. Our amendment does not prevent \npeople from protesting. They can protest. Our amendment does not \nprevent people from filing complaints. They can file complaints whether \nthey have any facts or whether not. Our amendment does not prevent the \nregulator from holding a hearing. Under current law, the regulator has \nto hold a hearing if somebody complains. We do not change that. Our \namendment does not prevent the regulator from forcing an entirely new \nCRA evaluation.\n  All our amendment says is: If you have a bank that has been in \ncompliance with CRA over a 3-year period, and if they are currently in \ncompliance, a protester can still file a protest, but in order to stop \nthe bank's application from going forward, the protester has to provide \nsubstantial evidence.\n  Then I went through and read from Supreme Court cases, how you define \n``substantial evidence''--more than a scintilla; enough that a \nreasonable person might believe that what you are saying is true. Those \nare not high standards.\n  Why anybody would want to let protesters potentially impose hundreds \nof thousands of dollars or millions of dollars in losses on a bank and \ntheir stockholders, many of whom are members of teacher retirement \nprograms and other broad investment groups, without providing any \nevidence whatsoever to back up their claim, I don't know. But that is \nthe debate we are having.\n  So, that is what the amendment does and does not do. It is not a safe \nharbor. It is not a safe harbor. It is not a safe harbor. The Secretary \nof the Treasury came up with the use of that term and now all critics \nuse it, even though it is verifiably false. This is a rebuttable \npresumption. Stated another way, if a bank has a good record of \ncompliance and it is deemed by the regulator to be in compliance, it is \ninnocent until proven guilty. You have to present some facts to \nsubstantiate your claim if you are going to stop it from going forward. \nYou don't have to have any facts to state your opinion. You don't have \nto have any facts to declare that there ought to be a hearing. You \ndon't have to have any facts to protest. But before the regulator can \nstop it, you have to present some facts.\n\n  The final provision that would be undone here is the eminently \nreasonable exemption of very, very small, very, very rural banks that \non average have a regulatory burden of about $80,000 a year in \ncomplying with CRA, even though in the last 9 years, with 16,380 \nexaminations of these small, rural banks, only three have been deemed \nto be substantially out of compliance with CRA.\n  If you were from a small town like I am, or you represented a State \nthat had a lot of little bitty towns and a few little bitty banks left \nand you went to those banks, you would discover why only .03 percent \nhave been found out of compliance in 9 years. If you are from a small \ntown and you have a bank with four or five employees, your bank ends up \nlending to everybody in town because they have nobody else to lend to. \nThat is basically what the debate is about.\n  I wish every person could, in some simple form, get all these facts. \nBut it takes time to debate them, and I am grateful to have the \nopportunity. I am sure we will get some more opportunity today. But I \nthank my colleagues for their patience, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Bryan \namendment, which contains, in my opinion, a balanced approach to the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act as well as a bipartisan spirit enjoyed in \nthe last session of Congress.\n  I also want to say, to my colleague from the State of Texas, how much \nI respect his expertise in this area as well as his dedication to this \ncause. But I must also respectfully disagree and say to all those who \nare concerned about this issue that if there are problems with this \namendment, in terms of\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\nthe fines that can be imposed or other details, let's correct them. If, \nin the past, overly zealous advocates have used CRA as an excuse for \nextortion, then let's prosecute them. If there are other problems, \nlet's correct them.\n  Let's throw out the bathwater, not the baby. At the dawn of the 21st \ncentury, let us not turn back the clock and deny to thousands of \nAmericans, because of the color of their skin, because of their race, \nbecause of their income, the right to access one of the basic tools for \nempowerment and progress, and that is credit and the ability to start a \nbusiness or build a home. We cannot return to those days.\n  I should also say I am somewhat disappointed that we have arrived at \nthis impasse, because this is important legislation. It is my great \nhope we will ultimately get it enacted, because it is important to the \nfinancial services industry, insurance, banking, as well as other \nindustries that need access to credit and to consumers across our \ncountry. This should not be a partisan debate. In fact, in the very \nrecent past, it has been nonpartisan or even bipartisan. Unfortunately, \nit has become an issue that has broken down more and more along party \nlines.\n\n  I especially regret this has happened in large part because of \nefforts to curtail and restrict the Community Reinvestment Act, which \nthe vast majority of evidence has suggested works well, has served the \nAmerican people well in the past, and I believe is critical to equal \nopportunity for all Americans as we advance to a new century and a new \nmillennium.\n  We are increasingly relying upon the use of market forces to create \nopportunity. We are asking the American people to be self-sufficient, \nto save, to work hard, to be personally responsible, and I support \nthose trends. At the same time, we need to ensure that the market \nsystem works for all Americans and that every American, regardless of \nwhether that person happens to come from the right side of the tracks \nor the wrong side of the tracks, be he or she Hispanic, African \nAmerican, Native American or any other race, creed or religion in this \nsociety, that they have access to those tools in the marketplace that \nwill allow them to be self-sufficient, to build a better way of life \nfor themselves and their families.\n  It is important that we pass this law, as I mentioned. It is one of \nthe areas in which we are internationally competitive. It is important \nthat we pass legislation that will allow our financial services \nindustry to provide comprehensive services to their customers and to \ncompete with our foreign competitors.\n  It is important that consumers be allowed to have access to these \nservices on a coordinated basis, on a one-stop shopping basis. It is \nbetter for consumers as well. It means jobs for your State and my State \nand the rest of the 48 States across the United States of America, not \njust in insurance, which is important to the State of Indiana, or \ninvestment banking or in securities or on the part of insurance company \nemployees, agents, and brokers across this country. It means jobs for \nsmall businesses and industries in the State of Indiana and elsewhere \nthat need access to low-cost credit, so that they can invest, be more \ncompetitive, more productive and create good-paying jobs across our \ncountry. This is an issue not just for Wall Street, but for Main Street \nand for all of our streets across this country.\n  Unfortunately, there has been increasing partisanship. I think that \nis very, very important. Just last year this measure passed out of the \nSenate Banking Committee on a 16-to-2 vote. This year, unfortunately, \nit broke down exactly along party lines, 11 to 9.\n  Earlier this year, this provision, very similar to the amendment I am \nsupporting today, passed out of the House of Representatives Banking \nCommittee 52 to 8, with the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats \nsupporting a continuation of a vital CRA and equal financial \nopportunity for all Americans.\n  The administration strongly supports this point of view. It is \nimportant to note that there is virtually no significant opposition \nfrom industry groups. I find it to be somewhat ironic that in the past, \nmembers of my own party have been accused of favoring legislation that \nwould unduly hamstring business for ideological reasons. Today, the \nshoe seems to be on the other foot.\n  Let me be very clear what this dispute that has brought us to this \nimpasse is not about. It is not about the organization under which \nfuture banking, insurance and security services will be offered. This \nis not really a dispute about operating subsidiaries versus the \naffiliates and holding companies, although there is a very serious \ndispute between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve on this issue. I am convinced that this can be resolved \nif we are given a chance.\n\n  Our dispute in this impasse is really not about the unitary thrift \nand whether commercial entities should be allowed to get involved in \nthe financial services sector. That is a legitimate issue and a concern \nthat I am convinced that, too, can be resolved if we can only deal with \nthe issue currently before us. No, Mr. President, the dispute that has \nbrought us to this point involves the Community Reinvestment Act.\n  I say to my colleagues and those listening and watching us at home \nthat the Community Reinvestment Act has been good for America and good \nfor Americans. It is working. Between 1993 and 1997--4 years--loans in \nlow- and middle-income areas across our country for mortgages and \nbuilding homes increased 45 percent, 45 percent in just 4 years; up 72 \npercent for African Americans; up 45 percent for Hispanic Americans; up \n30 percent for Native Americans.\n  In the same period of time, actually just last year alone, there were \n525,000 loans to small business men and women in low- and moderate-\nincome areas, with total capital investments of $34 billion.\n  The Community Reinvestment Act has proven to be a boom for the \nAmerican dream: families wishing to invest in home ownership, \nentrepreneurs wishing to start small businesses, Americans of every \nrace, creed and religion wanting to participate in the American dream \nof a better way of life for themselves and for their loved ones.\n  The Community Reinvestment Act has worked in my own home State of \nIndiana. I won't go through all the cases here. From Gary, East \nChicago, Indianapolis, South Bend, Lafayette, Bloomington, from the \nnorth to the south, from the east to the west, in communities large and \nsmall across my State, more Hoosiers have opportunities to make \ninvestments, make a decent income through a good job, buy a home, or \nstart a small business. It has been good for our country. It has been \ngood for my State.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter with me today that I think my \ncolleagues will find to be of some interest. It was sent to me 2 days \nago. It happens to be from the mayor of the city of Fort Wayne. The \nreason this may be of interest is that Fort Wayne is the second largest \ncity in the State of Indiana. More than that, Paul Helmke, the mayor of \nFort Wayne, happened to be my opponent in the race for the Senate last \nyear.\n  Paul Helmke is a card-carrying member of the Republican Party. He \nalso believes in opportunities for the citizens of Fort Wayne, business \ninvestment expansion, and home ownership. The mayor of Fort Wayne, my \nopponent in the election last year, has written me asking me to support \na vigorous and vital Community Reinvestment Act.\n  I read from his correspondence:\n\n       . . . In Fort Wayne, banks have fulfilled their CRA \n     requirements in creative and meaningful ways that have \n     allowed us to leverage their resources with public and other \n     private influences to help in our urban revitalization \n     efforts.\n       . . . Perhaps the banking community would continue to see \n     their investment in urban renewal as beneficial without the \n     CRA requirements. But I do not think that it is wise to tempt \n     fate.\n\n  Mr. President, neither do I. Involved mayors, like Mayor Helmke, who \nwas the head of the mayors association last year, and I believe \nconcerned Senators should rise to vote in favor of a vital and \ncontinually vigorous Community Reinvestment Act. On April 22 of this \nyear, the Los Angeles Times wrote:\n\n       Before Congress voted to establish the CRA in 1977, many \n     banks wrote off entire areas, refusing to lend to anyone who \n     lived behind the red line.\n\n  The unfortunate truth is that while the vast majority of bankers \nacross our country are involved and caring and doing a good job, both \nbefore and afterwards, too often there were bankers\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\nwho were willing to accept deposits from some parts of our communities \nand not make loans to those very same parts of our communities. That is \nwhat CRA has established. It is a very strong track record of change.\n  Unfortunately, the bill, as unamended, before us poses a serious \nthreat to the continuation of this progress we have seen across this \ncountry and in my State. My understanding is it would make 97 percent \nof all banks presumptively exempt from the requirements of CRA, 38 \npercent entirely exempt from the provisions of CRA, and would exclude \nthe whole new areas banks hope to get into, entirely exempt, new users \nentirely exempt from the provisions of CRA. Mr. President, now is not \nthe time to turn back the clock.\n  I will summarize before yielding the floor. Access to credit today is \nas important an opportunity for Americans of every walk of life as \nrural electrification was in the 1930s. Access to credit today is as \nimportant to the future well-being of all of our citizens as universal \nservice to telephones was in the fifties and the sixties.\n  That is why I believe very strongly, as we ask Americans to be more \nresponsible, to take charge of their own lives, as we encourage them to \nstart homes and build businesses and to build for the future, we must \ngive them the tools within the market economy to get the job done. That \nmeans equal access to credit as we approach the new millennium, not \njust to the few, not just to the powerful, but to Americans of every \nrace, ethnicity, and those of even modest means. That, Mr. President, \nis why I rise in support of the Bryan amendment and urge my colleagues \nto vote in the affirmative for it.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Would the Senator from Indiana yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAYH. I would be glad to yield to my colleague from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you.\n  I am wondering, Senator Bayh, if you have had the same experience I \nhave had. That is, I come from a State with many banks, including some \nof the largest banks in America, Bank of America being one. And having \nhad many conversations with representatives of banks that are \nheadquartered in my State, what I hear from them is, in fact, they \nenjoy participating in the Community Reinvestment Act. They take great \npride in the work they do in the communities where they are located. \nThey have absolutely no opposition to the Community Reinvestment Act \nand, in fact, do not oppose the Community Reinvestment Act provisions \nof the Democratic substitute offered by Senator Sarbanes.\n  I am just curious whether the banks in your State of Indiana have had \nthe same kind of reaction.\n  Mr. BAYH. I say to the Senator, I appreciate your question. As a \nmatter of fact, one of the things that has been most impressive about \nthis issue has been the uniformity of opinion among our banks in my \nState, large and small. They find that CRA has not been a significant \nimpediment to their doing business, and really the industry groups are \nnot in opposition at all. As a matter of fact, they support the intent \nbehind this very, very important provision.\n  So we have a situation here where many of our community groups, \nincluding our mayors--as a matter of fact, I should mention for the \nRecord I spoke to the mayor or Gary last night, as well, who believes \nvery strongly that a city like Gary, which has been struggling to get \nback on its feet, needs this provision.\n  The banks are not opposed and, in fact, find it to be a very positive \nelement.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is exactly the response I have had. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. President, I seek recognition at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator from North Carolina yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to say to my colleague from Indiana, before he \nleaves the floor, that was an excellent set of remarks. I think it \npoints out the importance of this issue. I was particularly taken by \nthe comments of your mayor of--which city was that, I ask?\n  Mr. BAYH. Fort Wayne.\n  Mr. DODD. Fort Wayne. This was your former opponent, I think, that my \ncolleague pointed out. And I just say to my colleague, again, I have \nhad a similar reaction from my mayors across my State. I know others \nhave.\n  We have a tendency to think of these issues in terms of just what the \nbanking community wants. And that is an important consideration for us, \nas we certainly deal with financial institutions. But I think--and I \nwould ask my colleague from Indiana whether or not he would agree with \nthis--that, in addition to the banking community, we bear a special \nresponsibility, as Members of the Senate, to also consider what occurs \nto the customers' financial services.\n\n  I think sometimes that constituency is given a back seat when it \ncomes to considering the implications of decisions we make. It is the \nfarmer in Wyoming; it is the small businessperson in Connecticut; it is \nthe consumer in Indiana; it is the minority business in North \nCarolina--all of us have consumers out here who use these financial \ninstitutions.\n  I commend my colleague from Indiana for a very thoughtful set of \nremarks, pointing out that side of the equation, the consumer side, the \nuser side, the business side of our financial services, and I commend \nhim again for his remarks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before the Senator yields, I wonder if I could pose a \nquestion for 20 seconds.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Of course.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I also want to thank my colleague for his \nremarks. I wonder if he was aware of the comments made --and this gets \nto the Senator from North Carolina--by the President of Bank of America \nabout this program. If not, I would like to put them in the Record. If \nhe answered that question----\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from North Carolina \nhas the floor. The question was being directed to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina does have the \nfloor and may only yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to direct this to the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes, absolutely. I am aware, I say to Senator Boxer, of \nthe comment by Hugh McColl, who is head of Bank of America. I think I \ncan quote him exactly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like you to do that right now in the Record, \nbecause it is a very telling comment.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I think it is, too. He says, ``My company supports the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act both in spirit and in fact. We have gone way \nbeyond its requirements. We have had fun doing it. And we have made a \nbusiness out of it.''\n  Now, here is the head of the largest, or one of the largest, banks in \nthe country, headquartered in my home State. I happen to know that Mr. \nMcColl has, in fact, strongly supported the Community Reinvestment Act. \nHis bank has gone above and beyond the call of duty in that respect.\n  Mrs. BOXER. One more question before I yield to my friend.\n  I find it very interesting that Senators would get up and attack this \nprogram as if it were some kind of a giveaway program. These bank \npresidents have told us that these loans are very profitable. As a \nmatter of fact, I wonder if the Senator is aware, at least in \nCalifornia--and now we do have a tie in because, as you know, Mr. \nMcColl, although headquartered in your fair State, does a lot of \nbusiness in my fair State--they have told us that they are doing very \nwell with their CRA ratings. As a matter of fact, they are telling us--\nand I want to know if the Senator was aware of this--that their \nportfolio of CRA loans--these are loans that never used to be made in \nthe old days--are just as profitable, that portfolio, as their other \nloans. Is my friend aware of that?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes, I say to Senator Boxer, I am aware of that, and \nthat is what I have been told consistently by the banks located in \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend, and also my friend from Indiana, \nbecause I think the notion that somehow, if you are for CRA, you are \nfor doing something with social value and yet interfering with business \nis simply not true.\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\n These loans are profitable loans. They are good for the community. It \ngoes back to the old adage: ``If you do good, you do good things, you \nwill do well.''\n\n  I hope we will stand together in favor of this program that does good \nthings for people and does well for the banks.\n  I yield back to my friend.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, I say to Senator Boxer.\n  I will add to what she just said: When you do good things and have \nthe impact that the Community Reinvestment Act has had, it does not \njust inure to the benefit of the people who are directly affected, it \ninures to the benefit of all of us.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I want to address that in just a moment. I want to say, \nfirst, in relation to the remarks of my friend, the Senator from \nIndiana, who has become a very close friend and colleague of mine \nduring our tenure--we came to the Senate together--that I am proud of \nwhat he had to say. I completely agree with everything he had to say, \nand his remarks particularly about turning back the clock on this very, \nvery important piece of legislation ring true with me and I think ring \ntrue with most Americans.\n  Mr. President, if I may, there is a really critical thing I want \nAmericans, who are listening to this debate, to understand. This is not \nsome obscure piece of banking legislation that has nothing to do with \ntheir lives.\n  It is really important for Americans to understand that this bill--I \nrefer now to Senator Gramm's bill--that this bill will have, or has the \npotential to have, a dramatic effect on the lives of every American, \nnot just the poor, not just minorities, not just the elderly, not just \nthose who run a small business or want to get into the family farming \nbusiness, and not just those people who are directly impacted by the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act.\n  This bill has the potential to affect every single one of us, every \nsingle American. And here is why. Because it weakens the Community \nReinvestment Act. Because of CRA, we provide low-income housing, we \nprovide single-family housing, we give families a place to live, we \ngive small businessmen and women, minority and otherwise, a chance to \nengage in entrepreneurship, to open their own business. We give the \npeople the opportunity, in my home State of North Carolina, to start a \nsmall farm, and expand that farm.\n  Every time we provide these kinds of economic opportunities to \npeople, every time we give families, core families, a chance to live \ntogether, to stay together, and not be spread out, we do a number of \nthings: No. 1, we reduce crime; No. 2, we create pride, an \nextraordinary amount of self-esteem that may not have existed before; \nand we give people an opportunity to do something they otherwise might \nnot be able to do--own their own home or open their own business.\n  I speak to every American when I say, crime, core family values, the \nfact that the folks who benefit directly from the Community \nReinvestment Act are folks that we may otherwise, as a Government, have \nto support, these are things that affect every American. This bill is \nnot some obscure banking bill that has nothing to do with people's \nlives. The Community Reivestment Act has a dramatic effect and has had \na dramatic effect on every single American. I think it is critically \nimportant for people to understand that.\n\n  I think it is also important for them to understand what exactly \nSenator Gramm's bill does to the existence of the Community \nReinvestment Act. I have heard the bill described by him and others as \nbeing ``Community Reinvestment Act neutral,'' as to the overall \npurposes of this legislation.\n  I might add parenthetically that I strongly support the idea that \nbanks ought to be able to expand services and affiliate with other \nfinancial institutions. They ought to be able to sell insurance. They \nought to be able to sell securities. It is good for banks. We have a \nlot of banks in my State that need to do this and want to do it and, I \nthink, ought to be able to do it. It is also good for consumers because \nit creates competition, and it is a good thing for consumers to have \naccess to these services when they go to their banks. I strongly \nsupport those opportunities.\n  Here is the problem. Under existing law, when a bank seeks to expand, \neither by merger or by opening a branch, then its CRA rating is one of \nthe things that is taken into consideration. Under the provision that \nis proposed by Senator Gramm, when a bank seeks to expand services by \naffiliating with a company that sells insurance, by affiliating with a \ncompany that sells securities, CRA, or the Community Reinvestment Act, \nplays no role whatsoever.\n  Let me say this in the simplest terms. A bank with a completely \nunsatisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating that has been \ndetermined by regulators to not be complying with the law, to not be \ndoing what it should be doing with respect to investing in its \ncommunity, I am talking about a totally noncompliant bank, that factor \ncannot even be taken into consideration in determining whether that \nbank should be allowed to sell insurance and whether it should be \nallowed to sell securities.\n  This bill, Senator Gramm's bill, is not CRA neutral for one simple \nreason. We are, by virtue of this law, expanding what banks can do, \nallowing them to sell insurance, allowing them to sell securities. If \nwe don't take CRA, which presently applies to applications for \nbranching and mergers, and apply it as a precondition for these new \nservices they are going to engage in, then we have withdrawn from CRA. \nWe will have cut the underpinnings from CRA. It is something we \nshouldn't do--it is fundamental--we shouldn't do. CRA compliance ought \nto be a consideration when banks seek to engage in the expanded \nservices permitted under this bill in exactly the same way, in exactly \nthe same fashion that it presently applies to their attempts to merge \nwith other banks or to their attempts to open other branches.\n  Now, I want to show a couple of examples with the indulgence of my \ncolleagues.\n  I want to show a couple examples of what the Community Reinvestment \nAct has done in North Carolina. I show now a photograph of a \nneighborhood, an economically disadvantaged neighborhood, a minority \nneighborhood in Durham, NC. This is a house that existed in that \nneighborhood.\n  As a result of the Community Reinvestment Act, and as a result of a \nbank partnering with local community groups, this house that we have \njust taken a look at was turned into this house.\n  If I could hold up the first photo just a minute, this was a crime-\nridden, drug-infested community. As a result of the Community \nReinvestment Act, we went from this to this--a place that the people \nwho occupy this home are proud of; a low-income family was able to \nreside there. They take pride in their community. And as Reverend \nBrooks, who was part of this effort, said:\n\n       Before, there were drug dealers sitting on this corner. \n     Now, we have homeowners hoping to be in these houses.\n\n  The Community Reinvestment Act. It changes communities. It changes \nfamilies. It changes people's lives. It also changes the financial \nobligations that the rest of us, as Americans, have to support \nopportunities for people who want to support themselves. They just need \na chance. What the Community Reinvestment Act does is, it gives those \nfolks a chance.\n\n  I want to show one last photo. We have seen one house. This is a \nneighborhood. This is located in Durham, NC. This is a neighborhood \nthat, again, has gone from a high-crime, drug-dealers-on-the-street-\ncorner neighborhood to a model community. Can you imagine the \ndifference between the way a family feels when they live in a community \nwhere right outside their doorstep people are selling drugs and all the \nhouses are in terrible shape versus how they feel when they find \nthemselves in a community that looks like this? Now they take pride in \ntheir community. The children growing up in this community take pride \nin where they live. It gives them a sense of self-esteem. It allows \nthem an opportunity to have pride in themselves and their family that \nthey otherwise might not have.\n  Now, there are some simple facts that I will speak to briefly that \nhave emerged from the progress of the Community Reinvestment Act during \nthe time it has been in place. If I could have the appropriate chart, \nplease.\n  First of all, just since 1993, the private sector lending in low- and \nmoderate-income areas, which is what we have been concerned with, has \nrisen.\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\n From 1993, I guess this is the number of loans, 185,014 to 268,463 in \n1997. Over a period of 4 years, there is an increase of 45 percent, \nalmost a 50-percent increase in just 4 years, as a result of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act.\n  The argument is made that--and we have heard a lot of it from Senator \nGramm over the course of the last 45 minutes to an hour--that the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act places an enormous regulatory burden on \nbanks, unfairly so.\n  Well, I think, unfortunately, with all due respect to Senator Gramm, \nthe facts do not bear that argument out. What we find is that among \nCRA-covered institutions, when they make an application, for example, \nwhen a bank decides they are going to merge with another bank, when a \nbank decides they are going to expand and open a branch, and therefore \nthey file a CRA application, 99 percent of those applications are never \neven challenged by community groups. So we start with a base of 99 \npercent where there is no challenge whatsoever. I would love the \ncomments of Senator Sarbanes on this in a moment, if he will. It is my \nunderstanding that the banks are not required to keep additional \ninformation as a result of this expansion of services. In fact, I think \nthey use exactly the same base data that they kept previously. Is that \ncorrect, Senator Sarbanes?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator, that is correct. Senator Bryan \nspoke to that earlier, about the effort that was made in the mid-1990s \nto ease the regulatory burden on the banks.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is my understanding.\n  So we start with this basic idea that 99 percent of all the CRA-\ncovered applications are not challenged at all. Then of the ones that \nare challenged, in only 1 percent of those cases are the applications \ndenied. So 1 percent are challenged versus 99 percent that are not, and \nof that 1 percent, only 1 percent of those are denied.\n  I think the facts prove that CRA has not been an enormous regulatory \nburden and that banks, as has been the experience of Senator Bayh, as \nhas been the experience of Senator Dodd in Connecticut, and as has been \nmy experience in talking to my bankers in North Carolina, the reality \nis they do not oppose the Community Reinvestment Act. They simply do \nnot.\n  As the quote from Hugh McColl indicated earlier, banks take great \npride in their opportunities to invest in their community. Our banks \nare good corporate citizens who do what they do because they take pride \nin it. They believe in the Community Reinvestment Act. They support it. \nThey are not opposed to it.\n  Finally, this chart depicts what CRA has done in loans to low- and \nmoderate-income communities. This is as of 1997, $34 billion in small \nbusiness loans. I think it is really important that we understand we \nare not just talking about housing. We are talking about small \nbusinesses, entrepreneurs who want to get started and just need a leg \nup, giving them a chance to develop their own business, $34 billion as \na result of the Community Reinvestment Act; $18.6 billion in community \ndevelopment, the kind of community development that we saw photographs \nof just a few moments ago; and critically important to my State of \nNorth Carolina--and I suspect Senator Bayh's State of Indiana--$11 \nbillion in small farm loans. That is $11 billion going to small farmers \nas a result of the Community Reinvestment Act.\n\n  Here is what we have. We have a bill that makes a great deal of sense \non the whole. We want to expand the services of banks. We believe--at \nleast I believe--that banks ought to be able to engage in those \nservices. But it is critically important that we maintain the viability \nand the vitality of the Community Reinvestment Act. It is important \nthat we maintain it for a lot of reasons: because we need to support \nminorities; we need to support the elderly; we need to support low-\nincome families; we need to support people who need or want to start \ntheir own small business or their own family farm. It makes good \nbusiness economic sense for the country.\n  But what I want the American people to hear from me today, if they \nhear nothing else, is that this is not some obscure piece of banking \nlegislation that is technical or difficult to understand. This \nlegislation can affect their lives and, in fact, will affect the lives \nof every American every day because to the extent that we keep poor \nfamilies together, to the extent that we reduce crime in this country, \nto the extent that we give people an opportunity to seek out good \nemployment, to get jobs to support their own families--all those things \nthat we as Americans believe in--when we do those things in \nconjunction, we as a country benefit. And to the extent that we look at \nit selfishly, we as individuals benefit because those people will not \nbe supported by the Government. They won't be supported by taxpayers. \nThey will support themselves. And the reality is that is exactly what \nthey want. They want the opportunity to support themselves and to know \nthe pride of homeownership. That is what community reinvestment is all \nabout. That is the reason Senators Sarbanes, Kerry, Bayh, Dodd, and \nmyself believe in it so deeply.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me compliment the Senator from Indiana and the \nSenator from North Carolina for their very strong presentations and \ntheir tremendous contributions to the Banking Committee. They both came \non the committee this year, and we are barely a few months into their \nfirst session and they have both made extraordinary contributions to \nthe work of the committee and to the work of the Senate. I simply want \nto say, as one Senator who has been here for a while, we are very \nhonored to have them as part of the Senate and thankful and grateful to \nthem for the contributions they make.\n  I wanted to ask the Senator this: In a letter we received from the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, which in effect fits in with the point that \nboth Senators were making about the importance of the Community \nReinvestment Act--it is signed by close to 170 mayors from all over the \ncountry, besides the ones that are trustees and on the advisory board \nof the U.S. Conference of Mayors--it says:\n\n       . . .As mayors, we recognize that CRA has been an essential \n     tool in revitalizing cities around this nation. In fact, \n     there is now increasing recognition that the strength and \n     economic health of whole regions require strong and vibrant \n     cities. Creating new economic activity--new businesses, new \n     jobs, new homeowners--is key to the revival of urban areas \n     and their surrounding regions, CRA has been a key component \n     to creating this new economic activity.\n\n  They go on later to say:\n\n       Prior to the enactment of CRA, banks and thrifts routinely \n     redlined low and moderate-income neighborhoods in our \n     nation's cities. The modest requirement in CRA that financial \n     institutions meet the credit needs of their communities has \n     led to the successful channeling of billions of dollars into \n     localities.\n\n  Then they note that the bill brought out by the committee would \nseverely weaken CRA. They say:\n       Unless the onerous CRA provisions are addressed and CRA is \n     preserved and strengthened, we would urge strong opposition \n     to the Senate bill.\n\n  I raise that with the Senator because it seems to me that it goes to \nthis very point, including the pictures he was showing. We are talking \nabout the elected officials who are right on the front line, so to \nspeak, trying to deal with the problems of their communities, trying to \nbring them back and achieve revitalization and renewal. They, \nobviously, have come in feeling very strongly.\n  Mr. President, does the Senator feel that this is another perspective \non the very point he was trying to make of the importance of CRA--not \njust for the people who directly benefit from it but for the broader \ncommunity, for all of us, it seems to me, here is, in a sense, an \nendorsement of the very position the Senator has been enunciating.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I think that is a wonderful indication, as the Senator \nput it, of the people on the ground, on the spot, seeing what is \nhappening on a day-to-day basis, recognizing how critically important \nCRA is to this country. They see what is happening. I think it goes \nhand in hand with the fact that the banks--and I might add, I take \ngreat pride in the fact that every bank in North Carolina has a \nsatisfactory CRA rating, every single one of them--are helping make a \ndifference.\n  I think the fact that the mayors are behind it, the fact that the \ncommunity\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\ngroups are behind it, the fact that the banks themselves, the financial \ninstitutions, are behind it, I think all these things in combination go \nto prove a very simple point: The Community Reinvestment Act has been \ngood for America. It is good for the specific groups it directly \nbenefits, and it is good for all of us as Americans because it allows \nthese folks to support themselves, which is what they want to do.\n  Mr. BAYH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I echo the words of the Senator from \nMaryland in complimenting my friend from North Carolina for his \neloquence and his insightful presentation on a continued, strong CRA. I \nobserve and I can tell that he has taken his advocacy skills from the \ncourtroom to the floor of the Senate, and the American people are \nbetter for it.\n  I compliment the Senator on his statement, which is built upon what \nthe ranking member said in the statement he read from the Conference of \nMayors. The Senator from North Carolina has become a dear friend and \nsomeone I have admiration and great respect for. I have heard the \nSenator mention on many occasions his dedication to ensuring that not \njust big cities or large institutions have opportunities, but that the \nfarmers and small rural areas across North Carolina are afforded the \nsame opportunities as those in the large cities and in the large \nfinancial institutions.\n  My question is this: Very often, this financial modernization bill is \nportrayed as something that just Wall Street and big institutions are \ninterested in. The Senator touched on this briefly, and there is one \nthing I was hoping he can expand on. I wonder if his experience in \nNorth Carolina is the same as ours in Indiana, which is that CRA can be \nan engine for making sure that farmers and small businesses in rural \nareas are afforded the same kinds of opportunities as the mayors \nindicated the cities enjoy.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator for his kind comments. He and I \nshare the same feelings about each other. We share a lot of the same \nbeliefs and values. There is no question that in the State of North \nCarolina we have had the same experience they have had in Indiana, \nwhich is that the Community Reinvestment Act, in fact, reaches out into \nrural, underserved communities, to small farmers, small businesses and \ncommunities that are chronically and economically disadvantaged and so \ndesperately need its help. I think it is another example of how well \nthe CRA has worked.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would like to ask a question.\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator doesn't even know what my statement would be. \nIt would be difficult to yield for a question based on what I haven't \nsaid yet. There is a little bit of smoke that needs to be cleared out \nof the Chamber before we proceed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think the Senator was just asking you \nto yield in order to determine the procedure.\n  Mr. KERRY. I was just going to ask the Senator how long he was going \nto speak.\n  Mr. ENZI. I apologize. I have been listening to a lot of statements \nmade, and I probably reacted in a way that I should not have.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. I will yield for a question, yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will make the following point. We go back \nand forth to try to keep some balance in the debate.\n  I think when people have a real question that it is a logical thing \nto do. But when questions used really disrupt the flow of the debate so \nthat you have long periods of time on one side of the aisle, I don't \nthink it is quite fair. Obviously under the rules we can do it, but it \ncan be done on both sides.\n  I would like to just suggest--we are going to vote on this at about 7 \no'clock. We have plenty of time. Everybody can be heard. I would just \nlike to suggest that we go back and forth. Everybody will get a chance \nto speak.\n  I urge our colleagues, if you have a real question on something you \ndon't know--other than, ``Do you realize that our proposal is a great \nproposal and their proposal is a rotten proposal?''--yes, I realize \nthat--if you have a real question, I think it makes sense. But in \nfairness to what we try to do in going back and forth, I urge people to \nwait for their time to speak so we have debate on both sides of the \naisle. That is my point.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. The answer to the question of the Senator from \nMassachusetts is, I think about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senator from \nWyoming concludes that the Senator from Massachusetts be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank you for the recognition. I \nappreciate this opportunity to speak.\n\n  There is a certain amount of tension that builds up as you listen to \nsome of the comments. The comments have been very good about CRA, the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, in general, and in general nothing is going \nto happen to that CRA. The Community Reinvestment Act will still be in \nplace. There will still be community reinvestment.\n  There are two changes in this bill that have been suggested. They \nmake some changes. They make some important changes that may make CRA \nmore viable, more valuable, more productive, and more useful.\n  There has been a tremendous escalation in the number of dollars being \ngiven in CRA commitments. We note that in 1995 the annual dollars were \n26 million, almost $27 million. In 1998, the annual dollars were 694 \nmillion.\n  What do you suppose caused the increase? Are banks just discovering \nthis? I don't think so.\n  A while ago you had the opportunity to listen to some of the contents \nof an agreement that was necessary in order to move on in a banking \narrangement. There are a lot of clauses in that which are pretty \ndisturbing to me.\n  It has been said that you are not hearing from the banks. If that \nletter has been used by many groups--you can see by the numbers that it \nis rapidly escalating--how many groups are being brought into this? \nThere is a clause in that which says they cannot complain about CRA. \nThat is freedom of speech? You cannot complain about somebody extorting \nmoney from you?\n  When banks are merging, there are a lot of stockholders who are \nnervous. There are customers who are nervous. They do not know whether \nthey want to stay with the bank or not just because of the media \nturmoil that is caused by the merger.\n  Then you have a group coming in to take advantage of that crisis \nmoment, that interest moment. They raise an issue. The bank isn't found \nto be out of compliance; the bank is in compliance. Under this bill, \nthey have to have been in compliance for 3 years. For 3 years they have \nbeen following this.\n  We had some discussion earlier that there are audits done on this. \nThey are checked on. It has always been shown that the ones that are \nmost likely to be involved in this, the bigger banks, are also the best \nrespondents. But there is a clause they have that says, first of all, \nthey are not going to complain about CRA; second, they are going to \nwrite this Congress and say what a good deal CRA is.\n  Does that sound like a normal business transaction? Does that sound \nlike something that businesses ought to be involved in?\n  If these things are really invalid actions by those banks, they ought \nto be taken to the highest level and the highest opportunity to punish. \nBut that destroys the value of the company. So they enter into \nagreements like this and send letters that say that the CRA is OK.\n  This bill does not gut CRA. It keeps the same program in place. If a \nbank, which is audited regularly, has met the criteria for 3 years, and \nmeets it at the moment, then actual objections have\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\nto be lodged. It seems like common sense to me. It doesn't sound like \ndoing away with the program. It is just common sense.\n  Small banks were mentioned. There is a change for small banks in \nhere, too, if they have under $100 million in assets. I think if any of \nyou look into banks, you will find that it is a very small bank that \nhas five or six employees. You will probably find that one of those \nemployees is dedicated to just doing CRA--doing CRA so they can prove \nthat they don't have a problem. It is only rural banks.\n\n  We have had these letters from Fort Wayne and some other cities. \nThose aren't rural banks. I don't care what their asset base is. They \ndon't get this advantage.\n  We are talking about the very small communities. I have those in \nWyoming. Those very small communities, even if they only have one or \ntwo employees, have to have somebody dedicated to doing the CRA. It is \na paperwork experience. They are having to fill out paperwork to prove \nthat they are not in violation in a community where there may not even \nbe minorities. So they cannot rest as well, because they don't have a \nclassification they can meet in their customer base in their community.\n  Three-fourths of the banks are rural banks. It was said that we had \nan amendment that put that at $2 million. I also want to point out a \ncomment that was made about these small banks. There were over 16,000 \nof them audited for CRA. There were three out of compliance. According \nto my record, there were three out of compliance. There are some that \nget lower ratings, and I have explained why they are lower ratings. But \neven if they were considerably more out of compliance, it is not good \nauditing to do it under that basis.\n  I am an accountant. I am the only accountant in the Senate. When you \nhave criteria for auditing businesses, you come up with higher \nstatistics than that kind of a base, or even a higher base than that. \nYou have to. Otherwise, you are wasting resources.\n  What I am saying is that some of these benefits that are talked about \nmay not have been worth it even on the basis of the auditing costs. We \nare talking about the basis of the business cost as well complying with \nthis law.\n  These banks are community banks--rural banks. In Wyoming, the bank \nmay be 100 miles from another bank. Who do you think they serve? People \nfrom other States in the Nation don't mail their money there. It is the \npeople who live in that community, and they expect and they get \nservice, or the bank goes out of business.\n  We have heard some statistics about how business has increased \nbecause of the CRA. We have heard statistics about how loans have \nincreased because of the CRA. Take a look at the timeframe. It wasn't \nthe CRA that drove up the number of people buying houses or drove up \nthe opportunity for more people to go into business. It was the \ninterest rate. The interest rate plummeted. More people could make \nhouse payments. More people bought houses. It wasn't that the banks \nwere being forced into this; the banks are already precluded from \nhaving to do bad loans. They are not loaning to just anybody who comes \nin the door. They are just doing a lot of paperwork to show that the \nloans they are granting are valid loans and the ones they are not are \nnot valid loans.\n  The economy makes the difference in whether new businesses start and \nwhether people buy more houses. The exemption for small banks will \nsolve some problems for small banks, and it probably ought to be a \nhigher amount than that.\n  Again, if you are looking at auditing statistics, you could double or \ntriple that number without affecting the numbers that are out of \ncompliance; hardly at all.\n  I want to reiterate again that that amount of extortion to the big \nbanks has gone from $27 billion up to $694 billion. That is going to be \nsomething on an ever-increasing basis. As more people get into the \nbusiness of taking on CRA, taking a base and a commission off of that, \nnone of this goes to the sector of the community we are talking about.\n\n  CRA is important. CRA is included in the bill. CRA only makes two \nchanges. It does not gut the bill. There are two changes: One for \nsmall, rural banks so we don't have to spend so much annually complying \nwith CRA and they instead can put it into their community, which is \nwhere they put their money; the other one is for the big banks so they \ndon't have to write these required letters we heard to their \nCongressman saying they don't have any problem with CRA.\n  This is not an attempt to gut CRA. This is an attempt to make it more \nvaluable, more useful and more applicable in the banks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank particularly the Senator from \nMaryland, the ranking member, for his leadership on this issue. I \nregret that the Senate is in the position it is in on this particular \nbill.\n  I have previously supported financial modernization. We have voted on \nit in several incarnations. Last year I was among those who happily \nsent this bill, what was then H.R. 10, to the Senate with a very \nsignificant vote of support in the Banking Committee, because we \nbelieved overwhelmingly that we had the right balance between the \ninterests of the financial services community, whom we are all \nconcerned about and we all understand need the needs of that community; \nat the same time we had what most people thought was a very fair and \nsensible recognition of the virtues of the CRA.\n  In the waning hours of the last Congress, all Members remember there \nwas a single, very adamant voice of opposition, the now chairman of the \ncommittee, who in fairness has deep-rooted beliefs about it, but who \nfrankly stood in a very, very small number last year who ultimately, \nbecause of the timing of the bill, was able to prevent an entire bill \nfrom passing the Senate.\n  Now we are back here once again revisiting the important imperatives \nof financial modernization. This year many of us who want to vote for \nthat financial modernization are put in the very difficult position of \nhaving to take a position of fundamental principle that because we \nbelieve so deeply that the CRA provision is so disturbed by this bill \nthat a strong relationship that has existed and worked with a profound, \npositive impact for people in this country, is being sufficiently \nundone, even attacked, and requires that we oppose the bill in its \ncurrent form.\n  I am used to going through Pyrrhic exercises in the Senate, \nregrettably with increased frequency. It is a sad commentary on the \nnature of the legislative process today that sometimes measures move \nthrough here in a very partisan way and then we ultimately wind up in \nthe conference committee with the administration negotiating and things \nare changed.\n  That may or may not happen here. It certainly didn't have to be this \nway. We could have arrived at some kind of fairminded compromise that \nreflected the views of the vast majority of Senators. Instead, we find \nourselves with a bill that is not just about financial modernization. \nIt is also about a significant reduction in the capacity of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act to work. Many Members believe very, very \ndeeply we can do better than that.\n  I think we obviously need to recognize that U.S. financial \ninstitutions as a whole are the most efficient providers of financial \nservices in the world today. There have been remarkable changes in the \nmarketplace in the last years. All Members ought to pay proper tribute \nto the virtues of the entrepreneurs who have themselves undertaken to \nput those changes in place.\n  I don't think Congress can stand here with a straight face and take \nentire credit for the virtues of the economy that we are living in \ntoday. I do think we take partial credit because I think it was a \ncourageous effort in 1993 to face up to the realities of the deficit \nand to come up with a solid deficit reduction act. In addition to the \ncongressional efforts, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, \ndeserves enormous credit for his courage during the banking crisis of \nthe last years of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s when he took \nbold action to help refinance the banks, as well as his remarkable \nstewardship of monetary policy itself.\n  Finally, it seems to me a very significant amount of the credit goes \nto the companies themselves and the CEOs\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\nwho saw a change coming down the road, who responded to the demands of \nthe 1980s when people were writing books about Japan, Inc. and writing \noff American enterprise and suggesting we needed a wholesale adoption \nof another model. Indeed, our model has proven perhaps at times to be \nexcessive and at times even to be insensitive, but nevertheless to be \nway ahead of any other capacity or structure in the world in the \nmarketplace.\n  Increasingly, one of the reasons for that success has been the \nblurring of the lines between banking, insurance, and securities. We \nneed to do our part. We are way behind the curve, years behind the \ncurve. Were it not for the thoughtful and judicious steps taken by the \nregulators themselves without congressional impetus we perhaps wouldn't \nhave been able to accomplish some of what we have.\n  Now is the time to respond by breaking down the artificial legal \nbarriers of an outdated era, the barriers that prevented banks, \nsecurity firms and insurance companies from affiliating. It is time we \ntake the step to ratify the liberation of financial service companies \nso they can provide a broader array of services to consumers and \ncorporate customers. I don't think we should hesitate to do it. This is \nseveral years overdue.\n  It is regrettable that we find ourselves in this position, after the \nSenate Banking Committee overwhelmingly by a 16-2 vote passed \nlegislation. That is a fairly profound statement of the Senate Banking \ncommittee's willingness to move forward.\n  Here we are again, notwithstanding the challenge of financial \nmodernization, with too many Members having to say no to moving forward \nbecause of the extreme measures being applied to the CRA itself.\n  That judgment is not ours alone. The Treasury Secretary, whose \nexpertise and judgment over the last years, I think, has been without \nparallel, and the President of the United States, clearly on Secretary \nRubin's recommendation, have stated that if the CRA measure stays as it \nis, this measure will be vetoed. Very simple: It is going to be vetoed.\n  We have a choice. We can either take a look at the CRA and make a \njudgment about what it accomplishes or we can go through another Senate \nexercise, send the bill out for veto and accept failure in the end for \nour capacity to be able to recognize the importance of the vast changes \nthat I referred to a moment ago.\n  Let me say a few words about the CRA, if I may. The CRA is now more \nthan 20 years old. It is very straightforward in concept. It is \nimminently reasonable. It says simply that banks have to provide credit \nto all the communities in which they take deposits. In other words, if \na bank accepts deposits from a neighbor, that bank has some kind of \nresponsibility to make loans available to creditworthy borrowers in \nthose neighborhoods. That is common sense and it is fundamentally fair. \nThis statement of reciprocity, of mutual responsibility, says an awful \nlot about the kind of country we want to be and the kind of country we \nare as a consequence of that kind of effort.\n\n  Let me speak for a moment to what the CRA has accomplished. It has \nhelped to make more than $1 trillion in good, profitable loans to low-\nincome areas, loans that bankers in my State and in States all across \nthe country have said would not have been made without the law. It has \ngiven low-income communities of working families access to capital that \nis absolutely crucial to start a small business or to buy a home. And \nit has created new business opportunities for the banks themselves.\n  I would say that CRA is a fundamentally conservative, procapitalist \nlaw because it is not a handout; it is not something for nothing. It \nrequires responsibility. It broadens the tax base. It broadens the \ncapitalization capacity of a community. It brings people into the \neconomic mainstream. It is a law that provides that all Americans, low- \nand moderate-income Americans, very often African Americans or Hispanic \nAmericans, with the opportunity to buy a home or build a business if \nthey are creditworthy.\n  The law is very clear on the last point, about creditworthiness. \nLoans have to be made with all of the normal concerns for safety and \nfor soundness. The act itself could not have been more clear on that. \nIt says that it has to help meet the credit needs of the local \ncommunities from which it is chartered, ``consistent with the safe and \nsound operation of such institutions.''\n  So, when the chairman of the committee says it is just an extortion \nprogram, I think there is such a level of extreme exaggeration and \nrhetoric in that, measured against what happens --and I will speak for \na moment later to the question of extortion--because any bank has the \nability to prove that any particular request was not able to meet the \nrequirement of safe and sound operation of that institution. It is \nclear there are plenty of ways of doing that. And the balance of the \nweight is on the bank; it is really against the person requesting the \ncredit, based upon the normal standards by which banks do business.\n  If you talk to most bankers, they will tell you the CRA loans perform \nas well as the rest of their portfolios. We are not looking at some \nenormous drag on banking institutions. In fact, some banks have begun \nto sell CRA loans on Wall Street in order to acquire more capital to \nmake more CRA loans. Those are market forces that are being harnessed \nto expand opportunity and to grow our economy.\n  Here in the Senate, lately, we have heard a lot of talk about the \n``opportunity society.'' The fact is, the Community Reinvestment Act \nexemplifies that notion. Credit is the economic lifeblood of every \ncommunity, whether it is rich or poor. In our society, I think it is \nfair to say that historically we know that credit denied is also \nopportunity denied. When you deny hard-working Americans the chance to \nbuy their own homes or start their own businesses, you are denying them \nthe opportunity to share in the American promise.\n  This is a country where we have demanded a lot of our citizens. We \nexpect them to make the most of their own lives, to take responsibility \nfor themselves and for their families--largely because of the kinds of \npublic policy decisions we have had the privilege of supporting here in \nthe Senate with respect to this kind of economic sharing, if you will. \nWe say to Americans: If you take the effort to live by the rules, to \nshow your creditworthiness, to stand up within the economic structure, \nthen we have the ability to help provide some of the tools to build \nthat decent life for yourself. CRA was built on that.\n  But what we are considering today--and I heard the Senator from \nWyoming and I have heard other Senators try to suggest this is really \njust a fixing of the CRA, that it doesn't really take it apart, it is \ngoing to leave it in place; we are just going to take, whatever, about \n38 percent of the banks out from under it--those are the banks under \nthe $100 million mark--and then we are going to make it a lot more \ndifficult to apply any real measurement because we are going to change \nthe standard by which we measure a violation; and, we are also going to \nchange--according to the chairman--we are going to exempt banks from \nprotest based on a 3-year satisfactory CRA record no matter what. And \nof course for the new activities we are empowering in this bill, it \ndoesn't apply at all.\n\n  If ever there was a reason to make judgments about whether or not \npeople are in compliance, it is when they are going to go out and \nengage in new activities that involve a whole series of new, larger \nroles within the economic community.\n  It seems to me it is inconceivable that, when they are going to take \non those new kinds of responsibilities, you are suddenly going to say: \nWe are not going to apply it; we are going to hold it where it is based \non the theory of what CRA is supposed to be.\n  There is a reason that there is this kind of semi-subtle approach--I \nwould not call it that subtle in the end. It is sort of a sledgehammer, \nbut it is hidden enough in a way that people who are not completely \nfamiliar with it or with the process might say there are some redeeming \nfactors here. But the fact is, the reason it is done in this sort of \nbackdoor approach is that they learned they cannot do a frontal \nassault. They are not going to strike it altogether. It does not give \npeople enough cover. So then you are left sort of analyzing: What is it \nthat it is really going to do? What is going to happen here, in terms \nof this effort?\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\n  I believe the Bryan amendment will preserve the appropriate \nrelationships by simply requiring that banks have and maintain a \nsatisfactory CRA rating as a condition of exercising the new \naffiliations allowed in this bill. The Bryan amendment also strikes the \nsafe harbor language and the exemption from CRA regulations for banks \nwith less than $100 million of assets.\n  I listened to the chairman in the committee and I addressed this \ndirectly--raised this issue of extortion. I acknowledged at the time, \nand I will acknowledge on the floor, that I know of instances where \npeople have come into a bank at the last minute, or at the moment of a \nmerger, feeling the iron is hot, and of course when the bank wants the \nmerger to move--carefully and without ruffled feathers. When the banks \ndon't want the regulators suddenly getting their dander up at this \ncritical moment of merger. So people take advantage of this \nopportunity.\n  Let me say, I know of some instances where there have been some \nmarginally meritorious requests. But the record of the numbers of \nchallenges--and I will address that in a moment--is very clear. It is \nso de minimis that no one can come to the floor with anything except \npure anecdote, sort of a story here or there, that suggests that \nsomehow there is some massive problem. What bank does not deal with \ncommunity groups, all the time--this is not some sort of a last minute \nthing where there are a bunch of unknown people sitting at a table who \ncan walk into the bank and the newspapers and the local television are \nall going to take them seriously. We are dealing, after all, with \ncommunities in which there are sets of relationships which everybody \nunderstands.\n  Most of the people within that community--the political leaders, the \nelected political leaders, the opinion leaders, the bankers, the \nbusinesspeople, the news people--understand the difference between \nlegitimacy and extortion. They understand the difference between a \ncommunity that is getting its fair share of community investment from a \nbank and a community that has been starved.\n  The fact is, if somebody is walking in, in some sort of bald-faced \n``extortion effort,'' the bank can tell them no way and probably stand \nthere with impunity and justification in doing so. If some banker is \ncomplaining about some illegitimate group coming in and holding them \nup, then that banker, frankly, ought to be fired for not having the \ncourage and the guts to say: Look, we are meeting our standards. We \nhave covered all the people who have made legitimate requests. Your \nrequest is not legitimate. It will not withstand the scrutiny in the \nlight of day, and I am not going to be blackmailed, period.\n  Moreover, there are laws in this country already on the books, \nFederal laws, State laws and local--within counties--which district \nattorneys can prosecute with respect to those kinds of extortion \nefforts.\n  To suggest we are going to hold up the financial modernization \nefforts of the United States of America in a global marketplace over \nthese anecdotal stories and not be able to find a common ground where \nwe could fix or address the question of legitimacy--there are any \nnumber of language changes you could make in the standards or in the \nreview process or in the process, all of which would be adequate to \ndeal with the questions that the Senator from Texas has raised. But \nnone of those is on the table, none of them. What is on the table is an \nentire exemption for a whole set of banks for whom this has worked very \neffectively. Moreover, what is on the table is an exemption of any \nconsideration at all for these remarkable new powers that are going to \nbe given to the banks which demand that you make some kind of judgment \nabout what their commitment really is in their community.\n  You can talk to most of the bankers in the country right now.\n  The Wall Street Journal summed it up this way:\n\n       Few Republicans share (the Chairman's) passion for the \n     (CRA) issue. Bankers don't love the CRA but have largely made \n     their peace with it. . . . ``CRA is part of the way we do \n     business--we don't have any problems with it,'' says Pamela \n     Flaherty, a vice president at Citigroup, Inc.\n\n  It is not industry leaders or community leaders who are driving this \neffort to undermine the CRA; it is the tendency in this Chamber and in \nour politics for ideology sometimes to work against the needs of \ncommunities and the interests of good public policy. When you measure \nwhat we are doing against the broad-based effort of the House of \nRepresentatives and the House Banking Committee to develop a more \nbroad-based effort, you have a real confrontation with that approach.\n  If you look at some of the language we have heard about the CRA--\ncomparing it to slavery--that is the kind of statement that just \nignores the reality of what the CRA has accomplished.\n  The CRA, accepted by most bankers in this country, supported by \npeople like Alan Greenspan, supported by major bankers in the country, \nhas brought billions of dollars of credit into African communities, \nHispanic communities, and Asian-American communities where thousands of \nbanks have become active partners in creating opportunities for working \nfamilies so they can become new homeowners and by providing the capital \nto budding entrepreneurs.\n  Slavery? That is an extraordinary comment. Too many of our colleagues \nare willing to forget the redlining and the racism that plagued lending \nin too many low-income communities in previous years. Before 1977, when \nthe Community Reinvestment Act became law, many financial institutions \nbelieved they had absolutely no responsibility to the communities they \nserved. Some financial institutions accepted racial and economic \ndiscrimination as part of their mortgage credit and business lending \npolicy. It is because we found that too many banking institutions saw \nan ease to the profit line by moving into certain areas and an \nunwillingness to do business and reach out to Main Street with access \nto credit that we put the CRA in place.\n  Studies from that time period show that some financial institutions \nroutinely invested more than 90 percent of their deposits that they \nreceived from low-income and minority neighborhoods into other areas. \nNinety percent of the deposits that came from certain low-income \ncommunities went out to other areas. We have a fundamental \nresponsibility not to start segmenting and dividing up the financial \nmarketplace in a way that is going to allow people to turn away from \nthat responsibility of inclusion that has benefited everybody in this \ncountry and has made this country a better place.\n  In Roxbury, MA, a low-income minority neighborhood within the city of \nBoston, only 20 percent of home sales were financed by financial \ninstitutions between 1975 and 1976. But in the prosperous suburbs of \nBoston, 83 percent of home sales were financed by financial \ninstitutions in the same time period.\n  The residents of Roxbury who were able to obtain financing were \nforced to use private mortgage companies, often at substantially \ngreater expense than at financial institutions. The cost of denying \nprivate mortgage credit and business lending was literally devastating \nto the social and economic growth of Roxbury and other low-income \nneighborhoods in the inner city and in rural areas. Over time, property \nvalues and small business activity plummeted, and then crime and \npoverty escalated.\n  We can recreate that cycle if we want to go backward in time, Mr. \nPresident. Activities like that are exactly what brought the Congress \nto pass the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977, to encourage bank and \nthrift regulatory agencies to help meet the credit needs in all areas \nof the communities that they serve.\n  I don't think we can afford as a nation to roll ourselves back to \nthose days when it was more power to the powerful, more money to those \nwho already had the money, and less concern and less effort to try to \nbe the country that all the speeches are about and all our days of \ncelebration are about.\n\n  CRA has worked in Massachusetts where there has been more than $1.6 \nbillion in commitments made by financial assistance institutions to \nassist low-income neighborhoods. These funds have been invested in home \nownership, affordable housing development, minority small business \ndevelopment, new banking facilities and services, and it has made a \ndifference in our inner-city neighborhoods from Roxbury to Jamaica \nPlain to the South End. Let me give a direct example.\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\n  Stacy Andrus, from Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, was a restaurateur \nstruggling to make ends meet and retain her clientele in a competitive \nenvironment. She knew she had to be creative just to keep pace. She \nbegan toasting chips out of pita bread to serve as finger food before \nmeals. As one might expect, those chips soon became the most popular \nitem on the menu.\n  Like so many businessowners who know they have latched on to a great \nidea, she wanted to expand the operation. She tried to bring the \nconcept to scale, but capital and credit were not available to her; \nthey were not available in Jamaica Plain. Even though their deposits \nwent into the bank, they did not come back into the community.\n  She could not find the help she needed until finally she started \nworking with the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation. \nThis corporation works within a network of small business providers \nthat use CRA programs at local banks to secure funding for small \nbusinesses. With their help, Stacy obtained a $60,000 loan from \nBankBoston. As a result, her business expanded rapidly: She has leased \na production plant in Jamaica Plain; she has residents of the low-\nincome community working for her; she has put former welfare recipients \non the payroll; she has 900 bags of chips rolling off the assembly line \nevery single day. Thanks to CRA she has now made them one of the top \nselling gourmet snack foods in all of Boston, and she has major \nairlines interested in serving her chips to first-class customers. \nWithout the CRA, Mr. President, the community of Jamaica Plain would \nnot have received those kinds of benefits from economic development \nthat has been generated. In addition, it is also giving low-income \ncommunities a shot at home ownership.\n  Julie Orlando is a single working mother of three. She wanted to buy \na home for her family in Leominster, MA, which is Northwest of Boston. \nIn the days before CRA, she would not have possibly been considered a \nlikely candidate to own a home, but because the Fidelity Cooperative \nBank was involved in the CRA coalition, she was able to obtain a \n$72,000 mortgage with no points. The city of Leominster provided \nadditional assistance to Julie and her family. Because the Fidelity \nCooperative Bank participated in the CRA coalition, she and her \nchildren can live with their first home, which is, after all, Mr. \nPresident, not just the American dream, but it is good for the \ncommunity.\n  How many times have we heard of the problem of crime that comes from \ntransient members of the community, people who do not have a stake in \nthe community. That is exactly the type of assistance that CRA was \ndesigned to provide.\n  It is my hope we are not going to take measures here that deny a \nwhole generation of CRA success stories in the future. The CRA and the \nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act data continue to show that blacks and \nHispanics face significantly higher mortgage rejection rates.\n  The Boston Federal Reserve showed conclusively that African Americans \nget turned down for a mortgage 1.6 times more often than whites, even \nafter you control for many of the economic income and creditworthiness \ndifferences.\n  A New York Newsday study, looking at 100,000 mortgage applications on \nLong Island, showed that blacks' applications were rejected three times \nas often as whites', even when they had the same income.\n  In a study right here in the Washington, DC, area, completed last \nyear, we found that significant lending discrimination exists against \nblacks and Hispanics.\n  Mr. President, the need for the CRA remains very much alive in the \nUnited States. Let's put the rhetoric aside. Let's put the ideology \naside. Let's find the common ground within the Senate whereby we can \nguarantee that we can build a coalition that will support the best of \nfinancial modernization and the best of our effort to broaden the \neconomic base of this country.\n  I might add, some have suggested there is sort of a legalized concept \nto what has been called the ``legalized extortion.'' In fact, some \npeople have suggested that the regulators have assisted that process.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, I find it very hard to believe that people \nwould suggest that Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, \nfor whom we have--all of us--such respect for, is complicitous in that \nprocess. This is what he said about the CRA:\n\n       . . . the CRA process is something that we clearly have \n     been supportive of and think is crucial and necessary to the \n     development of communities. We think that it's in the \n     interest of the banks. We think that it's in the interest of \n     communities.\n\n  Mr. President, the data from the regulators--let me just close on \nthis--the data from the regulators is clear. The chairman of the \nBanking Committee wants the Senate to fundamentally weaken CRA. He will \nstand up and argue, this is not taking it away. He is going to try to \npoint to the exemption for the small banks. And he will come back to \nthe notion that it somehow is still in effect, even though it does not \napply to the new services that will be provided, and even though the 3-\nyear safe harbor provision is included.\n  But the fact is, that fewer than 1 percent of bank applications have \nbeen receiving an adverse CRA comment. Fewer than 1 percent of the 660 \napplications that received the adverse comment were denied on CRA \ngrounds--1 percent of the 1 percent. Not a single application receiving \nadverse comments has been denied since 1994.\n  So here we are with the entire regulatory structure of our \nmodernization effort of the financial services of our country held \nhostage to a few people's perceptions, based on ideology, of 1 percent \nof 1 percent, notwithstanding that all of the banks in the country have \nlearned that this is, in fact, good economic policy, good banking \npolicy, and they have accepted the CRA.\n  It is my hope that our colleagues will recognize that, even as this \ncountry has grown strong and the economy and the marketplace has grown, \neven as the stock market is reaching the extraordinary 11,000 level, \nthe fact is that there are more Americans who are poor, there are more \nAmericans who are living on 1989 wages, there are more children in \npoverty today than there were 3 years ago or 4 years ago in this \ncountry, by a figure of about 400,000, and the fact that too many \nfamilies are working too hard at the bottom level just to make ends \nmeet.\n\n  For us to backtrack on a fundamental commitment about the \nrelationship of financial institutions within the communities in which \nthey do business, would be to turn our backs on what has made America \nstronger and better. And I hope my colleagues will not do that. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, you will hardly know where to begin when \nyou have listened to these speeches for a couple hours, and most of \nthem have nothing whatsoever to do with what we are talking about on \nthe floor.\n  It reminds me of the old Lincoln adage, where Lincoln was engaged in \na debate, and the guy debating Lincoln got up and gave a wonderful \nspeech that had nothing to do with the subject being debated; and \nLincoln got up and said that his colleague had given a wonderful speech \nthat would be appropriate for another day and another occasion.\n  I want to go through, roughly, 10 points that have been raised in all \nthese speeches, and then go back to what we are debating.\n  No. 1, we have had a lot of speeches for CRA. And one would get the \nidea in listening to these speeches that someone is proposing to repeal \nCRA. In fact, as far as I am aware, no one has ever offered an \namendment or bill since 1977 proposing repeal of CRA.\n  Whether the record for CRA is as wonderful as our colleagues have \nclaimed, have we built more houses because the economy is better or \nbecause of CRA? Who wants to get into that debate? Because it is not \nrelevant to what we are talking about, nobody is talking about \nrepealing CRA.\n  No. 2, nobody is talking about ``turning back the clock.'' What we \nare talking about is dealing with abuses that exist in the current \nsystem, and that can and should be fixed. One of those abuses basically \nhas to do with extraordinary power that protesters and protest groups \nhave at critical moments when banks are trying to make\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\ndecisions. The second has to do with the relevancy of CRA, and which \nbanks under what circumstances have relevant requirements, and what are \nthe regulatory burdens and costs involved.\n  In terms of a point that was made way back so many speeches ago--I \nforget which one it was--that in 99 percent of the cases where banks \napply to do something that requires CRA evaluation, nobody challenges \nthat action, that is a very misleading number, really, for a number of \nreasons.\n  First, most of these applications concern the opening or closing \nbranches. They are not very relevant. It is basically the mergers and \nacquisitions that are relevant to CRS protests.\n  Second, as I have pointed out on many occasions, most of the CRA \naction takes place not in the formal complaint, but basically when the \nprotester goes to the bank threatening that unless the bank takes \ncertain action, often giving that person money, that they are going to \nfile a complaint. So it never shows up in the statistics. So that is \nall interesting but largely irrelevant.\n  One of our colleagues said that I said, or someone had said, that CRA \nis just an extortion program. No one ever made that statement. What I \nhave said is that CRA has become a vehicle where a tremendous number of \nactions occur that certainly look like extortion. When you look at \ncontracts that are being signed, these individuals and groups are given \nlarge sums of money, and then they sign a commitment that they will \nwithdraw their objection. That is a classic quid pro quo, that is the \nessence of extortion or bribery or kickbacks. There are a lot of names \nyou can use. But no one has suggested any of them in this debate. Many, \nmost, almost all of the people involved in CRA are conscientious and \nhonest.\n  We are talking about people here who are abusing the system. And even \nspokesmen for CRA, even spokesmen for community groups, say there are \nabuses, that the abuses undercut the system. As everybody who is on the \nBanking Committee knows, when the CRA advocates testified before the \nBanking Committee, a clear point was made that abuses do occur. They \ncalled the abuses ``greenmail.'' I think the standard term is \n``blackmail,'' but nobody disputes that they occur. What we are trying \nto do is to deal with them.\n\n  In terms of half the banks being out of compliance, half the banks \nbeing affected, there isn't any proposal that would let half the banks \nout of CRA. Basically, the proposal in the underlying bill is that \nbanks with less than $100 million in assets and which are also in \nnonmetropolitan areas, in rural areas, that these banks be exempt from \nCRA. Now, why?\n  First of all, since 1990, over a 9-year period, there have been \n16,380 examinations of these small rural banks; 16,380 times Federal \nregulators have gone to these rural banks. They have sat down for days \nand weeks, looking through their records. They have done reports to \ndetermine whether these rural banks are lending in their community and \nmeeting their community reinvestment requirements.\n  After 16,380 examinations, only 3 banks have been found to be \nsubstantially out of compliance. The cost of complying with CRA for \nthese examinations to the small banks has been roughly $80,000 a year, \naccording to the 488 letters we have received from small banks on this \nsubject.\n  That is $1.3 billion of cost imposed on small banks. I have read at \ngreat length letters about how small banks can't serve their customers \nbecause they have to do all this paperwork and how it is interfering \nwith community lending. I have read some passionate letters on this \nsubject on the floor of the Senate in this debate. I am not going to \nreread them now.\n  The point is, $1.3 billion later, 16,380 examinations later, crushing \npaperwork, cost burden on very small banks, many of them between 6 and \n10 employees, $1.3 billion of costs banks have paid, and only 3 small \nrural banks have been found to be substantially out of compliance.\n  What does our bill do? It exempts from CRA very small, very rural \nbanks. In total, in terms of the number of banks, that is about 38 \npercent of the banks in America. In terms of available capital, as you \ncan see from this chart, that is 2.7 percent of all the assets in all \nthe banks and S in America.\n  Now, the logical question is this: 44 percent of our auditing effort \nis going into banks that have only 2.7 percent of the assets, and they \nhave been found to be substantially out of compliance only 3/100 of 1 \npercent of the time. Is this not massive regulatory overkill? What does \nthis have to do with meeting community needs for loans? If there has \never been an overreach in regulatory terms, imposing $1.3 billion of \ncost on little banks and little communities to turn up three banks in 9 \nyears that have been substantially out of compliance, this is \nregulatory overkill. We are trying to fix it.\n  In terms of exemption based on a 3-year record, one of my \nfrustrations in debating on the Senate floor--and I guess all of us can \nbe accused of doing it; I try to, at least within my own mind, be \ncareful about things I say. I try to put my argument in the best light \nI can. Everybody else does. I try not to say things I don't believe to \nbe true. But we continue to hear these things like, if a bank has been \nin compliance three times, they are exempt from CRA. That is not what \nour bill does.\n  Here is what our bill does. Let me explain the problem. In fact, let \nme have that quote from the law professor at Cornell. This quote is \nfrom Cornell law professor Jonathan Macey. Jonathan Macey is one of our \nNation's premier experts in banking law and is very knowledgeable in \nthis whole area of application of CRA. In evaluating what is happening, \nthis is basically what he says:\n\n       You see really weird things when you look at the code of \n     Federal regulations . . . like Federal regulators are \n     encouraged to leave the room and allowing community groups to \n     negotiate ex parte with bankers in a community reinvestment \n     context. . . . Giving jobs to the top five officials of these \n     communities or shake-down groups is generally high up on the \n     list (of demands). So, what we really have is a bit of old \n     world Sicily brought into the U.S., but legitimized and given \n     the patina of government support.\n\n  Let me see those CRA agreements, if you will stack all those back up \nthere one more time. I am going to zip through them real quickly.\n  One of our problems in evaluating what happened to the $9 billion of \ncash payments that were made under CRA--something never contemplated; \nnobody on the Banking Committee in 1977, I don't believe, thought CRA \nwould ultimately produce cash payments being made to individuals and to \ngroups; they thought, as we have heard arguments all day, that CRA is \nabout lending--we don't know where all this money goes. We don't know \nwhat percentage of rake-offs, for example, these groups get on loans \nbanks make, because we don't have the records. These CRA agreements are \nconfidential; they are not made public. That is something later that we \nhope to change.\n  But let me just say, I have three pieces of CRA agreements. These are \nall private agreements where the parties have agreed not to make them \npublic. We have redacted the names to protect the people who committed \nnot to make them public.\n  The point I am trying to make here is how far away from lending, as \nwe conventionally know it, this is.\n  This is from Bank A: Provide blank--this is the CRA group--with a \ngrant of up to $20,000. Provide blank with a grant of up to $50,000. \nProvide blank with a grant of up to $25,000. And on this one they say \nwhy: to pay reasonable and necessary soft costs incurred. Provide blank \nwith a grant of a reasonable amount.\n  And then after they agree to pay that money, look at this provision: \nBlank agrees to withdraw on the date hereof the comment letter, dated \nblank 28, 19 blank, and any related materials filed by blank with the \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Bank, \nand the board--and it goes on.\n  The point is, on one page they give all these grants to groups, and \nthen on the second page the groups agree to withdraw the complaints \nthey filed against the action the banks want to make.\n  Here is the point: Did the groups file the complaints to get the \nmoney? What about the legitimacy of the complaint? Did it go away when \nthey got the money?\n  It goes on. We are getting more and more of these every day. Then, in \nevery one of these agreements we have seen,\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\nthere is an agreement by the community group or the individual and the \nbank not to disseminate or otherwise make available to the public \ncopies of this agreement.\n  Here is a second bank agreement, Bank B: Blank will receive a fee of \n2 and three quarters percent of the face amount of each program loan \nmade by blank.\n  Now, I wonder if people in that community realize that this \nundisclosed individual, or group, is getting a rake-off of 2.75 percent \nof the face value of every loan that is being made by this bank. Blank \nwill receive a $200,000 fee as reimbursement, $100,000 payable fund, \nexecution and delivery, $100,000 6 months from now. That is the quid. \nHere is the quo: The group commits to withdraw all pending protests of \nregulatory applications and related matters, but not to sponsor, either \ndirectly or indirectly, to protest or supply information in connection \nwith any protest relating to the pending or future blank applications \nwith bank regulators.\n  In other words, it doesn't matter what abuses the bank might do in \nthe future. They are never going to protest again because of this. At \nthe request to send letters to the customers of the bank--well, let me \ngo on. Not only do they agree never to protest again on any issue, but \nthey agree to purge the files and data bases of all information \nrelating to the bank's customers.\n  Now, it goes on: to immediately cease all activities directed against \nthe bank; to maintain the confidentiality of this agreement--they have \nconfidentiality again here--and then: to cooperate with the community \ngroup, to help them use this agreement to leverage other financial \ninstitutions to get money from them. In other words, not only are they \npaying this money, they are going to help them get other banks to pay \nit.\n  It is funny how little things grab you. Maybe it is just me, but this \none hits me the hardest. I was wondering why we were getting these \nletters from banks in favor of CRA when the bank officers were telling \nme--and in some cases saying publicly--that CRA was blackmail. Yet, I \nwas getting letters from these banks saying CRA is great. Well, here is \nthe reason:\n  Blank will work with the blank to establish a clear, written \ndeclaratory statement indicating support for the Community Reinvestment \nAct and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the party's opposition to \nany attempts to weaken the law. Blank will send the final copy of this \nstatement to the blank.\n  In other words, they will let them go over and rewrite the letter \nthey are going to send. And they are going to send the letter to the \nAmerican Bankers Association, Federal Reserve Board, Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency, the whole congressional delegation of \ntheir State, and to all members of the House and Senate Banking \nCommittees.\n  So, Senator Bennett, when you got a letter from this bank telling you \nthat CRA is the greatest thing that has ever been, you probably did not \nknow that was the result of a CRA agreement so that a bank could do \nbusiness in America. And we are not talking about Honduras; we are not \ntalking about Thailand. We are talking about the United States of \nAmerica, and we have banks--some of the richest and most powerful \ninstitutions in America--that are having dictated to them at this very \nmoment that they have to write us letters telling us things they do not \nbelieve. How is that happening? How can that be happening in America? I \nask you, how can it happen?\n  Not only is it happening, it is being condoned because, as the law \nprofessor from Cornell said, we have given the patina of Government \nsupport to something that if it happened to an American bank in \nThailand, we would file an unfair trade practice against them.\n  So when you are getting all these letters telling you how wonderful \nCRA is from banks, remember this agreement. In fact, I received such a \nletter from a particular bank. Fortunately, to show you this is a very \ngood and honorable bank, they say in their letter they have been forced \nto send this letter as a result of a CRA agreement.\n  I discovered this letter because there was an editorial written \nattacking the bill quoting this bank, or this letter, interestingly \nenough. There was an editorial written quoting a letter from First \nUnion Corporation, a wonderful, great bank. They were quoted in the \neditorial as saying how great CRA was and why we should not be making \nany changes to the bill. Well, I said I want to see this letter. So we \ngot the letter. Let me read the first paragraph:\n\n       As part of a CRA pledge we made during our merger with \n     CoreStates, First Union National Bank committed to send a \n     written statement to certain individuals or organizations \n     clearly expressing our position on CRA and HMDA regulations. \n     We, as an organization, are very committed to serving all of \n     our communities, including underserved areas. We are happy to \n     provide this statement.\n\n  Then they go on to say that nothing in the letter is meant to be an \nendorsement or opposition to any particular bill. I know we have one of \nthe most distinguished former prosecutors in America sitting in the \nChair. I have to say--not to speak for him, because in his role as \nPresiding Officer, he can't speak until he comes down here--what is the \ndifference between this and the old protection racket that existed when \nI was a child? I am proud to say that my uncles, as sheriffs and police \nofficers, broke up some of those protection rackets. But the only \ndifference is that this is Government; this is the Federal Government \nthat is basically allowing this to happen.\n  Now, we are not talking about repealing CRA. We are not talking about \nending a program that obviously has had many successes. We are talking \nabout trying to deal with abuse. So what are the two things we do? No. \n1, we say that if a bank has a history of being in compliance with the \nlaw, if they have been evaluated 3 years in a row and been found to be \nin compliance with CRA, and if they are presently in compliance with \nCRA, then any individual or group can protest, file a complaint; and \nunder the existing regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, \nthere has to be a hearing for any complaint that is lodged.\n  But what our amendment adds is the requirement that if this bank has \na long history of being in compliance, before the regulator can stop \nthe action that they have earned the right to undertake, the protester \nmust present some substantial evidence. In other words, if you are a \ngood actor and you have been evaluated 3 years in a row and were found \nto be in compliance, you are innocent until proven guilty. Somebody \ncan't just walk in and say a banker is a racist and a loan shark.\n  Some protesters have done exactly that. There is a CRA protester who \ncalls himself an ``urban terrorist,'' who used those charges against a \nbank, harassed them for 4 years, went to a speech of the president of \nthe bank at Harvard University, disrupted the speech, made this man's \nlife miserable for 4 long years, until the bank gave him $1.4 million \nand a $200,000 grant and set up an organization that now lends $3.5 \nbillion, totally unregulated by the Federal Government. He gets a 2.75-\npercent rake-off of each one of those loans, and nobody knows what he \ndoes with the money. He is not accountable to anybody.\n  Now, all we want to do is say if a bank has consistently been in \ncompliance and you want to stop them from merging with another bank, or \nopening a branch, you have to present some evidence. Now, what is the \nstandard we have used? The Presiding Officer, as a distinguished \nattorney and former prosecutor, knows that substantial evidence is the \nmost defined term in American law. It is referred to over 900 times in \nthe United States Code.\n  There have been 400 court decisions that have defined ``substantial \nevidence.''\n  So what standard do we require a protester to meet if he tries to \nimpose potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in costs on a bank, \nand to stop a bank from doing what it appears to be qualified to do? \nThey have to present evidence.\n  Here are four standards set by the Supreme Court as to what \n``substantial evidence'' means:\n  They have to present evidence that is understood to mean ``more than \na mere scintilla.''\n  That is a standard we are setting. You can't come in and stop a bank \nwith a consistent record of CRA compliance. You can't automatically \nstop, shut down, and delay the process unless you present evidence that \nis ``more than a mere scintilla.''\n  Unless you present such relevant evidence as a ``reasonable mind \nmight''--\n\n[[Page S4771]]\n\nnotice it didn't say ``would,'' but ``might''-- ``accept as adequate to \nsupport a claim.''\n  You have to present evidence that is real, material, not ``seeming or \nimaginary,'' and considerable in amount, value, and worth.\n  Why in the world would we stand by and allow a bank that has complied \nwith the law of the land and been evaluated three times in a row as \nbeing in compliance to be prevented from exercising a right they have \nearned unless somebody presents credible evidence, substantial \nevidence, to the contrary? I don't understand. Why would anybody be \nagainst this change?\n  I continue to be stunned that our colleagues talk about CRA and how \nwonderful it is. That is not what we are talking about.\n  Should you have to present some evidence if you are going to try to \ndeny people the rights they earned under the law? How can that be \nunfair? How can that be reaching? How can that be burdensome? Who could \nbe against that?\n  The second provision of the bill provides relief to small banks in \nrural areas. I have gone through the figures: $1.3 billion later, in \nthis decade of audits and costs imposed on the banks, three small rural \nbanks--three one-hundredths of 1 percent--are bad actors. Is that not \nregulatory overkill?\n  We have forced little banks, many with just 6 to 10 employees, to pay \n$1.3 billion in compliance costs, and in 16,380 examinations, only 3 of \nthem have been deemed to be substantially out of compliance. Does that \nmake sense? Is that crazy? Did I miss something?\n  I could read to you letter after letter. We have had 488 letters from \nbanks urging the committee to take this action. I have read them \nbefore; I will not do so again.\n  Finally, let me remind my colleagues that the amendment that is \npending doesn't just strike these two provisions--the ``integrity and \nrelevance'' provisions--it does far more than that. It would create a \nsituation where individual officers and directors of a bank could \npotentially be fined up to $1 million a day for noncompliance.\n  Remember, in these little banks you have 16,380 examinations over the \ndecade, and just 3 banks have been found to be substantially out of \ncompliance. What is the justification for this $1-million-a-day fine?\n  I have letters from the American Bankers Association, and from the \nIndependent Bankers Association, pointing out the obvious.\n  This provision that has been offered by our colleague from Nevada, \nand was offered in committee by Senator Sarbanes, will make it \nvirtually impossible for small banks to get quality directors, because \nwho can afford that potential liability? It will make it virtually \nimpossible for small banks, who can't buy the insurance to protect \npeople from liability, to hire quality bank officials.\n  The bill goes on and on and on in the most massive overkill of \nexpanding CRA to nonbanking activities. Currently, a bank can sell \ninsurance without CRA approval. This substitute that is now pending \nwould require CRA approval for that. Banks can sell securities without \nCRA approval. This takes CRA out of banking and into other areas.\n\n  What is the justification for that? The justification for requiring \nCRA was that banks have a federal subsidy through deposit insurance. So \nthat is public insurance, and making banks do things in the public \ninterest could be justified. But how does expanding that requirement \noutside banking make any sense? Are we simply going to keep writing \nlaws telling people what to do with this money?\n  Basically we have a choice. The choice is the following:\n  Both of these provisions concern CRA. The bill that was adopted by \nthe Banking Committee has two reforms--one an integrity provision, and \none a relevancy provision. The amendment that has been offered strikes \nboth of those reforms and imposes all of these new regulations.\n  So I think it is as clear a choice as you can make.\n  Just a couple of other points, and I will stop, because I know that \nothers want to speak. One of our colleagues quoted the Wall Street \nJournal. The Wall Street Journal has editorialized not once but twice \nin favor of the position the committee has taken here.\n  I urge my colleagues again to look at the debate--not get carried \naway or be confused by people who say the committee has gutted CRA, is \nkilling CRA, or is repealing CRA. We are not doing any of those things. \nBut we are dealing with abuses of CRA. They need to be dealt with. They \nscream out to be dealt with.\n  If I could make a plea to the other side, it would be a simple and \nshort plea: If we don't fix the abuses of CRA, by the time we are \nthrough letting people know what is happening in terms of these $9 \nbillion of cash payments, and by the time we finally do run down and \nknow where all of this money is going, and we find that much of it--or \nsome of it--is not being used to benefit people who are supposed to be \nbenefiting from community loans, I think it is going to undercut CRA.\n  If I were a strong proponent of CRA, I would be for these reforms, \nbecause they clean up a program that clearly has had an impact. But our \ncolleagues--as they did on welfare--it was abused and abused and abused \nand abused and abused. But they would never ever, ever, ever say that \nit should be fixed. Finally, the American people rose up and elected a \nnew Congress. We are probably in the majority because of their \nintransigence. So God does provide His services from time to time. And \nthen it was fixed. They probably could have had it closer to what they \nwanted had they been willing to fix it.\n  But the position we have heard today over and over is, never ever, \never, ever will we allow any change whatsoever, no matter how bad the \nabuse is in CRA.\n  I don't understand it. I think it is an extreme view. I hope that \neven yet, by the time we get through conference, by the time we have \nhad a chance to discuss this over many more times, perhaps there can be \na compromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Karen Brown of \nmy office, a fellow, be granted floor privileges during the \nconsideration of S. 900.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me for 2 \nminutes without losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. DODD. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have refrained from taking a lot of \ndebate time this afternoon, because a lot of our colleagues want to \nspeak. I recognize that. Of course, the temptation is very great to \nsort of rise every time the chairman of the committee speaks. He has \ndone that at some length here this afternoon. So I am not going to do \nit now, because I have colleagues here. I hope before we get to 7 \no'clock I will get a chance to have a few minutes to make a statement.\n  But I want to say that there is kind of an Alice-in-Wonderland \nquality to this debate. The chairman pulls these figures out of the \nair. I don't really know where they come from. I asked him where they \ncome from. He says there have been 16,000 something examinations of \nbanks under $100 million in nonmetropolitan areas.\n\n  I don't know where he gets that figure. The figure from the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation is 11,445. He says only 3 have been found \nin substantial noncompliance; the figure is 18, and another 320 have \nbeen found a need to improve. This chart is from the FDIC.\n  The Chairman says only three--it is not only three. I want to make \nthat point.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. These are figures from the interagency CRA rating.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator said earlier today that the cost this is \nimposing on small banks is $1.3 trillion.\n  I am thinking to myself, $1.3 trillion from these examinations? So I \nasked him, How did you get that figure? He took the number of \nexaminations--about which we have just disagreed--and he multiplied it \nby 80,000. I am not sure where he got the 80,000 figure. Someone must \nhave written in and said: That is what it costs our bank.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right, a small bank said that.\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I don't know any study that validates that figure as \nthe right figure.\n  Even assuming for the purpose of this Alice-in-Wonderland discussion \nthat both the number of exams and the costs which we were then told \ncame to a $1.3 trillion burden, the fact is, it is $1.3 billion. That \nis still a lot of money. I don't pretend to the contrary, but it is a \nlot different from $1.3 trillion. It was escalated 1,000 times.\n  Let me give one other example. We were told the CRA is allocating \nmore money each year than the gross domestic product of Canada. The CRA \ncommitments are over a 10-year period. Those commitments, factored out \nover a 10-year period, do not begin to approach the gross domestic \nproduct of Canada.\n  These are only a few examples. We could give a lot more. I want to \nunderscore these figures that come floating in out of the air, and we \nhear this long disquisition. When we start probing these figures, we \ndiscover it is not there; it is Alice in Wonderland.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bryan amendment. My \nfervent hope is that we can adopt this amendment and move on with \npassage of this bill. There are other outstanding issues that need to \nbe resolved. No issue is as galvanizing or as important as this issue \nof the Community Reinvestment Act and how it is to be handled.\n  My friend from Texas, the chairman of the committee, and I have \nworked very closely together over many years. We have been each other's \nchairman and ranking minority member, depending on who was in control \nof this August body. We have dealt with securities matters, we have \nwritten legislation together, passed it together here on the floor, \ncarried it through conference, overrode the President's veto--the only \ntime a veto by this President has been overridden.\n  It is not easy for me to disagree with a man with whom I have agreed \non many occasions in dealing with financial issues. However, on this we \nhave a fundamental disagreement. I listened for a good part of the \nchairman's presentation, especially the last part of the presentation \ndealing with the alleged abuses that have occurred. I know of nothing \nin the bill violating existing federal laws on extortion. We may do \nsome things in this bill Members do not want, but to the best of my \nknowledge the criminal code is left intact. Nowhere in this bill do we \ntouch on the issue of whether or not people are going to be excused \nfrom engaging in extortion, blackmail, green mail--call it what you \nwill.\n  The suggestion that there are serious violations of law--State and \nFederal that I know of--ought to be brought to the proper authorities. \nIf someone believes they have been extorted, then we have Federal \nprosecutors and State prosecutors to bring those matters to the light \nof day and those accused can be brought to the bar of justice.\n  Second, I have never known the banking community to be terribly shy \nabout things that they want. They are usually pretty vociferous. They \nare never reluctant to tell us how they want us to vote on matters that \naffect their institutions. They lobby quite effectively. They do a good \njob. The idea that the banking constituency, the thousands of banks all \nacross this country, are somehow afraid of some community-based groups, \nand would not bring to light their concerns because of fear of some \nretribution, just doesn't hold up when it comes to how the banking \ncommunity generally makes its concerns known.\n  The fact of the matter is, here on this issue there really is not a \nconstituency for the provisions in this bill dealing with CRA. Usually \nwe have a litany of organizations that are in favor of or against a \nprovision, organizations and groups which have felt outraged or \ndiscriminated against in some way and will stand up and defend in a \nvery loud and clear voice their rights or how their rights are being \ninfringed upon.\n  In the last almost 6 hours of debate, I defy anyone to show me a list \nof organizations here across the country that feel as though the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act is somehow a great infringement on their \nability to conduct their business. It is nonexistent. In fact, the only \ntime we have ever actually voted on these matters prior to today is \nwhen the House Banking Committee recently voted--51-8, Democrats and \nRepublicans, voted for provisions we are seeking here contained within \nthe Bryan amendment. The Banking Committee last year voted 16-2, \nDemocrats and Republicans, in favor of the provisions that we are \ntrying to reinsert into this legislation. There is overwhelming \nevidence from the Federal Reserve Board, the banking regulators, banks \nall across the country, that the Community Reinvestment Act is working, \nand working well.\n  Let me quickly add I have never met any institution which was overly \nenthusiastic about any regulation--State, local or Federal. They \nusually do not welcome these and I understand why. There is a cost \nassociated with it. I appreciate that they try to keep their costs \ndown.\n  Most banks, certainly in my State, have been active in our community \nand do a great deal of good. However, as the Presiding Officer who has \nbeen identified as a distinguished scholar of the legal codes of our \ncountry knows, we do not write laws for the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans who obey the law, who try to do the right thing. Laws are \nwritten for those who try to abuse what we believe is proper behavior. \nOnly a small percentage of Americans violate the law. But that is not \nan excuse for not writing laws, because, unfortunately, some do in fact \nbreak the law.\n  So when it comes to the Community Reinvestment Act, we seek here not \nto lay a burden on the overwhelming majority of banks who do a good \njob. We must recognize that there are institutions which have \ndiscriminated against various groups in this country based on race, \nreligion, ethnicity. So several years ago, we decided to enact the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act to require that lending institutions, \ndepository institutions, pay attention to our nation's underserved, pay \nattention to our small farmers, and pay attention to our small \nbusinesses. If you are going to do business in Alabama or business in \nConnecticut as a depository institution, we do not want you to neglect \nthe people in your communities, in your States, on any basis.\n  So we passed CRA and it has worked well. My colleague from Texas has \nsaid that there are extortionate practices ongoing. Let me quote him, \nfrom a statement made last October. The chairman of the committee said:\n\n       It has now become common practice in CRA for professional \n     protest groups to protest a bank's community service record \n     and in turn to use the leverage of those protests to extract \n     bribes, kickbacks, set-asides in purchases, quotas, hiring \n     and promotion, none of which has anything to do with CRA and \n     the lending practices of banks in the communities that they \n     serve.''\n  It is a pretty broad statement. Now, let me give you the facts. Mr. \nPresident, four-tenths of 1 percent--let me repeat that, four-tenths of \n1 percent of applications have resulted in agreements with community \ngroups; four-tenths of 1 percent have resulted in these agreements. We \nhave had them up here on placards and the easel here today. A great \namount of time has been spent talking about these outrageous provisions \nin these agreements. If one sort of casually tuned into the debate the \nassumption would be, as the Senator from Texas has said: It is common \npractice. Common practice? Four-tenths of 1 percent of all the \napplications? Under any estimation that is not a common practice, less \nthan 1 percent of all the applications.\n  During the past 21 years, there have been approximately 360 \nagreements reached. How many applications do you think there have been \nin the past 21 years? Mr. President, 86,000; 86,000 applications and \n360 agreements. When you stand up here for an hour and a half or so and \nlist these agreements that have been reached, you leave our colleagues \nand others with the impression that this has, to quote my friend from \nTexas, ``become common practice in CRA.'' That is an exaggeration. That \nis an extreme exaggeration.\n  I do not like what I heard in these agreements. It bothers me a bit. \nI would like to know more about it. A great deal of information was \nredacted. We do not have the whole agreement. But I tell my friend from \nTexas, I am concerned about it, too, and we ought to take a good look \nat this. Let us remember, however, that we ought to take a look at the \n360 agreements, and\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\nmany of those probably are proper and worthwhile agreements. In fact, \nmany lenders also require counseling for certain loan practices because \nthey improve the quality of loans. To meet commitments, banks sometimes \nprovide payments to community groups for services provided. It is not \nsome outrageous behavior. It goes on all the time. But, nonetheless, if \nproblems exist, let's look at them.\n  But with all due respect to my good friend from Texas, it appears as \nthough we were sort of squirrel hunting with a machine gun here. That \nis not what his amendment or the language of the bill does. All we are \nsaying here is we want to preserve the Community Reinvestment Act in a \nnew financial framework. This modernization bill allows for the \nconsolidation of financial services. If we are going to do that--and I \nthink we should, I am a strong supporter of it--then it seems to me we \nshould be preserving the Community Reinvestment Act to ensure that we \ndo not have discrimination in lending. We must ensure that Hispanics, \nAfrican Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, as well as \nsmall businesses and small farmers, are not going to get short shrift. \nWe are going to have a lot of large institutions, a lot of large banks. \nWe want to make sure the average citizen is not going to find himself \nor herself denied fair access to credit. That is what the Community \nReinvestment Act has been able to do for millions of Americans.\n  I listened to my colleague from Massachusetts and others here today \ngo over the statistics of how vastly the availability of credit has \nincreased to groups who in the past were denied those opportunities. We \nin this country cherish the notion of equal opportunity. We have never \nachieved the perfection that our Constitution and our Founding Fathers \nsought in creating equal opportunity for every citizen in this country, \nregardless of where they come from or the color of their skin. We all \nknow, painfully, the discrimination that existed for a long time in all \nparts of our country.\n  Let me reiterate--all parts of our country. I could take you to the \nNortheast. You do not have to go to the home of my friends from the \nSouth in this country to find discrimination in lending. In \nConnecticut, a year or two ago, you could see the redlining that went \non. People talked about this being a southern issue. That is untrue. I \ncould take you to places all across this land where redlining occurred, \nwhere neighborhoods and communities were denied equal opportunity. If \nthey are creditworthy people, they ought to get the credit and \nfinancing to buy a home, start a business, and get on their feet. \nBecause of these discriminatory practices, we passed the Community \nReinvestment Act. It has made quite a difference in our country. It is \nnot a perfect condition yet, but we have reached into the communities \nof people who never had a chance before and they have a chance today.\n\n  Now we are going to allow these institutions to affiliate, and engage \nin new financial activities. With this legislation, are we now going to \ndeny them the very benefit that the Community Reinvestment Act has \nafforded during the past 22 years? I do not think we ought to deprive \nthem of that.\n  That is what the Bryan amendment attempts to address in part. It says \nwe ought not to exclude certain creditworthy consumers in the process \nof allowing banks to expand in these new financial areas. To suggest \nthat the extortion of banks by community groups is somehow a common \npractice--again, four-tenths of 1 percent, 360 applications out of \n86,000, is not legitimate. Under anyone's estimation, that is not \njustification for weakening the Community Reinvestment Act in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Again, there is no constituency here. Most people, I think most of my \ncolleagues from all across this country, believe the Community \nReinvestment Act is doing a good job. Nobody here wants to be on the \nside of an equation that says: Having made these gains now we are going \nto turn back the clock. We should not do that. I do not believe the \npeople who have communicated with us, who write us--bankers, \nconsumers--said that.\n  One of the things we need to keep in mind as we talk about banking \nlegislation and financial institutions in general, is that one of our \nmajor responsibilities is to ensure that our nation's financial \ninstitutions are going to work well. So we pay a lot of attention to \ntheir needs, as we should. But we also need to pay attention to the \npeople who do business with our financial institutions. They are an \nimportant part of the equation here as well. Let us not forget the \npeople who show up at that bank window, who go in nervous about whether \nor not they can get a home loan. Let us not forget the person with a \ngood idea to start a business who needs to know if that local banker \nwill take a chance on him, back him, give him a chance to get on his \nfeet. Those are our constituents, too. They are a fundamental part of \nthis equation.\n  It is not just the person behind the grate; it is the person in front \nof the grate, too, who we have an obligation to watch out for when we \npass financial services modernization legislation. It is those people \nout there tonight who would like to start a new business, buy a new \nhome, get a chance to share in the American dream. And the Community \nReinvestment Act has been the engine for many achieving those desired \nresults.\n  Again, in the past, we have seen votes of support on CRA by our \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans. It would be a great pity, \nindeed, for this bill to fail over this issue.\n  It would be a great pity, indeed. This issue ought not to be the one \nthat causes this bill either to be defeated or to be vetoed by a \nPresident and sent back after all the years we tried to get this done.\n  We are 240 days away from the next millennium, the year 2000. The \nworld and its financial markets are getting more complicated. The \nUnited States of America has always been a leader in financial \nservices. I do not want to see us lag behind because we couldn't come \nto terms with what is essentially a fundamental civil rights issue. I \ndo not want to see us lose our leadership role in the global \nmarketplace because we decided we were not going to expand the equal \nopportunities that are so much a part of this country's heritage. I am \nconcerned that we are willing to give up all the other things we are \ntrying to achieve in financial modernization over CRA provisions that \nare not supported by the banks they purport to help.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I will include in the Record, and others have \nalready, countless statements from many others-- the Federal Reserve \nChairman, the Treasury, and major banks in all parts of this country \nwho have said the Community Reinvestment Act is working. Sometimes \nconflicts occur; it is difficult. Sometimes we have two groups we \nadmire and support, that are fighting hard for their points of view, \nand we are asked to make a choice between them. That can be a hard \ndecision.\n  This is not a hard decision. There is no one on the other side of \nthis equation. Yet we are dangerously close to killing an otherwise \ngreat bill that does a lot of good things.\n  As I said a moment ago, we have an obligation to make sure our \nfinancial institutions are strong. We have an obligation as well to see \nto it that the users of these financial institutions are not going to \nbe adversely affected by legislation we pass.\n  Let me focus for a second on the small, rural bank exemption that is \nincluded in this bill. The bill exempts rural banks with less than $100 \nmillion in assets from the requirement of CRA. This exemption addresses \nthat there is some undue burden imposed on small banks complying with \nCRA, and there may be some merit in that. But the provision in this \nbill which the Bryan amendment would take out exempts 76 percent of \nrural banks from CRA, 38 percent of all the banks and thrifts in the \nUnited States.\n  Again, I can understand if you just hate CRA, you just think it is a \nbad idea and we ought to get rid of it. Then I accept that--I disagree \nwith it, but I accept your position. But if you believe CRA makes a \ndifference and it actually helps rural people have greater access to \nfair credit, then you must acknowledge that this bill exempts 76 \npercent of rural banks in this country. Virtually one out of every \nthree banks in the country will be exempt from CRA. That seems to me to \ngo too far.\n  CRA loans in rural areas assist small farmers in obtaining credit. \nSmall bankers have historically received\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\nlower CRA ratings, quite candidly, than larger banks and have invested \nless in their communities. On average, 50 percent of large banks have a \nloan-to-deposit ratio below 70 percent. 25 percent of small banks have \na loan-to-deposit ratio of less than 58 percent.\n  The supporters of the small bank exemption contend the CRA creates an \nonerous regulatory burden. However, the federal banking regulators \nspecifically reduced the regulatory burden on banks when the new CRA \nenforcement rules went into effect 3 years ago. These efforts \nstreamlined CRA, facilitated easier compliance by lenders, and reduced \npaperwork requirements.\n  Addressing the specific point the Senator from Texas made that \nsometimes these banks have a few employees--and, again, I do not want \nto overload that small bank--in 1996 we streamlined that process \nconsiderably for them.\n  If there are some other ideas that will help achieve that, I think we \nought to listen to them. Again, think not only about the 8 or 10 \nemployees of that small bank, but think about those small farmers who \ndo not have any other choice but to do business at that bank. Small \ncommunities do not give you much of a choice. Your local farmers in \nAlabama or Connecticut have one bank to go to. It is not like living in \nNew York City or Washington, DC, where you can walk down the street and \ncompare which bank will give you the better deal.\n\n  Under this bill, if you have only one bank window to go to, and you \nare living in rural America, you will be told that your bank is exempt \nfrom having to see to it that you are going to be dealt with fairly. \nThere is something seriously wrong here.\n  Streamlining the process for rural small banks is something I \napplaud; it is something we ought to move ahead on to make it easier. I \ndo not want people to be denied options, denied choices, and to be \ndiscriminated against when it comes to getting the credit they need.\n  According to Christopher Williston, the president of the Independent \nBankers Association of Texas:\n\n       Most small banks are really very accustomed to complying \n     with CRA. . .. Now they know exactly what the regulators are \n     looking for, many of my members would say CRA is here and I \n     can live with it.\n\n  Mr. President, again, if there are specific problems with the \nimplementation of CRA, if there are certain activities that should be \nconsidered that are not considered, then the appropriate way to address \nthose specific concerns is to work with the regulators or come up with \na specific legislative approach.\n  The Senator from Texas, our distinguished chairman, should remember \nour conversations to address this and have some hearings to look into \nthe issues he raised.\n  Again, don't exaggerate and turn four-tenths of 1 percent of the \napplications into a common practice, and then miss the opportunity to \ninclude reasonable CRA provisions in this consolidation of financial \nservices.\n  I hope there will be enough votes on the other side to support the \nBryan amendment. I am fearful if we do not do so, this bill is doomed. \nI mentioned at the outset of my remarks the other day that my colleague \nfrom Maryland and I have been at this together for the full 18 years I \nhave served in the Senate. He has been at it longer than that, having \nserved a bit longer than I have in the Senate. Nothing--nothing--would \nmake me happier than to pass this bill and expand and consolidate \nfinancial services to serve consumers' needs and keep America in a \nleadership position on these issues.\n  However, I cannot support a bill that turns its back on my \nconstituents at home. I want to help my financial institutions in \nConnecticut. I want to help banks across the country. But I cannot, in \ndoing so, turn the clock back on the gains, on the strengthening of \nAmerica that we have made with the Community Reinvestment Act.\n  Whatever shortcomings it has--and I am certain they are there, CRA is \nnot perfect--let's fix the shortcomings. Let's deal with those, but do \nnot deprive people in this country of the increased opportunities. We \nhave a CRA bill on the books that has worked well, even by those who \nmust bear the burden of implementing these regulations. We must no \nplace in jeopardy an otherwise fine bill that, in my opinion, deserves \nbroad-based support in this Chamber and the other body.\n  I hope that we will stand at 7 p.m. tonight when the votes are cast, \nin what may be the only civil rights vote of this Congress, and the \nBryan amendment will be adopted. Maybe other civil rights votes will \ncome along, but as of right now, this will be the only test as to where \npeople stand when it comes to seeing that equal opportunity in America \nis going to be at least preserved in this Congress and not set back.\n  I hope at 7 o'clock, when the vote begins and as Members come to the \nChamber to cast their ballots, they will keep in mind the importance of \nthis bill. And to a far greater extent, keep in mind those who depend \nupon us to see to it that they are going to have equal opportunity in \nAmerica, a chance to participate in the American dream in the 21st \ncentury, and will not be denied because of an action we take tonight by \ndenying the preservation of CRA in a new financial services framework.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened to this debate with some \ninterest. I have enormous respect for members of the Banking Committee \non which I have served since I came to the Senate. I know there is good \nintention on both sides of the issue, on both sides of the aisle.\n  I echo the comments of the chairman of the committee in that much of \nthe debate that I have heard has been focused on the wrong issue; that \nis, you would think that this was an attempt on the part of the \nmajority in the committee to repeal CRA. I do not condone redlining. I \nrecognize that the decision which was made by the Congress in 1977 to \ncreate CRA was motivated by a genuine abuse that required a genuine \nFederal fix.\n  At the same time, I recognize also that under Secretary Rubin's \nleadership, attempts have been made to alleviate the regulatory burden \nof CRA, that there has been a recognition on the part of this \nadministration--I think belatedly, but nonetheless I will accept it \nwhenever I can get it--a recognition that CRA has gotten out of hand \nand has become, in some instances, a paperwork burden that is \nnonproductive and anticompetitive and puts an undue burden on places \nwhere it should not be.\n  The question is not, Should we abolish CRA? The answer to that is \nclearly no. The question is not, Should we turn our backs on those \npeople who have been benefited by CRA? The answer to that is no.\n  The question is, Can we streamline CRA, as we are going through the \nprocess of modernizing our financial institutions, in a way that \nrecognizes the reality of the marketplace? And there the answer is yes.\n  One of the criticisms which has been made, and I think with some \njustification, is that a good part of the debate has been anecdotal; \nthat is, one situation has been described, and we extrapolate from \nthat, and then another has been described, and we extrapolate from \nthat.\n  I agree with those members of the committee who have suggested at \nsome point it would be well for the committee to have hearings on the \nwhole CRA matter and examine it at great detail. I think that is a \nsalutary thing to do.\n  But we have an opportunity here in this bill to take some steps which \nI consider to be relatively modest and relatively straightforward. The \none I want to focus on is the exemption of CRA, the CRA requirement for \ninstitutions that have $100 million or less in aggregate assets.\n  I want to share with the Senate the reaction of banks from my home \nState that have been contacted about this. And this is their \ninformation. This is not some professor at some university. This is the \neveryday banker doing business in the everyday community. And I will go \nbeyond simply quoting the letters because I want to put it in context \nso you can understand the market.\n  I have said around here before--and undoubtedly in the spirit of the \nSenate where there is no such thing as repetition--I will say, again, \nthat if I could control what we engrave in the marble around here to \nremind us of our duty--not to denigrate the marvelous phrases\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\nthat are here--I would have engraved in stone, at least in our \ncommittee rooms, the phrase: ``You cannot repeal the law of supply and \ndemand.''\n  We try to do that continually in Congress. We try to think that \nmarkets do not matter, that governments are smarter than markets, that \ngovernments can make decisions that interfere with the law of supply \nand demand and produce beneficial results with no side effects. People \nhave been trying to do that in government not only for centuries but \nfor millennia. And they always fail.\n  Here are the market realities with respect to CRA.\n  I first quote from a letter of the Cache Valley Bank. No one in this \nChamber knows where Cache Valley is; but I know where Cache Valley is. \nI have spent a lot of time there. My family has done business there. We \nhave owned a business there. The president of the Cache Valley Bank \nsays in his letter:\n\n       Our community is a middle class farming community with a \n     university. Most all of our customers are of modest income, \n     small businesses and small farms. The rich professionals have \n     gravitated to the local credit unions where they know they \n     can get something for nothing.\n\n  That last sentence indicates how he feels about the competitive \nimpact of credit unions in Cache Valley.\n  He says:\n\n       We are chartered to serve our community. We have no \n     business going outside our community. We live off the ability \n     to say we are a hometown institution.\n\n  Let me underscore that last sentence again. ``We live off the ability \nto say we are a hometown institution.''\n  In Cache Valley, there are branches of large banks, large banks that \nare located someplace else. There are, as an earlier somewhat sarcastic \ncomment indicated, credit unions. They happen to be very large credit \nunions. We have some of the largest credit unions in the United States \nin Utah because of Utah's law. There is competition in Cache Valley for \nthe banking customer.\n  How does he deal with that competition? He says:\n\n       My bank is . . . a $90 million institution operating from \n     one office . . .\n\n  One office--so he does not have branches around the city. The credit \nunion does. He does not have the reach of advertising that the large \nbanks which are there as his competition do. He has one office. And he \nmakes his living advertising himself as a hometown institution.\n  This, in marketing, is what is known as a marketing niche. He \nrecognizes that he cannot compete with the big banks throughout the \nentire city. He recognizes that he has a particular niche in the market \nthat he can fill, and he goes after it and he fills it.\n  He says:\n\n       We do what the CRA regulation intended us to do because it \n     makes good sense. The documentation and time spent telling \n     the regulators that that is what we do is just wasted by both \n     us and the regulators. I have never had a customer come in \n     and ask to see our CRA file.\n\n  Then, with the optimism that comes from every small businessman, he \nsays:\n\n       As I will probably [pass] the $100 million proposed limit \n     some day, I can see that not having to comply would give \n     smaller institutions a slight advantage from costs they would \n     save. The real issue is if the whole rule for community \n     oriented institutions makes any sense. It doesn't and no one \n     has provided any evidence that it does.\n\n  He is not operating in a vacuum. He is not operating in a situation \nwhere there is no credit available to anybody else if he does not serve \nhis niche. He is operating in a highly competitive situation, and yet \nhe is examined as if he is the only institution, and he is looked at in \nterms of his lending to his market niche.\n  All right. Let me go down the highway a little from Cache Valley to \nthe First National Bank of Morgan. This is a smaller bank. This is a \nsmaller community. The president of this bank says that they have $37 \nmillion in current assets. They serve a county, the population of which \nis approximately 7,000. In Utah, given our family size, a total \npopulation of 7,000 means that there are probably about 2,000 families \nthere. I do not know how many of those are borrowers. This is a \nrelatively small base for him to serve.\n  Once again, while it is an isolated farming community, in today's \nmodern world there is competition there. The big banks can go after his \ncustomers on the Internet if they want. They can open ATM stations or \nput branches there, if they want. There is a big bank just down the \nhighway, within 20 miles of this small institution. How does he survive \nunder these competitive conditions? He survives by serving the \ncommunity. This is what he has to say:\n\n       Exempting our institution from CRA requirements would allow \n     bank personnel to spend more time with our customers in \n     developing new products rather than gathering information to \n     satisfy CRA documentation requirements. Competition is the \n     greatest enforcer of CRA. The delivery of financial services \n     is a highly competitive business. If my institution is not \n     offering free checking or mortgage loans, then my competitor \n     down the road will be taking advantage of my financial \n     institution's shortcomings.\n\n  I think he is absolutely right. In today's competitive world, you do \nnot operate in a vacuum. If he wasn't doing his job, even though he is \nin a small, rural community, with Internet banking and advertising over \ntelevision, the large institutions would come in.\n  It is interesting, again, referring to Utah's somewhat unique \nsituation, in many communities where the local bank was perceived as \nhaving something of a monopoly or a free ride in the community because \nof the physical isolation, it was not another bank that came in to \noffer competition; it was a credit union, operating under Utah's credit \nunion laws. The competition produced the kinds of challenges that \ncompetition always produces. Once again, you cannot repeal the law of \nsupply and demand. If there was demand in that community that was not \nbeing met by the local institution, competition came in and met it.\n  Now, a little further down the highway, I want to refer to the \nFrontier Bank of Park City. Here the president of the bank says:\n\n       As president of a nonmetropolitan community bank, I am of \n     the opinion that existing CRA regulations are largely \n     superfluous for both my institution and its direct \n     competitors. The fact remains that we have and will continue \n     to lend to all segments of our community because it is good \n     business, not because it has been defined by regulation. \n     Additionally, the time spent documenting our community \n     lending efforts for regulatory purposes is in itself \n     counterproductive as we could instead redirect our energies \n     towards additional lending and community development \n     activities.\n\n  An interesting quote, Mr. President. He feels that CRA gets in the \nway of community developing activities that he would otherwise engage \nin.\n  When I first went on the Banking Committee, some 6 years ago, I had \nnever heard of the CRA. I heard at that time institutions coming in and \ncomplaining that the CRA documentation burden was overwhelming and that \nCRA had become more of a documentation issue than it had been a lending \nissue, that if they could fill out the documents in such a way as to \nsatisfy the regulators, it didn't matter what their lending practices \nwere.\n  We had some testimony--I can't go back and put my hand on it now--\nthat made it clear that CRA was failing in its purpose to produce a \nmeaningful impact for those in need in communities where they were not \ngetting served.\n  I am hoping that the reforms established by Secretary Rubin have \nbegun to lift that burden and change that situation, but I am satisfied \nnow that we have enough evidence that indicates that the vast majority \nof small banks with capitalization under $100 million are spending \ntheir time on CRA, filling out documents and meeting with regulators, \nspending their time performing the bureaucratic chores necessary to \nfile a report, where they could be spending their time better serving \ntheir communities.\n  Therefore, I will vote to see to it that the language that was \nadopted in the committee report remains there. I will oppose the Bryan \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Community \nReinvestment Act. The CRA was enacted in 1977 to encourage banks to \nserve the credit needs of the entire community including low and middle \nincome areas. The obligations that banks owe to the entire community \nstem from their charters and the public benefits they receive through \nthe Federal Reserve. The CRA is a way to encourage banks to live up to \ntheir public obligation.\n  Nationwide the CRA has been recognized as an effective way to \nincrease credit availability in underserved\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\nareas. In his testimony before the House Banking Committee in February, \nFederal Reserve Chairman Greenspan remarked, that the CRA has ``very \nsignificantly increased the amount of credit in communities'' and the \nchanges have been ``quite profound.'' In 1997 alone, almost 2,000 banks \nand thrifts reported $64 billion in CRA loans, including 525,000 small \nbusiness loans worth $34 billion; 213,000 small farm loans totaling $11 \nbillion; and 25,000 community development loans totaling $19 billion. \nThose loans went to affordable housing projects, economic development \nthrough financing small businesses or farms, and activities that \nrevitalize or stabilize low or moderate income areas. CRA has also \nencouraged a dramatic increase in home ownership by low and moderate \nincome individuals. Between 1993 and 1997, private sector conventional \nhome mortgage lending in low and moderate income census tracts \nincreased by 45%.\n  And the CRA has done so without forcing a large paperwork burden onto \nbanks and without forcing banks to make bad loans. During the same \nHouse hearing, Chairman Greenspan alluded to the mutual benefit of the \nCRA to consumers and banks when he said, ``CRA has helped financial \ninstitutions to discover new markets that may have been underserved \nbefore.''\n  While there are countless examples of the Act's effectiveness in \nencouraging lending in underserved areas all over the country. Here's \nsome examples from Michigan. Lake Osceola State Bank in Baldwin just \ncompleted their CRA exam under the reformed 1996 regulations. They said \nit was not a burden, and they received a rating of outstanding. Under \nthe terms of S. 900, the bill before us today, Lake Osceola State Bank \nwould qualify for an exemption from the CRA because of their size and \nlocation, but the bank has told my office that they are not seeking a \nCRA exemption. To the contrary, they are justifiably proud of the \ncontributions they are making to community development in the Baldwin \narea.\n  We Care, Inc. is a small non-profit that rehabilitates a few houses a \nyear in Detroit's Van Dyke and 7 Mile area. They say the CRA and \nNational City Bank have been their life-line for credit.\n  Northwest Detroit Neighborhood Development, Inc. is yet another \nnonprofit organization that has contacted me in support of the CRA. \nThey praised the National Bank of Detroit and Comerica for extending \ncredit to them and supporting their mission of homebuilding in the \nBrightmore area of Detroit.\n  The Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), a nationally \nprominent community development group that operates in five Michigan \ncities, considers the CRA critical to their efforts. In an effort to \nboost their CRA scores, lenders have sought out groups like LISC and \nthe Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation to develop ``shared risk'' \nloan pools that offer financing to first time home buyers. Over the \npast 5 years, more than 400 mortgages were written in six Michigan \ncities. This has generated over $16 million in direct public and \nprivate investment in central city neighborhoods. According to LISC, \nwithout the CRA ``these types of programs would not have been \nestablished.'' Other Michigan community development groups like U-SNAP-\nBAC, SWAN and New Hope also rely on loans encouraged by the CRA.\n  Many Michigan mayors have expressed their support for the CRA. They \npraise the CRA for encouraging private business investment and creating \nnew jobs and businesses in their communities. In addition, money from \nfederal grants is leveraged to obtain millions of dollars in private \ninvestment. There are twelve mayors from all over Michigan on this \nletter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors supporting the CRA. I oppose \nthe provisions weakening the CRA included in S. 900, a bill intended to \nmodernize the financial sector of our economy. Both small and large \nbanks in Michigan have received outstanding CRA ratings. The community \ngroups and nonprofits make great use of the resources which are made \navailable through the CRA. The federal independent agency that oversees \nthe nation's banking system says its not onerous and has been very \nsuccessful. Therefore, I will not support a bill that weakens a program \nthat has been so important to community development efforts in Michigan \nand nationally.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Bryan \namendment. While my comments today will be brief, my conviction on the \nissue of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is strong.\n  CRA came into being in 1977 thanks to my Wisconsin colleague, Senator \nBill Proxmire. While there's been talk of CRA as merely an urban \nconcern, in fact, it has enriched and addressed inequities in both \nurban and rural areas in Wisconsin and across the country. We are all \nfamiliar with the numbers--more than $1 trillion in community \ndevelopment, small business and home mortgage loans--to communities \nthat were once deemed unworthy.\n  CRA has been, and remains, vital to our common efforts of ensuring \nthat credit is extended to all Americans without prejudice. But CRA \nlending has also proven that the ability and willpower of a borrower is \noften just as important, if not more important, than a loan \ndetermination based solely on income or economic history. In other \nwords, new and innovative lending inspired by CRA has promoted \nfairness, but also made good business sense and delivered profits to \nlending institutions. And, fortunately, we've made substantial progress \nat making CRA compliance less burdensome.\n  While impressive, this progress has not reduced the need for an \neffective CRA. In 1977, Senator Proxmire's legislation was timely and \nappropriate, but in 1999, it has proven timeless and visionary. We are \ncontemplating an era of more diversified, and potentially bigger, \nactors in the financial marketplace--one in which vigilance to ensure \nfair lending is all the more important. Overall, with adequate safety \nand soundness protections and an effective CRA, this new financial \nmarketplace will yield benefits for consumers--more financial products \ndelivered more conveniently and rapidly and at a better price.\n  I strongly support financial modernization and want to help send a \nsignable, bipartisan and well-balanced piece of legislation to the \nPresident's desk. Last year, we secured a compromise bill that passed \nout of Committee by a vote of 16 to 2 that would have had my support. \nIt is regrettable that this year we find this legislation and the \nfinancial industry held hostage to a counterproductive agenda to scale \nback CRA.\n  Financial modernization is about moving forward, paving the way for \nmarketplace innovation and consumer benefits. But Senator Gramm's bill \nand his proposed CRA restrictions move us backward. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Bryan amendment and ensure that CRA will \nremain strong and viable for all American communities, whether urban or \nrural, in the new financial era that we hope to create.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support for \npreserving current law with regard to the Community Reinvestment Act \n(CRA) and striking the provisions of S. 900 which will harm this \nimportant and worthwhile program. CRA was enacted in 1977 to help \nprevent ``redlining'' of poor neighborhoods by banks, which denied \nloans to residents and businesses in those areas.\n  For more than twenty years, CRA has been a key means of increasing \ncapital and credit to underdeveloped areas through market based loans. \nCRA has created jobs and contributed to the economic revitalization of \nmany depressed urban and rural areas. It has been a force for the \ncapital needed to increase home ownership and business development. CRA \nhas contributed greatly toward the revitalization of many areas, \nhelping to generate an estimated one trillion dollars in lending over \n22 years. Put simply, CRA is good public policy.\n  Mr. President, community groups, housing groups, farm groups, \nminority groups, civil rights groups, mayors and rural organizations \nall support a vibrant CRA and are opposed to S. 900's CRA provisions.\n  In my State of Iowa, many rural residents remain in desperate need of \naffordable capital, especially during the farm crisis gripping the mid-\nWest. Under S. 900, as it is now written, 276 of the 325 banks and \nthrifts in rural Iowa counties would be exempt from CRA requirements. \nThat's 85 percent of all the\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\nrural banks in Iowa. If the provision exempting banks under 100 million \ndollars in assets remains, the benefits of CRA would not be available \nto a large share of the rural communities in Iowa.\n  I have here a letter from the Iowa Coalition for Housing and the \nHomeless, which describes the importance CRA has for our communities. \nIt reads, in part, ``Through increasing the access to capital and \ncredit, CRA provides a market-based solution for economic \nrevitalization and even job creation. A strong and vibrant CRA has \nmeant that hundreds of billions worth of new home mortgage loans and \nsmall business loans have been made in low and moderate income, urban \nand rural communities throughout the country in the past several \nyears.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would just like to mention briefly the \nCRA reforms already in place to protect small and rural banks. In 1995, \nnew regulations dramatically simplified the CRA exam process for small \nbanks under 250 million dollars in assets. Under the new rules, small \nbanks are not subject to the lending, investment and service tests \napplied to large institutions. Additionally, for small banks, examiners \nlook at only five factors: loan to deposit ratio; percentage of loans \ninside bank's CRA assessment area; record of lending to borrowers of \ndifferent income levels and businesses of different sizes; geographic \ndistribution of loans; and a bank's record of taking action in response \nto written complaints about its CRA performance. Finally, small banks \nare not subject to any data collection requirements for CRA. So, we \nhave already addressed these issues. This Senator would certainly \nwelcome hearings on the current state of those reforms and their \neffectiveness. In fact, I would ask the Banking Chairman to consider \nholding such hearings on CRA before we make changes to an important and \neffective program.\n  Mr. President, CRA has provided jobs, helped our economy to grow, and \nensured all of our citizens are considered for loans based on their \nfinancial history, not their address. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport removal of these provisions.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                        Iowa Coalition for Housing\n\n\n                                             and the Homeless,\n\n                                      Des Moines, IA, May 3, 1999.\n     Rep. Tom Latham,\n     Cannon House Office Building,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Congressman Latham: As organizations that work with \n     and on behalf of low-income and homeless individuals, we join \n     today to share our concerns regarding the proposed financial \n     modernization legislation currently being considered in \n     Congress. By combating discrimination and promoting bank-\n     community partnerships, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) \n     extends the American dream of home and small business \n     ownership to millions of Americans. Without this sustained \n     access to capital and credit, our neighborhoods die. We ask \n     that you support a strong CRA and the benefits it has brought \n     our communities.\n       Through increasing the access to capital and credit, CRA \n     provides a market-based solution for economic revitalization \n     and even job creation. A strong and vibrant CRA has meant \n     that hundreds of billions worth of new home mortgage loans \n     and small business loans have been made in the low- and \n     moderate-income urban and rural communities throughout the \n     country in the past several years. Any bill that threatens to \n     eviscerate the effectiveness and application of CRA will only \n     destroy this promotion of wealth creation and entrepreneurial \n     development in minority and working-class neighborhoods. \n     While the various versions of financial modernization that \n     have been introduced and contemplated may not directly attack \n     CRA, they will eventually undermine the law by preventing its \n     evolution with the rapid changes in the financial industry.\n       The current versions of financial modernization only \n     demonstrate its fundamental problem: the ability of financial \n     conglomerates to offer loans through their holding company \n     affiliates, without having to conform to CRA requirements. \n     Stated simply, holding companies will be able to shift assets \n     from CRA-covered banks to mortgage and insurance companies, \n     securities firms, and other institutions exempt from CRA-like \n     requirements. Banks, therefore, will be left with fewer \n     resources with which to make affordable housing economic \n     development, and small business loans. If any financial \n     modernization bill fails to extend CRA to the lending and \n     bank services activities of  mortgage companies and other \n     non-depository affiliates, CRA will cover an ever-\n     shrinking amount of traditional banking products and \n     services.\n       In addition to the expansion of CRA, financial \n     modernization could further serve low-income consumers if it \n     improved upon data disclosure requirements. Such data \n     disclosure requirements help communities identify missed \n     market opportunities and eliminate discriminatory practices. \n     These requirements help leverage reinvestment by making \n     financial institutions publicly accountable to serve all \n     borrowers in a fair and equitable manner. Insurance companies \n     and others affiliating with banks should be required to \n     report data on policies and services issued by income and \n     race and small business data should include the race and \n     gender of the borrower as well as the neighborhood in which \n     the business is located.\n       We would also urge you to fight attempts to directly attack \n     or weaken CRA; specifically, proposals such as safe harbors, \n     small bank exemptions, and ``anti-greenmail'' bills or \n     amendments. Mergers and acquisitions can disrupt the lives of \n     thousands of citizens in a community through job losses, \n     closing of offices, decreases in lending, and higher fees. \n     CRA reviews are critical to ensure that lenders involved in \n     mergers can preserve their CRA performance after such \n     enormous institutional changes. Moreover, affected citizens \n     ought to have the right to speak up and have their concerns \n     addressed before a merger application is approved, regardless \n     of the pre-merger CRA ratings.\n       Small bank exemptions would also be extremely harmful to \n     communities because they eliminate community reinvestment \n     requirements for most of the banks in the country. Small \n     towns and rural areas that depend on these banks for home and \n     small business lending would only suffer a new round of \n     credit and capital flight. as proposed, the current \n     legislation would exempt small rural banks under $100 million \n     in assets from CRA altogether. Almost 40% of all lenders in \n     the country will then have no obligation to serve minority \n     and working-class neighborhoods. Seventy-two percent of all \n     rural banks would be exempt from CRA. In Iowa, this exemption \n     would include 85% of the lenders in non-metropolitan areas, \n     many of whom enjoy a near monopoly in their service areas.\n       It would be detrimental to the wealth-building efforts in \n     this country to pass a financial modernization bill that \n     would halt community reinvestment progress by failing to keep \n     CRA on pace with the evolution in the financial industry. \n     Congress has required that banks serve ``the convenience and \n     needs'' of the communities in which they are chartered \n     because of the vital role they play in our lives. We believe \n     that this same standard should be applied to the entire \n     financial industry. A financial modernization bill that \n     carefully modernizes the Community Reinvestment Act to the \n     entire financial industry could have a profound effect in \n     democratizing access to credit and capital accumulation tools \n     in our society. Clearly, that would be good for America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Sandi Murphy,\n                                                  Policy Director.\n       The organizations listed below support the position of the \n     Iowa Coalition for Housing and the Homeless and strongly \n     encourage you to oppose the current financial modernization \n     legislation and demand a strong, and protected, CRA.\n       John Boyne, United Action for Youth, Street Outreach, Iowa \n     City.\n       Crissy Canganelli, Emergency Housing Project of Iowa City.\n       Jan Capaccioli, Domestic Violence Intervention Program.\n       Amy Covreia, Iowa City, Iowa.\n       Mike Coverdale, Iowa Community Action Network.\n       Bill Holvoet, Southeast Iowa Community Action.\n       Greg Jaudon, Iowa Homeless Youth Centers.\n       Gene Jones, Des Moines Coalition for the Homeless.\n       Mike Kratz, Veteran Affairs Medical Center.\n       Lora J.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Bryan CRA \namendment. This amendment would strike the small bank exemption and the \nCRA safe harbor provisions included in S. 900 and require banks to have \na ``satisfactory'' CRA rating as a condition for engaging in the \nexpanded powers allowed under this bill.\n  The language of this amendment is similar to language that was \nincluded in the financial modernization bill which passed the House and \nSenate Banking Committee by a vote of 16 to 2 last year and which \nenjoyed broad industry support. Similar language has also been \nincorporated in the H.R. 10 bill that recently passed the House Banking \nCommittee and is pending in the House Commerce Committee.\n  In short, the Community Reinvestment Act requires financial \ninstitutions to meet the credit needs of the\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\nlocal communities in which they are chartered, including low- and \nmoderate-income communities, consistent with safe and sound practices. \nLet me reiterate, CRA requires banks to make credit-worthy loans. It \ndoes not require banks to make bad loans.\n  Despite this fact, some have argued that CRA is tantamount to \ngovernment-mandated credit allocation. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. Neither the Act nor its regulations specify the number of \nloans, the type of loans, or the parties to CRA loans. To the contrary, \nCRA relies on market forces and private sector ingenuity to promote \ncommunity lending. This is evidenced by the tremendous flexibility that \nfinancial institutions have in satisfying CRA. For example, loans to \nlow-income individuals; loans to nonprofits serving primarily low- and \nmoderate-income housing needs; loans to financial intermediaries such \nas Community Development Financial Institutions; and loans to local, \nstate, and tribal governments may qualify for CRA coverage. Moreover, \nloans to finance environmental clean-up or redevelop industrial sites \nin low- and moderate-income areas also qualify as CRA loans.\n  In addition to lending, CRA is satisfied through investments by \nfinancial institutions in organizations engaged in affordable housing \nrehabilitation, and facilities that promote community development such \nas child care centers, homeless centers, and soup kitchens.\n  Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has weighed in on this \nissue, arguing, ``The essential purpose of the CRA is to try to \nencourage institutions who are not involved in areas where their own \nself-interest is involved, in doing so. If you are indicating to an \ninstitution that there is a foregone business opportunity in an area X \nor loan product Y, that is not credit allocation. That, indeed, is \nenhancing the market.''\n  As illustrated by these examples and Chairman Greenspan's comments, \nit is clear that CRA is a far cry from government-mandated credit \nallocation. To be sure, CRA is predicated on two simple assumptions \nthat were well-articulated by the legislative architect of CRA, former \nSenate Banking Committee Chairman Proxmire, who stated, ``(1) \nGovernment through tax revenues and public debt cannot and should not \nprovide more than a limited part of the capital required for local \nhousing and economic development needs. Financial institutions in our \nfree economic system must play the leading role, and (2) A public \ncharter for a bank or savings institution conveys numerous benefits and \nit is fair for the public to ask something in return.''\n  In the words of former Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, \n``CRA is in many respects a model statute. It requires no public \nsubsidy, no private subsidy, and no massive Washington bureaucracy.''\n  It is this simple concept that has resulted in more than $1 trillion \nin loan commitments for low- and moderate-income borrowers since CRA's \nenactment in 1977. Indeed, the record home ownership rate that the U.S. \nis now enjoying--66.3 percent of Americans own their homes--is in large \nmeasure due to CRA lending to minorities and low-income individuals. \nMinorities have accounted for a disproportionately large share of home \nownership growth since 1994--roughly 42 percent.\n  Also, since 1993, home mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income \ncensus tracts have risen by 22 percent, which is more than twice as \nfast as the rate of growth in all home mortgage loans. In view of these \nstatistics, it is clear that CRA has played a tremendous role in the \nhome ownership boom.\n  In addition to increases in home mortgage lending, CRA has also been \nresponsible for an increase in community development lending. In the \npast four years, banks have invested four times as much in community \ndevelopment projects, as they did in the previous thirty years.\n  This increased investment in community development by banks has also \nfurthered the evolution of a secondary market for community development \nloans, which ultimately provides additional capital for community \ndevelopment. For many years, the development of a secondary market for \ncommunity development loans had been limited. This development was \nlimited for a number of reasons including the lack of conformity in the \nunderlying loans, as well as the fact that community development \nsecurities typically do not receive a rating from a nationally-\nrecognized rating agency. Also, the underlying loans lacked long-term \nperformance data, making them difficult to rate.\n  However, because of CRA, a secondary market for community development \nsecurities is beginning to emerge. This is happening for two specific \nreasons: (1) The federal banking regulators have interpreted CRA to \nallow banks to get CRA credit for purchasing community development \nsecurities, even if they lack ratings or performance data, if the \npurchases are consistent with safe and sound banking practices, (2) \nAlso, as banks have increased their community development lending, they \nhave been able to draw on this experience to improve underwriting \nstandards and create greater conformity in underwriting, which is \nimportant for investors in the secondary market. Also, this experience \nhas provided banks with greater empirical data on loan performance, \nwhich is another important consideration for secondary market \ninvestors. These are trends that we should clearly be excited about and \nshould seek to further.\n  Instead, S. 900 would undermine this progress. Specifically, one \nprovision of S. 900 would exempt rural banks with assets under $100 \nmillion from CRA. Although this exemption is limited to the smallest \ninstitutions, over 76 percent of rural banks would be covered. This is \nof great concern since small banks have historically received the \nlowest CRA ratings. In fact, institutions with less than $100 million \nin assets accounted for 92 percent of institutions receiving ``non-\ncompliance'' CRA ratings in 1997-1998.\n  I am also concerned about this exemption because smaller banks are \ntypically the primary sources of credit in rural communities. Hence, \nabsent CRA, it is likely that many rural communities could become \ncredit-starved.\n  The bill also includes a provision that would provide a safe harbor \nfor banks with a ``satisfactory'' or better CRA rating. Specifically, \ninstitutions receiving a satisfactory CRA rating at their most recent \nexamination would be presumptively in compliance with CRA, \nunless ``substantial verifiable information'' to the contrary was \npresented. I am concerned about this provision because it establishes a \nvery difficult-to-satisfy burden of proof for individuals or groups \nwishing to protest a bank merger on CRA grounds. Indeed, I fear this \nprovision will greatly inhibit the ability of groups to get the \nnecessary information from banks to protest a merger. Also, when \nconsidering the fact that 97 percent of institutions receive a \nsatisfactory or better CRA rating, it is clear that this provision will \neffectively eliminate CRA comment on a bank merger.\n\n  If these provisions of S. 900 are not eliminated, I fear a return to \nthe days prior to CRA's enactment when access to credit was limited for \nmany minorities and those living in low-income neighborhoods. In fact, \ntestimony before the Senate Banking Committee during the consideration \nof CRA in 1977 revealed how bad things were. Witnesses recounted \nstories of financial institutions that had previously been active in \nurban lending, that disinvested in those same urban neighborhoods as \nminorities increasingly moved in. Testimony before the Senate Banking \nCommittee also brought to light a 1974 study of six Chicago banks. In \nthe study, it was found that these banks, which held $144 million in \ndeposits from low-income and minority communities, returned one-half \ncent on the dollar in home loans. Such was the deplorable state of \nlending in low-income and minority communities before CRA.\n  While certainly we have come a long way since CRA's passage in 1977, \nlending discrimination, unfortunately, persists. In a study published \nearlier this year by the Fair Housing Council of Greater Washington, it \nwas revealed that Washington area lenders discriminate against two out \nof five African American and Hispanic mortgage applicants. In one \nincident cited in the study, a Rockville lender advised a black tester \nthat the lender did not make loans to first-time home buyers. The same \nlender later met with a white tester, also posing as a first-time home \nbuyer, giving the tester an appointment and encouraging him to apply \nfor a mortgage loan. Lending studies by\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\nother organizations reveal similar findings. These studies have shown \nthat minority borrowers receive fewer bank loans even when their \nfinancial status is the same as or better than white borrowers.\n  By encouraging lenders to extend credit to all communities, CRA has \nbeen an important weapon in fighting lending discrimination. The Bryan \namendment will ensure the potency of CRA in fighting lending \ndiscrimination and providing fair access to credit to low-income and \nminority communities.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate how important it is to \ninclude CRA in any modernization legislation that passes. It is very \nlikely that if S. 900 is enacted, we will see increased consolidation \nin the financial services industry. As we know from recent experience, \nthis consolidation will likely lead to layoffs and bank branch \nclosings. Absent the CRA language included in the Bryan amendment, I \nfear that this consolidation could have a significant and adverse \nimpact on access to banking services and credit in low-income and \nminority communities. By adopting the Bryan amendment, we will at least \nensure that industry consolidation will not decrease access to credit \nin these communities.\n  In fact, I feel so strongly about these provisions that I plan on \nopposing the bill if this amendment is not adopted. I would hope my \ncolleagues can support this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have been a longstanding supporter of financial \nservices modernization and affirmed such support in a letter to \nSecretary Rubin about two years ago, and last year, as a member of the \nBanking Committee, I voted in support of H.R. 10--the Financial \nServices Modernization bill reported out of the Banking Committee with \nstrong bi-partisan support.\n  I believe it is important that our financial services sector adapt to \ncontemporary market conditions, marketplace innovations and to growing \nfinancial competition from abroad. Moreover, I understand and \nappreciate the desire of our financial services industries--banks, \nsecurities firms, and insurance firms--to further expand their \ntraditional lines of business.\n  I joined the Banking Committee in 1993 when I was first elected to \nthe Senate, and I proudly served on that Committee until this year. So \nI realize the process of financial services reform has been long, \ntedious, and often quite contentious. I also realize that many \nfinancial services firms are looking forward to the Senate putting an \nend to that long process by passing a financial services modernization \nbill. And I would like to see us pass a good bill--a fair and balanced \nbill.\n  Nonetheless, it is important to remember that the U.S. already has \nthe best banking system in the world. It is the best capitalized, the \nmost transparent, has the highest accounting standards, is very \ninnovative and its safety and soundness is unsurpassed.\n  Therefore, it is appropriate to ask, ``why is financial services \nmodernization necessary?'' It is necessary because the financial \nmarketplace has changed, brought on by, among other things, a \ncombination of new and innovative products and services, as well as \ntechnological advances.\n  Regulators must keep pace with these innovations, and we, as \nlegislators must set the appropriate parameters for this changed \nfinancial services marketplace. We cannot leave it up to piecemeal \nregulation and legislation as, all to often, has been the case.\n  Our goal should be to create a regulatory framework which provides \nmeasurable benefits to consumers and businesses, enhances \ncompetitiveness of the financial services sector on a global basis, and \nensures the continued safety and soundness of our financial \ninstitutions. While the bill before us goes a long way toward achieving \nthat goal, unfortunately I believe, it falls short.\n  It falls short, principally in my opinion, because it fails to ensure \nthe continued strength of the Community Reinvestment Act. CRA has been \ninvaluable in helping to assure low and moderate income consumers, \ncommunities and small businesses have sufficient access to credit.\n  The Community Reinvestment Act has been important to both urban and \nrural communities. Every CRA dollar is a loan--it is the leveraging of \ncapital. Over the past seven years or so, approximately $400 billion of \ncommunity development has been leveraged. It has proven to be \nan effective tool in my home state of California and in states \nthroughout the country.\n\n  CRA encourages federally insured financial institutions to help meet \nthe credit needs of the communities in which they do business. As \nSenator Proxmire said in 1974, ``CRA is intended to establish a system \nof regulatory incentives to encourage banks and savings institutions to \nmore effectively meet the credit needs of the localities they are \nchartered to serve, consistent with sound lending practices.''\n  CRA does not, despite many implications to the contrary, impose any \nrequirement upon banks to make unsound or unsafe loans. CRA does not \nrequire banks to engage in risky lending or investments. It does not \nrequire banks to make loans outside of the lending criteria they have \nestablished. I would suggest, in fact, that given how well banks are \ndoing these days, one would be hard pressed to make a reasonable case \nthat CRA has been detrimental to the bottom line of banks or to their \nsafety and soundness.\n  I think it is wonderful banks are doing so well, I appreciate the \ncontributions they are making to our economy. I remember all too well \nwhen banks were not doing so well. Thus, I would not support CRA, or \nany other requirement, which encouraged banks to engage in unsafe \nlending practices.\n  My specific concerns as relate to the CRA provisions in this bill are \nas follows. First, as I understand it, there are no enforcement \nmechanisms or penalties for failing to maintain a ``satisfactory'' CRA \nrating. By contrast, the bill passed last year by the Senate Banking \nCommittee required all banks in a holding company structure to have a \nsatisfactory CRA rating as a condition of affiliation, and maintain a \nsatisfactory CRA rating in order to continue to engage in new financial \nactivities.\n  Second, this bill provides for a CRA ``safe harbor.'' Under this \nprovision, all institutions which received at least a satisfactory CRA \nrating on their most recent examination, and received a satisfactory \nrating in each of the past 3 years, would be deemed to be in compliance \nwith CRA. Such a safe harbor, I believe, would often effectively \neliminate the opportunity for public comment. Banks and thrifts are \nusually examined every two to three years. CRA performance can change \nin the interim.\n  Third, S. 900 exempts those banks with less assets of less than $100 \nmillion, and those that are not located in metropolitan areas, from \nCRA. While I think we can all agree that institutions with assets of \nless than $100 million are small, the amendment would exempt more than \n75 percent of rural institutions from CRA requirements--that is almost \n40 percent of all U.S. banks and thrifts. Ironically, I would note, it \nhas traditionally been these smaller institutions that have had the \nworst CRA records. Moreover, the new CRA rules, which went into effect \nin January 1996, provide a streamlined examination for banks and \nthrifts with assets less than $250 million. In fact, pursuant to the \nchanges which took effect in 1996, small banks do not have any data \ncollection or reporting requirements.\n  I do not believe the CRA changes envisioned in S. 900 are \nappropriate, or needed at this time. If there are abuses or specific \nproblems, let's deal with them--let regulators, and, if appropriate, \nlaw enforcement deal with them. Such abuses are hurtful to CRA and to \nthose who can potentially benefit from CRA. These abuses, I would \nsuggest however, are extraordinarily rare. On the whole, bankers have \nfound CRA to be an extremely minimal intrusion at most.\n  CRA has not been a problem to most bankers in my home state of \nCalifornia. BankAmerica, Wells Fargo and others have made important CRA \ncommitments in my state.\n  Between 1992 and 1997, BankAmerica made $3 billion in conventional \nsmall business loans and lines of credit for less than $50,000. In \n1997, it made more than $1 billion in loans and lines of credit for \n$100,000 or less. And BankAmerica has often noted their CRA loans have \nperformed as well as other more traditional loans made by the bank. \nThese loans have also been profitable for the bank. In fact, Hugh\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\nMcColl, the Chairman and CEO of BankAmerica Corp. has said, ``My \ncompany supports the Community Reinvestment Act both in spirit and in \nfact. We have had fun doing it. We've made a business out of it.''\n  Moreover, in Los Angeles, as a result of CRA, loans to African \nAmerican owned businesses increased a whopping 171 percent between 1992 \nand 1997. However, it is important to note that small business owners \nof every race have obtained credit as a result of CRA-related programs. \nFor example, in San Diego, at least 25 percent of the loans made by \nlocal community development organizations were to white business \nowners.\n  So Mr. President, although I am a enthusiastic supporter of financial \nservices modernization, I cannot support S. 900 if the CRA provisions \ncontained in the bill are maintained. Access to capital and economic \ndevelopment, I believe, will potentially be some of the most important \ntools available to low and moderate income Americans in the coming \ncentury. Without such access to capital, far too many Americans, \nparticularly those in urban and rural areas, will not be able to share \nin the economic wealth of our remarkably exuberant economy.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have refrained from speaking all day. \nI do need to speak for a brief period of time, but I want to try to \naccommodate colleagues as well. If I can inquire of Senator Schumer, \nhow much time would he need to speak, 5 minutes or thereabouts?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes, that would be fine.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And Senator Shelby?\n  Mr. SHELBY. About 10.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would like to propound a request that Senator Schumer \nbe allowed to speak and then Senator Shelby and then after Senator \nShelby that I would be recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Could we add to it that, after the Senator from Maryland, \nI be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nMaryland, as well as the Senators from Alabama and Texas for their \ncourtesy here this evening.\n  I also thank Senator Sarbanes for his indefatigable efforts to defend \nthe Community Reinvestment Act.\n  And I'd like to thank my Democratic colleagues as well as Secretary \nRubin for their strong commitment to CRA.\n  In 1977 when CRA was enacted, the thinking was that banks--though \nprivately owned--receive public benefits in the form of deposit \ninsurance and access to the Federal Reserve's discount window and \npayments system.\n  And in return, they would have an obligation to ``serve the \nconvenience and needs'' of their communities.\n  Over 20 years later, banks still CRA as an obligation--but as an \nobligation that a minimum they can live with--and in many cases, that \nthey endorse.\n  Does CRA work?\n  The answer has been a resounding yes.\n  Since its enactment, CRA has resulted in $1 trillion of investments \nin underserved communities. It's been a driving force for community \neconomic development; one of the best ways to bring people together, to \nbring poor people and people of color upward, which we all want to do.\n  It's also driven a 30 percent increase in home ownership among low-\nincome families since 1990, making the American Dream of home ownership \na more commonplace reality for our minority communities.\n  And in 1997, large banks and thrifts made approximately 525,000 small \nbusiness loans totaling $34 billion to entrepreneurs located in low and \nmoderate communities.\n  CRA works.\n  And we know it works because banks who have never been shy in \nfighting what they view as burdensome or intrusive Federal regulation \nare not pushing to repeal CRA or even to roll it back.\n  In fact, they're supporting it. Every major bank in my State has \ncontacted me in favor of CRA.\n  Some have been honest enough to admit that because of CRA they are \nreaching out to communities that they would not otherwise have served.\n  And they're serving them profitably.\n  Hugh McColl, Jr., Chairman and CEO of BankAmerica Corp., stated \nearlier this year; ``My company supports the Community Reinvestment Act \nin spirit and in fact. To be candid, we have gone way beyond its \nrequirements * * *. We're quite happy living with the existing rules.''\n  A Federal Reserve study showed that banks with higher volumes of \nloans to low-income communities were on average more profitable than \nthose with a lower volume.\n  And we know that banks have had some of their most profitable years \neven as CRA loans have reached record heights.\n  Finally, our regulators, who are committed to ensuring the safety and \nsoundness of our financial institutions, have been very vocal in their \nsupport of CRA.\n  So there's more evidence that CRA has been effective in communities' \nedification than in any invidious exploitation of banks, as some of its \ncritics have been charging.\n  The question is, then, with everyone in support of CRA, why do we \nwant to throw away our best chance to pass financial modernization \nsolely to end a law that we know is working?\n  The President has stated very clearly that with these CRA provisions, \nthis bill will end in veto. His veto letter states:\n\n       We cannot support the ``Financial Services Modernization \n     Act of 1999'' * * *. In its current form, the bill would \n     undermine the effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act \n     (CRA), a law that has helped to build homes, create jobs, and \n     restore hope in communities across America. The CRA is \n     working, and we must preserve its vitality as we write the \n     financial constitution for the 21st Century.\n\n  Contrary to what many think, this amendment does not expand CRA. It \nsimply maintains the status quo.\n  First, it requires that banks have at least a ``satisfactory'' CRA \nrating as a precondition for affiliation with securities and insurance \nfirms. Today our insured depository institutions have this obligation. \nAnd 97 percent of them meet it. They meet it precisely because it is \nnot a tremendous burden.\n  Second, this amendment would remove the small bank exemption that \nnarrowly passed the Banking Committee. Small banks account for 70 \npercent of the ``needs improvement'' ratings handed out to banks by the \nregulators last year. So the idea that we should exempt the \ninstitutions that are most likely to be in noncompliance seems ill-\nadvised.\n  Finally, the amendment eliminates the safe harbor provisions in the \nCommittee print. The safe harbor sets up an unnecessary burden of proof \nthat is simply unnecessary.\n  In sum, these provisions would restore CRA to today's potency.\n  As I said yesterday, I say, it is my hope that we can set aside our \npartisanship for the sake of pragmatism.\n  And set aside confrontation for the sake of compromise.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote for modernization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bryan CRA \namendment. This amendment not only strikes the small rural bank \nexemption that we have in the Banking Committee bill and that we \nadopted on a bipartisan vote, but it also replaces that language with a \nsignificant expansion in CRA--the same language Chairman Gramm and I \nvehemently opposed on the Senate floor this past year.\n  Community banks, as the Presiding Officer knows, by their very \nnature, serve the needs of their communities and do not need a \nburdensome Government mandate to force them to allocate credit or to \noriginate profitable loans. And, contrary to the assertions of critics, \nthere is no evidence whatsoever that the small bank exemption would \nhave ``devastating consequences'' for low- and moderate-income rural \ncommunities. There remains no documented evidence to prove such an \nassertion, just as there is no tangible evidence that CRA has ever \nhelped rural communities in America.\n  What is documented, though--and Chairman Gramm has worked tirelessly \nto do so--is the kinds of blackmail agreements and extortion practices\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\nthat the Community Reinvestment Act enables community groups to engage \nin. The truth of the matter is that the small bank exemption would \nexempt less than 3 percent of bank assets nationwide. Thus, 97 percent \nof all bank assets would still be subject to the Community Reinvestment \nAct.\n  Just bear with me a minute on this chart. We have bank assets of \n$5.711 trillion. But banks above $100 million, rural and nonrural, \ncontrol 97 percent of the bank assets in America. The small banks in \nAmerica that we are talking about, those under $100 million in assets--\nthere are 3,667 of them--control only $165 billion, or 2.9 percent of \nall the banking assets. Can you imagine? BankAmerica, for example, has \n$614 billion in assets. And I commend them for that. They are a well-\nrun bank. But that is more than all 3,667 small rural banks in America \nput together; it is about 4 times more. So let's look at this in a \nrealistic situation, as this chart here depicts.\n  Mr. President, critics will point out that the small rural bank \nexemption which I and Senator Gramm have in the bill would exempt 3,700 \nbanks. That is true. But to put that into context again, and to \nreiterate, one needs to understand that BankAmerica, as I have just \nshown, is four times the size of all small rural banks in America.\n  Indeed, BankAmerica possesses $614 billion in assets, or 10.7 percent \nof all bank assets in this country. If one looks at the list of large \nbanks, one will soon realize that the vast majority of bank assets are \nconcentrated in the large, multibillion-dollar banks that can most \neasily shoulder the burden of CRA.\n  The assertions of those who oppose the small bank exemption that we \nhave in the banking legislation also do not comport with the comments I \nhave received from small banks across the country. In fact, I have many \nletters from small bankers who complain about the burden of CRA, as \nwell as the regulators' subjective reporting requirements dealing with \nCRA.\n  I would like to take a moment to read some letters from some small \nbankers in Alabama. I believe they have a right to be heard. I will \nquote from some of these. The first one says:\n\n       I don't think, in these small community banks, that we have \n     to be examined by people who usually don't understand our \n     purpose, to enforce us to service our community * * *. \n     Small community banks are a Service Institution. I know \n     because I have just completed 39 years this month. All \n     this time in small home-owned banks that deliver services \n     that are essential to rural life. Where services have been \n     rendered over the years even before we knew anything about \n     CRA.\n\n  That was from Charles Willmon, chairman of the First Bank of the \nSouth in the small town of Rainsville, AL.\n  I have another letter, from John Mullins, president and CEO of First \nCommercial Bank of Cullman, AL, which says:\n\n       Exempting small banks would be a wonderful opportunity for \n     me to spend less time on unnecessary and nonproductive \n     paperwork and more time helping the citizens of my market \n     area improve their financial well-being . . . CRA examiners \n     spend many unnecessary hours examining our loan track record. \n     Banks our size are an integral part of the local community \n     and we are always sensitive to the needs of our citizens. \n     They are not faceless names, but people whom we know. We \n     don't need a law to require us to help them with credit, we \n     do it anyway.\n\n  I have another letter from a small banker in Clanton, AL. He is \nLeland Howard, Jr., of Peoples Southern Bank. He says:\n\n       We in the community banks feel that the CRA exception for \n     banks with aggregate assets of $100 million or less is a very \n     good start on the road to easing the regulatory burden.\n\n  I have a letter from John Hughes, CEO of First National Bank of \nHartford, AL, a small town in south Alabama. He says:\n\n       Extra work created by the CRA is tremendous. Most rural \n     banks know at least 95 percent of all their customers, their \n     family, and their situation. The rating system that most \n     examiners used is highly subjective and the rural banks have \n     a hard time to achieve a grade higher than satisfactory. \n     Again, it would be a great day in Alabama if you . . . could \n     get this amendment passed.\n\n  Those are just a few letters, and they come from all over the Nation.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond published its \n1994 annual report on ``Neighborhoods and Banking,'' where it reported \nits findings on the costs of CRA. The report found:\n\n       The regulatory burden [of CRA] would fall on bank-dependent \n     borrowers in the form of higher loan rates and on bank-\n     dependent savers in the form of lower deposit rates. And to \n     the extent that lending induced by the CRA regulations \n     increases the risk exposure of the deposit insurance funds, \n     taxpayers who ultimately back those funds bear some of the \n     burden as well.\n\n  The report goes on to say that, basically, the CRA imposes a tax on \nbanks. CRA, then, is a tax on community banks and raises the costs of \ninputs to banks by increasing their regulatory burden and compliance \ncosts. Mr. President, in addition, CRA forces banks to make loans \naccording to a Federal quota, increasing the risks, and therefore the \ncosts, of borrowing to consumers. Make no mistake about it, the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act raises the cost of borrowing through higher \nloan rates and punishes savers in the form of lower savings rates.\n  Critics of the small bank exemption claim that small banks get the \nworst CRA ratings. The truth of the matter is that one size does not \nfit all in any business. These critics point to lower than average \nloan-to-deposit ratios of small banks as evidence that they are not \nserving their communities. That is nonsense. That is like saying the \naverage male wears a size 42 regular suit and that every male in \nAmerica who does not fit in that size suit should be reprimanded by the \nFederal Government.\n  Every community in this great country is different. Most of us take \npride in such diversity. That is the foundation on which this country \nwas built.\n  However, the Community Reinvestment Act punishes banks who do not \ncomport with national averages. Indeed, the loan demand in Prattville, \nAL, is not the same as in Lafayette, LA. Nor is it the same as in \nShelbyville, TN. Nonetheless, CRA judges banks based largely on their \nloan-to-deposit ratios that the regulators deem to be appropriate. \nThat, my friends, is nothing but a quota. When everything is said and \ndone, CRA promotes quotas and creates a regulatory burden.\n  As if that is not bad enough, Mr. President, the Bryan amendment \nwould also expand the reach and the scope of the Community Reinvestment \nAct.\n  Specifically his amendment would:\n  One, increase administrative enforcement authority of the regulators \nto fine directors and officers up to $1 million a day for CRA \nnoncompliance. Just think about that.\n  Two, it would make expanded activities subject to CRA compliance on \nall depository institution affiliates on an ongoing basis.\n  And it would give the regulators the authority to shut down any \naffiliate within the holding company if just one subsidiary depository \ninstitution falls out of CRA compliance.\n  The Bryan amendment dramatically expands, Mr. President, CRA \nenforcement authority to allow civil money penalties for bank directors \nand officers, as I have pointed out.\n  The amendment would require bank holding companies who seek to become \nfinancial holding companies to be compliant with the Community \nReinvestment Act of 1977 just in order to be eligible. If even one \nsubsidiary depository institution ever falls out of compliance, the \nholding company, including the nonbank affiliate, would then be subject \nto section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which is 12 U.S.C. \n1818, which authorizes bank regulators to invoke cease and desist \norders, civil penalties, and fines.\n  Regulators would be authorized to fine bank directors and officers up \nto $1 million a day. This, Mr. President, is a dramatic expansion in \nthe enforcement authority and reach of bank regulators.\n  Such authority does not exist today. The Clinton Justice Department \neven agrees.\n  In late 1994, Comptroller of the Currency, Eugene Ludwig, tried to \ninvoke the administrative enforcement powers under Section 8 of FDIA \n(12 U.S.C. 1818) to enforce CRA. The Justice Department issued a \nmemorandum stating:\n\n       [T]o move from an enforcement scheme that relies upon a \n     system of regulatory incentives to a scheme that entails \n     cease-and-desist orders and potentially substantial monetary \n     penalties is a leap that we do not believe can be justified \n     on the basis of the text, purpose, and legislative history of \n     CRA. We therefore conclude that enforcement under 12 U.S.C. \n     1818 is not authorized by CRA.\n\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\n\n  Bank trade associations were very pleased with the Justice Department \ndecision. The Bankers Roundtable, the American Bankers Association, the \nConsumer Bankers Association, and the Savings and Community Bankers of \nAmerica, filed joint letters focusing in substantial part on the \nregulators claims of enforcement authority.\n  The Bryan amendment also permits regulators to force divestiture \nsince banks cannot ``retain shares of any company'' if ever out of CRA \ncompliance. This provision also explicitly states that a bank holding \ncompany may not ``engage in any activity'' unless the institution is \nCRA compliant always and forever.\n  Think about it.\n  If just one subsidiary depository institution of a financial holding \ncompany falls out of compliance with CRA, the substitute authorizes the \nFederal Reserve Board to ``impose such limitations on the conduct or \nactivities of the company or any affiliate of the company as the Board \ndetermines to be appropriate * * * '' This, too, is a dramatic \nexpansion of enforcement authority under CRA. For the first time, \nregulators will be able to impose restrictions on activities throughout \nthe entire holding company. This means a bank regulator could prohibit \na securities affiliate from underwriting securities or an insurance \naffiliate from underwriting insurance.\n  Regulators do not have such authority today. Currently, CRA only \nallows regulators to prohibit the merger, acquisition or branch \nexpansion of an institution that is not compliant with CRA.\n  Current law does not give bank regulators the authority to prohibit \neligible activities of a given charter due to CRA non-compliance. The \nBryan amendment requires an operating subsidiary who wants to engage in \nagency activities to maintain CRA compliance on all depository \ninstitution affiliates.\n  Thus, non-banking financial agency activities would be held hostage \nto CRA, with the bank regulators given the authority to enforce such \nlaw. This is the first time CRA has ever been expanded to cover the \napproval of non-depository activities.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Bryan amendment and support \nwhat is in the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, shortly we will be voting with respect \nto the Bryan amendment.\n  I, again, want to underscore the very strong and powerful statement \nwhich I think Senator Bryan made shortly after noon at the outset of \nthis debate, and I am deeply appreciative to him for the strong \nleadership he has shown with respect to this amendment.\n  We have tried to give all Members a chance to speak. I, in fact, have \nrefrained from doing so in the course of the day in order to make sure \nthat our colleagues had a chance to speak. I would like to take just a \nfew minutes now.\n  I want to speak in support of the amendment. But I really do not want \nto repeat a lot of the extensive discussion of the issues which have \ntaken place, both during opening statements on the bill, and on the \nalternative amendment, and now on this amendment itself, although they \nmay well bear repeating.\n  I want to make sure my colleagues appreciate the intense feeling and \nthe critical importance which civil rights groups, mayors, rural \ngroups, Hispanic groups, and Native American groups attach to this \nissue of CRA. They have all sent letters to the committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent those letters be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, these letters reflect how CRA has \nbenefited communities all over this country--small, urban, and rural. \nThey demonstrate how CRA has expanded economic opportunities for people \nof all races, colors, and ethnic affiliations.\n  Yesterday morning, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, our \npreeminent civil rights group, held a press conference in support of \nCRA. I would like briefly just to quote some of the comments made by \ncivil rights leaders at the press conference, as well as comments made \nby individuals who benefited from CRA.\n  Dr. Dorothy Height, chairman of the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, president emeritus of the National Council of Negro Women, \nspoke, and said:\n\n       Since its enactment in 1977, the Community Reinvestment Act \n     has served as one of the crowning achievements in the civil \n     rights movement.\n       The premise of the legislation is simple--to make sure that \n     economic opportunity for families and communities is \n     available to every American.\n       Opportunities for home ownership, small business \n     development, and sustaining rural communities are critical to \n     the strength of this Nation.\n       With CRA our neighborhoods have a chance. Without it, they \n     are discriminated against.\n       Just as civil rights legislation enacted a decade ago \n     sought to break down the walls of discrimination that \n     separated us in schools, restaurants, and places of work by \n     the color of our skin, the CRA has meant opportunity for \n     everyone, whatever race or color. As a result of CRA, \n     millions of minorities across this Nation now have access to \n     the capital that will allow them to build new homes, to \n     create new businesses, and to improve education.\n\n  She concluded her introductory remarks at the press conference by \nsaying:\n\n       Leaders you see before you represent dozens of \n     organizations galvanized by an assault on the Community \n     Reinvestment Act. Those organizations represent millions of \n     Americans who have been touched by CRA and millions more \n     who deserve the same opportunity.\n\n  Make no mistake about it, this issue is seen by the civil rights \ncommunity as a critical civil rights issue. Fair access to credit is \nfundamental to hopes for economic progress in our minority communities.\n  Another speaker at the press conference was Hugh Price, president of \nthe National Urban League, who said:\n\n       We of the National Urban League strongly support financial \n     services modernization because we believe it is in tune with \n     the times. But we staunchly oppose any effort to gut the CRA. \n     We at the Urban League work with the leaders of many \n     financial institutions. Just last week I talked with Kenny \n     Lewis, president of Bank America, who said that his bank \n     stands strongly behind the renewal of CRA.\n\n  I know that belief is echoed by many leaders in the financial \nservices and banking community who see it as good business for their \ncorporations.\n  Charles Kamasaki, senior vice president of the National Council of La \nRaza, stated:\n\n       The National Council of La Raza is the Nation's largest \n     Hispanic civil rights organization. We represent more than \n     200 local community-based organizations who provide a range \n     of services, many of them supported by CRA-related funds in \n     over 32 States.\n\n  Mr. Kamasaki, the head of the National Council of La Raza, introduced \nRichard Farias as president of the Tejano Center for Community Concerns \nin Houston, a member organization of La Raza. Mr. Farias stated, in \nspeaking of the importance of CRA:\n\n       Now because of CRA, a number of banks in Houston created a \n     consortium to help us purchase a $2.1 million school \n     building. The building has 7.5 acres and 80,000 square feet \n     of space, including a gymnasium, a cafeteria, an auditorium \n     and 25 classrooms. They now have a charter school for success \n     that houses 400 students and is expected to grow to 650 \n     students.\n\n  He goes on to say that it is very important to understand that CRA is \nnot just about community development; it is about empowerment of the \npeople; it is about being able to give low-income children and families \nthe right that they have to not only good housing but to good education \nand to good health services.\n  Daphne Kwok, executive director of the Organization of Chinese \nAmericans, also took part in the press conference. She stated that the \nOrganization of Chinese Americans supports the Community Reinvestment \nAct because it has enabled home ownership among minority and low- and \nmoderate-income individuals:\n\n       Asian Pacific-Americans, especially Chinese-Americans, \n     Korean-Americans, Vietnamese-Americans, Asian Indian-\n     Americans are small business owners, and many of them are \n     seeking to open up businesses in low and moderate income \n     areas.\n\n  JoAnn Chase, executive director of the National Congress of American \nIndians, then spoke and stated:\n\n       Founded in 1944, the National Congress of American Indians \n     is the oldest, largest and most representative national \n     organization\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\n     devoted to promoting and protecting the rights of American \n     Indian tribal governments and their citizens. One of our key \n     missions has been to continuously advocate for Indian self \n     determination and self sufficiency, and toward that end from \n     its very inception, our communities, our governments, our \n     people have supported the Community Reinvestment Act, which \n     has proven to be an effective means of encouraging federally \n     insured financial institutions to extend prudent and \n     profitable loans in traditionally underserved areas, \n     particularly in Indian country.\n       Specifically, the CRA has helped focus attention to the \n     challenges of extending credit to reservations and has acted \n     as a catalyst to reservation-based economic development. \n     Since the implementation of the CRA, Native American \n     governments and citizens and our own banks have negotiated \n     agreements for lending more than $155 million within the \n     Indian country which has substantially advanced efforts \n     toward economic self-sufficiency. It is a law that has helped \n     build homes for our people, has inspired hope and has created \n     jobs in many native communities.\n\n  The final speaker at the press conference was Hillary Shelton, \nWashington bureau director of the NAACP, who stated:\n\n       * * * on behalf of the NAACP * * * we are honored to \n     strongly support and continue to endorse the Community \n     Reinvestment Act and consequently oppose any attempts to \n     weaken it.\n       The CRA has been instrumental in the revitalization of \n     literally tens of thousands of communities nationwide, and \n     continues to be an important tool in the NAACP's ongoing \n     efforts to help people and communities achieve the goals of \n     community resurrection, development, and growth, at no cost \n     to American taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, there has been printed in the Record a letter from the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors which was quoted from earlier, a letter from \na coalition of 19 family farm and rural groups, which states:\n\n       Rural areas continue to suffer from a serious shortage of \n     affordable housing. Farmers are facing the worst financial \n     conditions in more than a decade due to declining commodity \n     prices. Rural Americans continue to need the tools of the CRA \n     to ensure accountability of their local lending institutions. \n     CRA helps to meet the credit demands of millions of family \n     farmers, rural residents and local businesses.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nother letters from a number of organizations which have written to us \nin very strong support of the CRA, as well as editorials.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                        Mischief From Mr. Gramm\n\n       Cities that were in drastic decline 20 years ago are \n     experiencing rebirth, thanks to new homeowners who are \n     transforming neighborhoods of transients into places where \n     families have a stake in what happens. The renaissance is due \n     in part to the Federal Community Reinvestment Act, which \n     requires banks to reinvest actively in depressed and minority \n     areas that were historically written off. Senator Phil Gramm \n     of Texas now wants to weaken the Reinvestment Act, \n     encouraging a return to the bad old days, when banks took \n     everyone's deposits but lent them only to the affluent. \n     Sensible members of Congress need to keep the measure intact.\n       The act was passed in 1977. Until then, prospective home or \n     business owners in many communities had little chance of \n     landing loans even from banks where they kept money on \n     deposit. But according to the National Community Reinvestment \n     Coalition, banks have committed more than $1 trillion to \n     once-neglected neighborhoods since the act was passed, the \n     vast majority of it in the last six years.\n       In New York City's South Bronx neighborhood, the money has \n     turned burned-out areas into havens for affordable homes and \n     a new middle class. The banks earn less on community-based \n     loans than on corporate business. But the most civic-minded \n     banks have accepted this reduced revenue as a cost of doing \n     business--and as a reasonable sacrifice for keeping the \n     surrounding communities strong.\n       Federal bank examiners can block mergers or expansions for \n     banks that fail to achieve a satisfactory Community \n     Reinvestment Act rating. The Senate proposal that Mr. Gramm \n     supports would exempt banks with assets of less than $100 \n     million from their obligations under the act. That would \n     include 65 percent of all banks. The Senate bill would also \n     dramatically curtail the community's right to expose what it \n     consider unfair practices. Without Federal pressure, however, \n     the amount of money flowing to poorer neighborhoods would \n     drop substantially, undermining the urban recovery.\n       Mr. Gramm argues that community groups are ``extorting'' \n     money from banks in return for approval, and describes the \n     required paperwork as odious. But community organizations \n     that build affordable housing in Mr. Gramm's home state \n     heartily disagree. Mayor Ron Kirk of Dallas disagrees as \n     well, and told the Dallas Morning News that he welcomed the \n     opportunity to explain to Mr. Gramm that ``there is no \n     downside to investing in all parts of our community.''\n       In a perfect world, lending practices would be fair and the \n     Reinvestment Act would be unnecessary. But without Federal \n     pressure the country would return to the era of redlining, \n     when communities cut off from capital withered and died.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 4, 1999]\n\n                           Banking on Reform\n\n       The Senate today is scheduled to begin considering a bill \n     that would remake the financial services industry, allowing \n     banks and insurance companies and investment firms to merge \n     and compete. Similar legislation is making its way through \n     the House. The thrust of both bills is sound. But while the \n     industries have lobbied hard to shape a law satisfactory to \n     them, the current legislation doesn't adequately protect low-\n     income communities or consumers' privacy. Financial \n     modernization should apply to them, too.\n       Since the Depression, federal law has sought to keep the \n     banking, insurance and securities industries separate. The \n     idea, in part, was to make sure that federally insured bank \n     deposits didn't wind up somewhere risky and unregulated. But \n     in recent years, even without a change in the law, that \n     separation has eroded. Banks have found ways to offer mutual \n     funds to their customers; investment firms function like \n     deposit institutions; etc. It makes sense now to bring \n     legislation--and regulation--in line with reality.\n       Congress has been trying to do so, and failing, for more \n     than a decade, and may again. But on the major issues, the \n     administration, the Federal Reserve and Congress have pretty \n     well agreed. They would let the financial services industries \n     meld while for the most part keeping them out of other \n     businesses, a wise decision. They've come up with fire walls \n     and regulatory schemes that, while still not entirely agreed \n     upon, have satisfied most concerns about protecting federally \n     insured deposits.\n       But there is no consensus yet on safeguarding the interests \n     of underserved communities. Since 1977 federally insured \n     banks have been subject to the Community Reinvestment Act, \n     requiring them to seek business opportunities in poor areas \n     as well as middle-class and wealthy neighborhoods. The law, a \n     response originally to clear evidence of bias in lending, has \n     worked well. It doesn't force banks to make unprofitable \n     loans, but it encourages them to look beyond traditional \n     customers, and it's had a beneficial effect on home ownership \n     and small-business lending.\n       Sen. Phil Gramm, chairman of the Banking Committee, now \n     wants to scale the law way back. He argues that community \n     groups use it to extort money from banks; there's scant \n     evidence for that. The real danger is that, with financial \n     modernization, banks will gradually escape their community \n     obligations by transferring capital to affiliates that aren't \n     covered by the law. The law should be extended and modernized \n     to keep pace with a changing industry.\n       Consumer privacy also could be in danger as barriers among \n     industries break down. An example: Should your life insurance \n     medical records be shipped over, without your knowledge, to \n     the loan officer considering your mortgage application? Sen. \n     Paul Sarbanes of Maryland and Rep. Ed Markey of \n     Massachusetts, among others, would give consumers more \n     control over the sale and sharing of personal data. As the \n     financial industry moves into a new era, privacy laws should \n     also keep pace.\n                                  ____\n\n         Jesuit Conference, The Society of Jesus in the United \n           States.\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Seante Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We are writing you on behalf of the \n     Jesuit Conference Board of the Society of Jesus in the United \n     States. With the House and Senate Banking Committees \n     scheduled to mark-up financial modernization legislation this \n     week and vigorous discussions already underway we call your \n     urgent attention to the status of the Community Reinvestment \n     Act (CRA) in this debate. We urge your vocal and \n     unconditional support for safeguarding and effectively \n     applying CRA to any proposed financial modernization \n     legislation. By maximizing the capital available to \n     undeserved urban and rural areas, CRA has proven to be an \n     exceptional means of promoting vital and sustainable \n     communities. CRA should be allowed to continue its invaluable \n     work.\n       There are approximately 4,000 U.S. Jesuit priests and \n     brothers working abroad and in our domestic projects which \n     include: 28 Jesuit-affiliated universities and colleges, more \n     than 50 Jesuit high schools and middle schools, nearly 100 \n     Jesuit parishes, and various other apostolic programs \n     throughout the country. We have an overriding commitment to \n     empower individuals, families and communities who are most \n     at-risk in our society. In essential ways, CRA enables these \n     marginalized groups to fully integrate into society.\n       Propelled by a mission of justice and social progress, \n     Jesuit institutions have CRA-type goals of investing in the \n     communities where they are located. For example, Fordham \n     University is situated in one of the poorest urban counties \n     in the nation. In 1983, Fordham formalized a long-standing \n     partnership\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\n     with the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition to \n     form the University Neighborhood Housing Corporation (UNHP). \n     UNHP believes in working aggressively to develop and preserve \n     innovative, community-controlled, affordable housing. With \n     the strength and leverage of CRA, UNHP, has built a positive, \n     working relationship with Chase Manhattan Bank. From the late \n     1980s, this relationship has resulted in millions of dollars \n     of capital for affordable housing and economic development in \n     the northwest Bronx. Recently, this successful partnership \n     yielded $25 million in housing rehabilitation funding from \n     Fannie Mae. The force of community leaders working with \n     university, banking and Fannie Mae representatives is not \n     merely a lifeline for the northwest Bronx; it has added self-\n     sustaining stability and growth to an historically \n     distressed, densely populated neighborhood. This is one \n     example of an estimated $1 trillion in CRA-leveraged \n     financial commitments since 1977.\n       We ask for your continued support for national economic \n     development policies which equip people with the means to \n     lead respectful and dignified lives. CRA is in the interest \n     of underserved communities; it is in the interest of our \n     Jesuit institutions; and it is in our collective, national \n     interest.\n       Thank you for your consideration and efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rev.

Paul Sarbanes,\n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I write to ask that you oppose any \n     provisions in the Financial Services Act of 1999 that may \n     eliminate consumer protections and/or dilute the fair lending \n     laws.\n       The United States Catholic Conference has vigorously \n     supported the disclosure of lending patterns since 1975 and \n     was one of the original supporters of the Home Mortgage \n     Disclosure Act. We believe people must have access to \n     information about the lending practices and patterns of the \n     financial institutions in their communities that are seeking \n     their business. In the past banks, mortgage companies, \n     insurance brokers and other financial institutions have \n     discriminated against minority populations, low-income \n     individuals and the communities in which they live with \n     virtual impunity. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and \n     the effective enforcement of its regulations have proved \n     significant tools in ensuring that financial institutions \n     meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they \n     are located, particularly by increasing the flow of credit to \n     low-income and minority communities.\n       Since 1977, CRA has channeled tens of billions of dollars \n     profitably back into rural and urban communities. This \n     success of local communities gaining access to private \n     capital should not be jeopardized. Communities and \n     neighborhoods need the investment of private capital \n     particularly as government curtails its spending on housing \n     and social services programs and local communities are being \n     asked to assume more responsibility for their own \n     development. Low and moderate income families of all races \n     and ethnicities have benefited from CRA with increased \n     opportunities to purchase homes, open small businesses or \n     operate farms.\n       As Congress seeks to modernize the banking and financial \n     industry, fair lending laws must not be undermined. Once \n     more, we urge you to oppose any efforts to diminish consumer \n     protections and to weaken fair lending laws.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Cardinal Roser Mahony,\n\n       Archbishop of Los Angeles, Chairman, Domestic Policy \n     Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       National Low Income Housing\n\n\n                                               Coalition/LIHIS\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the National Low Income \n     Housing Coalition, I must express in the strongest terms \n     possible our objection to the evisceration of the Community \n     Reinvestment Act in the Financial Services Modernization Act \n     of 1999 recently reported out of the Senate Banking \n     Committee.\n       The National Low Income Housing Coalition represents \n     thousands of local housing organizations that are doing the \n     hard work at the local level to rebuild neighborhoods that \n     have been depleted by disinvestment, and to produce safe, \n     decent, and affordable housing for people at the low end of \n     the economic spectrum. These are organizations that are \n     masterful at the management of multiple funding streams, \n     bringing together the public and private resources required \n     to stimulate and produce new housing and economic development \n     initiatives at the local level. Each of our members can \n     attest to the necessity of the Community Reinvestment Act in \n     putting together the resources required to do the job we all \n     expect of them. At a time when responsibility for solving \n     serious community problems is being devolved to local \n     organizations, it is mystifying as to why one of their most \n     critical resource development tools would be pulled out from \n     underneath them.\n       Especially serious is the provision in the Senate bill \n     which allows banks not in compliance with CRA to expand their \n     affiliations and engage in new powers. This would essentially \n     render the CRA useless in the new world of financial \n     modernization.\n       We also object to the creation of so-called ``safe \n     harbors'' for institutions with at least a satisfactory CRA \n     rating, which in effect eliminates opportunity for public \n     comment on the community reinvestment activities of the \n     banks, while maintaining opportunity for public comment on \n     all other aspects of the institutions' functioning.\n       Finally, the small bank exemption would mean that rural \n     communities have no options for acquiring credit, as small \n     banks are often the only source of credit in many rural parts \n     of the country.\n       The Community Reinvestment Act is a model of the Federal \n     government at its best, stimulating investment in poor \n     neighborhoods and creating a true partnership among the \n     private, for profit sector; the private, not for profit \n     sector, and the public sector. As we move into an era of a \n     bigger and more comprehensive banking system, building on, \n     not tearing down, this core element of community reinvestment \n     should be an essential principle.\n       We urge that the Senate not take this action, and prevent \n     the dire consequences that would result in its wake of its \n     passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila Crowley,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as I draw to a close, let me again say \nto the distinguished Senator from Nevada we very much appreciate his \nvery strong and powerful statement.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                     April 8, 1999\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes:  The undersigned organizations write \n     to express strong opposition to the Financial Services \n     Modernization Act of 1999 as reported out of the Senate \n     Banking Committee on March 4th. The Act would restructure the \n     financial services industry in the United States by allowing \n     broad affiliations among banks, insurance companies, and \n     security firms. Currently, the law strictly limits ownership \n     among different financial entities and between financial \n     companies and commercial corporations. The Act seeks to ease \n     these restrictions, without commensurate expansion of the \n     Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to cover insurance \n     companies, securities firms, mortgage companies, and other \n     financial entities allowed to affiliate with banks. The Act \n     would undermine one of the most effective revitalization \n     vehicles for underserved low-income and minority communities, \n     including Hispanic American communities across the country.\n       We have found, and research confirms, that all too often \n     the credit and financial needs of these communities are \n     severely underserved. Historically, many financial \n     institutions have avoided investing in these communities due \n     to their perceived higher level of risk. Unfortunately, \n     ``perceived higher level of risk'' is often code for ``low-\n     income'' or ``minority.'' But the facts show that low-income \n     and minority communities are not inherently riskier than \n     other communities. In fact, most financial institutions find \n     them to be quite profitable, once they begin investing in \n     them. Unfortunately, without the CRA, many financial \n     institutions have not and would not be encouraged to do so.\n       As the data show, Hispanics are the fastest-growing \n     population in the United States. We are a growing force in \n     the expansion of homeownership and small business \n     development, two leading indicators of the economic well-\n     being of this country. For example, between 1987 and 1992, \n     Hispanic-owned business grew by over 76%, compared to 26% for \n     U.S. businesses overall. According to a 1997 Harvard study, \n     ``the number of Hispanic homeowners has shown the most \n     spectacular rise'' in recent years compared to that of Whites \n     and of other minority groups. Population projections forecast \n     Hispanics to be the largest minority group in the U.S. by the \n     year 2005, causing the U.S. economy to be increasingly \n     dependent on the continued prosperity of the Hispanic \n     American community. Without the CRA, this growth may be \n     impeded.\n       As reported out of the Senate Banking Committee, the \n     Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 would hinder \n     that growth by weakening the CRA in the following three ways. \n     First, ``satisfactory'' CRA rating is not required in order \n     for financial institutions to enjoy the new powers \n     afforded to them by the legislation, thereby allowing \n     banks to exercise their privilege, even if they are not \n     meeting the credit needs of the communities where they do \n     business.\n       Second, banks receiving a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating would \n     be given a ``safe harbor'' from public comment on CRA \n     performance. Since over 95% of banks receive a \n     ``satisfactory'' rating, this would undermine the \n     effectiveness of the law by restricting a community's right \n     to voice its experience with\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\n     banks. While a ``satisfactory'' rating provides a helpful \n     guide to a bank's overall performance, it may not provide an \n     accurate picture at the neighborhood level.\n       Third, the Act proposes to exempt all small rural banks \n     (those with less than $100 million in assets) from CRA, \n     thereby releasing 76% of all rural banks from their CRA \n     obligations. As with the safe harbor provision, this \n     undermines the spirit and the effectiveness of the law by \n     exempting most rural banks. This would have particularly \n     adverse consequences in low-income rural communities where \n     often the only source of credit is a small bank. Moreover, \n     researchers have found that small banks have \n     disproportionately poor CRA records compared to larger banks, \n     thereby highlighting the need for CRA in rural communities \n     and small towns.\n       CRA is one of the strongest incentives to encourage \n     investment in low-income and minority communities. Over the \n     last twenty-two years, neighborhoods across the country have \n     benefited from CRA-encouraged investments. This has resulted \n     in increases in homeownership and business development, \n     leading to the rebirth of many American neighborhoods. \n     However, many communities remain underserved by capital and \n     investment vehicles. For this reason, reinforcement, not \n     weakening, of CRA is critically needed. We urge you to \n     support the continued strengthening of America's communities \n     by vigorously opposing the Financial Services Modernization \n     Act of 1999 as reported out of Committee, and supporting \n     amendments that would strengthen the Bill's CRA protections. \n     Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n         Rick Dovalina, National President, League of United Latin \n           American Citizens; Arturo Vargas, Executive Director, \n           NALEO Educational Fund; Ruth Pagani, Executive \n           Director, National Hispanic Housing Council (NHHC); \n           Juan Figueroa, President and General Counsel, Puerto \n           Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund (PRLDEF); \n           Antonia Hernandez, President and General Counsel, \n           MALDEF; Raul Yzaguirre, President and Chief Executive \n           Officer, National Council of La Raza (NCLR); Manuel \n           Mirabal, President and Chief Executive Officer, \n           National Puerto Rican Coalition (NPRC).\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 300,000 farm and ranch \n     families of the National Farmers Union, I write to express \n     our strong opposition to the Financial Services Modernization \n     Act of 1999, as reported out of the Senate Banking Committee \n     earlier this month. Specifically, we are concerned that the \n     bill would undercut the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)--a \n     law that has significantly expanded access to credit in rural \n     communities across the nation.\n       The Community Reinvestment Act prohibits redlining, and \n     encourages banks to make affordable mortgage, small farm and \n     small business loans. Under the impetus of CRA, banks and \n     thrifts made $11 billion in farm loans in 1997. CRA loans \n     assisted small farmers in obtaining credit for operating \n     expenses, livestock and real estate purchases. Low- and \n     moderate-income residents in rural communities also benefited \n     from $2.8 billion in small business loans in 1997.\n       In 1999, access to credit is tighter than usual, making it \n     critical to maintain the CRA. There are three provisions in \n     the pending legislation that jeopardize the CRA.\n       First, the bill exempts banks and thrifts that are located \n     in rural areas and have less than $100 million in assets, \n     from CRA requirements. This provision would exempt 76 percent \n     of all banks and thrifts in rural communities. A \n     Congressional Research Service study of data from 1997 to \n     mid-1998 found that banks with less than $100 million in \n     assets receive 70 percent of the ``below satisfactory'' CRA \n     ratings.\n       Second, the banking bill fails to require that banks have a \n     satisfactory CRA rating in order to affiliate with securities \n     and insurance firms. In the absence of this requirement, \n     banks could ignore local credit needs in favor of expanding \n     to other areas.\n       Third, the bill has the effect of eliminating the public's \n     opportunity to comment on a bank's performance pending \n     expansion, if that bank has had a satisfactory CRA rating \n     during the previous 36 months.\n       There is no compelling reason to weaken the CRA. In fact, \n     CRA regulations were revised in 1995 to reduce compliance \n     burdens on small banks and allow for streamlined examination.\n       The CRA has been extremely successful in encouraging \n     financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of rural \n     communities across the nation. Therefore, we urge you to \n     oppose the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 until \n     the provisions against the CRA are removed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Leland Swenson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Small Business Administration,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing to express my concern \n     with provisions of the Financial Services Modernization \n     legislation that would weaken the Community Reinvestment Act \n     (CRA). The President has made clear that he would veto \n     legislation that weakens CRA, and it is my hope that the U.S. \n     Senate will not move to undermine this important statute.\n       The CRA is a vital tool in providing access to capital in \n     communities traditionally underserved and once perceived as \n     high-risk lending areas. Financial institutions have found, \n     through CRA, that creditworthy borrowers and sound \n     investments do exist in these areas. The CRA has resulted in \n     viable small businesses creating jobs and stimulating local \n     economies. Without CRA, lending institutions might never \n     realize the maximum potential of these marketplaces, and many \n     communities could lose access to bank credit, which is so \n     important to small businesses.\n       The CRA focus for banks strikes at the heart of fulfilling \n     the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) mission. SBA \n     is in the business of providing credit to those who cannot \n     obtain it elsewhere, and we do this largely through our \n     partners--local financial institutions. Everyday, SBA and \n     banks across the country help entire communities grow through \n     SBA-backed equity investments and guaranteed loans, many of \n     which fall under CRA goals. Additionally, studies analyzing \n     CRA data identify and quantify what would have been only \n     hunches just 4 years ago, and the result is a more accurate \n     depiction of the patterns and gaps of small business lending \n     across the Nation. The CRA is essential in meeting the credit \n     and investment needs of our America's small businesses.\n       Weakening CRA could reverse the progress we have made in \n     small business lending in this country. As you seek to \n     modernize the financial industry, I urge you to oppose any \n     provision that actually moves us back in time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Aida Alvarez\n     Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Chairman Greenspan Comments on CRA\n\n       ``Anecdotal information seems to suggest that loans to low- \n     and moderate-income people perform, with respect to \n     repayment, as well as loans to others, though some studies \n     have suggested that delinquency rates on some types of \n     affordable mortgage loans are higher. . . . there is little \n     or no evidence that banks' safety and soundness have been \n     compromised by such lending, and bankers often report sound \n     business opportunities.''--January 12, 1998.\n       ``When conducted properly by banks who are knowledgeable \n     about their local markets, who use this knowledge to develop \n     suitable products, and have adequately promoted those \n     products to the low- and moderate-income segments of the \n     community, CRA can be a safe, sound and profitable \n     business.''--May 17, 1995.\n       Chairman Greenspan noted during testimony before the House \n     Banking Committee on February 11, 1999 that CRA has ``very \n     significantly increased the amount of credit in communities'' \n     that the changes have been ``quite profound.''\n       ``CRA has helped financial institutions to discover new \n     markets that may have been underserved before.''--May 17, \n     1995 repeated January 12, 1998.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              CRA Administration and Democratic Supporters\n\n       ``We must pass a stronger Community Reinvestment Act that \n     challenges to lend to entrepreneurs and promotes development \n     projects that reinforce community and neighborhood goals.''--\n     Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore, ``Putting People \n     First,'' 1992.\n       ``[T]he town banker is doing pretty well where you live--in \n     a big city or a small town.

We have greatly improved CRA by streamlining \n     its regulations so that they focus on performance, not \n     paperwork. CRA has been an enormous success.''--Treasury \n     Secretary Robert Rubin, Letter to Senator Phil Gramm, \n     February 1, 1999.\n       ``It's very significantly increased the amount of credit \n     that's available in the communities, and if one looks at the \n     detailed statistics, some of the changes have been quite \n     profound.''--Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, \n     Testimony before the House Banking and Financial Services \n     Committee, February 11, 1999.\n       ``[C]redit is the key to the American dream.

Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Paul: This Administration has been a strong proponent \n     of financial legislation that would reduce costs and increase \n     access to financial services for consumers, businesses and \n     communities. Nevertheless, we cannot support the ``Financial \n     Services Modernization Act of 1999,'' as currently proposed \n     by Chairman Gramm, now pending before the Senate Banking \n     Committee.\n       In its current form, the bill would undermine the \n     effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), a law \n     that has helped to build homes, create jobs, and restore hope \n     in communities across America. The CRA is working, and we \n     must preserve its vitality as we write the financial \n     constitution for the 21st Century. The bill would deny \n     financial services firms the freedom to organize themselves \n     in the way that best serves their customers, and prohibit a \n     structure with proven advantages for safety and soundness. \n     The bill would also provide inadequate consumer protections. \n     Finally, the bill could expand the ability of depository \n     institutions and nonfinancial firms to affiliate, at a time \n     when experience around the world suggests the need for \n     caution in this area.\n       I agree that reform of the laws governing our nation's \n     financial services industry would promote the public \n     interest. However, I will veto the Financial Services \n     Modernization Act if it is presented to me in its current \n     form.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      National Association for the\n\n\n                                Advancement of Colored People,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1999.\n     Re the Financial Services Modernization Act and the Community \n         Reinvestment Act.\n\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the nation's oldest \n     and largest grassroots civil rights organization, strongly \n     supports the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and opposes any \n     attempts to weaken it. The CRA has been instrumental in the \n     revitalization of literally tens of thousands of communities \n     nationwide, and is an important tool in the NAACP's efforts \n     to help people and communities achieve their goals at no cost \n     to the taxpayer.\n       Through CRA, financial institutions are discovering that \n     there are benefits to working in and with low to moderate \n     income and minority communities. Since its enactment in 1977, \n     CRA has helped lenders tap into previously unchartered areas \n     and consequently they are learning what a viable, profitable \n     market the low-moderate and minority communities are.\n       One example of a CRA success story would be the NAACP's \n     Community Development and Resource Centers (CDRCs). The \n     NAACP, working together with NationsBank, opened our first \n     CDRC in 1992 in part to help NationsBank comply with CRA. \n     Since that time, NAACP-CDRCs have made mortgage, consumer and \n     small business loan referrals amounting to over $100 million, \n     and more than 10,000 individuals and businesses have received \n     counseling or technical assistance through CRDCs.\n       Due to the vital role the banking industry plays in the \n     success or failure of every American neighborhood, CRA is a \n     necessary tool for the sustained economic development of our \n     nation. Thus the NAACP urges you, in the strongest terms \n     possible, to oppose any amendments or bills that would in any \n     way weaken the effectiveness of CRA. The NAACP also urges \n     you, again in the strongest terms possible, to support any \n     move to expand or modernize CRA as the financial services \n     industry is allowed to change and grow. By not including CRA \n     in any restructuring of the financial services industry, you \n     would effectively be denying whole communities access to \n     much-needed mortgages, consumer or small business loans, or \n     basic financial assistance.\n       I hope that you will feel free to contact me if you have \n     any questions regarding the NAACP position on CRA, or if \n     there is any way that I can work with you to ensure that CRA \n     is allowed to continue to prosper and provide assistance to \n     people and communities across the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Hilary O. Shelton,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I note that the distinguished chairman wants to speak. The \nSenator from Nevada would like to get 5 to 6 minutes at some point, if \nthat can be accommodated.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent request, I was \nto be recognized next.\n  I suggest we let Senator Mack speak for 4 minutes, have the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada speak for 4 minutes, and then I will \nspeak for 4 minutes and we will be through. Would that work?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm and the other Members \non the floor for this time. I will be brief.\n  I have spoken on this issue throughout my time in the Senate serving \non the Banking Committee which now is into its 11th year. I also make \nthese comments from the perspective of an individual who was president \nof a small bank in southwest Florida for 5 years out of a 16-year \nbanking career.\n  One would think, listening to the comments that have been made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, that we were proposing to repeal \nCRA. We are not proposing that at all. There may be Members who want to \ndo that, but that is not what the issue is about. The issue is about \nregulatory overkill.\n  This little bank that I was president of had about $60 million in \nassets--very small bank--in a community that was developed, one of \nthese Florida developments, that began in the late 1950s. To suggest \nthat this small community bank in a very well-defined and confined \nmarket was not providing resources to that market is just absurd. If we \ndid not lend money into that market, we would, in fact, have gone \nbroke. So all I am suggesting is the amendment being proposed here is \nbeing sold as if we were trying to repeal CRA. The information I have \nis with the committee position: Only 2.8 percent of the total assets of \nthe banking industry in America are affected by this carve-out, 2.8 \npercent. There were 16,000 banks audited over a 9-year period and only \nthree of those banks--I am talking about small banks now--only three of \nthose banks were found to be significantly out of compliance.\n  Small banks in America need some regulatory relief. That is all we \nare suggesting here. Again, my experience was this little bank of $60 \nmillion in assets had to assign one individual whose job it was to put \npins into a map in our market showing where we had made real estate \nloans. That is all we had to do. But I had to assign one person to do \nthat. She had to put programs into effect in the bank to make sure we \nwere complying with lending to our community. It was the only place we \ncould have loaned.\n  So the idea that we needed to have the Community Reinvestment Act for \nmy bank and for small community banks is absurd. I ask my colleagues to \nreject the amendment and to support the committee position.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the chairman for accommodating me and allowing me \nto speak for 4 minutes.\n  Let me say we had much debate and much discussion. There are \namendments on bills that come and go. They really do not impact the \noverall outcome. This amendment is the most important amendment that \nwill be considered in this debate. If the Bryan amendment loses, we \nconvert what can be a bipartisan effort to get this legislation, which \nI strongly support and supported in the last Congress--and it becomes \nimmediately a partisan vote, and that legislation has no chance in that \nform of becoming law. Whatever\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\none's view is on CRA, and I understand we have widely different views, \nI respectfully submit this is not the vehicle to make this the issue. \nIf, as the distinguished chairman and others have said, CRA needs to be \nrevisited, let's do so in the context of some type of other legislation \nthat is presently before the Banking Committee. We have had no hearings \nat all on this.\n  The Bryan amendment does two very simple things. One, it retains the \ncurrent CRA provisions, including those provisions which relate to \nsmall banks that eliminate their need to even file a report. All they \nhave to do is to point for the bank examiner and say the records are in \nthe file cabinet. They need do no more. So this is not, in my judgment, \nan onerous burden.\n  And with respect to the new services that we permit banks to \nparticipate in, if Secretary Rubin and other experts who are looking at \nthe banking field are correct, that is the wave of the future. If we do \nnot require CRA as the condition of availing oneself of these new \nfinancial services, securities and insurance, in effect we marginalize \nand relegate CRA to a much lesser role.\n\n  What is accomplished? Hundreds of millions of dollars have been \ninvested in the inner cities in our country. Thousands of minority \nbusinesses have had an opportunity to participate, which they would not \notherwise have gotten, and home ownership opportunities have expanded \nfor literally millions of Americans. It would seem to me those are the \nkind of issues we can agree on--Democrats, Republicans, conservatives \nand liberals. CRA has accomplished much.\n  We have gone through this before. A year ago, we nearly got a bill. \nIt passed by a bipartisan majority in the House, with virtually the \nidentical provisions that relate to CRA as contained in the Bryan \namendment. It passed 16 to 2 out of the Banking Committee in this \nsession of Congress; in the House Banking Committee by a vote of 51 to \n8. This legislation has progressed with, again, virtually the identical \nprovisions as it relates to CRA that the Bryan amendment contains.\n  So why are we going through this? The protagonists, the bankers, the \ninsurance companies and the securities industry, do not oppose this \nlegislation. We are going through this because our able chairman, whom \nwe all greatly respect, says he needs leverage in dealing with the \nHouse. The last time I looked at the record of the composition of the \nHouse, the Republican Party was in the majority. Among its leaders were \npeople such as Tom Delay and Dick Armey, not exactly what you would \ncall liberal exponents, bleeding-heart types.\n  It seems to me the argument that we need leverage makes no sense at \nall.\n  Finally, let me say this may be the only opportunity in this Congress \nto vote on a civil rights amendment, a process that has worked well and \nhas served the nation well. It is not objected to by those who are \nstruggling to reach the compromises on this piece of legislation. We \nshould enact the Bryan amendment and move forward and get this bill \nover to the House, get it to conference and signed into law by the \nPresident. We have that opportunity only if the Bryan amendment \nprevails.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this has been a long debate and I think a \ngood debate. Rather than trying to go back and answer specific points \nthat have been made, and correct statements, let me just try to cut to \nthe heart of this. This is not about banks, even though the Independent \nBankers, the American Bankers Association, the Bankers Roundtable \noppose this amendment and support the underlying bill.\n  This is not about insurance companies. This is not about securities \ncompanies. This is about right and wrong. I have presented today, from \nredacted agreements, secret agreements that have been entered into by \ncommunity groups and banks, three examples, the only three we have, \nwhere over and over again community groups are paid cash payments in \nreturn for them withdrawing objections which they have made to banks \ntaking specific action, or where they have agreed not to raise an \nobjection.\n  So the first thing we are trying to do is bring integrity to the \nprocess by preventing people, in essence, from paying witnesses. How do \nwe try to do that? We try to do it in the following way: If you are a \nbank and you have an excellent CRA record, you have been in compliance \nfor three audits in a row and you are in compliance now--we do not in \nany way limit the ability of anybody to object to that bank doing what \nit has a right to do under law--all we are saying is you are innocent \nuntil proven guilty if you have a long record of compliance. If you are \ngoing to come in and prevent a bank from taking an action they have \nearned the right to do based on audits on community lending, and you \ncome in and say they are racists, or they are loan sharks, that is not \nenough. What we require is you present substantial evidence.\n\n  How is that defined? The Supreme Court defines substantial evidence \nas ``more than a mere scintilla . . . such relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a claim.''\n  That is not a high standard. That is simply a credibility standard. \nAnd all over America--we have professional protesters in Boston who are \nprotesting bank mergers in Illinois. What do they have to do with \ncommunity lending in Illinois? Nothing. But they file a protest. The \nbank is deathly afraid of being held up in its merger, for example. \nObviously, they do not want to be called bad names by people who are \nprofessionals at calling people bad names. So they end up paying these \ngroups cash. That is not right.\n  This is an issue of right and wrong. The second issue is the issue \nrelating to small banks. Little banks in rural communities in total \nhold only 2 percent of the assets of banks, but in 16,300 audits of \nthese banks, each one of them on average cost the bank $80,000 to \ncomply with. They found three banks in 9 years that are substantially \nout of compliance. They made these little banks pay $1.3 billion to \nfind three bad actors. And little banks all over America are threatened \nby this regulatory burden. So we exempt them from it.\n  Mr. President, 44 percent of the enforcement effort is going to banks \nwith 2.8 percent of the capital. Take that enforcement effort and put \nit where the money is and you will get more community lending, not \nless.\n  Finally, it is not as if the Sarbanes amendment simply strikes our \nprovisions. But the Sarbanes amendment is the largest expansion of CRA \nin American history.\n  It would impose a million-dollar-a-day fine on bank officers and \nboard members if they fell out of compliance. The American Bankers \nAssociation and the Independent Bankers Association have urged us not \nto do this, because they will not be able to get board members to serve \nand they will not be able to hire officers if they have to buy \ninsurance to potentially pay a million-dollar-a-day fine if they fall \nout of compliance with this regulation.\n  What is the justification for this regulatory overkill when you have \nhad three cases of substantial noncompliance out of 16,300 audits over \n9 years? What is wrong with this picture?\n  What is wrong with the picture is, sadly, that many of our Democrat \ncolleagues have decided, even though the spokesman for CRA testifying \nbefore our committee said, yes, there are abuses and, yes, they hurt \nthe process and, yes, there is what they call green mail. Most people \ncall it blackmail. But our colleagues have taken the extreme position \nthat not only will they not address these abuses, they are going to \nvastly expand this to insurance, to securities and, with these million-\ndollar-a-day fines, producing a situation where every abuse we are \nconcerned about today is going to be greatly expanded.\n  I urge our Democrat colleagues, if you support CRA, to help us bring \nan end to these abuses. If you support CRA, end the regulatory \npaperwork burden overkill so we can focus in this law on the real \nproblem. While groups claim we are endangering CRA, it is those who \nwill not fix clear wrongs that scream out that endanger it.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment and ask for the \nyeas and the nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 900, which \nwill modernize our financial services laws.\n  If our financial industries are going to be able to compete in the \nworld market in the next century, we must modernize our depression-era \nbanking laws.\n  The next century is almost here. We all talk about a Y2K problem. \nWhat about the antique banking law problem? Entering the new century \nwith antiquated banking laws would be foolhardy. We have to reform our \nfinancial service system.\n  Most of the financial services and bank laws that are on the books \ntoday are based on the Glass-Steagall Act, legislation passed in 1935, \nover 60 years ago!\n  The world has changed a great deal since then, and it is going to \nchange further and faster as we move into the 21st century. We need to \nupdate our outdated laws to account for this change and to give \nflexibility to American companies.\n  At the same time, we must make sure that any bill we pass treats all \nthe segments of the financial industry fairly, and that there is a \nlevel playing field for all of the groups involved.\n  If history is any indication, any new law we pass will be with us for \na long time, so we had better get it right.\n  We've been working to get it right for a long time. Eleven years ago, \nwhen I was a member of the House Banking Committee, we were able to \nreport a financial services modernization bill to the floor.\n  Last year the House passed a bill and the Senate was able to pass a \nbill out of committee.\n  As a Member of the House last year, I supported the bill that passed \nby one vote in the House. It wasn't perfect. There were things I would \nhave liked to change.\n  But I believed at the time that we couldn't allow the search for \nperfection to block real progress.\n  That's even more true this year.\n  We can talk about banking reform--and negotiate issues--for another \ntwelve years--and we won't ever be able to make everyone totally happy.\n  There are too many competing interests and too much complexity is \ninvolved in the rapidly changing financial services industry for us \never to find a regulatory framework that will completely satisfy all of \nthe players involved.\n  It's not going to happen.\n  At some point, we just have to do the best we can and move ahead. I'm \nconvinced we have reached that point now--we should pass this bill.\n  Fortunately, the bill our committee approved this year is even better \nthan the bills we considered last year. Chairman Gramm and his staff \ndid a good job--the committee did a good job.\n  It is time to move ahead.\n  We should pass a clean bill quickly and send a message to the other \nbody that we are serious about financial services reform.\n  This bill has many important provisions. And I'm not going to talk \nabout them all, but I would like to mention one issue in particular.\n  The one issue my bankers bring up every time they come to visit is \nCommunity Reinvestment Act or CRA reform.\n  I am very pleased the chairman has agreed to put CRA provisions in \nthe bill and that we were able to pass Senator Shelby's amendment in \ncommittee that will provide CRA relief, especially to small banks in my \nState and across the Nation.\n  Senator Shelby's amendment will exempt 154 small banks in Kentucky \nfrom Federal CRA burdens.\n  These banks have always invested in the community. That is where \ntheir business is. A bank in Clinton, Kentucky does not lend in \nLouisville or Lexington, it lends in Clinton.\n  I have a letter from Robert Black, president and CEO of the Clinton \nBank. Mr. Black says: ``We were using good CRA practices long before \nthe burdensome regulation was passed. This regulation is now requiring \nmuch of our time preparing documentation and placing pins in a map just \nto prove that we made loans in every community.''\n  I should mention that Clinton, Kentucky was not named after Bill \nClinton.\n  I would also like to read a passage from a letter from E.L. Williams, \npresident of the Citizens Deposit Bank of Arlington, in Arlington \nKentucky.\n  Mr. Williams states: ``In our opinion, the time and money afforded to \nCRA compliance in small banks could be used to a much greater \nadvantage, such as lending and assisting the low to moderate income \npopulation for which the CRA was originally implemented.''\n  These small banks will lend in their own communities with or without \nCRA. They don't need Federal regulators breathing down their necks to \nmake sure they are doing what they would be doing anyway.\n  I would personally like to see even greater reform of CRA--across the \nboard--but our small banks really need and deserve relief and this bill \nprovides it.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I repeat that this bill is not perfect. \nBut it is a dramatic improvement over the antique financial laws we are \noperating under now and it is a dramatic improvement over the Sarbanes \nsubstitute.\n  We must enter the 21st century ready to compete and this bill will \nmake that possible.\n  It is a good bill--I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4788-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4788-S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today, May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo,'' \nmarks an important holiday for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans alike, \nand it will be observed with celebrations and festivities across the \nUnited States. Contrary to a popular misconception, Cinco de Mayo does \nnot commemorate Mexico's independence from Spain. That holiday is \ncelebrated on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo marks the victory in \n1862 of the Mexican army over a larger, better armed and better trained \ninvading French army at La Batalla de Puebla.\n  After gaining independence in 1821, Mexico endured a series of set \nbacks while trying to establish a republic. By the late 1850s, Mexico \nwas in the grips of a severe economic crisis, and the treasury was \nbankrupt. In 1861, President Benito Juarez placed a moratorium halting \npayments on foreign debt. Since much of Mexico's debt was owed to \nFrance, Napoleon III responded by invading Mexico. After landing in the \nport of Veracruz, the French army, which was considered the finest \nmilitary force of the period, expected to march through the country and \neasily capture the capital, Mexico City. However, a small Mexican army, \nunder the command of General Ignacio Zaragosa, mounted a strong defense \nat the town of Pueblo and routed the invading force.\n  The stunning victory was short-lived, though. The French returned \nwith reinforcements and were able to defeat Mexican forces the \nfollowing year. But they were only able to control Mexico for four \nyears, and President Juarez regained power in 1867.\n  Although, in the end, La Batalla de Puebla had little lasting \nmilitary significance, it was, culturally, a watershed event for the \nfledging nation, and for Latin America as a whole. After seeing \nEurope's best army routed by a hastily gathered and largely untrained \nMexican defense, European leaders became more wary of exerting military \nforce in the Americans. Europe never sent another invading force to the \nAmericas after this episode.\n  The victory at Puebla also instilled a great sense of pride and \npatriotism in the people of Mexico. They proved their military mettle \nto themselves and the world, and their government, led by President \nJuarez, secured legitimacy in the eyes of other nations.\n  Finally, La Batalla de Puebla asserted the right of people living in \nformer European colonies to self determination and national \nsovereignty, and it unified all the citizens of Mexico, from landowners \nto laborers, in a common cause. It marks the point when people stopped \nseeing themselves as subjects of monarchy in a distant land or \nrestricted their loyalty to a particular state or region, but instead \nviewed themselves as citizens of a new nation, a nation united under \nthe green, white and red colors of the Mexican flag.\n  Much has been said in recent years about the ``commercialization'' of \nCino de Mayo, and it is true that importance of this holiday often has \nbeen overlooked. However, to most Mexican-Americans, or Chicanos, Cinco \nde Mayo has a special meaning. Many scholars believe La Batalla de \nPuebla produced the first military hero from the American Southwestern \nregion in General Ignacio Zaragosa, who was born in Texas. The holiday \nhas long been a lesson in overcoming great odds through determination \nand unity. Today, Cinco de Mayo is an occasion for people of Mexican \ndescent to come together to express pride in their history, and I \nencourage all Americans to enjoy this opportunity to celebrate and \nappreciate the contributions of Mexican culture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4789-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4789-S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RUMORS OF NURSING HOME BANKRUPTCY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I serve as chairman of the Senate Aging \nSubcommittee and I feel a necessity to inform my colleagues about the \nissue of rumors about the pending bankruptcy of some nursing home \nchains in the United States.\n  There are reports in the press, and in discussions with my colleagues \nI have received information, indicating that one and possibly two large \nnursing home chains may be facing bankruptcy in the near future. That \nhas an economic side and it has a human side. I will speak first about \nthe human side.\n  Should one or both of these nursing home chains go bankrupt, we would \nhave an immediate challenge to ensure the continued care of somewhere \nbetween 35,000 residents, on the one hand, and 70,000, on the other, in \nthese respective homes where they are currently under care. This would \nbe a significant task. Nursing home residents are frail and are not \neasily moved. Moving them runs the risk of causing ``transfer trauma,'' \na condition that can result in death. Therefore, it is critical that we \nkeep focused on preventing avoidable harm and take precautions to \nprevent this from happening.\n  I have introduced legislation to ensure that the quality of patient \ncare is monitored if there would be bankruptcy. My legislation requires \nthe appointment of an ombudsman to act as an advocate for the patient. \nThis change will ensure that bankruptcy judges are fully aware of all \nthe facts when they guide a health care provider through the process of \nbankruptcy. Prior to a chapter 11 filing, or immediately thereafter, \nthe debtor employs a health care crisis consultant to help it in its \nreorganization effort. The first step is usually cutting costs. \nSometimes this step may result in a lower quality of care for the \npatients who live there. The appointment, then, of an ombudsman, should \nbalance the interests between the creditor and the patient. These \ninterests need balancing because the court-appointed officials owe \nfiduciary duties to creditors and the estate but not necessarily to the \npatients.\n  There will be occasions which illustrate that what may be in the best \ninterest of creditors may not always be consistent with the patients' \nbest interest. The trustee's interest, for example, is to maximize the \namount of the estate to pay off the creditors. The more assets the \ntrustee disburses, the more his payment will be. On the other hand, the \nombudsman for the patient is designed to ensure continued quality of \ncare at least above some minimum standards. Such quality of care \nstandards currently exist throughout the health care environment, from \nthe health care facility itself to State standards and even Federal \nstandards that were adopted in 1987.\n  I would like to have my colleagues consider the following excerpt \nfrom the Los Angeles Times on September 28, 1997, which describes the \nunconscionable, pathetic, and traumatizing consequences of a sudden \nnursing home closing because of bankruptcy:\n\n       It could not be determined Saturday how many more elderly \n     or chronically ill patients may be affected by the health \n     care company's financial problems. Those at the Reseda Care \n     Center in the San Fernando Valley, including a 106-year-old \n     woman, were rolled into the streets late Friday in \n     wheelchairs and on hospital beds, bundled in blankets as \n     relatives scurried to gather up clothes and other personal \n     belongings.\n  The presence of an ombudsman should help prevent a recurrence of \ninstances similar to what I just described, where trustees quickly \nclose health care facilities without notifying appropriate state and \nfederal agencies and without notifying the bankruptcy court.\n  I began discussions with the Health Care Financing Administration at \nthe beginning of April to urge them to take seriously the rumors we \nwere hearing about possible nursing home bankruptcies and to encourage \nthem to make preparations. I called for contingency plans that would \nprepare, well in advance, for the daunting challenges bankruptcies \nwould pose to various federal and state agencies. HCFA briefed the \nstaff of the Aging Committee, as well as staff from the Finance \nCommittee and Budget Committee. While the HCFA staff appreciated the \nseverity and size of the problem of ensuring resident safety in the \nevent of a bankruptcy, they did not have a plan--or even a plan for a \nplan.\n  I wrote to the HCFA Administrator urging her to take the effort very \nseriously, to keep at the planning and to stay in touch with my office. \nOnly on April 28th did I hear from her office\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nthat we could expect to see the plan in the next two weeks. That is why \nI wrote to her again on April 29, to tell her to get on with the effort \nand to let me and interested Members know of the plan to ensure that \nthe people in the affected nursing homes will be protected.\n  Once we are assured that residents will be safe we can turn to the \nfinancial part of the bankruptcies. Now I will address these financial \nissues.\n  Before we take any action involving the taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars, we should ask, and get solid answers to, some critical \nquestions.\n  The first is this: if the rumors of financial distress are true, how \nis it that some providers are in such distress while others seem not to \nbe? What factors have put certain companies at particular risk? The \nanswer to that question will go a long way to help us know what kind of \nresponse their situation demands.\n  At this point, I'd like to make an observation about the Medicare \nelement of this situation.\n  This is in response to the one excuse you are going to find from some \nof these changes why something ought to be done in the balanced budget \namendment of 1997.\n  A Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Skilled Nursing Facilities was \nmandated by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). Some argue that, \ncomparing CBO's 1997 baseline with its 1999 baseline, Medicare has \nsaved $7 billion more than originally anticipated, and that this pushed \nthese companies over the edge.\n  But we need to ask whether or not it did.\n  CBO has recently clarified its baselines, explaining that the alleged \ndifference between the two baselines comes from an apples-to-oranges \ncomparison: the 1997 baseline included Part B spending on patients in \nthese facilities, while the 1999 baseline does not. When apples are \ncompared to apples, CBO tells us, the Medicare Part A baseline for \nSkilled Nursing Facilities has decreased by only $200 million over 5 \nyears--not by the $7 billion that we are hearing. Of course this \ndoesn't tell us what is going on in the real world--it only tells us \nthat the discussion should not be about CBO's baselines, it should be \nabout what is really going on out there.\n  And that is what we need to find out.\n  Next, questions have been raised by shareholders, in class action \nsuits against the management of these companies, about the competence \nand effectiveness of the management of these two companies. Did these \ncompanies try to grow too large, too fast? Did they take on more debt \nthan they could manage? Was their business strategy flawed? A host of \nquestions need to be answered about the internal operation of these \ncompanies--to see if they were being well run--before we assume that \nmore taxpayer dollars will fix the problem. Otherwise we could wind up \nsubsidizing the mistakes of well compensated executives.\n  These are serious questions that should be answered by the committees \nof this body. We should make full use of the evaluators who work for \nCongress. And the Administration should devote some effort to the \ninquiry as well. We need to understand the problem before we propose a \nsolution.\n  Yet, some solutions are being presumed, and they are being presumed \nbased on that apples-to-oranges comparison which says there has been $7 \nbillion more saved from Medicare than was anticipated in the 1997 \nbalanced budget amendment. We should make haste to get these answers, \nand not rush blindly into what could otherwise be a thoughtless \nbailout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4790-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMENDING THE EFFORTS OF THE REVEREND JESSE JACKSON\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

A bill to establish a National Ocean Council, a Commission on \nOcean Policy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                         the oceans act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Oceans Act \nof\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\n1999, legislation that the Senate unanimously passed in November 1997. \nI am pleased to be joined in this endeavor by Senators Stevens, Kerry, \nBreaux, Inouye, Kennedy, Boxer, Biden, Lautenberg, Akaka, Murkowski, \nThurmond, Murray, Cleland, and Wyden. Mr. President, plainly and \nsimply, this bill calls for a plan of action for the twenty-first \ncentury to explore, protect, and use our oceans and coasts through the \ncoming millennium.\n  This is not the first time we have faced the need for a national \nocean policy. Three decades ago, our Nation roared into space, \ninvesting tens of billions of dollars to investigate the moon and the \nSea of Tranquility. During that golden era of science, some of us also \nrecognized the importance of exploring the seas on our own planet. In \n1966, Congress enacted the Marine Resources and Engineering Development \nAct in order to define national objectives and programs with respect to \nthe oceans. That legislation laid the foundation for U.S. ocean and \ncoastal policy and programs and has guided their development for three \ndecades. I was elected to the Senate just three months after the 1966 \nAct was enacted into law, but I am pleased that both Senators Inouye \nand Kennedy, the two cosponsors of the 1966 Act still serving in the \nSenate, have agreed to join me today in introducing the Oceans Act.\n  One of the central elements of the 1966 Act was establishment of a \npresidential commission to develop a plan for national action in the \noceans and atmosphere. Dr. Julius A. Stratton, a former president of \nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then-chairman of the Ford \nFoundation, led the Commission on an unprecedented, and since \nunrepeated, investigation of this nation's relationship with the oceans \nand the atmosphere. The Stratton Commission and its congressional \nadvisors (including Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Norris Cotton) \nworked together in a bipartisan fashion. In fact, the Commission was \nestablished and carried out its mandate in the Democratic \nAdministration of Lyndon Johnson and saw its findings implemented by \nthe Republicans under President Richard Nixon. With a staff of 35 \npeople, the commissioners hear and consulted over 1,000 people, visited \nevery coastal area of this country, and submitted some 126 \nrecommendations in a 1969 report to Congress entitled Our Nation and \nthe Sea. Those recommendations led directly to the creation of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1970, laid the \ngroundwork for enactment of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in \n1972, and established priorities for federal ocean activities that have \nguided this Nation for almost thirty years.\n  While the Stratton Commission performed its job with vision and \nintegrity, the world has changed since 1966. Today, half of the U.S. \npopulation lives within 50 miles of our shores and more than 30 percent \nof the Gross Domestic Product is generated in the coastal zone. Ocean \nand coastal resources once considered inexhaustible are severely \ndepleted, and wetlands and other marine habitats are threatened by \npollution and human activities. In addition, the U.S. regulatory and \nlegal framework has developed over the years with the passage of a \nnumber of statutes in addition to CZMA. These include the Endangered \nSpecies Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, \nResearch, and Sanctuaries Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, and \nthe Oil Pollution Act. It is time to conduct a review that looks at \ncoordination and duplication of programs and policies developed under \nthese laws.\n  Today people who work and live on the water face a patchwork of \nconfusing and sometimes contradictory federal and state regulations. \nThis bill would allow us to reduce conflicts while maintaining \nenvironmental and health safeguards. One illustration of the type of \nsituation that must be corrected is the southeast shrimp trawl fishery. \nShrimpers are required under the Endangered Species Act to use panels \nor grates (known as turtle excluder devices or TEDs) in their nets to \nprotect endangered sea turtles. The panels also reduce catches of small \nfish (bycatch), a new requirement of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. \nUnfortunately, however, the government has approved one TED for turtle \nprotection and another for bycatch reduction--forcing the fishermen to \nuse two separate devices, cut two holes in their nets, and double their \nshrimp loss. Anyone who wonders about public interest in regulatory \nreform has only to talk to a McClellanville, SC shrimper.\n  The Oceans Act is vital to the continued health of the oceans and \nprosperity of our coasts. It is patterned after and would replace the \n1966 Act. Like that Act, it is comprised of three major elements:\n  First, the bill calls for development and implementation of a \ncoherent national ocean and coastal policy to conserve and sustainably \nuse fisheries and other ocean and coastal resources, protect the marine \nenvironment and human safety, explore ocean frontiers, create marine \ntechnologies and economic opportunities, and preserve U.S. leadership \non ocean and coastal issues.\n  Second, the bill would establish a 16-member Commission, similar to \nthe Stratton Commission, to examine ocean and coastal activities and \nreport within 18 months on recommendations for a national policy. \nCommission members would be drawn from State and local governments, \nindustry, academic and technical institutions, and public interest \norganizations involved in ocean and coastal activities. In developing \nits recommendations, the Commission would assess federal programs and \nfunding priorities, ocean-related infrastructure requirements, \nconflicts among marine users, and technological opportunities. The bill \nauthorizes appropriations of $6 million over two years to support \nCommission activities; last year's Omnibus Appropriations bill included \n$3.5 million to fund such a Commission.\n\n  Third, the bill would create a high-level federal interagency Council \nthat would include the heads of the Departments of Commerce, Navy, \nState, Transportation, and the Interior, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality, and the National Economic Council. This Council \nwould advise the President and serve as a forum for developing and \nimplementing an ocean and coastal policy, provide for coordination of \nfederal budgets and programs, and work with non-federal and \ninternational organizations.\n  By establishing an action plan for ocean and coastal activities, the \nOceans Act should also contribute substantially to national goals and \nobjectives in the areas of education and research, economic \ndevelopment, and public safety. With respect to education and research, \nour view of the oceans thirty years ago was based on a remarkably small \namount of information. When Jack Kennedy was in the White House, we \nwere just beginning to develop the capability for exploring the oceans, \nand the driving factor was the military need to hide our submarines \nfrom the Soviets during the Cold War. What we knew of the oceans at \nthat time was based as much on what fishermen brought up in their nets \nas it was on reliable scientific investigation.\n  Nowhere is the need for U.S. leadership more evident than in the area \nof ocean exploration. Today, we still have explored only a tiny \nfraction of the sea, but with the use of new technologies what we have \nfound is truly incredible. For example, hydrothermal vents, hot water \ngeysers on the deep ocean floor, were discovered just 20 years ago by \noceanographers trying to understand the formation of the earth's crust. \nNow this discovery had led to the identification of nearly 300 new \ntypes of marine animals with untold pharmaceutical and biomedical \npotential. In recent years, scientists from 19 nations have joined in \nan international partnership, headed by Admiral Watkins, to explore the \nhistory and structure of the Earth beneath the oceans basins. Their \nship, the Resolution, is the world's largest scientific research vessel \nand can drill in water depths of up 8,200 meters. Over the past 12 \nyears, it has recovered more than 115 miles of core samples through the \nworld oceans. Recently ship scientists worked off the coast of South \nCarolina collecting new evidence of a large meteor that struck the \nEarth 65 million years ago, and is thought to have triggered climate \nchange that may be linked to the disappearance of the dinosaurs.\n  Many of our marine research efforts could have profound impacts on \nour\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\neconomic well-being. For example, research on coastal ocean currents \nand other processes that affect shoreline erosion is critical to \neffective management of the shoreline. Oceanographers are working with \nfederal, state, and local managers to use this new understanding in \nprotecting beachfront property and the lives of those who reside and \nwork in coastal communities. Development of underwater cameras and \nsonar, begun in the 1940s for the U.S. Navy, has led to major strides \nnot only for military uses, but for marine archaeologists and \nscientists exploring unknown stretches of sea floor. Consumers have \nbenefited from the technology now used in video cameras. Sonar has \nbroad applications in both the military and commercial sector.\n  Finally, marine biotechnology research is thought to be one of the \ngreatest remaining technological and industrial frontiers. Among the \nopportunities which it may offer are to: restore and protect marine \necosystems; monitor human health and treat disease; increase food \nsupplies through aquaculture; enhance seafood safety and quality; \nprovide new types and sources of industrial materials and processes; \nand understand biological and geochemical processes in the world ocean.\n  In addition to the economic opportunities offered by our marine \nresearch investment, traditional marine activities play an important \nrole in our national economic outlook. Ninety-five percent of our \ninternational trade is shipped on the ocean. In 1996, commercial \nfishermen in the United States landed almost 10 billion pounds of fish \nwith a value of $3.5 billion. Their fishing-related activities \ncontributed over $42 billion to the U.S. economy. During the same \nperiod, marine anglers contributed another $20 billion. Travel and \ntourism also contribute over $700 billion to our economy, much of which \nis generated in coastal areas. With a sound national ocean and coastal \npolicy and effective marine resource management, these numbers have \nnowhere to go but up.\n  With respect to public safety, it is particularly important to \ndevelop ocean and coastal priorities that reflect the changes we have \nseen in recent years. Before World War II, most of the U.S. shoreline \nwas sparsely populated. There were long, wild stretches of coast, \ndotted with an occasional port city, fishing village, or sleepy resort. \nMost barrier islands had few residents or were uninhabited. After the \nwar, people began pouring in, and coastal development began a period of \nexplosive growth. In my state of South Carolina, our beaches attract \nmillions of visitors every year, and more and more people are choosing \nto move to the coast--making the coastal counties the fastest growing \nones in the state. Seventeen of the twenty fastest growing states in \nthe nation are coastal states--which compounds the situation that the \nmost densely populated regions already border the ocean. With \npopulation growth comes the demand for highways, shopping centers, \nschools, and sewers that permanently alter the landscape. If people are \nto continue to live and work on the coast, we must do a better job of \nplanning how we impact the very regions in which we all want to live.\n\n  There is no better example of how our ocean and coastal policies \naffect public safety, than to look at the effects of hurricanes. \nThroughout the 1920s, hurricanes killed 2,122 Americans while causing \nabout $1.8 billion in property damages. By contrast, in the first five \nyears of the 1990s, hurricanes killed 111 Americans, and resulted in \ndamages of about $35 billion. While we have made notable advances in \nearly warning and evacuation systems to protect human lives, the risk \nof property loss continues to escalate and coastal inhabitants are more \nvulnerable to major storms than they ever have been. In 1989, Hurricane \nHugo came ashore in South Carolina, leaving more than $6 billion in \ndamages. Of that total from Hugo, the federal government paid out more \nthan $2.8 billion in disaster assistance and more than $400 million \nfrom the National Flood Insurance Program. The payments from private \ninsurance companies were equally staggering. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew \nstruck southern Florida and slammed into low lying areas of Louisiana, \nforever changing the lives of more than a quarter of a million people \nand causing an estimated $25 to $30 billion dollars in damage. \nHurricanes demonstrate that the human desire to live near the ocean and \nalong the coast comes with both a responsibility and a cost.\n  The oceans are part of our culture, part of our heritage, part of our \neconomy, and part of our future. Those who doubt the need for this \nlegislation need only pick up a newspaper and they will be face to face \nwith pressing ocean and coastal issues. And while our coastal waters \nare governed by the United States or all of us, beyond our waters \nprogress relies primarily on international cooperation. There are no \nboundaries at sea, no national borders with fences and checkpoints. \nDeciding how to manage all these problems and use the seas is one of \nthe most complicated tasks we can tackle.\n  Therefore, we need to be smart about ocean policy--we need the best \nminds to come together and take a look at what the real challenges are. \nIt is not enough to sit back and assume the role of caretakers. We must \nbe proactive and develop a plan for the future.\n  The United Nations declared 1998 to the be the Year of the Ocean in \npart to encourage governments and the pubic to pay adequate attention \nto the need to protect the marine environment and to ensure a healthy \nocean. This is an unprecedented opportunity to follow up the Year of \nthe Ocean activities by celebrating and enhancing what has been \naccomplished in understanding and managing our oceans.\n  The Stratton Commission stated in 1969: ``How fully and wisely the \nUnited States uses the sea in the decades ahead will affect profoundly \nits security, its economy, its ability to meet increasing demands for \nfood and raw materials, its position and influence in the world \ncommunity, and the quality of the environment in which its people \nlive.'' Those words are as true today as they were 30 years ago.\n  Mr. President, it is time to look towards the next 30 years. This \nbill offers us the vision and understanding needed to establish sound \nocean and coastal policies for the 21st century, and I thank the \ncosponsors of the legislation for joining with me in recognizing it \nsignificance. We look forward to working together in the bipartisan \nspirit of the Stratton Commission to enact legislation that ensures the \ndevelopment of an integrated national ocean and coastal policy well \ninto the next millennium. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 959\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Oceans Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Covering more than two-thirds of the Earth's surface, \n     the oceans and Great Lakes play a critical role in the global \n     water cycle and in regulating climate, sustain a large part \n     of Earth's biodiversity, provide an important source of food \n     and a wealth of other natural products, act as a frontier to \n     scientific exploration, are critical to national security, \n     and provide a vital means of transportation. The coasts, \n     transition between land and open ocean, are regions of \n     remarkable high biological productivity, contribute more than \n     30 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, and are of \n     considerable importance for recreation, waste disposal, and \n     mineral exploration.\n       (2) Ocean and coastal resources are susceptible to change \n     as a direct and indirect result of human activities, and such \n     changes can significantly impact the ability of the oceans \n     and Great Lakes to provide the benefits upon which the Nation \n     depends. Changes in ocean and coastal processes could affect \n     global patterns, marine productivity and bio-diversity, \n     environmental quality, national security, economic \n     competitiveness, availability of energy, vulnerability to \n     natural hazards, and transportation safety and efficiency.\n       (3) Ocean and coastal resources are not infinite, and human \n     pressure on them is increasing. One half of the Nation's \n     population lives within 50 miles of the coast, ocean and \n     coastal resources once considered inexhaustible are not \n     threatened with depletion, and if population trends continue \n     as expected, pressure on and conflicting demands for ocean \n     and coastal resources will increase further as will \n     vulnerability to coastal hazards.\n       (4) Marine transportation is key to United States \n     participation in the global economy and to the wide range of \n     activities carried\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\n     out in ocean and coastal regions. Inland waterway and ports \n     are the link between marine activities in ocean and coastal \n     regions and the supporting transportation infrastructure \n     ashore. International trade is expected to triple by 2020. \n     The increase has the potential to outgrow--\n       (A) the capabilities of the marine transportation system to \n     ensure safety; and\n       (B) the existing capacity of ports and waterways.\n       (5) Marine technologies hold tremendous promise for \n     expanding the range and increasing the utility of products \n     from the oceans and Great Lakes, improving the stewardship of \n     ocean and coastal resources, and contributing to business \n     and manufacturing innovations and the creation of new \n     jobs.\n       (6) Research has uncovered the link between oceanic and \n     atmospheric processes and improved understanding of world \n     climate patterns and forecasts. Important new advances, \n     including availability of military technology have made \n     feasible the exploration of large areas of the ocean which \n     were inaccessible several years ago. In designating 1998 as \n     ``The Year of the Ocean'', the United Nations high-lighted \n     the value of increasing our knowledge of the oceans.\n       (7) It has been more than 30 years since the Commission on \n     Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources (known as the \n     Stratton Commission) conducted a comprehensive examination of \n     ocean and coastal activities that led to enactment of major \n     legislation and the establishment of key oceanic and \n     atmospheric institutions.\n       (8) A review of existing activities is essential to respond \n     to the changes that have occurred over the past three decades \n     and to develop an effective new policy for the twenty-first \n     century to conserve and use, in a sustainable manner, ocean \n     and coastal resources, protect the marine environment, \n     explore ocean frontiers, protect human safety, and create \n     marine technologies and economic opportunities.\n       (9) Changes in United States laws and policies since the \n     Stratton Commission, such as the enactment of the Coastal \n     Zone Management Act, have increased the role of the States in \n     the management of ocean and coastal resources.\n       (10) While significant Federal and State ocean and coastal \n     programs are underway, those Federal programs would benefit \n     from a coherent national ocean and coastal policy that \n     reflects the need for cost-effective allocation of fiscal \n     resources, improved interagency coordination, and \n     strengthened partnerships with State, private, and \n     international entities engaged in ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (b) Purpose and Objectives.--The purpose of this Act is to \n     develop and maintain, consistent with the obligations of the \n     United States under international law, a coordinated, \n     comprehensive, and long-range national policy with respect to \n     ocean and coastal activities that will assist the Nation in \n     meeting the following objectives:\n       (1) The protection of life and property against natural and \n     manmade hazards.\n       (2) Responsible stewardship, including use, of fishery \n     resources and other ocean and coastal resources.\n       (3) The protection of the marine environment and prevention \n     of marine pollution.\n       (4) The enhancement of marine-related commerce and \n     transportation, the resolution of conflicts among users of \n     the marine environment, and the engagement of the private \n     sector in innovative approaches for sustainable use of living \n     marine resources.\n       (5) The expansion of human knowledge of the marine \n     environment including the role of the oceans in climate and \n     global environmental change and the advance of education and \n     training in fields related to ocean and coastal activities.\n       (6) The continued investment in and development and \n     improvement of the capabilities, performance, use, and \n     efficiency of technologies for use in ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (7) Close cooperation among all government agencies and \n     departments to ensure--\n       (A) coherent regulation of ocean and coastal activities;\n       (B) availability and appropriate allocation of Federal \n     funding, personnel, facilities, and equipment for such \n     activities; and\n       (C) cost-effective and efficient operation of Federal \n     departments, agencies, and programs involved in ocean and \n     coastal activities.\n       (8) The enhancement of partnerships with State and local \n     governments with respect to oceans and coastal activities, \n     including the management of ocean and coastal resources and \n     identification of appropriate opportunities for policy-making \n     and decision-making at the State and local level.\n       (9) The preservation of the role of the United States as a \n     leader in ocean and coastal activities, and, when it is in \n     the national interest, the cooperation by the United States \n     with other nations and international organizations in ocean \n     and coastal activities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

REPEAL OF 1966 STATUTE.\n\n       The Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act of \n     1966 (33 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) is repealed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 960. A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to establish \npension counseling programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n             pension assistance and counseling act of 1999\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce \nlegislation to achieve one of my primary objectives as chairman of the \nSpecial Committee on Aging: to help workers and retirees achieve a \nsecure retirement.\n  As with any discussion about retirement planning, it is the norm to \npoint to the ``three-legged stool'' of retirement--Social Security, \npersonal savings, and a pension. Unfortunately, the legs of the stool \nmay be getting warped.\n  This legislation is the result of a hearing held by the Aging \nCommittee in the 105th Congress. The Aging Committee confronted an \nissue that is affecting hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees--\nmiscalculation of their hard-earned pensions. This hearing was intended \nto raise consumer awareness about the need to be pro-active about \npolicing your pension. As one of our witnesses said, ``never assume \nyour pension is error-free.''\n  While it is impossible to know how many pension payments and lump sum \ndistributions may be miscalculated, we know the number is on the rise. \nAn audit conducted last Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation--focused on plans that were voluntarily terminated--showed \nthat the number of people underpaid has increased from 2.8 to 8.2 \npercent. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of people \nreceiving lump sum distributions who end up getting shortchanged could \nbe 15 to 20 percent. Those numbers are very disturbing. The practical \nimpact is that retirees, and young and old workers alike, are losing \ndollars that they have earned.\n  Workers and retirees need to be aware that they are at risk. They can \nhelp themselves by knowing how their benefits are calculated, that they \nshould keep all the documents their employer gives them, and to start \nasking questions at a young age--don't wait until the eve of \nretirement.\n  Unfortunately, policing your pension is not easy. Employers are \ntrying to do a good job but they are confronted with one of the most \ncomplex regulatory schemes in the Federal Government. Pensions operate \nin a complex universe of laws, rules, and regulations. Over the last 20 \nyears, 16 laws have been enacted that require employers to amend their \npension plans and then notify their workers of changes. It is not a \nsimple task. If employers have problems trying to comply with Federal \nrequirements, it is understandable that workers and retirees are having \ntrouble getting a grasp on how their pension works.\n  Trying to educate yourself about pensions implies that someone is out \nthere providing information to those who need it. That is where the \nlegislation that I am introducing today comes in. People who are \nconcerned about their pensions--whether it's an unintentional mistake \nor outright fraud--often don't have anywhere to go for expert advice.\n  Fortunately, there is an answer. Already authorized by the Older \nAmericans Act, seven pension counseling projects have assisted \nthousands of people around this country with their pension problems. \nThese projects provide information and counseling to retirees, and \nyoung and old workers in a very cost-effective manner.\n  Each project received $75,000 of Federal assistance over a 17-month \nperiod. As is normal for other programs under the Older Americans Act, \nthese dollars were supplemented by money raised from private sources. \nDuring their operation, the projects recovered nearly $2 million in \npension benefits and payments. That is a return of $4 for every $1 \nspent.\n  My legislation contains three key provisions: first, it updates the \nOlder Americans Act to encourage the creation of more pension \ncounseling projects. While 10 projects in 15 states currently exist, \nthey are not enough to reach the 80 million people who are covered by \npensions in this country. Hopefully, more counseling projects can be \nestablished to provide more regionally comprehensive assistance.\n  Second, the legislation would create an 800 number that people could \ncall for one-stop advice on where to get assistance. Jurisdiction over \npension issues is spread across three government agencies--none of \nwhich are focused on helping individuals with individual problems--\nespecially if the problem does not seem to be a clear fiduciary breach \nor indicate that there may be criminal wrongdoing. An 800 number \nlinking people to assistance will help close that gap.\n  Finally, the legislation would transfer authority for the \ndemonstration\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\nprojects to Title VII of the Older Americans Act in order to make them \npermanent in nature. They provide a much needed service to workers and \nretirees. These demonstration projects have existed since 1992 and have \nproven to be very successful. However, they have outgrown their pilot-\nproject beginnings and should become a permanent fixture.\n  I want to thank Senator Breaux for his support of this legislation. \nFurthermore, I encourage all of my colleagues to support these projects \nand show their support by co-sponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 961. A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to improve shared appreciation arrangements; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n         consolidated farm and rural development act amendments\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, shared appreciation agreements have the \npotential to cause hundreds of farm foreclosures across the nation, and \nespecially in my home state of Montana. Ten years ago, a large number \nof farmers signed these agreements. At that time they were under the \nimpression that they would be required to pay these back at the end of \nten years, at a reasonable rate of redemption.\n  However, that has not proved to be the case. The appraisals being \nconducted by the Farm Service Agency are showing increased values of \nridiculous proportions. By all standards, one would expect the value to \nhave decreased. Farm prices are the lowest they have been in years, and \nthere does not seem to be a quick recovery forthcoming. Farmers cannot \npossibly be expected to pay back a value twice the amount they \noriginally wrote down. Especially in light of the current market \nsituation, I believe something must be done about the way these \nappraisals are conducted.\n  I am aware of one case in which the amount of the shared appreciation \nagreement was estimated at $167,500. The increased value was estimated \nat $335,000! When agricultural prices are at nearly an all-time low, \nfarmers can barely keep up with their current payment schedules. They \ncertainly cannot pay twice what they already owe.\n  USDA is attempting to fix the problem with proposed rules and \nregulations but farmers need help with these agreements now. I cannot \nstand idly by and wait for bureaucratic regulations to go through the \n``process'' while farmers and ranchers are forced out of business.\n  The USDA has issued an emergency rule which will allow people who are \nunable to pay their shared appreciation agreement on time, to extend \ntheir current loan for up to three years. The interest rate on this \nextension will be at the government's cost of borrowing. Also, the USDA \nis allowing farmers to take out an additional loan at an interest rate \nof 9.25% to pay off the amount owed on the shared appreciation \nagreement.\n  There is also consideration being given to decreasing the number of \nyears on shared appreciation agreements from ten to five. I appreciate \nthe efforts by the USDA to alleviate the financial burden these shared \nappreciation agreements impose upon farmers, and hope that farmers are \nable to take advantage of them.\n  However, as I have stated, time is of the essence. Another proposed \nregulation, which will require a public comment period of 60 days, will \nexclude capital investments from the increase in appreciation. However, \nthis proposal has not yet been published and is not expected to be for \nat least another month. After that, the comment period will further \ndrag out the process and in the meantime more farmers will be forced \ninto foreclosure.\n  To ensure this regulation on excluding capital investments from the \nincrease in value is carried out, I intend to make it mandatory by \nlegislation. Farmers should not be penalized for attempting to better \ntheir operations. Nor can they be expected to delay capital \nimprovements so that they will not be penalized.\n  Additionally, my legislation will require the appraisal to be \nconducted by a certified appraiser from the state where the land is \nlocated. This will prevent out-of-state appraisal businesses from \nconducting appraisals in land areas they know nothing about. How can an \nappraisal company in Arizona be expected to do an accurate appraisal on \nland in Montana? It is not fair to the producers on that land to have \ntheir appraisal conducted by outside interests.\n  I look forward to working with members in other states to alleviate \nthe financial burdens imposed by shared appreciation agreements. I hope \nthat we may move this through the legislative process quickly to \nprovide help as soon as possible to our farmers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 961\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to allow a deduction from gross income for year 2000 \ncomputer conversion costs of small businesses; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n             THE SMALL BUSINESS Y2K COMPLIANCE ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Y2K Compliance Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Dodd, the ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on the \nYear 2000 Technology Problem, as an original cosponsor of this measure.\n  Our legislation would offer small businesses a tax deduction of up to \n$40,000 towards the expenses of purchasing and installing Year 2000 \ncompliant computer hardware and software in 1999. In addition, our bill \nwould reward those small businesses that have acted responsibly by \nallowing an accelerated depreciation of up to $40,000 for the purchase \nand installation of Year 2000 compliant computer hardware and software \nmade in 1997 and 1998. These tax incentives have been endorsed by \nthousands of small business owners at last year's White House \nConference on Small Business, the American Small Business Alliance and \nthe Small Business Administration.\n  Unfortunately, not all small businesses are doing enough to address \nthe year 2000 issue because of a lack of resources in many cases. They \nface Y2K problems both directly and indirectly through their suppliers, \ncustomers and financial institutions. As recently as last October a \nrepresentative of the National Federation of Independent Businesses \ntestified: ``A fifth of them do not understand that there is a Y2K \nproblem. . . . They are not aware of it. A fifth of them are currently \ntaking action. A fifth have not taken action but plan to take action, \nand two-fifths are aware of the problem but do not plan to take any \naction prior to the year 2000.''\n  Indeed, the Small Business Administration recently warned that \n330,000 small businesses are at risk of closing down as a result of Y2K \nproblems, and another 370,000 could be temporarily or permanently \nhobbled.\n  Federal and State government agencies have entire departments working\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\non this problem. Utilities, financial institutions, telecommunications \ncompanies, and other large companies have information technology \ndivisions working to make corrections to keep their systems running. \nThey have armies of workers--but small businesses do not.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, from the city \ncorner market to the family farm to the small-town doctor. In my home \nState of Vermont, 98 percent of the businesses are small businesses \nwith limited resources. That is why it is so important to provide small \nbusinesses with the resources to correct their Y2K problems now.\n  A few months ago, I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small \nbusinesses prepare for 2000. Hundreds of small business owners from \nacross Vermont attended the conference to learn how to minimize or \neliminate their Y2K computer problems. Vermonters are working hard to \nidentify their Y2K vulnerabilities and prepare action plans to resolve \nthem. They should be encouraged and assisted in these important \nefforts.\n  This is the right approach. We have to fix as many of these problems \nahead of time as we can. Ultimately, the best business policy and the \nbest defense against any Y2K-based lawsuits is to be Y2K compliant.\n  That is why it is so important to provide small businesses with the \nresources to correct their Y2K problems now. Our legislation would \nprovide targeted tax incentives to encourage small businesses round the \ncountry in their Y2K remediation efforts. Our bill encourages Y2K \ncompliance now to avoid computer problems next year.\n  Moreover, the tax incentives in our legislation would have a \nnegligible revenue cost. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Taxation has \nestimated that companion legislation introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Representative Karen Thurman, H.R. 179, would reduce \nrevenue by $171 million from 1990-2003, but would increase revenues by \nthe same $171 million from 2004-2008. Thus, this bill is fiscally \nprudent as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support the ``Small Business \nY2K Compliance Act of 1999.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 962\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family \nForestland Preservation Tax Act of 1999. This bill amends several key \ntax provisions to help landowners keep their lands in long-term private \nforest ownership and management. Without these changes, many landowners \nwill continue to be forced to sell or change the use of their land.\n\n  This bill derives from four years of work by the Northern Forest \nLands Council (NFLC). The NFLC was created in 1990 to seek ways for \nMaine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York to maintain the \n``traditional patterns of land ownership and use'' in the forest that \ncovers this nation's Northeast. The Northern Forest is a 26-million-\nacre stretch of land, home to one million residents and within a two-\nhour drive of 70 million people. Nearly 85% of the Forest is privately \nowned. Times have changed, however, and social and economic forces have \nbegun to affect the traditional patterns of land use with more and more \nland being marketed for development.\n  This bill will help maintain traditional patterns and, thus, preserve \nthe forest by adjusting several estate tax provisions. This bill would \nallow heirs to make postmortem donations of conservation easements on \nundeveloped estate land and allow the valuation of undeveloped land at \ncurrent use value for estate tax purposes if the owner or heir agrees \nto maintain the land in its current use for a period of twenty-five \nyears. This bill also would establish a partial inflation adjustment \nfor timber sales by allowing a tax credit not to exceed 50%. This will \nencourage landowners to maintain their timberland for long-term \nstewardship, which is both economically and environmentally desirable. \nAlso, the bill would eliminate the requirement that landowners \ngenerally must work 100-hours-per-year in forest management on their \nforest properties to be allowed to deduct normal management expenses \nfrom timber activities against nonpassive income. Currently, landowners \nare required to capitalize these losses until timber is harvested. This \nlegislation, though prompted by the NFLC's work, will benefit not only \nthe four states that make up the Northern Forest, but also all states \nwith forestland and all who enjoy the multiple uses of forestland. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill, which will not only protect \nthe historic current use patterns, but also allow the rustic beauty of \nour forests to be enjoyed by all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for equitable compensation for the Cheyenne \nRiver Sioux Tribe, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n  CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT TRUST FUND ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncompensate the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for losses the tribe suffered \nwhen the Oahe dam was constructed in central South Dakota and over \n100,000 acres of tribal land was flooded. Its passage will help the \ntribe rebuild their infrastructure and their economy, which was \nseriously crippled by the Oahe project during the 1950s. It is \nextraordinary that it has taken four decades to reach this point. The \nimportance of passing this long-overdue legislation as soon as possible \ncannot be stated too strongly.\n  This legislation was developed with the assistance of Chairman Gregg\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\nBourland and Council Member Louis Dubray of the Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe. Both men have worked tirelessly to bring us to this point and I \nam grateful for their assistance. This legislation represents one \nelement of their progressive vision for providing the members of the \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe with greater opportunities for economic \ndevelopment and to fulfill the debts owned to the tribe by the federal \ngovernment.\n  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is the \ncompanion bill to the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Infrastructure \nDevelopment Trust Fund Act, which passed by unanimous consent in \nNovember of 1997, and the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure \nDevelopment Trust Fund Act of 1996, which passed the Congress \nunanimously in 1996.\n  The bill is based on an extensive analysis of the imp[act of the \nPick-Sloan Dam Projects on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe which was \nperformed by the Robert McLaughlin Company. The McLaughlin report was \nreviewed by the General Accounting Office, which found that the losses \nsuffered by the tribe justify the establishment of a $290 million trust \nfund, which is the amount called for in this legislation.\n  It represents an important step in our continuing effort to fairly \ncompensate the tribes of South Dakota for the sacrifices they made \ndecades ago for the construction of the dams along the Missouri River \nand will further the goal of improving the lives of Native Americans \nliving on those reservations.\n  To fully appreciate the need for this legislation, it is important \nfor the committee to understand the historic events that are prologue \nto its development. The Oahe dam was constructed in South Dakota \npursuant to the Flood Control Act (58 Stat. 887) of 1944. That \nlegislation authorized implementation of the Missouri River Basin Pick-\nSloan Plan for water development and flood control for downstream \nstates.\n  The Oahe dam flooded 104,000 acres of tribal land, forcing the \nrelocation of roughly 30 percent of the tribe's population, including \nfour entire communities. Equally as important, the tribe lost 80 \npercent of its fertile river bottom lands--lands that represented the \nbasis for the tribal economy. Prior to the flooding, the tribe relied \non these lands for firewood and building material, game wild fruits and \nberries, as well as cover from the severe storms that characterize \nwinters in South Dakota and shelter from the heat of the prairie \nsummer. Indian ranchers no longer had places to shelter their cattle in \nthe wintertime, causing a significant loss in the value of their \noperations.\n\n  The loss of these important river bottom lands can be felt today. \nDuring the extreme winter of 1996-1997, the tribe lost roughly 30,000 \nhead of livestock, including 25,000 head of cattle. Without adequate \nnatural shelter, the remaining Indian ranchers along this stretch of \nriver can expect to continue to have difficulty scratching out a living \nin future years when the winter turns particularly hard.\n  Mr. President, the damage caused by the Pick-Sloan projects touched \nevery aspect of life on the Cheyenne River reservation. Ninety percent \nof the timber on the reservation was wiped out, causing shortages of \nbuilding material and firewood. Wildlife, once abundant in the river \nbottom, became more scarce. The entire lifestyle of the tribe changed \nas it was forced to relocate much of its people from the lush river \nbottom lands to the windswept prairie.\n  Most Americans, if not all, are familiar with the many broken \npromises of the United States Government to Native Americans during the \n1800's. For Indian tribes located along the Missouri River in the state \nof South Dakota, the United States Government still has not met its \nresponsibilities for compensation for losses suffered as a result of \nthe construction of the Pick-Sloan dams. This proposed legislation is \nintended to correct that situation as it applies to the Cheyenne River \nSioux Tribe.\n  We cannot, of course, remake the lost lands and return the tribe to \nits former existence. We can, however, help provide the resources \nnecessary to the tribe to improve the infrastructure on the Cheyenne \nRiver reservation. This, in turn, will enhance opportunities for \neconomic development which will benefit all members of the tribe. \nPerhaps most importantly, it will fulfill part of our commitment to \nimprove the lives of Native Americans--in this case the Cheyenne River \nSioux.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to approve this legislation this year. \nProviding compensation to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for past harm \ninflicted by the federal government is long-overdue and any further \ndelay only compounds that harm. I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 964\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe \n     Equitable Compensation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) by enacting the Act of December 22, 1944, (58 Stat. \n     887, chapter 665; 33 U.S.C. 701-1 et seq.), commonly known as \n     the ``Flood Control Act of 1944'', Congress approved the \n     Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Pick-Sloan program'')--\n       (A) to promote the general economic development of the \n     United States;\n       (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, Iowa;\n       (C) to protect urban and rural areas from devastating \n     floods of the Missouri River; and\n       (D) for other purposes;\n       (2) the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project--\n       (A) is a major component of the Pick-Sloan program, and \n     contributes to the economy of the United States by generating \n     a substantial amount of hydropower and impounding a \n     substantial quantity of water;\n       (B) overlies the eastern boundary of the Cheyenne River \n     Sioux Indian Reservation; and\n       (C) has not only contributed little to the economy of the \n     Tribe, but has severely damaged the economy of the Tribe and \n     members of the Tribe by inundating the fertile, wooded bottom \n     lands of the Tribe along the Missouri River that constituted \n     the most productive agricultural and pastoral lands of the \n     Tribe and the homeland of the members of the Tribe;\n       (3) the Secretary of the Interior appointed a Joint Tribal \n     Advisory Committee that examined the Oahe Dam and Reservoir \n     project and correctly concluded that--\n       (A) the Federal Government did not justify, or fairly \n     compensate the Tribe for, the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project \n     when the Federal Government acquired 104,492 acres of land of \n     the Tribe for that project; and\n       (B) the Tribe should be adequately compensated for the land \n     acquisition described in subparagraph (A);\n       (4) after applying the same method of analysis as is used \n     for the compensation of similarly situated Indian tribes, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States (referred to in this \n     Act as the ``Comptroller General'') determined that the \n     appropriate amount of compensation to pay the Tribe for the \n     land acquisition described in paragraph (3)(A) would be \n     $290,722,958;\n       (5) the Tribe is entitled to receive additional financial \n     compensation for the land acquisition described in paragraph \n     (3)(A) in a manner consistent with the determination of the \n     Comptroller General described in paragraph (4); and\n       (6) the establishment of a trust fund to make amounts \n     available to the Tribe under this Act is consistent with the \n     principles of self-governance and self-determination.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide for additional financial compensation to the \n     Tribe for the acquisition by the Federal Government of \n     104,492 acres of land of the Tribe for the Oahe Dam and \n     Reservoir project in a manner consistent with the \n     determinations of the Comptroller General described in \n     subsection (a)(4).\n       (2) To provide for the establishment of the Cheyenne River \n     Sioux Tribal Recovery Fund, to be managed by the Secretary of \n     the Treasury in order to make payments to the Tribe to carry \n     out projects under a plan prepared by the Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Cheyenne River \n     Sioux Tribe, which is comprised of the Itazipco, Siha Sapa, \n     Minniconjou, and Oohenumpa bands of the Great Sioux Nation \n     that reside on the Cheyenne Reservation, located in central \n     South Dakota.\n       (2) Tribal council.--The term ``Tribal Council'' means the \n     governing body of the Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to restore a United States voluntary contribution to \nthe United Nations Population Fund; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n       united nations population fund (unfpa) funding act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``United \nNations Population Fund Funding Act of 1999.'' Senators Chafee, Snowe, \nLeahy, Murray, and Durbin join me as original cosponsors.\n  I will celebrate the memory of my mother this Sunday on Mother's Day. \nVery sadly, I know that there are millions of children in the \ndeveloping world who have very few, or even no memories of their \nmothers. Nearly all maternal deaths are in developing countries. More \nthan 585,000 women, many of them already mothers, die each year from \ncauses related to pregnancy, including obstructed labor, hemorrhage and \npostpartum infection, and ectopic pregnancies caused by a sexually \ntransmitted disease. Mothers also die from HIV, malnutrition and \nanemina, or complications of an unsafe abortion.\n  These are only a few examples of how poverty, lack of knowledge, and \nlack of basic maternal health care claim the lives of millions of \nmothers all over the world every year. But the importance of maternal \nhealth care to the well-being of women and their families is clear. We \ncan support mothers in poorer countries around the world by removing \nthe ban on U.S. funding for UNFPA. UNFPA is currently the leading \nmaternal health care provider around the world.\n  During the heated debate surrounding international family planning \nand U.S. funding for UNFPA, ``the baby often gets thrown out with the \nbath water.'' The ``baby'' in this debate is the vast array of work \nUNFPA does around the world to improve pre- and post-natal mother's \nhealth, access to voluntary family planning programs, STD and HIV \neducation and prevention, and programs to end the practice of female \ngenital mutilation. UNFPA provides couples all over the world access to \ncontraception. It seeks to reduce abortions and related deaths by \nimproving access to family planning and to treatment for complications \nof unsafe abortion. UNFPA's priorities include preventing teen \npregnancy. Too frequently, the bulk of UNFPA's work is overlooked in \nthe international family planning controversy.\n  Many people do not even realize that UNFPA also assists women in \ncrisis situations. UNFPA recently announced it is sending emergency \nreproductive health hits, including equipment for safe delivery of \nbabies and emergency contraceptives for rape victims, to Albania for \nthousands of Kosovar Albanian refugee women.\n  The lives of pregnant women and newborns are at particular risk among \nrefugees fleeing Kosovo. These kits include supplies for women who give \nbirth in areas without medical facilities, including materials like \nsoap, plastic sheeting, pictorial instructions for delivering a baby, \nand razor blades for cutting the umbilical cord of a newborn. These are \nthe most basic of\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\nitems. But they can mean the difference between life and death for \nmothers and their newborn babies. The U.S. should contribute to this \nhumanitarian work.\n  The whole world has been horrified by reports released by human \nrights organizations stating that the Serbs are using rape as a weapon \nof war. UNFPA has responded and is leading international efforts to \nhelp Kosovar Albanian women who have been raped by Serb forces. UNFPA \nprovides trauma treatment and counseling for other mental health \nconsequences of this form of human rights abuse.\n  As the legislative year progresses, the controversy over \ninternational family planning programs will intensify. My legislation \ncalling for renewal of the U.S. contribution to UNFPA will get caught \nup in the controversy as well. But I will not let one of the most \nimportant issues get lost--the health of mothers in poor countries. In \nthe coming months I will work with the cosponsors to this bill and many \nhealth care organizations to keep the issue of maternal health visible \nin the international family planning debate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 966. A bill to require Medicare providers to disclose publicly \nstaffing and performance in order to promote improved consumer \ninformation and choice, to protect employees of Medicare providers who \nreport concerns about the safety and quality of services provided by \nthe Medicare providers or who report violations of Federal or State law \nby those providers, and to require review of the impact on public \nhealth and safety of proposed mergers and acquisitions of Medicare \nproviders; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                       patient safety at of 1999\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Patient Safety \nAct of 1999. This legislation focuses on the major safety, quality, and \nworkforce issues for nurses employed by health care institutions and \nthe patients who receive care in these facilities.\n  Health care consumers need access to information about health care \ninstitutions in order to make informed decisions about where they or \ntheir loved ones will receive care. My bill would require health care \nfacilties to make information publicly available about staffing levels, \npatient care outcomes, and specific kinds of errors and avoidable \npatient care problems--such as bedsores. The Patient Safety Act would \nnot require action to correct these problems. This is not a bill to \nregulate health care, but one that would provide individuals with the \ninformation they want and need when it comes time to make important \nhealth care choices.\n  As our front-line health care workers, nurses are usually the first \nto recognize dangerous patient care conditions. The Patient Safety Act \nwould provide nurses and other hospital employees with \n``whistleblower'' protections it they report problems that threaten \npatient safety to their employers, government agencies, or others.\n  Finally, the Patient Safety Act would dirct the Department of Health \nand Human Services to review mergers and acqusitions of hospitals to \ndetermine their long-term effects on the well-being of patients, the \ncommunity and employees. While these types of transactions are \nregularly evaluated from a financial standpoint, little information is \nmade available to the public about hwo such a change would affect the \nhealth care services available to them.\n  The Patient Safety Act is a valuable information resource for \nconsumers. I urge you to join my efforts to provide consumers with the \ndata necessary to make informed decisions about their health care \nproviders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 967. A bill to provide a uniform national standard to ensure that \nconsealed firearms are available only to authorized persons for lawful \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   concealed firearms prohibition act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nthe Concealed Firearms Prohibition Act, that would help make our \ncommunities safer.\n  Across the country, citizens are looking for ways to stop gun \nviolence. They see their families torn apart, their friends lost \nforever, and their communities shattered. And they wonder what has gone \nwrong in a nation where more than 30,000 people are killed by gunfire \neach year.\n  One area of growing concern is concealed weapons. Recently, the NRA \ntried to push a measure that would have allowed more concealed weapons \nin Missouri. They spent about $4 million trying to pass their \nreferendum. But the voters responded with a resounding ``no.'' They do \nnot want more people secretly carrying weapons in their schoolyards, \nmalls, stadiums and other public places.\n  Regrettably, there are still too many politicians who will not listen \nto the people. They insist on marching in lockstep with the NRA. They \nactually want to escalate the arms race on our streets. They try to \nsuggest that if more people are carrying guns, our neighborhoods will \nbe safer. That position simply defies common sense. The answer to gun \nviolence is not a new version of the Wild West, with everyone carrying \na gun on his or her hip, taking the law into their own hands.\n  Every day people get into arguments over everything from traffic \naccidents to domestic disputes. Maybe these arguments lead to yelling, \nor even fisticuffs. But if people are carrying guns, those conflicts \nare much more likely to end in a shooting, and death. And since some \nStates allow individuals to carry concealed weapons with little or no \ntraining in the operation of firearms, there is a greater chance that \nincompetent or careless handgun users will accidentally injure or kill \ninnocent bystanders.\n  More concealed weapons on our streets will also make the jobs of law \nenforcement officers more dangerous and difficult. But you do not need \nto take my word for this, Mr. President. Just ask the men and women in \nlaw enforcement. In fact, the Police Executive Research Forum did just \nthat. In their 1996 survey, they found that 92 percent of their \nmembership opposed legislation allowing private citizens to carry \nconcealed weapons.\n  Mr. President, although the regulation of concealed weapons has been \nleft to States, it is time for Congress to step in to protect the \npublic. All Americans have a right to be free from the dangers posed by \nthe carrying of concealed handguns, regardless of their State of \nresidence. And Americans should be able to travel across State lines \nfor business, to visit their families, or for any other purpose, \nwithout having to worry about concealed weapons.\n  Besides the strong Federal interest in ensuring the safety of our \ncitizens, there are other reasons why this area requires Congressional \nintervention. Beyond the lives lost and ruined, crimes committed with \nhandguns impose a substantial burden on interstate commerce and lead to \na reduction in productivity and profitability for businesses around the \nNation. Moreover, to ensure its coverage under the Constitution's \ncommerce clause, my bill applies only to handguns that have been \ntransported in interstate or foreign commerce, or that have parts or \ncomponents that have been transported in interstate or foreign \ncommerce. This clearly distinguishes the legislation from the gun-free \nschool zone statute that was struck down in the Supreme Court's Lopez \ncase.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that more guns equal more death. \nThis legislation will help in our struggle to reduce the number of guns \non our streets, and help prevent our society from becoming even more \nviolent and dangerous.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 967\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Concealed Firearms \n     Prohibition Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to make grants to State agencies with responsibility \nfor water source development, for the purposes of maximizing the \navailable water supply and protecting the environment through the \ndevelopment of alternative water sources, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 alternative water sources act of 1999\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenators Mack, Cleland, Lincoln, and Robb, to discuss an issue of great \nimportance to the people of Florida and the nation: the availability of \nadequate water supplies. During the last decade, many states have \nexperienced unprecedented population growth. For example, Florida's \npopulation increased by 15 percent, or almost 2 million people, over \nthe last 8 years. We have directed resources towards improvements in \nour highway infrastructure to accommodate increased use. However, an \narea that has not received adequate attention but has the potential to \nnegatively impact human health and the environment as well as limit \neconomic growth is the conservation and development of adequate water \nsupplies.\n  A number of eastern states, including Florida, are now experiencing \nwater supply problems similar to those in the arid West. We must act \nnow to prevent salt water intrusion into our aquifers, additional loss \nof wetlands, and curbs on economic development due to inadequate water \nsupplies. As we prepare for the 21st century, demand for water for \ndomestic, industrial, and agricultural uses will continue to increase.\n  In just one of Florida's regional water management districts, the \nGoverning Board has committed $10 million per year since 1994 to \nproviding financial assistance for local alternative water source \nprojects such as conservation, wastewater reclamation, stormwater \nreuse, and desalination. When fully implemented, the 23 currently \nactive or completed projects will provide more than 150 million gallons \nof water per day to supply existing and future needs. These projects \nwill also reduce groundwater withdrawals, rehydrate stressed lakes and \nwetlands, increase ground water recharge, enhanced wildlife habitat, \nand improve flood control.\n  We are today introducing legislation to address this critical public \nhealth, environmental, and economic issue. The ``Alternative Water \nSources Act of 1999'' establishes a federal grant program for eastern \nstates that is similar to a program already operated by the Bureau of \nReclamation for western states. The program will provide federal \nmatching funds for the design and construction of water reclamation, \nreuse, and conservation projects. The bill authorizes the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) to make grants to agencies with responsibility \nfor water resource development, for the purpose of maximizing available \nwater supplies while protecting the environment. Under this program, \nwater supply agencies will submit grant proposals to EPA. The proposed \nprojects must be part of a long range water resource management plan. \nIf approved, the federal government would provide half the cost of the \nproject. This legislation authorizes $75 million per year over the next \nfive years to fund alternative water source projects.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 969. A bill to amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct and the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 to authorize schools to apply \nappropriate discipline measures in cases where students have weapons or \nthreaten to harm others, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                       school safety act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in the past two weeks since the tragedy \noccurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, we have all \nhad time to reflect on a number of issues. Our thoughts and prayers go \nto the families, friends, and other loved ones affected by this \nincident. We have asked ourselves why this happened. How it happened.\n  The Littleton tragedy requires reflection, thought and corrective \naction within our spheres of influence and responsibility. Children \nmust learn respect and responsibility. Parents must be responsible for \ntheir children, including what they watch and what they do. Schools \nmust have firm, fair and consistent discipline policies. Schools must \nbe free to expel violence-prone students. State legislators must review \nstate laws. Congress must review federal laws.\n  As a member of the United States Senate, I have been prompted to stop \nand examine our current federal education laws involving school safety, \nand see if our policies are promoting and encouraging school safety--or \nare in some way hindering our teachers, parents, principals, \nsuperintendents, and school boards from maintaining a safe place for \nour children to learn and our teachers to teach.\n  For much of the past year and before the Littleton tragedy, I \ntraveled through Missouri talking to teachers, principals, school \nsuperintendents and school officials about the issue of school safety \nand school discipline. What I heard and learned was disturbing. After \nlistening to school officials, I have concluded that there is, in fact, \nat least one federal law that actually jeopardizes our schools' efforts \nto provide a safe learning environment. Today I am introducing \nlegislation, the School Safety Act, to amend this law and give schools \nthe ability to remove from the classroom students who possess weapons \nor threaten to use weapons in the classroom, so that we can keep our \nchildren and teachers safe.\n  Once enacted, this legislation will help foster a safer environment \nin\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\nschools. If this legislation had been enacted years ago, would it have \nprevented the Littleton tragedy? It would be wrong to claim for certain \nthat it would. The truth of the Littleton tragedy is that those \ninvolved in the massacre violated at least 13 federal laws. The \nexistence of those 13 laws did not stop the Littleton massacre. Still, \nwe must examine our current federal education laws involving school \nsafety and make necessary changes.\n  Across America, parents, teachers, and communities have made it clear \nthat we want our schools to offer our students a world-class education \nthat boosts student achievement and elevates them to excellence. If \nchildren are to attain high levels of academic performance, our schools \nmust be able to provide safe and secure learning environments free of \nundue disruption or violence.\n  When we think of school safety, we obviously turn to one element that \nposes a threat to a secure environment: weapons in schools.\n  Our general federal policy is commendable: to have zero tolerance for \nweapons at schools. The federal Gun-Free Schools Act requires states \nreceiving federal education funds to have a law requiring a one year \nexpulsion of a student who has a weapon at school. I know that my state \nof Missouri has such a law on the books.\n  We would think that the Gun-Free Schools Act settles the issue of \nweapons in schools. But it doesn't. This law contains an exception for \nnearly one in seven students in my state, and one in eight nationally. \nThis exception is for students covered by the federal Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  Hidden among the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act is section \n(c), entitled ``Special Rule,'' which says: ``The provisions of this \nsection shall be construed in a manner consistent with the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act.'' When you turn to the IDEA law, you \nsee a complex and elaborate set of roadblocks and barriers that \nhamstring schools in applying discipline to any IDEA student for \nsituations involving weapons possessions.\n  When we talk about students who are subject to the IDEA law, we are \nnot talking about any small number of children: In Missouri, over \n129,000--or nearly 14% of our 893,000 students--are classified as \n``disabled.'' That's one in seven students. Nationally, there are about \n12-13% of all students who are under the IDEA law. We have to keep this \nin mind as we talk about this issue of school discipline and safety.\n  We must also consider which individuals qualify as ``disabled'' under \nIDEA. We are not just talking about blindness, deafness, orthopedic \nimpairments, or MS. The federal IDEA definition of disability also \nincludes individuals with serious emotional disturbances or specific \nlearning disabilities.\n  Unlike the Gun-Free Schools Act, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act does not have a zero tolerance for students with weapons. \nIn fact, the IDEA law makes it very difficult for schools to act \neffectively when a student subject to this law has a weapon at school.\n  While the Gun-Free Schools Act would require that any other student \nbe expelled for a year, the ``special rule'' for an IDEA student who \nbrings a gun or knife to school provides that he could be back in the \nregular classroom within 45 days.\n  Here is a federal law that creates dangerous situations by not \nallowing school officials to keep those students who have possessed \nweapons in school out of the classroom.\n  IDEA also hinders schools from taking effective action to protect \ntheir students and teachers from students who make threats to use \nweapons. School districts have developed policies to address student \nweapons threats. For example, a superintendent in my state told my \noffice that under his school district's policy, he could suspend a \nstudent for up to 180 days for threatening to bring a weapon to school \nand shoot another student.\n  However, if that superintendent is dealing with a student under IDEA, \nthe law makes it very difficult for him to remove the student even if \nhe considers the student a serious threat to the safety of others. In \nfact, the school may be unable to remove this child from the classroom \nif he has already been suspended for a certain number of days during \nthe school year.\n  Here is a federal law that creates dangerous situations by not \nallowing school officials to act on early warning signs to remove \npotentially violent students from school.\n  The costs involved with trying to keep a dangerous child out of the \nclassroom are astronomical under IDEA. Schools have told me that the \n``due process'' proceedings a parent can invoke in response to any \ndisciplinary action taken toward a child is so expensive and time-\nconsuming that schools do all they can to avoid these proceedings. The \neasiest, simplest due process hearing costs a school about $7500 in \nMissouri!\n  Not only must schools pay their own legal fees for a due process \nhearing under IDEA, but they also face the prospect of being \nresponsible for the parents' attorneys fees in some cases.\n  Here is a federal law that discourages safe classrooms because \nschools cannot afford to take steps they deem essential to maintaining \nsafety without risking serious financial jeopardy.\n  The problems created by IDEA are not simply theoretical. Just three \nweeks ago--before the Littleton incident--I traveled around Missouri to \ntalk to parents, teachers, principals, and administrators about ways to \noffer each child a world class education. Again and again, I was told \nthat schools are handcuffed by federal law in dealing with violent and \ndangerous behavior--often connected with weapons. Let me give you a few \nexamples:\n  In one rural Missouri school, a 15-year-old IDEA student had been \nmaking numerous threats against both students and staff. He said such \nthings as, ``I'm going to shoot you. I'm going to get a gun and blow \nyou away.'' School officials were aware of the threats, but the federal \nlaw hindered them from taking steps they thought most appropriate to \ndeal with the student. Unfortunately this student ended up shooting \nanother student off school grounds. Fortunately, because he remained in \nthe custody of law enforcement authorities, the student was not \nreturned to the classroom. School officials in this district told me \nthat had this student not been subject to the IDEA laws, they could \nhave--and would have--removed him from the classroom when he made the \nthreats of killing other students and personnel.\n  In an eastern Missouri school district, an IDEA student who was under \nschool suspension was asked to leave a Friday night school dance that \nhe tried to attend in violation of school policy. The student tried \ncontinually to regain entry into the school and said to the principal, \na teacher, and a parent who was helping supervise the dance: ``I'm \ngoing to go home, get my shotgun, come back, and blow your [expletives \ndeleted] heads off.'' The superintendent says that the federal IDEA law \nconstrained him to return this potentially dangerous student to the \nclassroom early the next week. If the student had not had been under \nIDEA, the superintendent could have imposed a far longer suspension for \nthreatening school personnel.\n\n  I learned of a Missouri grade schooler, subject to IDEA law, who \nannounced at school, ``I'm going to bring a knife and cut the bus \ndriver's throat.'' Was this an idle threat? This child had transferred \nfrom another school where he had been found with a knife and was \nsuspended for 10 days. The federal IDEA law prevents this new school \nfrom imposing any more suspensions upon this child for the rest of the \nschool year unless he actually shows up with a weapon again!\n  Let me emphasize that the vast majority of disabled students under \nthe IDEA law--just like the vast majority of nondisabled students--are \ngood kids who don't pose discipline problems in school. However, when \nit comes to something as serious as a student bringing a weapon to \nschool or threatening to kill or harm someone with a weapon, school \nofficials must have the ability to respond in the way they believe most \nappropriate to maintain a safe and stable school for all children.\n  When I hear these incidents from Missouri schools, I cannot help but \nthink that there is something drastically wrong with our federal \neducation laws. We have a mass tragedy waiting to happen if federal law \nkeeps teachers from getting teenagers with weapons out of schools. We \ncannot afford to keep laws on the books that preclude schools from \ndealing with\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\nearly warning signs of danger and handcuff them from taking swift \naction to prevent violence. We must give schools the power to keep our \nchildren safe by allowing them to remove all students who have weapons \nor threaten to use them.\n  Schools all over my state have told me that they need the authority \nto discipline all students in a fair and consistent manner--for the \nsafety of their schools and for the benefit of disabled children. Here \nare some examples of what schools have told me:\n  Maynard Wallace, Superintendent of the Ava R-I School District, has \nwritten: ``The discipline code must be the same for all if public \neducation is to survive.'' He says that treating children with \nhandicaps differently than other children in the area of discipline \n``not only undermines the entire discipline of the school but is a \ndefinite disservice to the handicapped child as well.''\n  Betty Chong, Assistant Superintendent for Special Services in the \nCape Girardeau school district, writes: ``The educators are themselves \nadvocates for children with disabilities. . . . Special educators \ndirectors and many principals were first teachers who were dedicated \n(and still are) to the education of students with disabilities.'' She \ngoes on to say: ``Students with disabilities are held to the same \nstandards as students without disabilities when they are adults. When \ndo they learn how to be law abiding citizens?''\n  Lyle Laughman, the superintendent of the Lincoln County R-IV school \ndistrict has written: ``It is in the total best interest of the child \nand society for that [discipline] determination to be made on the \nlocal, individual case level rather than the Federal law which greatly \nrestricts what a school can do in an individual set of circumstances.''\n  Dale Walkup, Board of Education President of the Blue Springs School \nDistrict gave me a copy of a letter he sent to President Clinton which \nsays, ``The reauthorization of IDEA has not supported impartial and \nappropriate consequences for those students who choose drugs and are \nviolent or dangerous to others. We hope the IDEA regulations become \nmore reasonable, appropriate, and considerate of the needs of our total \nstudent population.''\n  In response to both the incidents and recommendations that I have \nheard from schools, I am introducing the School Safety Act, which will \nallow schools to remove from the classroom any student who has a weapon \nor threatens to use a weapon at school. This legislation, which has \nbeen endorsed by the Missouri School Boards Association, will repeal \nthe federal law that handcuffs schools from taking measures they \nbelieve appropriate to maintain a safe and secure learning environment \nfor students and teachers.\n  A safe and secure setting is vital to success in the classroom. Any \nstudent who has a weapon at school, or who threatens to kill or harm \nsomeone with a weapon, should be removed from the classroom \nimmediately. Whether a student is ``disabled'' under federal law should \nnot prevent school administrators from dealing appropriately with \nweapons in school. We can no longer afford to keep a federal law that \nthreatens the safety of the classroom. We can no longer afford to \ntolerate federal policy that invites a mass tragedy. Under the School \nSafety Act, schools will be empowered with the flexibility and \nauthority they need to remove any dangerous and violent student from \nthe classroom when weapons are involved.\n  This is not the first time I have introduced school safety \nlegislation since I have been in the Senate. I have already worked to \nmake improvements in the federal law to create a safer learning \nenvironment for students and teachers.\n  I began working on this issue in 1995, after a young woman was found \ndead in the restroom of a North St. Louis County high school. The male \nspecial education student convicted of murdering the woman had a \nhistory of dangerous behavior, but his discipline record hadn't been \ndisclosed to his new school. In response to this situation, I sought \nfor ways to give schools the crucial information they need to maintain \na secure school environment. I authored legislation signed into law in \nJune 1997 providing for the transfer of discipline records when \nstudents with dangerous behavior change schools.\n  In the recent ``ed-flex'' bill signed into law on April 29, 1999, I \nsecured a provision that closes a loophole in federal law concerning \nweapons possession in school. Missouri school board officials had \nalerted me to a federal provision that allows a school to discipline a \nstudent only for carrying a weapon onto school grounds, but not for \npossessing a weapon at school. In response to this concern, I had the \nlaw amended to ensure that school officials can remove a student from \nthe classroom whether he possesses--or carries--a weapon at school.\n  The legislation I am offering today builds upon this previous safe \nschools legislation by giving schools authority to remove any student \nfrom the classroom if he or she brings a weapon to school or threatens \nto kill or harm someone with a weapon.\n  Mr. President, a little over a year ago, the Senator from Washington, \nSenator Gorton, read from an editorial in the Seattle Post \nIntelligencer that recounted the story of a disabled student who \nattacked other students with a knife on a school bus. The editorial \npointed out the disparities caused by the federal IDEA laws. It said: \n``If the school district really is required by law to allow students \nback into class who carry weapons or otherwise have demonstrated intent \nto harm others, that law is in error and must be changed.''\n  I could not agree more with this editorial. It is time to change this \nerroneous law, which jeopardizes students and teachers by forcing \nschool officials to ignore early warning signs of disaster. Maintaining \na safe learning environment requires that local school officials have \nthe authority and flexibility to discipline all students in an \nequitable and effective manner, especially when it comes to weapons. \nLet's unshackle our teachers, principals, superintendents, and school \nboards from a law that prevents them from keeping our children safe and \nsecure. Let's give them the power to stop a tragedy before it happens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 969\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TIMOR, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Reed, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Kohl) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 96\n\n       Whereas United Nations-sponsored negotiations between the \n     Governments of Indonesia and Portugal have resulted in \n     significant and encouraging progress toward a resolution of \n     East Timor's political status;\n       Whereas on January 27, 1999, President Habibie expressed a \n     willingness to consider independence for East Timor if a \n     majority of the East Timorese reject autonomy in a planned \n     August 8, 1999 ballot organized by the United Nations;\n       Whereas despite President Habibie's efforts to bring about \n     a peaceful resolution of the political status of East Timor, \n     the arming of anti-independence militias by some members of \n     the Indonesian military has contributed to increased \n     political tension and violence;\n       Whereas since January 1999, violence and human rights \n     abuses by anti-independence militias has increased \n     dramatically resulting in the displacement of thousands of \n     East Timorese villagers and scores of deaths;\n       Whereas since March 1999, hundreds of civilians may have \n     been killed, injured or disappeared in separate attacks by \n     anti-independence militias;\n       Whereas there are also reports of killings of anti-\n     independence militia members;\n       Whereas the killings in East Timor should be fully \n     investigated and the individuals responsible brought to \n     justice;\n       Whereas access to East Timor by international human rights \n     monitors, humanitarian organizations is severely limited, and \n     members of the press have been threatened;\n       Whereas a stable and secure environment in East Timor is \n     necessary for a free and fair ballot on East Timor's \n     political status;\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should promptly contribute to the \n     United Nations Trust Fund which will provide support for the \n     East Timor ballot process;\n       (2) the President, Secretary of State and Secretary of \n     Defense should intensify their efforts to urge the Indonesian \n     Government and military to--\n       (a) disarm and disband anti-independence militias; and\n       (b) grant full access to East Timor by international human \n     rights monitors, humanitarian organizations, and the press;\n       (3) the President, after consultation with the United \n     Nations Secretary General, should report to the Congress not \n     later than 15 days after passage of this Resolution, on steps \n     taken by the Indonesian government and military to ensure a \n     stable and secure environment in East Timor, including those \n     steps described in subparagraphs (2) (a and b); and\n       (4) any agreement for the sale, transfer, or licensing of \n     any military equipment for Indonesia entered into by the \n     United States should state that the equipment will not be \n     used in East Timor.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate regarding a peaceful process of \nself-determination in East Timor. I am joined by Senators Feingold, \nReed, Harkin, McConnell, Moynihan, and Kohl.\n  A year ago I doubt anyone would have predicted that a settlement of \nEast Timor's political status would be in sight.\n  While there are many obstacles and dangers ahead, we should take note \nof what has been accomplished. In the past year:\n  President Suharto relinqushed power.\n  The Indonesian Government endorsed a ballot on autonomy, which is \nplanned for August 8th.\n  The United Nations, Indonesia, and Portugal are to sign an agreement \ntoday on the procedures for that vote.\n  If the East Timorese people reject autonomy, there is every \nexpectation that East Timor will be on the road to independence.\n  The resolution that I am submitting today recognizes the positive \nsteps that have been taken.\n  But it also expresses our deep concern that since January, when \nIndonesian President Habibie expressed the willingness to consider \nindependence for East Timor, violence and intimidation by anti-\nindependence militias backed by members of the Indonesian military has \nincreased dramatically.\n  The perpetrators of the violence want to sabotage the vote on East \nTimor's future.\n  I spoke with one East Timorese man today, Mr. Franciso Da Costa, who \nwitnessed the April 6th massacre of scores of people in the village of \nLiquica.\n  An Op Ed article in today's New York Times by East Timorese lawyer \nAniceto guterres Lopez says it all. He wrote: ``With arms, money and a \nlicense for reckless rampages, the militia leaders have openly \nthreatened death to anyone opposed to continued Indonesian \noccupation.''\n  I received a report earlier today that Mr. Lopez' house is surrounded \nand he has been threatened with death. Bishop Belo, winner of the Nobel \nPeace Prize and one of the most courageous people I have ever had the \nprivilege to meet, has also been threatened.\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\n  Hundreds of East Timorese civilians have been killed, injured or \ndisappeared. Thousands have fled their homes to escape the violence, \nand are struggling to survive. Food and medicines are in short supply \nbecause the Indonesian Government has severely restricted access.\n  This resolution sounds an alarm. The situation is extremely fragile. \nThe militias are sowing chaos and terror. Far stronger steps are needed \nby the Indonesian Government and military to rein in the paramilitary \ngroups.\n  The resolution calls on the President and Secretary of State to \nintensify their efforts to urge the Indonesian Government and military \nto disarm the paramilitary groups. This must be done.\n  Another recommendation we make is that the United States contribute \nto the U.N. Trust Fund which will set up polling booths and put people \non the ground to monitor the vote. I plan to work with Senator \nMcConnell, who is a cosponsor of this resolution and Chairman of the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee, to obtain the funding as soon as \npossible.\n  The resolution says that any agreement to sell or transfer military \nequipment to Indonesia should state that the equipment will not be used \nin East Timor. We would prefer that there be no military equipment. But \nat the very least, we do not want our equipment ending up in the hands \nof thugs who are trying to derail the vote.\n  We know from history how much blood can be shed in East Timor. \nNobody--not the Indonesian Government, not the Indonesian military, and \ncertainly not the East Timorese people, benefits from a return to those \ndays.\n  Mr. President, this resolution should receive overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport. I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times Op Ed article \nby Mr. Lopez be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 5, 1999]\n\n                    East Timor's Bloodiest Tradition\n\n                      (By Aniceto Guterres Lopes)\n\n       Dili, East Timor--April 6, 1999. Another massacre. April \n     17. Another. Two more to add to an already lengthy list in \n     East Timor. Since Indonesia invaded my homeland in 1975 and \n     officially annexed it the following year, our history has \n     seemed little more than a succession of massacres, one \n     following the other in a depressingly predictable pattern.\n       Although the recent attacks have many precedents, they were \n     committed when we were filled with unprecedented hope. Only \n     four months ago, the Government of President B.J. Habibie \n     offered us the chance to vote on whether to remain in \n     Indonesia or become independent. Indonesia began working out \n     the logistics of the vote with the United Nations and \n     Portugal (the former colonial power still acknowledged under \n     international law as the administering authority over East \n     Timor). Today the Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, is due to \n     sign the final agreement on the vote at the United Nations.\n       The recent wave of violence here reveals that the Habibie \n     Government is reneging on the promise of a peaceful \n     resolution to East Timor's disputed political status. \n     Although the Habibie Government denies it, the military, \n     since last December, has organized its hardened East Timorese \n     camp followers into militias. With arms, money and a license \n     for reckless rampages, the dozen or so militia leaders have \n     openly threatened death to anyone opposed to continued \n     Indonesian occupation. Their spokesman, Basilio Araujo, told \n     an Australian television crew, ``We will kill as many people \n     as we want.''\n       The militia bosses boast that they are countering pro-\n     independence guerrillas, but they have not fought a single \n     battle with the guerrillas. They have only attacked unarmed \n     civilians and created a refugee crisis. In sweeps through the \n     countryside, the militias have threatened to kill the \n     families of any male, young or old, who refuses to join their \n     ranks. Many ``members'' of the militias are ordinary \n     villagers, some of whom I know personally. They are forced \n     recruits sullenly going through the motions and hoping to \n     avoid being hurt and hurting others.\n       The human rights organization I direct has been trying to \n     care for those who fled the villages to escape the militia \n     threats. According to our figures, about 18,000 refugees are \n     now sheltered in the towns. With little food, money and \n     medicine, they are slowly succumbing to disease.\n       By unleashing the militias, the Indonesian Government's \n     apparent strategy is to create the appearance of a civil war. \n     Indonesia falsely claims to be an enlightened and neutral \n     arbiter between a factious and primitive people not yet ready \n     for independence.\n       As is clear to all observers, the militias have not been \n     engaged in any pitched battles with pro-independence forces. \n     They attacked, with axes and machetes, hundreds of helpless \n     refugees sheltered in a church in Liquica on April 6. My \n     staff has recorded the names of 57 dead, many of them women \n     and children. Here in East Timor's capital, they attacked \n     another group of about 150 refugees on April 17. Meanwhile, \n     the pro-independence guerrillas, observing a cease-fire since \n     December, refrained from responding to the militias' attacks \n     on civilians until mid-April, as the Indonesian military \n     spokesman in East Timor has admitted.\n       The militias have no other aim than to sow chaos and \n     terror. Instead of allowing us to vote on whether to remain \n     within Indonesia, the militia bosses are killing those who \n     oppose them and vowing to wreck the United Nations-supervised \n     vote scheduled for August. Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, who \n     won the Novel Peace Prize in 1996, is on their hit list, as \n     are Australian journalists, East Timorese students and human \n     rights workers (myself included). The militia bosses are even \n     threatening to attack United Nations officials who will come \n     to administer the vote.\n       Sadly, President Habibie and his top military commander, \n     Gen. Wiranto, have done nothing to stop the militias. Over \n     the past five months, the gang leaders have, in public view, \n     committed atrocities and issued death threats. Yet they move \n     around with impunity. The much-publicized ``peace pact'' Gen. \n     Wiranto arranged in Dili on April 21 was nothing more than a \n     public relations stunt. The militias continue to attack \n     unarmed civilians unilaterally.\n       For a free and fair vote to be held, Portugal and the \n     United States will have to insist on a disarming of the \n     militias and a substantial withdrawal of Indonesia's all-\n     pervasive troops. The United States, holding considerable \n     leverage over bankrupt Indonesia, should take strong action, \n     like cutting off all military aid and training until a valid \n     vote on independence is held in East Timor.\n       Every day my staff records more cases of torture, \n     disappearances and killings. All East Timorese, except for a \n     few deranged militia leaders, have experienced enough \n     violence in their lives. We are desperate for a peaceful \n     resolution. Yet the Indonesian military, by allowing these \n     militias to be deployed, is drowning our hopes in blood.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont [Senator Leahy] to offer this resolution to \nencourage a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. We \nare introducing this resolution because of serious obstacles that have \nappeared en route to a ballot to determine the future status of East \nTimor.\n  Earlier this year it appeared that there was finally some progress in \nEast Timor. President Habibie announced on January 27 that the \ngovernment of Indonesia was finally willing to seek to learn and \nrespect the wishes of the people in that territory. There appears to be \nan agreement between the governments of Indonesia and Portugal to hold \na vote, currently scheduled for August 8, to determine East Timor's \nfuture political status. This latter accord is expected to be finalized \ntoday at the United Nations.\n  Despite this positive development, excitement and tension over the \npossibility of gaining independence have in recent months led to an \nincredible level of violence and intimidation. The situation on the \nground continues to worsen as East Timor has been wracked by violence \nthroughout the last several weeks. Militias, comprised of individuals \ndetermined to intimidate the East Timorese people into support for \ncontinued integration with Indonesia and widely believed to be \nsupported by the Indonesian military, are responsible for a sharp \nincrease in violence.\n  Let me recount some of the horror stories I have heard coming out of \nEast Timor in the last few weeks. To cite just a few examples, pro-\ngovernment militias, backed by Indonesian troops, reportedly shot and \nkilled 17 supporters of independence on April 5. Shortly thereafter, \npro-independence groups reported clashes, arrests and deaths, as well \nas civilians fleeing violence in six cities. One of those cities was \nLiquica where at least 25 people were brutally murdered by pro-\ngovernment militias when up to 2000 civilians sought shelter in the \nlocal Catholic church. Later, on April 17, hundreds of East Timorese \nfled the capital of Dili as knife-wielding militias attacked anyone \nsuspected of supporting independence. At least 30 were killed in this \nincident as Indonesian troops made little effort to stop the violence. \nThe perpetrators have not all been on the government side. Over the \nyears there have been atrocities on the pro-independence side as well. \nIn recent months, however, the overwhelming majority of the violence \nhas come from army elements and militias under their effective control. \nOverall, hundreds of civilians have been killed, wounded or disappeared \nin separate militia attacks.\n\n[[Page S4811]]\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, there is no sign that the tension will \nease between now and the August ballot. Pro-integration militia leaders \nannounced on April 29 that they reject the concept of the upcoming \nballot, or anything that could be considered a referendum. They have \nfurther stated that if a ballot leads to independence, they are \nprepared to fight a guerrilla war for decades if necessary to defend \nIndonesian rule of the territory. Independent observers fear that \nneither side will accept a loss in the August 8 ballot, thus setting \nthe stage for a prolonged conflict in East Timor. This type of rhetoric \ndoes not reassure us about the prospects for a successful transition \nfor the people of East Timor, regardless of which form of government \nthey choose. The climate in East Timor today, sadly, may have become \ntoo violent for a legitimate poll to take place. Worse yet, the \nagreement on the ballot process that we hope will be announced today in \nNew York will be rendered meaningless if people will fear for their \nlives if they dare to participate in the process.\n  The government of Indonesia must shoulder particular responsibility. \nWhether Indonesian troops have actually participated in these types of \nincidents or not, the authorities certainly must accept the blame for \nallowing, and in some cases, encouraging the bloody tactics of the pro-\nintegration militias. As a long time observer of the situation there, I \nsee the continuation of this violence as a threat to the very sanctity \nand legitimacy of the process that is underway. It is for this reason \nthat Senator Leahy and I have submitted our resolution to encourage the \ngovernment in Jakarta to do all it can to seek a peaceful process and a \nfair resolution to the situation in East Timor.\n  Mr President, I believe the United States has a responsibility, an \nobligation, to put as much pressure as possible on the Indonesian \ngovernment to help encourage an environment conducive to a free, fair, \npeaceful ballot process for the people of East Timor. Administration \nofficials are saying the right things, but perhaps have not fully used \nthe leverage we have at our disposal to make things happen. If we are \never going to resolve this issue, now is the time for us, the whole \nU.S. government, to act decisively.\n  In order to further bring pressure on the government of Indonesia to \nensure the conditions necessary for the ballot on a settlement for East \nTimor, the Leahy/Feingold resolution would link the transfer of defense \narticles and services to effective measures by the Indonesian \ngovernment and military to ensure a stable environment in East Timor.\n  Though non-binding, it is strongly worded. Specifically, our \nresolution recognizes progress in negotiations on a settlement proposal \nfor East Timor, and the Indonesian government's apparent willingness to \nseek a peaceful resolution to the status of East Timor, but highlights \nthe resultant increase in violence and human rights abuses by anti-\nindependence militias and urges the Habibie government to curtail \nIndonesian military support to the militias. Nevertheless, despite that \nprogress and the prospect of today's finalization of ballot procedures, \naccess to East Timor by international monitors remains restricted, \nthreatening the very environment needed to conduct a free and fair \nballot\n  Most importantly, our resolution makes positive recommendations about \nwhat the United States can do to create an environment conducive to a \nfree election. It states that it is the Sense of the Senate that we \nshould urge the U.S. government to contribute to the United Nations \nTrust Fund to provide support for the East Timor ballot process. It \nalso encourages the Administration to urge the Indonesian government to \ndisarm the militias and grant full access to East Timor by \ninternational monitors.\n  Mr. President, it is not in our power to guarantee the free, fair \nexercise of the rights of the people of East Timor to determine their \nfuture. It is, however, in our interest to do all that we can to work \nwith the United Nations, other concerned countries, the government of \nIndonesia and the people of East Timor to create an opportunity for a \nsuccessful ballot process. We cannot forget that the Timorese have been \nliving with violence and oppression for more than 23 years. These many \nyears have not dulled the desire of the East Timorese for freedom, or \nquieted their demands to have a role in the determination of East \nTimor's status. We have to do all we can to support an environment that \ncan produce a fair ballot in East Timor. Now. And throughout the rest \nof this process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of a May 3, \n1999, editorial from the Wall Street Journal be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,  as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 3, 1999]\n\n                      East Timor's Poisoned Choice\n\n       For more than two decades, the world has recoiled in horror \n     at periodic reports of atrocities by Indonesian troops in \n     East Timor, the former Portuguese colony that Jakarta invaded \n     in 1975 and then annexed amid great protest in 1976. Despite \n     the outrage, sympathy with the plight of East Timorese and \n     the repressed desire of many for independence didn't stop \n     foreigners from doing business with Jakarta over the years. \n     In fact, East Timor largely appeared on the world's radar \n     screen only during peaks of suffering there--as in 1991 after \n     Indonesian troops fired on a funeral procession and killed an \n     estimated 180 people in the capital of Dili.\n       Even so, when President B.J. Habibie announced in January \n     that East Timor could choose between autonomy or \n     independence, a great cheer of moral satisfaction went up \n     around the globe. After all these years and all that \n     struggle, liberation was at hand! Even in recent weeks, as \n     local antiseparation militiamen with ties to the Indonesian \n     army went on killing sprees in East Timor, the independence \n     juggernaut churned on. Representatives from Portugal and \n     Indonesia recently agreed to sign a U.N.-sponsored proposal \n     that could bring a vote to East Timor by this summer and an \n     end to Indonesian rule by 2000.\n       The fact that President Habibie didn't actually sign, but \n     requested a delay until early next month, has led to \n     speculation that he may be getting cold feet about a proposal \n     that Indonesia's powerful military does not support. As \n     ominous as that sounds for all who thought the end was in \n     sight, what strikes independence enthusiasts as sad may not \n     be entirely bad. Even before the emergence of East Timorese \n     anti-independence militas added to an already volatile \n     mixture featuring armed separatists, there was evidence that \n     the ordinary people of East Timor might be getting a raw deal \n     on a silver platter. Though the entire exercise, vote and \n     all, is supposed to be about self-determination, in some ways \n     it appears that they are being thrown to the wolves--and not \n     only by Indonesia.\n       Consider the reckless manner in which Mr. Habibie \n     acknowledged that the cost of maintaining a grip on the \n     turbulent province was too high for Indonesia. Former \n     colonial power Portugal departed from many of its possessions \n     in a fit of spiteful destruction, smashing infrastructure and \n     leaving arms in the hands of the baddest locals it could \n     find. Similarly, Mr. Habibie offered East Timor what was in \n     effect a poisoned choice of immediate autonomy or immediate \n     independence. That frightened even separatists among the \n     Timorese, some of whom have been pleading for a more gradual \n     process that would enable the province to better prepare for \n     an orderly transition and successful independence.\n       But such is the rush to complete the voting process that \n     East Timorese expressions of concern about timing have been \n     largely brushed aside by outsiders who claim to be on their \n     side. Such concerns have been unheard, or dismissed as \n     impossible to address given Mr. Habibie's all-or-nothing \n     adamancy. Better to take what you can get, and take it now, \n     the rest of the world has been telling the Timorese. It's a \n     shame it has to be so hurried, and now so bloody, but these \n     things do happen.\n       If outsiders are not willing to protect East Timorese from \n     the violent consequences of the process now under way, they \n     should stop cheering so hard for the process. Having come so \n     far, nobody likes to think of delay, not least because that \n     would be seen as a victory for the dark forces within the \n     Indonesian military and elsewhere. But standing idly by while \n     the people of East Timor are propelled into a situation that \n     is not simply risky but more or less expected to bring death \n     and destruction will be a crime in itself.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, having just returned from Cambodia, \nIndonesia, Australia and New Zealand, I was impressed by how deeply \nconcerned regional leaders were over the status and conditions in East \nTimor.\n  Although the first really democratic elections to be held in \nIndonesia are coming up in June, the U.N. autonomy agreement, which \nshould be announced today, was the focus of most of my discussions. \nWhile I was in the region, there was yet another explosive round of \nviolence which left 17 dead. There is absolutely no question that most \nof these attacks are being carried out by\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\nmilitias which enjoy military support from the Indonesian armed forces.\n  I do not believe these militias are directly commanded by Indonesian \nofficers. However, I do think these militias are both encouraged and \nequipped by individuals in the military who oppose autonomy or \nindependence for East Timor. There clearly are officers with a vested \ninterest in controlling the ports and trade through Timor. These \nindividuals have put self interest above their nation's interest.\n  While in Jakarta I raised these specific concerns directly with \nGeneral Wiranto. I believe he recognizes that these events damage \nIndonesia's stability and stature. I hope he will pursue a more \naggressive course in the days to come to assure this spiral of violence \nends.\n  In the meantime, I think we should make clear we will not allow US \nequipment to be used to further the violence in East Timor. I also \nbelieve it is essential to deploy civilian poll watchers and police to \nrestore calm and credibility to the election process. To accomplish \nthis goal in a timely and effective manner, I have initiated \ndiscussions with key congressional members to add funds to the \nsupplemental bill to support a peacekeeping presence in East Timor. I \nunderstand that the UN estimates an election team supported by civilian \npolice observers may cost as much as $50 million. I fully expect our \nregional partners and Portugal to assume a leadership role in meeting \nthese needs, but we have key interests in promoting Indonesian \nstability and security. I would hope we can commit roughly $10 million \nto this endeavor. I am convinced that our support for an international \nmonitoring initiative administered through the United Nations Trust \nFund will help ease this crisis and offer the citizens of East Timor a \nreal opportunity for reconciliation, peace and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4812-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 97--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 2 THROUGH 8, 1999, AS \nTHE 14TH ANNUAL TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK, AND DESIGNATING TUESDAY, MAY \n                    4, 1999, AS NATIONAL TEACHER DAY\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Lott, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Craig, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Mack, \nMr. Smith of Oregon, Ms. Collins, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nGrams, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Wellstone) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I join \nChairman McCain and Senators Hutchison and Inouye to introduce the \nMaritime Administration Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. This \nlegislation is critical for the continuation of a modern commercial \nfleet owned and operated by U.S. citizens and crewed by American \nseafarers. It also ensures America's economic competitiveness and \nnational security.\n  The Maritime Administration (MARAD) reauthorization continues very \nimportant programs, and is a much broader piece of legislation than in \npast years. For example, it provides the funding for the Title XI Loan \nGuarantee Program, a truly national and international program. Title XI \nshipowners, their operation and their supplier base, cover almost every \nstate in this country. Title XI has been vital in assisting our \nshipyards in competing internationally. U.S. shipyards are attracting \nforeign interests and winning orders for many vessel types. The bill \nalso contains technical amendments to the Title XI program which will \nsave time and money for both the Government and those applying for a \nloan guarantee. It also provides the funds for the operation of the \nU.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York and continuing \nassistance to six State maritime academies. These students are the \nfuture of country and our merchant marine.\n  This bill also recognizes the importance of the merchant marine to \nour national security by its support for the recently-enacted Maritime \nSecurity Program (MSP), a modern commercial fleet available to provide \ncritical support to the Department of Defense during war or national \nemergency. This year's reauthorization also contains provisions which \naim to strengthen our U.S.-flag fleet through a much needed infusion of \nnew tonnage by eliminating the three-year wait that a newly-registered \nbulk or breakbulk vessel must currently wait to carry preference cargo. \nThis opportunity, which would end in one year or upon enactment of the \nOECD Shipbuilding Agreement, would not just improve the vessel profile \nof this fleet, but also add U.S. jobs> Vessels allowed to enter the \npreference trade would be required to perform shipyard repairs and \nother work necessary to bring them up to U.S.-flag standards in our own \nU.S. shipyards.\n  Funding is also provided for two new programs, enacted by the last \nCongress. Under the American Fisheries Act, MARAD will determine \ncompliance with citizenship standards for certain fishing vessels, \nassisting in proper management and conservation of an important natural \nresource of our country. The agency is also developing a uniform \nprocess for the administrative waiver of the U.S.-built requirement for \nparticipation in the Jones Act trade for certain small passenger \nvessels, so that specific legislation need not be sought each time such \na waiver is needed.\n  Mr. President, MARAD's FY 2000 budget recognizes the importance of \nsealift readiness and a strong U.S.-flag fleet. It acknowledges the \nneed for a healthy shipbuilding industry and also provides for the \neducation of our youth. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4815-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          1999 NEW MEXICO HIGH SCHOOL SUPERCOMPUTING CHALLENGE\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nrise today to recognize the contestants of the 1999 New Mexico High \nSchool Supercomputing Challenge, an impressive group of young people \nfrom my home state of New Mexico. I want to extend a special \ncongratulations to the five Albuquerque Academy students who won this \nintellectually demanding contest. In addition to their normal school \nwork and other extra curricular activities, these students--Tom \nWidland, Kevin Oishi, Alex Feuchter, Ryan Davies and Ryan Duryea--\ndiligently worked on their project for nearly a year to compete in this \ncompetition.\n  For the past 9 years, High school students from around the state have \ncompeted against each other in the Supercomputing Challenge. The \nstudent's projects are done on high-speed supercomputers at the Los \nAlamos National Laboratory with the winners of the competition \nreceiving an award, a $1,000 savings bond, a plaque, several boxes of \nsoftware, and a computer for their schools.\n  In light of recent events in the news, it has been easy for us to \nfocus our attention on the problems seriously troubling our Nation's \nyouth. That is why, now, more than ever, I believe it is essential that \nwe encourage our kids by recognizing and praising their outstanding \naccomplishments. These young Americans exemplify, the character our \nNation was founded on and set a positive example for their peers to \nfollow.\n  The participants of the 1999 New Mexico High School Supercomputing \nChallenge, deserve to be recognized, and I am proud to salute them on \nthis worthy accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4815-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4815-S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             STADIUM FINANCING AND FRANCHISE RELOCATION ACT\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Specter \ntoday in introducing legislation that will create a fund to finance the \nbuilding and renovation of stadiums and ballparks for major league \nbaseball and professional football sports leagues across America. For \ntoo long, baseball and football teams have threatened to move if state \nand local governments do not ante up the money to renovate or build \nnew, publicly financed stadiums for the home teams. The scene is, by \nnow, a familiar one: multi-millionaire team owners demand new, \ntaxpayer-funded state-of-the-art stadiums, so that they and their \nplayers can make even more money for themselves--at taxpayer expense, \nof course. The taxpayers are impaled on the horns of a dilemma: either \npony up or risk losing the team.\n  This bill will strike an equitable arrangement between teams and \nlocal governments to share the costs of stadium renovation and \nconstruction--ensuring that professional sports teams put up their fair \nshare. The way the bill would accomplish this is straightforward. Team \nowners owe much of their wealth to revenue from network\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n\ntelecasts of their games, a boon they receive courtesy of the antitrust \nexemption granted by us--the Congress. The antitrust exemption \ncontained in the Sports Broadcasting Act permits teams to pool their \ntelevision rights, yielding annual revenues of $2.2 billion to the \nNational Football League and $425 million to Major League Baseball.\n  This legislation would require, as a condition for retaining this \nlucrative antitrust exemption, that Major League Baseball and the \nNational Football League place into a trust fund 10 percent of the \nrevenues the Leagues receive from network telecasts. Each sport's trust \nfund, in turn, would be used to finance up to one half the cost of \nconstructing a new stadium or park, or renovating an older one, for any \nof the teams seeking such financing--so long as the local government \nhas agreed to provide one dollar for every two furnished by the trust \nfund. In other words, if a pro team in Wilmington wanted to build a \n$200 million stadium, it could obtain $100 million from the trust fund, \na government entity in Delaware would have to kick in $50 million, and \nthe remaining money would have to come from the team owner or some \nother source. In addition to allowing the Leagues to retain their \ncurrent antitrust exemption, the bill would expand the exemption to \ngive the Leagues the authority to prevent member clubs from moving \ntheir franchises.\n  To my mind, this bill strikes just the right balance. Let us not \nsaddle cities and taxpayers with the exorbitant--sometimes mind-\nboggling--costs of building new stadiums while the teams and their \nowners sit back and wait for the highest bidder. If the Leagues want to \nkeep their antitrust exemption, the major source of their millions, \nthey should be willing to do their fair share. This legislation's \ncondition that in exchange for the exemption, the teams set aside 10 \npercent of their broadcast revenues, is a reasonable and much needed \nmeasure to restore some balance to a negotiating process that is out-\nof-whack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4816-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS' ANNUAL FOOD DRIVE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nNational Association of Letter Carriers for its efforts to combat \nhunger in America through its annual national food drive.\n  Each year, on the second Saturday in May, letter carriers in more \nthan 10,000 cities collect canned food along their postal routes to \nsupply local food banks. Last year, over 50 million pounds of food were \ndonated to feed the hungry, and I am confident that 1999's drive will \nbe an even greater success. In just seven years of operation, the \nNational Association of Letter Carrier's national food drive has grown \ninto America's largest one-day food collection effort.\n  To participate, residents in participating communities need only \nplace a can of non-perishable food near their mailbox--their letter \ncarrier does the rest. In addition to making regular pick-ups and \ndeliveries, their letter carrier collects donations and transports them \nto a nearby postal station. Food is then sorted and distributed to \nlocal charities.\n  Mr. President, an estimated 30 million people go hungry every day in \nAmerica. Food shortages hit children especially hard in the summer \nmonths, when school lunches are not available and many charity pantries \nrun out of supplies donated during the Winter holiday season. The \nLetter Carriers' food drive makes a critical contribution at a time \nwhen help is urgently needed.\n  I commend the National Association of Letter Carriers for its \nleadership in organizing this annual event. The NALC's organizing \npartners--the United States Postal Service, the AFL-CIO, and the United \nWay--also deserve our thanks.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I urge each American to leave a can of food \nby the mailbox on Saturday. Together, we can fight hunger and make a \ndifference in the lives of millions of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4816-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ARSON AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to remind the Senate \nand the American Public that this is Arson Awareness Week. It is that \ntime once a year that we stop to assess how arson affects our lives. \nEach year hundreds of Americans die because of the arsonist's match. \nMr. President, I am outraged at this and the countless firefighters who \nare killed every year attempting to extinguish intentionally set fires. \nArsonists should be swiftly brought to justice, especially when \nfirefighters lives are put on the line.\n  When a fire is intentionally set in the center of a retail city \ndistrict the damaged property becomes blight on the entire community. \nLike cancer, arson degrades the whole area. Jobs are lost, tax bases \nare depleted and, most importantly, people are often killed.\n  As a member of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I have long \nbeen associated with the war against arson. I have consistently \nsupported stricter penalties for convicted arsonists. I have supported \nthe efforts of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms that assist \nour fine state and local fire investigators. I have also supported the \nUnited States Fire Administration which provides valuable research \ngrants and public education efforts geared toward controlling arson.\n  Mr. President I remind all Americans that arson is still a serious \nproblem, one we must continually work together to solve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4816-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KEVIN L.

If it hadn't happened already, the Yugoslav conflict just \nhit home.\n  Early yesterday morning, NATO experienced its first fatalities in its \ncampaign against Yugoslavia. And Chetek, Wisconsin found its way into \nthe news.\n  Army Chief Warrant Officer Kevin L. Reichert, of Chetek, Wisconsin, \nwas killed aboard an Apache helicopter during a nighttime training \nmission in Albania. My thoughts, prayers, and sympathies go out to the \nfriends and family of Kevin Reichert. We can all be proud of Kevin's \nservice to his country.\n  The 28-year old from Wisconsin's Chippewa Valley leaves behind his \nwife of eight years, Ridgeley, and 3 kids. I thank the proud residents \nof Chetek and of Barron County, Wisconsin, for helping to raise such a \nbrave and dedicated American. I hope the Reichert family and the 1,700 \npeople of Chetek will take solace in the gratitude of our Nation.\n  The NATO effort in Yugoslavia has its costs. Kevin's death, and that \nof his co-pilot, David Gibbs, of Ohio, are sad reminders that conflicts \nlike the one in Yugoslavia, while they seem far away, have a very real \nimpact at home.\n  Mr. President, I am sure my colleagues join me in paying tribute to \nKevin Reichert for his dedicated service to the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4816-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4816-S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING ELMA F. BRITTINGHAM\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with utmost respect and \nadmiration that I rise today to acknowledge the contributions of a \nwoman who, at the age of 99, has never tired of giving her all to her \ncountry and to the men and women of the Mill Creek Fire Company--Elma \nF. Brittingham of Marshallton, Delaware, affectionately known to \neveryone as ``Mom.'' On May 8, 1999, Mill Creek will honor her at its \n72nd Annual Dinner for 72 years of unmatched volunteer service to the \nMill Creek Fire Company. Yes, Elma is a charter member of the Mill \nCreek Fire Company and she remains an institution in the Fire Hall.\n  This well-deserved recognition is much less than I or anyone in \nDelaware could ever do to capture just how significant Elma's life has \nbeen to everyone with whom she has come in contact. Her legacy is \netched in the memory of every fire service professional and volunteer \nin our State and her life continues to be an inspiration to all of us.\n  While many remember Elma for her 50 years of preparing turkey dinners \nfor the Annual Volunteer Fire Conference, or her playing Yen Man in the \ncompany minstrel show, she is most remembered for her work on the \nfront-line, fighting fires under the most dangerous circumstances. The \none she most vividly remembers was during World War II when she helped \nput out a fire at an old prison farm on Duncan Road in Wilmington \nduring a thunder and lightning storm. With this same energy and vigor, \nElma is as spirited\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\ntoday, five decades later, as she was more than a half-century ago.\n  I know that there may be someone like Elma Brittingham in other \nStates, but none can be more important to a community than this totally \ncommitted, selfless woman that I honor today. She is what we, as \nAmericans, should aspire to be--a loyal public servant, an example of \nexcellence and achievement in everything she has committed to \naccomplishing, and a credit to her community and to her country. I am \ndeeply privileged to know this woman and proud to call her a heroic \nDelawarean and an outstanding American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4817-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO BETTY FRANKLIN-HAMMONDS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. On April 28th, Madison lost a dedicated advocate \nand a dear friend: Betty Franklin-Hammonds.\n  Betty's life story is a catalogue of remarkable achievements. From \nher tenure as the executive director of the Madison Urban League, where \nshe spearheaded a study on the gap in achievement between black and \nwhite students in the Madison school system, to her leadership at the \nMadison Times and the numerous awards she received for her work, there \nare countless examples of Betty's effectiveness as an advocate in the \ncommunity.\n  But it was her character, more than any title or award, that defined \nBetty and made her such a powerful presence in our community. She was a \ntruth teller who never backed down from a fight, a woman who led by \nexample and wasn't shy about asking others to make the commitment to \nchange she demanded from herself.\n  Betty was a unique combination of a quiet dignity and a fierce \npassion for justice that could only be quenched by constant motion. She \nworked tirelessly, as a social worker, at the Madison chapter of the \nNAACP, at the Urban League, and at the Madison Times, to make our city \na better place.\n  Her own words tell us more about Betty than any tribute ever could. \nAfter receiving an award for her humanitarian work, she once told a \ncrowd that ``everybody can be great because everybody can serve.'' By \nthat measure, Betty Franklin-Hammonds was great indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/05/senate-section/article/S4817-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 75, S. Res. 68.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. Res. 68) expressing the sense of the Senate \n     regarding the treatment of women and girls by the Taliban in \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the Senate will stand \nup for the rights of women and pass S. Res. 68, a resolution condemning \nthe Taliban's treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan. I especially \nthank Senator Brownback in joining me as the main cosponsor of this \nresolution.\n  The Taliban is a militia group that now controls between 85-90 \npercent of Afghanistan. People living under its rule are subjected to \nan extreme interpretation of Islam practiced nowhere else in the world. \nIt is especially repressive on women living in Afghanistan.\n  Under Taliban rule, women and girls in Afghanistan are denied even \nthe most basic human rights. They cannot work outside the home, attend \nschool, or even wear shoes that make noise when they walk. Women who \nare in their homes are not allowed to be seen from the street, and \nhouses with female occupants must have their windows painted over. \nParents cannot teach their daughters to read, or take their little \ngirls to be treated by male doctors.\n  Women are also forced to wear a full head-to-toe garment called a \nburqa. This restrictive covering allows only a tiny opening to see and \nbreathe through. I understand that some women may choose to wear a \nburqa for religious reasons--that should be their right. However, the \nrequirement that women wear a burqa is a clear violation of human \nrights. And further, the rules surrounding this requirement are \nfrightening.\n  Women found in public who are not wearing a burqa are beaten by \nTaliban militiamen. If they wear a burqa and their ankles are showing, \nthey are beaten as well. Poor women who cannot afford a burqa are \nforced to stay at home, preventing them from receiving medical care.\n  The Physicians for Human Rights recently conducted a study of 160 \nwomen in Afghanistan and their findings are horrific.\n  The study found that 77 percent of women had poor access to health \ncare in Kabul, while another 20 percent reported no access at all. Of \nthe participants, 81 percent reported a decline in their mental \ncondition; 97 percent met the diagnostic criteria for depression; 42 \npercent met the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder; \nand 21 percent reported having suicidal thoughts ``extremely often'' or \n``quite often.'' In addition, 53 percent of women described occasions \nin which they were seriously ill and unable to seek medical care.\n  The resolution passed today calls on the President of the United \nStates to prevent a Taliban-led government of Afghanistan from taking a \nseat in the United Nations General Assembly, as long as these gross \nviolations of human rights persist.\n  My resolution also urges the Administration not to recognize any \ngovernment in Afghanistan which does not take actions to achieve the \nfollowing goals: effective participation of women in all civil, \neconomic, and social life; the right of women to work; the right of \nwomen and girls to an education without discrimination and the \nreopening of schools to women and girls at all levels of education; the \nfreedom of movement of women and girls; equal access of women and girls \nto health care; equal access of women and girls to humanitarian aid.\n  It is shocking that women and girls in Afghanistan are suffering \nunder these conditions as we approach the 21st century. The United \nStates has an obligation to take the lead in condemning these abuses.\n  I want to thank the majority and minority leaders for allowing this \nlegislation to come to the floor, and I appreciate the support from the \nmany cosponsors of this resolution who are working to end human rights \nabuses against women in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Boxer has \namendments to the resolution and the preamble at the desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendments to the resolution be \nagreed to, that the resolution, as amended, be agreed to, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that the amendment to the \npreamble be agreed to, and the preamble, as amended, be agreed to with \nno intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 305 and 306) were agreed to as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 305\n\n                  (Purpose: To improve the resolution)\n\n       On page 3, line 4, strike ``the'' and insert ``any''.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 306\n\n                   (Purpose: To improve the preamble)\n\n       Amend the preamble to read as follows:\n       Whereas millions of women and girls living under Taliban \n     rule Afghanistan are denied their basic human rights;\n       Whereas according to the Department of State and \n     international human rights organizations, the Taliban \n     continues to commit\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\n     widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in gross \n     violation of internationally accepted norms;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     Country Report on Human Rights Practices (hereafter ``1998 \n     State Department Human Rights Report''), violence against \n     women in Afghanistan occurs frequently, including beatings, \n     rapes, forced marriages, disappearances, kidnapings, and \n     killings;\n       Whereas women and girls under Taliban rule are generally \n     barred from working, going to school, leaving their homes \n     without an immediate male family member as chaperone, and \n     visiting doctors, hospitals or clinics;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, gender restrictions by the Taliban continue to \n     interfere with the delivery of humanitarian assistance to \n     women and girls in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, under Taliban rule women are forced to don a head-to-\n     toe garment known as a burqa, which has only a mesh screen \n     for vision, and many women found in public not wearing a \n     burqa, or wearing a burqa that does not properly cover the \n     ankles, are beaten by Taliban militiamen;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, some poor women under Taliban rule cannot afford the \n     cost of a burqa and thus are forced to remain at home or risk \n     beatings if they go outside the home without one;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, the lack of a burqa has resulted in the inability of \n     some women under Taliban rule to get necessary medical care \n     because they cannot leave home;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, women under Taliban rule reportedly have been beaten \n     if their shoe heels click when they walk;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, under Taliban rule women in homes must not be visible \n     from the street, and houses with female occupants must have \n     their windows painted over;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, under Taliban rule women are not allowed to drive, \n     and taxi drivers reportedly have been beaten if they take \n     unescorted women as passengers;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, women under Taliban rule are forbidden to enter \n     mosques or other places of worship; and\n       Whereas women and girls of all ages under Taliban rule have \n     suffered needlessly and even died from curable illness \n     because they have been turned away from health care \n     facilities because of their gender: Now, therefore, be it\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 68), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The resolution, as amended, with its preamble, as amended, reads as \nfollows:\n  [The resolution was not available for printing.
