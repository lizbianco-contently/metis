Mr. President, I must say, once again, welcome to my \ncolleagues and the Chaplain and a hardy band of brothers and sisters \nwho serve as our staff. It is very tough today to be in the Nation's \nCapital with, I guess, 8 or 10 inches of snow on the ground and more on \nthe way.\n  I note, of course, to the Senator from Montana, it is nothing unusual \nfor him; he is used to this kind of snow, I guess.\n  To our Chaplain, I say thank you for being here this morning with \nyour beautiful prayer, as always.\n  On our leadership team, I thank Senator Nickles, Senator Mack, \nSenator Craig, and Senator McConnell for being here today. We have \nalready had a leadership meeting. I thank Senator Reid for being here \non behalf of the Democrats.\n  I had several conversations early this morning with officials, the \npolice, and also with Senator Daschle, about how to deal with the \nweather. It is a massive snow and certainly there is a great deal of \ndanger in the amount that has come down. With the difficulty in the \nability to move around and with a lot of our staff and Senators living \nout in Virginia and Maryland, it made sense to join the rest of the \nFederal Government and be closed today. However, due to the Senate \nrules, we have to be here for a few minutes so that we can adjourn to \nreconvene tomorrow. We had already entered the order that we would be \nhere today at the assigned hour of 11:30 a.m., and so we had to be \nhere. But we will go on with business that we must do today, and then \neveryone will be able to go home safely before it gets even worse this \nafternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/25/senate-section/article/S47-8", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S47]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES PLACED ON CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I also ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in \nrecess on Wednesday from the hours of 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. so that \nthe weekly party conferences can meet.\n  Those conferences would have occurred, I believe, today--I know in \nour case; I think with the Democrats, too. But in view of the weather, \nwe will reschedule them for tomorrow, and thus the necessity of this \nrecess.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could through you to the majority \nleader indicate that certainly the right decision was made today. I \nthink we have become kind of spoiled back here in Washington; we have \nhad such mild winters. If we reflect back on the days of our service in \nthe House, which was not too long ago, I say to the majority leader, it \nseems to me we used to have bad weather and we had to make preparations \nfor snow days. I remember the Reagan inaugurations; those were bitter \ncold events about this time of year. So the right decision was made. I \nlook forward to working with the leader and the majority in moving \nlegislation along. We have made great progress on the bankruptcy bill, \nand I look forward to completing that in the near future.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say to the Senator, being from the Mississippi gulf \ncoast, I am not quite sure I know how to appreciate all this white \nstuff since we do not have it, but I think we made the right decision, \na safe decision, for our colleagues and for our staffs.\n  I thank the Senator for the work he has done on the bankruptcy bill. \nWithout the work of the Senator last year, we would not be in the \nposition of being able to finish the pending amendments and, hopefully, \nthe entire bill by tomorrow. I know the Senator is still working on it. \nWe did vitiate the cloture vote yesterday so that that will not occur, \nand we did lock in an agreement as to how to go forward, what \namendments would be considered and voted on, to complete its \nconsideration. I know the Senator has indicated he thinks we can do \nthat. So has Senator Daschle. And we will work with the Senators to try \nto make that occur.\n  I thank the Senator for his effort. I hope he will continue to do \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/25/senate-section/article/S48-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S48]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          1999 YEAR END REPORT\n\n  The mailing and filing date of the 1999 Year End Report required by \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act, as amended, is Monday, January 31, \n2000.
